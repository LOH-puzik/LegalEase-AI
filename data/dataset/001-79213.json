PERSON is an association of artists with its seat in the NORP building in GPE . The Secession , an independent gallery , is devoted entirely to exhibitions of contemporary article One of the basic objectives of the association is to present current developments in NORP and international art , and to cultivate an openness to experimentation .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant association held an exhibition on its LOC . The exhibition , entitled \u201c DATE of artistic freedom \u201d ( \u201c PERSON k\u00fcnstlerischer PERSON ) , was intended as part of the celebrations of the association 's CARDINALth anniversary . Among the works to be shown was a painting entitled \u201c Apocalypse \u201d , which had been produced for the occasion by the NORP painter PERSON . The painting , measuring QUANTITY by QUANTITY , showed a collage of various public figures , such as GPE , the NORP cardinal PERSON GPE and the former head of ORG ( ORG ) Mr PERSON PERSON , in sexual positions . While the naked bodies of these figures were painted , the heads and faces were depicted using blown - up photos taken from newspapers . The eyes of some of the persons portrayed were hidden under black bars . Among these persons was PERSON , a former general secretary of the ORG until DATE , who at the time of the events was a member of ORG ) , a mandate he held until DATE . Mr PERSON was shown gripping the ejaculating penis of PERSON PERSON while at the same time being touched by CARDINAL other ORG politicians and ejaculating on Mother LAW .", "CARDINAL . The exhibition , for which admission was charged , was open to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the exhibition was in progress , the NORP newspaper PERSON bristled at the above painting 's portayal of \u201c group sexual situations with ORG and GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the painting was damaged by a visitor , who covered with red paint the part which showed , among others , Mr Meischberger . As a consequence of this incident the entire painted body of PERSON and part of his face were covered with red paint .", "CARDINAL . NORP Several NORP newspapers reported on this event and also published pictures of the painting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Meischberger brought proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Urheberrechtsgesetz ) against the applicant association , seeking an injunction prohibiting it from exhibiting and publishing the painting . He further requested compensation in the amount of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG DATE ( ORG ) ) . He argued that the painting , showing him in sexual positions with several persons , debased him and his political activities and made statements as to his allegedly loose sexual life ( lotterhaftes PERSON ) . The black eye - bars did not prevent him from being recognised , because he was shown together with CARDINAL other ORG politicians . He remained recognisable even after the incident of CARDINAL June DATE , which had further increased the publicity given to the painting . Furthermore , there was a danger of recurrence as after the present exhibition the painting was due to be shown at another exhibition in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed PERSON action . It noted that it had initially been intended to show the exhibition in GPE , GPE and GPE as well ; now the intention was to close down the exhibition . The court further found that it could be ruled out that the painting had adversely affected the claimant or divulged information about his private life , as the painting , which resembled a comic strip ( \u201c comixartig \u201d ) , obviously did not represent reality . However , a painting showing the claimant in such an intimate position could , regardless of its relation to reality , still have a degrading and personally debasing effect . In the present case , however , the right of the applicant association to freedom of artistic expression outweighed Mr PERSON 's personal interests . When balancing the latter 's interests against the interests of the applicant association , the court had regard in particular to the fact that the exhibition was dedicated to the association 's artistic spectrum over DATE , which included the work of the NORP painter PERSON . It further noted that the painting showed numerous other persons , among them friends and benefactors of the painter , and also representatives of the ORG party , which had always strongly criticised Mr M\u00fchl 's work .", "CARDINAL . The painting in question could therefore be seen as a kind of counter - attack ( ORG ) . In any event , PERSON picture constituted only a rather small part of the painting and was therefore not striking . The court further added that there appeared to be no danger of recurrence ( PERSON ) as the painting had been partly covered by red paint and PERSON was therefore no longer recognisable on it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , after having held an oral hearing , granted an appeal on points of law and fact by PERSON , issued an injunction against the applicant association prohibiting it from continuing to display the painting at exhibitions , and ordered it to pay the costs incurred by Mr Meischberger in the proceedings and ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , plus PERCENT interest with effect from DATE , in compensation . It further allowed Mr Meischberger to publish extracts of its judgment in CARDINAL NORP newspapers . It noted that Mr PERSON 's picture was only partly covered by red paint , so that part of his face , the shape of his head and his hairstyle were still recognisable . The limits of artistic freedom were exceeded when the image of a person was substantially deformed by wholly imaginary elements without it being evident that the picture aimed at satire or any other form of exaggeration . The painting in the present case was not intended to be a parable or even an exaggerated criticism conveying a basic message , such as , for example , the statement that PERSON had disregarded sexual decency and morals . It therefore did not fall within the scope of LAW , but in fact constituted a debasement of Mr PERSON 's public standing ( Entw\u00fcrdigung \u00f6ffentlichen Ansehens ) . The applicant association could not justify the exhibition of the painting under the artistic freedom protected by LAW ) . There was , furthermore , nothing to indicate that the applicant association would abstain from exhibiting the painting in the future , so that there was a danger of recurrence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) rejected an appeal by the applicant association as it did not concern a legal question of considerable interest . It noted that ORG had not questioned the fact that the painting fell within the scope of protection provided by LAW but , weighing the guarantee of artistic freedom enshrined in that provision against Mr PERSON 's personal rights as protected by section CARDINAL of LAW , had considered that the latter prevailed over the former because a picture of Mr Meischberger had been used in a degrading and insulting manner . As to the question whether PERSON could still be recognised despite the painting being covered with red paint , ORG had not contradicted the documents contained in the court file and there was therefore no need for a rectification . It ordered the applicant association to pay the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . That decision was served on the applicant association 's counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly , nor in any way made accessible to the public , where injury would be caused to the legitimate interests of the portrayed persons or , in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication , those of a close relative . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Artistic freedom is guaranteed by DATE LAW Staatsgrundgesetz ) , which provides :", "\u201c There shall be freedom of artistic creation and of the publication and teaching of article \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
