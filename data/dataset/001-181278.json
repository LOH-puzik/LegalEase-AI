MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions);Violation of Article 13+P1-1-1 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property;Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Carlo Ranzoni", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of CARDINAL FAC , GPE , a twostorey tenement with a surface area of DATE . ( hereinafter \u201c the property \u201d ) . In DATE , and DATE , following the death of their father , mother and uncle respectively , the applicant and her CARDINAL brothers inherited an estate which included the property . By a deed of partition of CARDINAL DATE the property was assigned to the applicant and she became its sole owner .", "CARDINAL . The property was requisitioned in DATE by means of a requisition order . The premises were then allocated to ORG in GPE hereinafter \u201c the band club \u201d ) . The owners of the property never recognised the tenant or accepted any rent from the club . According to a judgment of DATE of ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction , the owners were entitled to do so because the tenement had not been leased as a dwelling , and thus greater risks were involved .", "CARDINAL . In DATE that followed rent was paid to the owners by the competent authority ( then ORG , DATE ORG ) . The DATE rent payable amounted to CARDINAL NORP Lira ( MTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) , less than ORG DATE . According to an architect \u2019s valuation from DATE submitted by the applicant , the rental value of the tenement at the time was ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) per month . The Government challenged this estimate , as the valuation had contained no explanation as to the basis for the calculations , or whether the property was considered residential or commercial , or vacant or occupied . They relied on a valuation in an architect \u2019s report concerning a property ( FAC ) requisitioned in DATE for the purposes of the band club \u2013 which stated that the rental value in DATE was ORG DATE , which meant ORG DATE . The Government did not refer to the different address , arguing as though the valuation referred to the property at issue in the present case .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE the band club carried out extensive structural alterations , without obtaining the consent of the owners or the relevant permits from the competent authorities . According to an architect \u2019s report , there had been a total change and the alteration effected had effaced what had once been the traditional layout of important buildings in old NORP towns . According to the applicant , this deprived her of the valuable quality and historical and architectural importance of the property , thus devaluing it . The Government argued that the applicant had not availed herself of any ordinary remedy in this regard and had thus failed to substantiate the loss in value . Moreover , in their view the property was in a good state of repair and the alterations had increased its value .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the band club also repeatedly breached the tenancy agreement which it had signed , by manufacturing fireworks on the LOC and conducting commercial activities ( such as running a bar and letting the LOC out as a wedding venue despite not having the requisite authorisation ) . The Government submitted that these were unsubstantiated allegations , which had not been proved before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE , in the light of constitutional proceedings ( see below ) , the band club started depositing the DATE rent in court .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and her brothers also owned a property ( CARDINAL ORG , GPE adjacent to the tenement above , which was requisitioned in DATE and also assigned to the band club .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the owners of the tenement instituted civil proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction against the ORG Secretary and the band club . They requested that the requisition order of CARDINAL DATE be declared null and void as being contrary to LAW , and sought to regain possession of the tenement . They also requested compensation for the damage allegedly sustained .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction rejected the ORG claim . The owners appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG declared the requisition order null and void and ordered that the appellants be given possession of the LOC within DATE . It held that the requisition for the purposes of assigning the property to the band club could not be considered to be in the public interest . It sent the case back to ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction for it to award the appellants compensation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected a request for a new trial submitted by the band club .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction found the ORG Secretary and the band club liable for the damage suffered by the owners in connection with the structural alterations to the property . This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction awarded the owners ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in damages , covering LAW for missing objects , ORG CARDINAL to rectify the structural changes made and LAW for the loss of use of the property for DATE . This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings in relation to the property requisitioned in DATE , asking the court to declare that , as a result of the requisition order and the continued occupation of the LOC , she had suffered a breach of her rights under LAW . She asked the court to award her compensation for the taking of possession of the property and for the violations suffered , and to order any other measure capable of preventing the continuation of the violation , including the release of the property .", "CARDINAL . The defendants , the Director of ORG , the Attorney General and the band club , argued that no such violations had occurred .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction upheld the applicant \u2019s claims . It considered that the requisition order had been issued for the property to be enjoyed by a private entity and therefore the measure had not been in the public interest . In this connection , it referred to a judgment of DATE by ORG concerning what it considered to be the same property ( see above ) . Moreover , the measure had not been proportionate . The rent had been derisory , causing the applicant to suffer a disproportionate and excessive burden . She had therefore suffered a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL . According to the court , the applicant had also suffered a violation of LAW , as only her property had been requisitioned for the use of the band club . In determining the amount of compensation , the court did not take into account the fact that the applicant or her ancestors had received rent , given that the amount was derisory . Bearing in mind the values established by the applicant \u2019s expert as to the rental value and sale value of the property , which was ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) ( pg.CARDINAL of the judgment ) , as well as the length of time the requisition was and remained in place , the court awarded the applicant ORG CARDINAL in compensation ( kumpens ) for the requisition of the LOC and the violations found , noting it was not awarding civil damages ( danni \u010bivili ) in this context . DATE of the amount was to be paid by ORG and DATE by the band club . It further ordered the band club to vacate the LOC within DATE of judgment and to return the LOC to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The band club appealed , arguing that it could not be held responsible for breaches of human rights and that , in any event , the measure had been in the public interest . It further contested the order to vacate the property . The Attorney General and the Director of ORG also appealed , in particular in relation to the findings of a lack of public interest , a violation of LAW and the redress awarded . The applicant crossappealed , arguing that the compensation awarded was too low and did not reflect the losses she had incurred over DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment in part . It reiterated the finding of a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW No . CARDINAL only in so far as the requisition had been disproportionate . It found , however , that it had been in the public interest \u2013 the court considered that jurisprudence had shifted since the time of the judgment of DATE of ORG on which the first - instance court had based its assessment . In the present case the requisition had served a social and cultural purpose for the generality of citizens and could not be said to have served solely private interests .", "CARDINAL . It further found that there had been no violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the redress , the Constitutional Court revoked the order for the club to vacate the LOC . Considering that the violation of LAW No . CARDINAL was a consequence of the lack of a fair balance between the interests of the landlord and those of the tenant , and given that the validity of the lease was not at issue in the present case , it did not seem appropriate for it to evict the tenant ; it sufficed that that unfair balance be redressed .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court confirmed the amount of compensation awarded by the first - instance court , including the way in which it had to be shared . It considered that the band club had benefited from the situation and had never attempted to fix it , despite the fact that it had not been recognised as a tenant . In relation to the amount of compensation , it considered that the disproportionality of the measure had not persisted since the start of the requisition in DATE , but had started to be so only after DATE . Furthermore , the applicant had received the rent paid by the department and had only instituted constitutional proceedings in DATE ( while never contesting the validity of the requisition ) , thus it was legitimate and in line with local case - law to reduce her compensation . It also held that the property had been taken in the public interest and therefore the compensation needed not reflect market values . It followed that the compensation had to be reduced , however , given that the property was not to be vacated , it was appropriate to retain the amount awarded by the firstinstance court . Lastly , the court held that the claim for damages for the depreciation of the property as a result of structural works did not fall within the ambit of a constitutional complaint , and it was thus not its place to award such damages .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered the applicant to pay the costs of the cross - appeal and CARDINAL the judicial costs of the proceedings before the CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
