He also confessed that he had been responsible for killing PERSON", "On DATE the applicant was placed under investigation on a charge of aggravated murder and banditry . In the meantime , CARDINAL other individuals suspected of belonging to the same gang were charged with burglary , robbery and murder . They thus became the applicant \u2019s co - defendants .", "During questioning in DATE , the applicant informed the prosecution service that all the confessions he had previously made were false , as they had been forced out of him by police officers from the anti - crime unit while he had been held in police custody . In the presence of his counsel , the applicant alleged that a specific police officer , whom he named , had threatened him and had offered him money and a reduction in his sentence in return for a confession ; this statement was recorded in TIME of the interview . In consequence , the applicant asked the prosecution service not to take into consideration the content of the preceding interviews and to acquit him .", "On DATE the prosecution service submitted a final bill of indictment ( aps\u016bdz\u012bbas raksts ) against the applicant and his co - defendants . The applicant was charged with aggravated murder and banditry ; the second charge included CARDINAL hold - ups . With particular regard to ORG murder , the prosecution service considered that the applicant \u2019s guilt was sufficiently proven by the co - existence of inferences arising from the following evidence :", "\u2013 the statements by the victim \u2019s adult daughter , who was questioned during the pre - trial investigation on CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL DATE and confirmed that she had seen her father \u2019s killer leaving the crime scene . On CARDINAL DATE she gave the following description of the criminal :", "\u201c ... A twenty to twenty - five- year old man , dark hair , wearing a dark cap and sunglasses covering his eyes , he was wearing gloves . I do not remember his clothes .

The applicant pleaded not guilty at the hearing , and repeated his allegation that the confessions had been forced from him by a police officer who promised money and a reduced sentence in exchange for an admission of guilt . After questioning the police officer named by the applicant and several of his colleagues and hierarchical superiors , the court found that that officer had questioned the applicant on CARDINAL occasion and that he was not part of the investigation team responsible for the case . As he had not been present at the crime - scene reconstruction on DATE , he could not therefore have guided the applicant \u2019s actions or helped him to falsify the results of that investigatory measure . Accordingly , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegations in this connection . At the hearing , ORG questioned the witnesses and examined all the other evidence submitted by the public prosecution service .", "On DATE a neurologist issued a medical certificate , prohibiting ORG to participate in court hearings and proceedings because of the state of her health .", "With regard to ORG killing in particular , the court summoned and questioned several witnesses , but not , however , the victim \u2019s daughter . Her statements , made during the preliminary investigation of the case , were submitted and read out at the trial on DATE , in accordance with LAW .", "In a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of aggravated murder and banditry ; with regard to ORG killing , the court established the applicant \u2019s guilt on the basis of the coexistence of inferences arising from the afore - mentioned evidence established by the prosecution service . Under LAW in force at the material time , the applicant was sentenced to death .", "The applicant himself and his legal counsel appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE to ORG . In their respective memorials , they reiterated the applicant \u2019s argument that the confessions had been forced from him by a police officer who had offered him a trade - off , and challenged the manner in which the evidence had been assessed by ORG .", "On DATE a NORP DATE newspaper published an interview with a forensic expert , a director of ORG . In a part of the interview he said the following :", "\u201c ... When leaving a gun next to a dead body , a killer \u201c gives \u201d it [ the gun ] to the police . And all ends break \u2013 where is the gun from , who is the owner of the gun \u2013 go and find it . But if a killer takes ORG [ a type of gun ] with himself \u2013 one can find it in a search . If one will try so sell a gun to someone else \u2013 then the gun will move from hand to hand and will appear in the police together with its present owner , but it is not the link to the real killer . ... \u201d", "These statements were followed by the illustration of the CARDINAL examples :", "\u201c ... The well - known murder of the Vice - President of \u201c Interpegro \u201d M [ ... ] G [ ... ] was detected exactly because the guns used in committing the murder M [ ... ] G [ ... ] were found in searching the persons arrested in the course of a completely different case . The killers of V [ ... ] L [ ... ] did it more professionally . All around , including GPE , requests were sent out about bullets used in the murder . No tracks ... \u201d", "The applicant submitted this article to ORG , without requesting to summon the expert for examination .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s arguments . After re - examining all the evidence available to it , the ORG confirmed the validity of ORG findings . Furthermore , like the first - instance court , the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request that ORG daughter be summoned and questioned in court . The ORG dismissed the allegation that the confessions had been obtained through extortion ; having watched the video recording of the scene - of - crime reconstruction , which took place on DATE , it found that the applicant \u2019s actions in demonstrating what had happened were authentic and very precise and that any attempt to manipulate or rig the event would have been impossible . However , the ORG quashed the applicant \u2019s conviction on the charge of banditry ; this charge was reclassified as armed robbery with violence . Equally , the ORG noted that as LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW had entered into force with regard to GPE on DATE , the death penalty could no longer be implemented . Accordingly , the ORG commuted the death sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , unsuspended .", "As the applicant \u2019s defence counsel had chosen not to represent the applicant in subsequent proceedings , the latter drew up an appeal on points of law himself and submitted it to the ORG of ORG . In his memorial , the applicant complained primarily of errors in assessment of the facts which he alleged had been made by the lower courts . He also submitted that the presiding judge in ORG had interrupted him several times during his statement , that the appeal judges had refused to grant all of his procedural requests and that the rights of the defence had been seriously infringed . Equally , the applicant complained about the ORG \u2019s refusal to summon and question in court the forensic expert who had informed the press that he was in possession of the murder weapon , and also ORG daughter . The applicant stressed that cross - examination of this second witness would have enabled the defence to focus on the visual difference between the portraits of the criminal and of the applicant , and thus to show that the killer had been someone else .", "By an order of DATE , served on the applicant on DATE , the ORG declared inadmissible the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as lacking legal grounds . According to the order , ORG and ORG had carried out a full and very detailed examination of all the evidence available to them . Equally , the decisions by the trial and appeal courts had been fully reasoned in terms of fact and law . As to the establishment of the factual circumstances in the case , the ORG pointed out that that question did not fall within the jurisdiction of ORG , which dealt with appeals on points of law . Finally , the ORG considered the applicant \u2019s various allegations of procedural violations to be unfounded .", "According to LAW , a transcript report of the court proceedings includes , inter alia , the information about case - related applications and petitions .", "The relevant part of LAW provides that within DATE after signing a transcript report of the court proceedings , the defence counsel and accused may submit remarks there on its accuracy . The remarks shall be considered and accordingly added to the transcript report .", "In accordance with LAW , the parties enjoy rights in terms of summoning and questioning witnesses during the trial .", "The defence is entitled to cross - examine the victims and witnesses on the same conditions as the prosecution service ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . If CARDINAL of the parties requests that a new witness be summoned or any new evidence be submitted to the court , it must explain to the court the reasons for such a request and , in particular , what it intends to prove through this new evidence . Dismissal of such a request does not prevent the party from resubmitting it during the examination of the case ( LAW and CARDINAL ) .", "Where a witness or a victim submits good reasons for failure to attend the trial , the statements made by them during the preliminary investigation of the case are read out to the court ( LAW ) .", "The defendant may also be cross - examined by his or her co - defendants and their lawyers ( LAW ) .", "Article CARDINAL states that examination of a judgment by the cassation court is permissible only if it is based on a violation of the criminal law or substantial violation of the Criminal Procedure law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
