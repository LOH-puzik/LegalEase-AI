It is not known when the letter was sent or when the applicant received it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG attached SEK CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) from a bank account belonging to the applicant . A document called LAW ( bevis om utm\u00e4tning ) was sent to the applicant confirming this and advising him how to go about appealing against the decision and that this had to be done within DATE from the date that the decision was served on him . The applicant , who was on holiday at the time , did not receive ORG until he returned home on DATE and was formally served the decision .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG distributed and paid the attached money to the creditor , in this case , the ORG itself . The decision was open to appeal within DATE from the date of the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to rectify ( besluta om r\u00e4ttelse ) the decision concerning attachment as he considered it to be incorrect . ORG , in a decision of DATE , rejected the applicant \u2019s request for rectification on the ground that it had been submitted too late . It further stated that it was not possible to appeal against the decision in that part and that , as regarded its other decisions , appeals were possible within the time - frames of which the applicant had previously been notified .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant appealed against the attachment decision to ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE .

On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal after first having noted that the decision as regarded the payment of the attached funds had gained legal force on DATE and that the applicant had appealed against the attachment decision on DATE . Thereafter the court , with reference to case - law from ORG , stated that an appeal against an attachment decision that was lodged after a decision regarding the payment of the attached funds had gained legal force could not be considered by the court .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) requesting that it quash the lower court \u2019s decision . The applicant submitted that he had not been aware of the attachment decision until DATE , when he was formally served the Proof of Attachment , and that he had never been notified of the fact that ORG , DATE after the attachment decision , had distributed and paid the attached money .

Domestic provisions of relevance to the present case are found mainly in LAW ( ORG ; CARDINAL ) and GPE ( ORG ; PERSON ) . ORG is responsible for enforcement of judgments or other enforcement titles ( exekutionstitel ) comprising an obligation to pay or some other obligation . Enforcement cases are dealt with as public cases ( allm\u00e4nna m\u00e5l ) , as in the applicant \u2019s case , or private cases ( enskilda m\u00e5l ; cf . LAW , LAW ) . Public cases are , for example , imposition of fines , taxes , and other funds to which the ORG is entitled .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , an enforcement title may consist of a court judgment , but also of a decision of an administrative authority that may be enforced in accordance with a special regulation . Moreover , according to LAW , enforcement titles in public cases may be enforced before they have gained legal force , if this has been specially prescribed . In this respect , LAW , LAW stipulates that a decision of ORG applies immediately , and the enforcement continues even if the decision is appealed against , unless otherwise prescribed by LAW or ordered by a court .", "CARDINAL . NORP In line with LAW , LAW , ORG shall investigate the debtor \u2019s employment and income situation and whether he or she has attachable property . Attachment shall take place as soon as possible after the necessary documents have been received by ORG , Article CARDINAL ) . With some exceptions , notification shall be sent to the debtor by post or given in an appropriate manner within such time that the debtor can be expected to have sufficient time to protect his or her rights ( LAW , Article CARDINAL ) . Chapter CARDINAL , Article CARDINAL of the Enforcement Ordinance stipulates that the debtor shall be notified in writing and the notification is to be served , unless it is known that the debtor can not be found . Moreover , ORG shall , as a rule , notify the interested parties about its decision of distribution of funds ( LAW , LAW ) . The debtor is generally not notified about distribution of funds and payment to the creditors and the enclosure to the attachment order does not contain any such information .", "CARDINAL .

Decisions regarding attachment and all subsequent decisions , such as the decision to distribute and pay the attached funds to the creditor , are taken by ORG and may be appealed against to ORG , and further to ORG and ORG .

DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , of that LAW stipulates that an attachment decision of the type in question shall be appealed against by a party within DATE from the date when the decision was served on him . DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , states that a decision on distribution or payment of funds shall be appealed against within DATE of the decision . LAW stipulates that , in the event of the grant of an appeal against a particular decision , a later decision in the case may also be revoked , if this can be done , provided the decision is connected with the former decision and that it had not gained legal force against the appellant at the time when he appealed against the first decision .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , ORG found that a prerequisite to trying an appeal against a decision regarding attachment is that no subsequent decision regarding the payment of the attached funds has gained legal force . In reaching its decision , ORG had regard to LAW , LAW as well as the preparatory works to that provision ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its comments on the above case , ORG ( PERSON , formerly in charge of tax administration and enforcement service in GPE ) , stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c In public cases , the funds are accounted for immediately , unless the official in charge of the matter has given special instructions . In cases concerning attachment of bank funds , it may take a while for the bank to account for the funds received . Once received by ORG , the funds are accounted for promptly to the creditors . DATE may elapse DATE and the accounting day . The appeals provisions in LAW , LAW do not seem to be coordinated in the sense that the funds are to be accounted for after the appeal period has elapsed , and there is no support for such an interpretation of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
