The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant left GPE with his family for the GPE in DATE when he was DATE . After claiming asylum , it would appear that the family were given a period of leave to remain in the GPE . During this period the applicant married and had a son , born in DATE . The applicant \u2019s family travelled to GPE in DATE . The applicant initially remained in the GPE but on DATE he arrived in GPE , where he claimed asylum . In doing so , he provided the immigration authorities with a false name and a false immigration history in order to avoid being sent back to the GPE . Although the asylum application was unsuccessful the applicant was granted exceptional leave to remain until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant received CARDINAL criminal convictions over the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . In DATE he was convicted of a public order offence and of failing to surrender . He was sentenced to CARDINAL half months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with notice that the Secretary of ORG intended to make a deportation order against him . The same letter refused an application for indefinite leave to remain in GPE . The applicant lodged an appeal against the decision to deport him on DATE . That appeal was dismissed on DATE and his appeal rights were exhausted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the applicant had served CARDINAL of his final custodial sentence and was eligible for release from prison , he was detained under paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL to the Immigration Act DATE pending the making of a deportation order against him . The Secretary of ORG signed the deportation order on DATE and he was thereafter detained under paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL to the Immigration Act DATE pending his removal from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE removal directions were set for CARDINAL DATE . However , they were cancelled on DATE when the applicant made an application to this ORG ( application no . CARDINAL ) , which granted an interim measure under Rule CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was reviewed DATE and the review forms set out the reasons for maintaining detention . The form from DATE includes the following statement in reference to the Rule CARDINAL measure : \u201c Whilst this means that enforced removal is not possible , [ the applicant ] could reduce the length of time he spends in detention by withdrawing voluntarily \u201d . A similar point features in some , if not all , of the later forms . The form for DATE notes that \u201c Rule CARDINAL ORG is a barrier to removal but I note that FRS [ Facilitated Return Scheme ] is an option that should be explored to the full to expedite his removal from the GPE \u201d . Likewise , the form for DATE states that \u201c [ t]he length of detention is a direct result of his appeals against deportation and , although it is now DATE , he has the real option of return to GPE with ORG . This option should be further explained to the subject \u201d . Furthermore , the form from DATE indicated that the applicant \u201c could minimise his time in detention by withdrawing [ the application to the ORG ] and taking up ORG which is offered DATE \u201d and that he could \u201c end his detention by volunteering to return ( with or without FRS ) at any time \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Applications for bail were refused on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE as ORG were not satisfied that the applicant would answer to any conditions set . On DATE the Immigration Judge further noted that although the applicant had been in detention for a lengthy period , \u201c the most recent period of detention is on account of delays with his own application to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant made further representations against removal on DATE . Those representations were treated as an application for revocation of the deportation order , but on CARDINAL DATE the Secretary of ORG refused to revoke the order . However , following an appeal by the applicant , the Secretary of ORG withdrew the refusal decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a claim for judicial review , contending that his ongoing detention was unlawful . Permission was granted on DATE but a further application for bail was refused . On DATE , DATE after the ORG ruled in NORP and ORG v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE ) , the applicant was granted bail .", "CARDINAL . A hearing took place on DATE . Pursuant to the principles set down by ORG in NORP v. FAC Governor ex parte ORG PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ( see section on domestic law below ) , the Secretary of ORG can not lawfully detain a person pending removal for longer than a reasonable period and , if it becomes apparent that the deportation can not be effected within a reasonable period , the detention will become unlawful even if the reasonable period has not yet expired . The applicant claimed that his detention was in breach of the principles ( a ) on or after DATE when the ORG granted an interim measure under Rule CARDINAL of ORG ; ( b ) on or immediately after DATE when he applied to revoke the deportation order ; or ( c ) at all points after the revocation refusal on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE ORG dismissed the claim . It noted that in deciding whether or not there was a realistic prospect that deportation would take place within a reasonable time , the risk of absconding or re - offending were \u201c of paramount importance \u201d but neither risk could be regarded as a \u201c trump card \u201d . Moreover , the fact that the period of detention occurred while the applicant was pursuing an appeal or comparable judicial process would also be a highly relevant factor , especially if there was a risk of absconding or reoffending .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the applicant in the present case had CARDINAL convictions for absconding and ORG had consistently concluded that he was a significant abscond risk . It agreed with ORG and also concluded that the risk was plainly substantial on the evidence available . Equally , the court took into account the fact that the applicant had family in the country at the times he absconded and therefore , contrary to his assertions , their presence did not remove the risk of absconding . Likewise , the Secretary of ORG \u2019s detention reviews had characterised the risk of the applicant reoffending as \u201c high \u201d . The court further noted that the applicant \u2019s offences became less serious and more intermittent as time went on . However , the fact remained that while he was free he was committing offences of such seriousness as to require him to be imprisoned , including robbery and public order offences . The court also considered whether alternatives to detention could be used such as electronic tagging , monitoring by telephone and regular reporting . However , given the applicant \u2019s history of absconding , it concluded that the alternatives would not have been sufficient and there was an absence of adequate assurances from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At the time ORG noted that the interim measure under LAW , was awaiting a lead judgment on returns to GPE ( NORP and ORG , cited above ) and it was clear that there would be no resolution of the applicant \u2019s claim - and the interim measure would therefore not be lifted - before that judgment was handed down . However , ORG observed that at the time the interim measure was indicated , there was uncertainty about when that judgment could be expected . Moreover , while the applicants in NORP and ORG would have had a reasonable to good prospect of success , a positive outcome had not been inevitable . Consequently , ORG did not accept that there was not , at the time the interim measure was indicated , a realistic prospect of removing the applicant within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court did not accept that by the time of the applicant \u2019s application for a revocation order , a reasonable period had already expired or that there was no realistic prospect of deportation within a reasonable time . In addition , it observed that the Secretary of ORG had been entitled to take DATE to consider the applicant \u2019s personal situation in light of the judgment in NORP and ORG . It therefore did not consider his continued detention up to DATE to be unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted permission to appeal to ORG . On appeal , he restated his arguments concerning the ORG PERSON principles which had been advanced in the court below . In addition , he submitted that the detention was vitiated by CARDINAL public law errors that bore directly on the decision to detain : first , following the indication of the interim measure the Secretary of ORG had failed to take any reasonable steps to acquaint herself with when it might be lifted ; and secondly , that the detention was maintained on the unlawful basis that the applicant could reduce the length of time in detention by withdrawing his application to the ORG and returning voluntarily to GPE . Finally , the applicant argued that his detention was in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE , tthe applicant \u2019s appeal against deportation as well as CARDINAL separate bail applications had been rejected by immigration judges , as well as the broader context in relation to the on - going litigation concerning removals to GPE both before the domestic courts and tribunals as well as before ORG ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . It took into consideration the fact that the Rule CARDINAL measure applied in the applicant \u2019s case did not involve any specific assessment of risk towards him by this ORG , since at the material time this ORG had adopted a fact - insensitive approach towards Rule CARDINAL measures in respect of removals to GPE , and noted the consequence that from DATE this ORG had adjourned CARDINAL applications concerning removal to GPE . It also took account of correspondence between the ORG and the registry of this ORG from which it was clear that from DATE the ORG would be granting a fact - insensitive Rule CARDINAL measure to any applicant with removal directions to GPE as well as the separate correspondence between the Government and this Court concerning the progress of NORP and ORG , cited above and the linked domestic case law .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the ORG PERSON ground , ORG stated that there could be a realistic prospect of success without it being possible to specify or predict the date by which , or the period in which , removal can reasonably be expected to occur . It accepted that at the time of receipt of the Rule CARDINAL measure in the applicant \u2019s case , although it was not possible to say when the proceedings before the ORG would be concluded , there was nonetheless a reasonable prospect of their being concluded and of removal being effected within a reasonable time . Likewise , ORG saw no reason to differ from the overall conclusion of the lower court on the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention at the time of the application for revocation of the deportation order or after the judgment in NORP and ORG was handed down . Lord Justice PERSON dissented on CARDINAL point only : acknowledging that \u201c there is no one right answer to the question what is a reasonable period \u201d , he believed that the period of DATE which elapsed following the judgment in NORP and ORG before the applicant was released from detention was not reasonable in all the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the second ground of appeal , the court accepted that if the applicant were able to show that the decisions to maintain his detention were vitiated by public law he would succeed in establishing that the detention was unlawful and would have a claim of false imprisonment . However , ORG found that although some of the passages in the review forms were not very happily expressed , they did not involve any legal error . Moreover , as the same conclusion was reached regardless of whether or not reference was made to the question of voluntary return , it appeared that the applicant \u2019s refusal of this offer played no material part in the assessment of whether detention should be maintained .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court found that LAW ) of the ORG added nothing of substance in the present case . In reaching this conclusion , it rejected the applicant \u2019s assertion that GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE was authority for the proposition that the lack of a realistic prospect of deportation within a defined period rendered detention under LAW ) unlawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["34", "5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"]}
