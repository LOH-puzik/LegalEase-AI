The first applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE . He is serving a term of imprisonment in the PERSON prison . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE and is serving a sentence of imprisonment in the PERSON prison . They were represented before the ORG by Mr J. Smetana , a lawyer practising in PERSON . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a police investigator accused the applicants , together with CARDINAL other people , of founding and supporting an organised criminal group and of fraud . The accused were suspected of having organised a large - scale financial transaction scheme which resulted in a value - added tax fraud of MONEY . CARDINAL other people were accused of fraud in the same context .", "The applicants were arrested on DATE . On DATE a judge of ORG remanded them in custody with effect from DATE . The judge considered that there was a risk of the applicants ' absconding , hampering the investigation into the case and committing further offences within the meaning of LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the DATE Code \u201d ) .", "The applicants were subsequently accused of murder and several other offences .", "On DATE a public prosecutor indicted the applicants , together with CARDINAL other people , for a number of criminal offences before ORG . The offences alleged included fraud , membership of an organised criminal group , murder and robbery .", "On DATE the case was transmitted to ORG in Pezinok . That court severed several charges against the applicants in order to conduct separate proceedings . The remaining part of the case was returned to the public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL to DATE ORG held the main hearing in the case . It decided to sever several more charges against the applicants and their co - accused into separate proceedings . The remaining part of the case was adjourned with a view to taking further evidence .", "On DATE ORG extended the applicants ' detention until DATE . It accepted ORG view that the case was complex and that it was necessary to obtain further evidence . The evidence available justified the suspicion that the applicants were involved in the killing of several people whose bodies had been subsequently dissolved in sulphuric acid . The risk of the applicants ' absconding , influencing witnesses and committing further offences persisted . It could be seen that the case was complex as the file comprised CARDINAL folders at that time , and the first - instance court had displayed due diligence when dealing with the case .", "Hearings before ORG were held on DATE , DATE and DATE . The accused and a number of witnesses and experts were heard and documentary evidence was taken .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants '' detention still existed within the meaning of LAW ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of LAW . In particular , the accused had been away from their place of residence prior to their arrest , several witnesses had made statements against them and , in view of the actions imputed to them , there was a real risk that they would commit offences in the event of their release .", "The decision stated that DATE Code continued to apply to the applicants ' case and , accordingly , the maximum permissible duration of their detention was DATE . Following the entry into force of the Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE ( \u201c the DATE Code \u201d ) on DATE , their detention during trial could not exceed DATE from DATE , as in the case of people detained under the provisions of the DATE Code .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' complaint against the above - mentioned decision , as it concurred with ORG reasoning .", "ORG held that people in the position of the applicants , who had been indicted prior to the entry into force of DATE , were not entitled to have the duration of their detention as a whole or the duration of their detention during trial governed by LAW . LAW clearly indicated that that had not been the intention of the legislature . The situation did not amount to unequal treatment , as the applicants had been remanded in custody under a different legal regime , namely that governed by LAW . However , both categories of detained persons DATE those whose detention was governed by LAW and those detained under LAW \u2013 should receive equal treatment as regards the duration of their detention during trial after the entry into force of the DATE Code . In that respect , the applicants were treated equally to the other category of detainees . Thus the detention during trial of accused persons who had been remanded and indicted prior to DATE for offences which LAW of DATE qualified as extremely serious crimes was permissible for a maximum duration of DATE as from DATE .", "As to the applicants ' reliance on LAW , ORG held that the legislator was free to choose whether the periods of maximum detention under DATE Code would apply to proceedings which had arisen under the law previously in force . The only situations where the legislator had allowed detained persons to benefit from the newly introduced shorter maximum periods of detention were the cases mentioned in LAW , where criminal proceedings were at the pre - trial stage .", "ORG concluded that the applicants , who had been indicted prior to DATE , could in principle be detained until DATE when the maximum permissible detention period of DATE would expire .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants complained separately to ORG that their detention had exceeded the maximum permissible period of DATE . They relied on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL in conjunction with Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code and on LAW \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "On DATE the Special Court convicted the applicants of murder . It sentenced the second applicant to DATE and the first applicant to DATE imprisonment . The applicants appealed .", "On DATE ORG rejected the first applicant 's complaint as being manifestly ill - founded . In particular , it held that ORG interpretation and application , in its above decision of CARDINAL DATE , of the relevant provisions of the CARDINAL ORG were in conformity with the LAW and the LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant 's complaint for similar reasons . It held , with reference to LAW , DATE and CARDINAL of the DATE Code , that the date of filing of the indictment was decisive in the determination of whether LAW or DATE Code would govern a criminal case including periods of detention . It therefore considered erroneous the interpretation which ORG had given to the relevant provisions in its decisions CARDINAL Ntv CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL Ntv CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE and on which the second applicant had relied . The fact that in the second applicant 's case ORG had decided differently from those CARDINAL decisions did not run contrary to the principle of legal certainty . In particular , those CARDINAL decisions had been given in DATE , immediately after the entry into force of the DATE Code . A difference in the interpretation of newly adopted legislation could not be avoided during a period preceding the elaboration of established practice on the issue .", "On DATE ORG extended the applicants ' detention until DATE . As to the lawfulness of their detention , reference was made to the above ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE on the complaint of the first applicant .", "Under LAW , detention during criminal proceedings was governed by the provisions of Articles CARDINAL et seq . A person charged with a criminal offence could be detained , inter alia , where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would abscond ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) ) , influence the witnesses or the co - accused or otherwise hamper the investigation ( LAW ( b ) ) , or continue criminal activities , complete an attempted offence or commit an offence which he or she had been prepared or had threatened to commit ( LAW ( c ) ) .", "The duration of detention was regulated by the provisions of Articles CARDINAL et seq . Detention in the pretrial phase of the proceedings and during the trial , taken together , could not exceed DATE . An extension could be authorised by ORG if it had been impossible to complete the proceedings earlier because of the complexity of the matter or for other important reasons and the release of the detainee would jeopardise the purpose of the proceedings . The total duration of the detention could not , however , exceed DATE or , in the case of offences qualified as extremely dangerous , DATE ( Article MONEY \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted on DATE and its text was published in LAW . It entered into force on DATE . The duration of detention is regulated by ORG CARDINAL et seq .", "The total duration of detention in the pre - trial phase of the proceedings and during the trial , taken together , can not exceed DATE where the case concerns a lesser crime ( pre\u010din ) , DATE in the case of a crime ( zlo\u010din ) , and DATE in the case of an extremely serious crime ( obzvl\u00e1\u0161\u0165 z\u00e1va\u017en\u00fd zlo\u010din ) ( LAW ) . Detention in the pretrial phase of the proceedings and during the trial , taken separately , can last up to CARDINAL of the above periods ( LAW ) . As regards detention during trial , the period is to be counted from the moment when the indictment is filed ( LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . If the detainee faces multiple charges , the offence carrying the most severe potential penalty should be used as the basis for determining the maximum permissible duration of the detention ( LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL) .", "The temporal application of DATE Code is governed by the provisions of Articles CARDINAL et seq . As a general rule , proceedings where the indictment was filed prior to the entry into force of the DATE Code should continue under LAW ( LAW ) . This extends to proceedings in which the duration of and grounds for detention are examined including proceedings on a proposal for one 's detention to be extended by ORG ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL provides that , in cases where a person 's pre - trial detention started prior to the entry into force of the DATE Code , the time - limits within which a decision is required on the extension of such detention at the pre - trial stage of the criminal proceedings start running at the date of entry into force of DATE . Paragraph CARDINAL does not affect the provisions governing the permissible duration of detention , with the exception of cases , where , prior to the entry into force of LAW , a final decision had been given to extend a person 's detention for a period exceeding the periods mentioned in LAW . In such cases , a person 's detention is to end DATE after the entry into force of the DATE Code at the latest .", "The provisions on the temporal application of the newly introduced DATE Code initially gave rise to differing interpretations by the benches of ORG . Thus , contrary to the above - mentioned decision on the applicants ' case of DATE , ORG also found that the maximum duration of detention of a person who had been indicted prior to DATE should be governed by the newly enacted DATE Code . ORG stated that any other interpretation of the relevant provisions would run contrary to the constitutional principle of equality of persons before the law ( ORG decision CARDINAL Ntv CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) . A similar view was expressed in ORG decision CARDINAL Ntv CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE .", "The criminal law section ( kol\u00e9gium ) of ORG therefore adopted a practice direction indicating how LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code should be interpreted ( no . GPE CARDINAL/CARDINAL , practice direction adopted on DATE and subsequently published in the Collection of practice directions of ORG and decisions of courts , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "With reference to relevant provisions of the LAW , the criminal law section of ORG held that detained persons who had been indicted prior to the entry into force of the DATE Code were not entitled to have the duration of their detention as a whole or the duration of their detention during trial governed by LAW and CARDINAL of the DATE Code . LAW clearly indicated that that had not been the intention of the legislature . The situation did not amount to unequal treatment as the individuals concerned had been remanded in detention under a different legal regime , namely that governed by LAW .", "However , ORG also held that both categories of detained persons DATE those whose detention was governed by LAW and those detained under LAW \u2013 should receive equal treatment as regards the duration of their detention during trial after the entry into force of the DATE Code . In practical terms , the detention during trial of individuals falling within the former category in the period after DATE should not last longer than CARDINAL , CARDINAL or DATE , depending on the nature of the offence in issue , as specified in LAW . In that respect , those individuals were treated equally to the other category of detainees . For example , the detention during trial of accused persons who had been remanded and indicted , prior to DATE , for offences which the DATE LAW qualified as extremely serious crimes , could not exceed DATE from DATE . Detention of such persons after DATE was therefore not permissible ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
