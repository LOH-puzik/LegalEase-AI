{"ITEMID": "001-61799", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF L. v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Not necessary to examine Art. 14+8;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He had a relationship with PERSON from DATE . On DATE a daughter , named PERSON , was born to PERSON and the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW ) , as then in force , PERSON obtained guardianship ( voogdij ) of A. The applicant was appointed as ORG \u2019s auxiliary guardian ( toeziend voogd ) on DATE by ORG judge ( kantonrechter ) . The applicant \u2019s auxiliary guardianship ended on DATE , when an amendment to LAW came into force abolishing that function .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON did not formally cohabit , but the applicant visited her and PERSON on a regular basis . He also babysat and took care of A. on several occasions . PERSON sometimes consulted the applicant about A. \u2019s hearing problems . The applicant did not formally recognise ( erkenning ) A. , as PERSON refused to give her permission and her family also opposed such recognition . Although the applicant could have sought judicial consent for recognising PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he did not avail himself of this possibility , considering that it would stand little chance of success . Moreover , the applicant preferred to respect the position adopted by PERSON and her relatives , and maintain the de facto family ties he had with his daughter rather than establish formal legal ties with her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s relationship with PERSON broke down . On DATE the applicant requested ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) to grant him access ( omgangsregeling ) to A. DATE every fortnight and DATE during DATE . In those proceedings PERSON argued primarily that the applicant \u2019s request should be declared inadmissible in that there had never been any family life within the meaning of LAW between the applicant and PERSON and , in so far as family life had existed , it had ceased to exist after the end of her relationship with the applicant . In the alternative , PERSON argued that to grant the applicant access would not be in DATE \u2019s interests . PERSON further submitted that the applicant had behaved badly towards her ( violence and financial abuse ) and had shown little interest in A. She indicated , lastly , that A. \u2019s hearing was impaired and that her daughter thus required a special approach of which she deemed the applicant incapable .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG accepted that there was family life within the meaning of LAW between the applicant and PERSON , and that this family life had not ceased to exist since the breakdown of the applicant \u2019s relationship with PERSON It consequently declared the applicant \u2019s request admissible . However , given the difficulties between the applicant and PERSON , ORG decided to order ORG ( PERSON ) to conduct an investigation and to report to it on the feasibility of an access arrangement .", "CARDINAL . PERSON filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( gerechtshof ) . By a decision of DATE , ORG quashed the decision of DATE and declared the applicant \u2019s request inadmissible . In its decision , ORG stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL Out of the parties\u2019 relationship ( lasting from DATE to August CARDINAL ) , PERSON was born . PERSON is the biological father of A. He has not recognised the child . The mother holds parental authority over A. by law .", "...", "CARDINAL NORP In addition to what is stated under CARDINAL , the following , as contended by CARDINAL side , and not , or insufficiently , disputed by the other , has been established or become plausible .", "The father was present at A. \u2019s birth . He has never been formally registered at the mother \u2019s address , but ( up to DATE ) regularly visited the mother . He has also changed A. \u2019s nappy a few times [ enkele malen ] and has babysat her once or twice [ een QUANTITY keer ] , but not since DATE . Further , the mother has on several occasions [ verschillende keren ] had contact by telephone with the father about ( the hearing problems of ) A.", "CARDINAL In the light of the above facts and circumstances , it has been insufficiently established that the father has a close personal relationship with the child \u2013 who at the time of the breakdown of the parties\u2019 relationship was DATE or that there is a link between him and the child that can be regarded as \u2018 family life\u2019 within the meaning of LAW . The further circumstances relied on by the father , from which it would appear that he has a close personal relationship with the child , have \u2013 in contrast to the substantiated denial thereof by the mother \u2013 not been established . The terminology used by the mother in the proceedings ( she spoke about \u2018 a relationship until DATE and \u2018 my ex - partner\u2019 ) can not , either in itself or in connection with the above circumstances , lead to a different conclusion .", "...", "CARDINAL On the basis of the above considerations , the impugned decision is quashed , and the father \u2019s request is declared inadmissible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal on points of law was dismissed by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . ORG rejected the argument that the mere biological link between the applicant and PERSON was sufficient to attract the protection of LAW . It held that \u201c family life \u201d for the purposes of LAW implied the existence of further personal ties in addition to biological paternity . As to the lack of existence of such further personal ties , it accepted the findings of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A child born out of wedlock had the status of the natural child of its mother . It became the natural child of its father after being recognised by DATE the \u201c father \u201d , for the purposes of this provision , being the man who recognised the child , whether he was the biological father or not ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A child born out of wedlock automatically had legally recognised family ties ( familierechtelijke betrekkingen ) with its mother and her relatives . ORG by the father entailed the creation of a legally recognised family tie between him and the child , as well as between the child and the father \u2019s relatives ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) . At the relevant time the surname of such a child was the surname of its father if the latter had recognised the child , and the mother \u2019s surname if not ( LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Recognition of a child could be effected on the birth certificate itself or by a separate deed of recognition drawn up for that purpose by ORG , Deaths and Marriages or a notary public ( LAW ) . A deed of recognition drawn up by the registrar was entered in the register of births ( LAW ) . At the request of an interested party , the regional court could order that a deed be entered in the appropriate registers ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Recognition without the mother \u2019s prior written consent was void ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( d ) of LAW ) . However , in view of the right of the father and the child to respect for their \u201c family life \u201d , as guaranteed by LAW , ORG construed this provision in such a way that the mother \u2019s effective right of veto could be overridden , if she abused it , by alternative judicial consent . However , such judicial consent could only be sought by a biological father whose relationship with his child was such that it should be considered to amount to \u201c family life \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( see PERSON , DATE , PERSON ( GPE Law Reports \u2013 ( GPE ) ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . In a situation where the mother was raising the child alone , judicial consent would only be given if the mother had no interest warranting protection in refusing to give her permission ( see PERSON , DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL , and PERSON , DATE , NJ DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW came into force . It still provides that , for a man to recognise a child who is not yet DATE as his , the prior written consent of the mother is required ( LAW ) ) . If the mother has not given her consent , it may be replaced by the consent of the regional court ( LAW ) . However , the man who seeks alternative judicial consent must be the child \u2019s biological father ; in addition , recognition must not be detrimental to the mother \u2019s relationship with the child or to the child \u2019s own interests ( ibid . ) . Furthermore , the child \u2019s written permission is required if he or she has reached DATE ( LAW ( d ) ) .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG case - law under LAW , the procedure for obtaining judicial consent must entail a judicial balancing exercise between the interests of the persons concerned , the point of departure being that both the child and its biological father should in principle be entitled to have their relationship acknowledged in law as a legally recognised family relationship ( familierechtelijke betrekking ) . However , the judge must balance the father \u2019s interests in obtaining recognition against any conflicting interests of the mother or the child or both . The mother \u2019s interest is defined in LAW as having an undisturbed relationship with the child ( see PERSON , DATE , PERSON ( Weekly Law Reports ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE , LAW was introduced into LAW , pursuant to which a child may request the regional court to issue a judicial declaration of paternity ( gerechtelijke vaststelling van vaderschap ) in order to have a legal tie established between him or her and the biological father . No time - limit applies for lodging such a request .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , parents DATE namely , the persons who have become a legal parent of a child either ipso jure , or through recognition , a judicial declaration of paternity , or adoption \u2013 are obliged to provide for the maintenance of their minor children . The absence of recognition of a child does not absolve the biological father of his maintenance obligations towards this child . Pursuant to LAW , the biological father of an unrecognised child remains liable to pay maintenance until the child has come of age . Until DATE , when this provision was amended as a consequence of the introduction of the possibility of seeking a judicial declaration of paternity , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provided that the supposed biological father of an illegitimate , unrecognised child was the man who had had intercourse with the mother between the GPE and DATE before the birth of the child .", "CARDINAL . Access rights are regulated by ORG CARDINAL - h of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The child and the parent who does not have custody are entitled to have access to each other [ omgang met CARDINAL ] .", "CARDINAL . The judge shall , at the request of the parents or of CARDINAL of them , establish an arrangement , for a definite or indefinite period , for the exercise of the right of access or shall deny , for a definite or indefinite period , the right of access .", "CARDINAL . The judge shall only deny the right of access if :", "( a ) access would seriously impair the mental or physical development of the child ;", "( b ) the parent is deemed to be manifestly unfit for or manifestly incapable of access ;", "( c ) the child is DATE and has , when being heard , manifested serious objections against allowing the parent access ; or", "( d ) access would for another reason be contrary to the weighty interests [ zwaarwegende belangen ] of the child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant part of Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Without prejudice to the provisions of Article [ CARDINAL:]CARDINALa [ of LAW ] , the judge may , on request , establish an access arrangement between the child and the person having close personal ties with it . The judge may reject the request where the interests of the child oppose granting it , or where the child is DATE and objects to it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the case - law of ORG , a request by a biological father for access to a child whose paternity he has not recognised is to be examined under Article CARDINAL , and not under LAW , of LAW , in that he is not a \u201c parent \u201d within the meaning of LAW . Where the father of a child born out of wedlock has recognised the child , a request for access is to be examined under LAW ( see PERSON , DATE , GPE DATE , no . CARDINAL , and PERSON , DATE , NJ DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In several cases in which a biological father has claimed a right of access to his child under LAW , ORG has held that mere biological fatherhood in itself is insufficient to establish the existence of \u201c family life \u201d . According to ORG , such a relationship can only be regarded as involving \u201c family life \u201d where there are additional circumstances , such as regular contact with the child , from which it ensues that the tie with the father can be regarded as constituting \u201c family life \u201d ( see PERSON , DATE , GPE DATE , no .
