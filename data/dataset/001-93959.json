The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the owner of a maisonette in GPE , GPE . He inherited CARDINAL undivided CARDINAL - share of the LOC from his father , who died in DATE and the other undivided CARDINAL - share from his mother , who died in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s father had entered into a temporary emphyteusis contract ( a contract granting a tenement [ house , flat or other type of real property ] for a stated yearly rent or ground rent to be paid in money or in kind ) with PERSON The parties had agreed that PERSON was to pay a DATE amount of MONEY ( MTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) and was to return the LOC with vacant possession to the owner after DATE . They further agreed that in respect of maintenance , the grantor was responsible only for \u201c extraordinary expenses in connection with the roofs and ceiling ... unless caused by the negligence of the acquirer \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW , the LOC reverted ipso iure to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) amending LAW of LAW , PERSON and PERSON , as holders of the utile dominium at the time and as NORP citizens occupying the LOC as their ordinary residence , were granted the right to retain possession of the LOC under a lease , without the consent of the owner . The law did not apply to temporary emphyteusis contracts entered into after DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , DATE in which the temporary emphyteusis contract lapsed , the applicant informed PERSON and PERSON that he would not renew the contract of emphyteusis and that they should vacate the LOC .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , PERSON and PERSON informed the applicant that they were not seeking renewal of the contract but that they were availing themselves of the right granted to them under LAW of DATE whereby they could retain the property under a lease .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , PERSON and PERSON remained in possession of the LOC under a lease , bringing about a completely new legal relationship between them and the applicant . As a result the applicant claimed that he had been unilaterally deprived of his property without being able to have recourse to a court for a determination as to whether it was necessary for PERSON and PERSON to retain the property or to establish just and fair lease conditions . The applicant also submitted that PERSON and PERSON also owned other property , whilst he could not make use of his property for the benefit of his daughter , who was getting married .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( the \u201c RRB \u201d ) in order to have a fair amount of rent fixed . On DATE these proceedings were adjourned sine die in view of the constitutional proceedings instituted by the applicant , and they have not been resumed since . According to the applicant the proceedings were awaiting the outcome of the constitutional proceedings and would be resumed according to law , as stated in TIME hearing before ORG . According to the Government , the applicant abandoned these proceedings , which were then declared to have been vacated on DATE . The maximum compensation the applicant could be offered by the ORG in accordance with the law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was MTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) per year .", "CARDINAL . According to an architect \u2019s report dated DATE , the market value of the vacant premises amounted to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately ORG MONEY ) , while the rental value was ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) per month .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) . He complained that the lease imposed on him , as owner of the premises , which had been granted in emphyteusis at the time of the introduction of the new law , subject to inadequate compensation , infringed his rights under LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW and was discriminatory and contrary to LAW , since other LOC , particularly those rented after DATE , were not subject to the same conditions .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . It held that the case was not CARDINAL of deprivation of property but rather of control of use . Although it had been claimed that the rent received by the applicant was minimal , the legislator had put in place provisions to deal with this ; in particular , the rent could be adjusted DATE in line with the inflation index , subject to capping at double the original amount . Consequently , there had been no breach of the applicant \u2019s property rights . In respect of LAW , it noted that the applicant had not invoked any basis for the discrimination and that the applicant and persons who rented out LOC after DATE were not persons in a similar situation and that consequently , no discrimination could have arisen .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . It held that the law at issue restricted the use of property ; thus , the interference suffered by the applicant constituted control of the use of property , which had been legitimate and in the general interest , falling within the ORG \u2019s wide margin of appreciation . In view of the housing situation in GPE , the new law was meant to protect persons occupying LOC as their ordinary residence for a certain period of time from being evicted . The law also allowed for the rent to be reviewed as mentioned by the first - instance court . ORG found that the sum of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) per year was certainly low and that it would be preferable for the executive to revise the laws determining such compensation , a task which fell outside the competence of the courts . However , the sum was higher than that payable under other rent laws in force in the country . Hence , having considered all the circumstances , it held that , although the amount of rent was close to the demarcation line below which it would qualify as unjust compensation , it did not result in a violation of the applicant \u2019s property rights . In respect of LAW , ORG upheld the first - instance judgment , ruling that no comparison could be made in the absence of an analogous situation .", "CARDINAL .
