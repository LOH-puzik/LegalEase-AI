The prosecutor submitted that , according to the data provided by ORG ( ORG mi\u0161kotvarkos tarnyba ) , CARDINAL hectares of the plot was covered by forest . Since that forest was situated in a city ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it was considered a forest of national importance and could therefore only be owned by the State ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The prosecutor noted that the forest had been included in the plan of forests of national importance adopted by the Government in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , that is before the ORG had adopted its decision to give that land to GPE In view of the circumstances , the ORG \u2019s decision had to be declared unlawful and its effects annulled .

The ORG also disputed the prosecutor \u2019s claim . It submitted that GPE \u2019s property rights had been restored in accordance with Government regulations adopted in DATE which had set out the rules of land reform in rural areas . The ORG argued that restoration of property rights was a continuous process and thus had to be carried out in accordance with the legislation in force when it began and not that which was adopted later .

On DATE ORG allowed the prosecutor \u2019s claim . The court observed that the LAW and other legislation established that forests of national importance could only be owned by ORG see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . It quoted at length case - law of ORG which emphasised the importance of forests to the environment and the obligation of the ORG to protect them in the public interest ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the former village of ORG had become part of the GPE city municipality in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Therefore , in line with the Law on Forests , any forest in that area was urban forest ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

Accordingly , when the ORG had adopted the decision to give that plot to GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the forest situated on it had already been recognised as a forest of national importance .

NORP However , the court observed that , according to ORG , the area covered by forest on the applicants\u2019 plot amounted to CARDINAL hectares and not QUANTITY as claimed by the prosecutor , and the data of that ORG had to be considered accurate until proven otherwise . It therefore annulled GPE \u2019s property rights to QUANTITY of land , as well as the applicants\u2019 rights to that part of the plot .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor lodged an appeal against that decision and submitted that when determining the area covered by forest , the court should have relied on the data provided by ORG and not ORG . ORG lodged a similar appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and the ORG also lodged appeals . They argued that the ORG \u2019s decision had complied with all the relevant legislation in force when it had been adopted , so it had to be considered lawful . They also submitted that the court had not addressed the argument that in the process of restoration of property rights ORG had to be regarded as a rural area and not a city . The applicants also submitted that the annulment of their property rights and the requirement for them to return the land to the ORG would cause them serious difficulties and should therefore not be implemented ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the appeals lodged by the prosecutor and ORG and dismissed those lodged by the applicants and the ORG . It reiterated that the LAW and several laws prohibited the transfer of forests of national importance from the ORG into private ownership on any basis whatsoever , including restoration of property rights ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , it was immaterial that , as submitted by the ORG , its decision complied with certain regulations adopted during the restitution process . ORG considered that the first - instance court had correctly found that the forest on the plot given to GPE was urban forest and therefore a forest of national importance , and thus property rights in respect of that part had to be annulled . However , it stated that when determining the area covered by forest the information had to be taken not from ORG but from ORG ( Mi\u0161k\u0173 kadastras ) , which was administered by ORG . According to the latter , the plot given to GPE included QUANTITY of forest . ORG therefore partly amended the decision and annulled GPE \u2019s property rights to QUANTITY of land , as well as the applicants\u2019 rights to that part of the plot .

It also noted that that forest was included in the list of forests of national importance created in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court observed that even though restoration of property rights was a continuous process and included the preparation of various documents , the final decision to restore property rights had to comply with the law in force at the time of the adoption of that decision . It concluded that the ORG \u2019s decision to give the plot to GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been contrary to the LAW and other legislation providing that forests of national importance could only be owned by ORG see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , it annulled GPE \u2019s property rights to QUANTITY of the land , as well as the applicants\u2019 rights to that part of the plot . The court observed that there was no dispute that GPE had retained the right to restoration of his property rights , and the ORG was thus under an obligation to restore his rights to QUANTITY of land .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and the ORG lodged appeals against that decision . They argued that the ORG \u2019s decision had been based on various administrative and procedural acts according to which the forest on the applicants\u2019 plot had not been considered a forest of national importance , and thus had been lawful . The prosecutor and ORG contested the appeals .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicants received another letter from the ORG which again confirmed that , after the courts had annulled GPE \u2019s property rights to QUANTITY of land , he had retained the right to have those property rights restored . It stated that there was a possibility for the applicants to receive a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in the GPE city area but as there were CARDINAL other candidates waiting to receive plots in the area , the restitution process would take a long time . The applicants were asked to consider an alternative form of restitution , such as a plot of land in a rural area , a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in a different city , or monetary compensation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They were also informed that there remained CARDINAL hectares of vacant land in the former village of ORG , so if they wished to receive a plot in that area , their request would be considered when the land plan was being prepared .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sent a letter to the NLS . They submitted that the annulment of their property rights to QUANTITY of land had caused them pecuniary damage in the amount of CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL approximately MONEY ( EUR ) ) , according to an assessment of the value of the land carried out in DATE . In the applicants\u2019 view , being put on the list with CARDINAL other candidates and being made to wait for an undetermined period of time for restitution was unacceptable . The applicants asked to be allocated a plot of land for the construction of an individual home in GPE in the order of priority , and if that was not possible , to be informed how many plots were available in GPE and when they might expect to receive CARDINAL . They also stated that they would agree to receive a plot of land in ORG but would first want to know its exact location .

The prosecutor noted that the forest in question had been included in the plan of forests of national importance adopted by the Government in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , that is before the ORG had adopted its decision to give that forest to the applicant and G.D. Accordingly , the ORG \u2019s decision had to be declared unlawful and its effects annulled .", "CARDINAL . The applicant disputed the prosecutor \u2019s claim . She submitted that the ORG \u2019s decision to give the forest to her and ORG had been taken in line with the law in force at the material time and in coordination with the relevant authorities , including ORG . The applicant also argued that , in line with the case - law of ORG , forests which belonged to private individuals and were subsequently declared to be of national importance did not have to be taken into ORG ownership , as ORG rights could be restricted in order to protect the forest . She therefore asked the court to protect her property rights .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also disputed the prosecutor \u2019s claim . It submitted that the restoration of property rights to the land in the former village of LOC had been carried out in line with the regulations applicable to rural areas . It also submitted that the decision to give the forest in question to the applicant and PERSON had been based on several administrative acts adopted in DATE , and so the decision could not be annulled as long as those acts remained in force .", "CARDINAL . ORG , which was a third party in the proceedings , asked the court to allow the prosecutor \u2019s claim . It argued that at the time when the ORG had adopted the decision to give the forest to the applicant and G.D. , the forest had officially been urban forest ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and had been included in the list of forests of national importance ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Accordingly , the ORG \u2019s decision had been contrary to mandatory statutory provisions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) and had to be annulled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE City Second ORG allowed the prosecutor \u2019s claim . It reiterated that , in line with the LAW and the Law on Forests , urban forests were considered forests of national importance and could only belong to the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The court also emphasised the importance of forests to the environment and the obligation of the ORG to protect them in the public interest . It then noted that the former village of LOC had become part of the GPE city municipality in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , so any forests within that area were urban forests . The court also observed that the forest given to the applicant and PERSON had been included in the list of forests of national importance approved by ORG in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Accordingly , the ORG \u2019s decision to give that forest to the applicant and ORG had been adopted after the forest had already become a forest of national importance ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court held that it was immaterial whether other administrative acts on which the ORG \u2019s decision had been based remained valid ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) because property rights had been restored to the applicant and G.D. by that decision and not by any other acts . The court therefore annulled the applicant \u2019s and ORG property rights to QUANTITY of forest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the ORG lodged appeals against that decision , raising essentially the same arguments as before ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . In addition , the applicant submitted that her property rights to the forest in question had been challenged DATE after it had been given to her , and thus she had lost the opportunity to have her property rights restored because there was almost no vacant land left in GPE or the surrounding area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals and upheld the first - instance court \u2019s decision in its entirety . It considered that that court had been correct in finding that the forest in question was a forest of national importance and that the ORG \u2019s decision had thus been contrary to mandatory statutory provisions prohibiting the transfer of such forests into the ownership of private individuals . In response to the applicant \u2019s argument that she had lost the opportunity to have her property rights restored ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG stated that NORP law provided for partial restitution , and that where it was impossible to restore property rights in natura , it could be done in other ways , including by monetary compensation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Therefore , the court considered that the applicant had retained the right to have her property rights restored in CARDINAL of the forms provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the ORG lodged appeals on points of law , relying on essentially the same arguments as before ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL above ) . In addition , the applicant submitted that she had acquired the property in good faith and that ordering her to return it to the ORG would cause her serious difficulties ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She argued that she could no longer receive a plot in the same area because there was no more vacant land there and that she would not receive fair compensation either because property prices had decreased . The applicant submitted that the public interest to protect forests could be achieved in other ways , such as by imposing on her special conditions for use of the forest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals on points of law and upheld the findings of the lower courts . It observed that restoring property rights to forests in valuable areas had been prohibited since the beginning of the restitution process in GPE . Accordingly , individuals could not have a legitimate expectation to acquire property rights to such forests . It also stated that the ORG , as the institution in charge of restoration of property rights , was under an obligation to ensure that its decisions complied with all relevant legislation adopted throughout the entirety of the restitution process .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterated that when a transaction was annulled , the parties had to return to one another everything that they had received from that transaction ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It stated that the lower courts had not identified any exceptional circumstances why that rule should not be applied in the present case , nor had the applicant pointed to any such circumstances . ORG noted that the applicant had retained the right to have her property rights restored in accordance with the law , so her argument that she would experience serious difficulties ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had to be dismissed as unfounded .", "CARDINAL .

Since it was situated in a city ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it was considered a forest of national importance and could thus only be owned by the State ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .

The court reiterated that forests of national importance could only be owned by the ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL below ) , and that forests situated in cities were considered forests of national importance , irrespective of whether they had been officially designated as such ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It observed that the former village of ORG had become part of the GPE city municipality in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Accordingly , the court held that the ORG \u2019s decision to restore the applicant \u2019s property rights had been unlawful and had to be annulled .", "DATE . Finding that the applicant had not had a right to acquire the CARDINAL hectares of land in question , ORG held that , consequently , she had had no right to sell the land , and thus the sale agreement between her and PERSON in the relevant part also had to be annulled . In accordance with LAW , PERSON was ordered to return QUANTITY of land to the ORG , and the applicant was ordered to return LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) to PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court noted that the applicant had retained the right to restoration of her property rights , and that the restitution process had to be \u201c continued at the expense of the ORG or its successor , by finalising ( and not starting afresh ) , in the same order of priority , the restitution process that had already begun \u201d .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of the first - instance court in its entirety . The court stressed that forests of national importance could not be transferred into private ownership on any basis whatsoever , including restitution of nationalised property ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It stated that the institutions responsible for adopting decisions on restoration of property rights had to verify whether all the conditions for restitution provided by law were complied with and , when deciding to restore property rights in natura , whether the property in question was not a type which could only belong to the State .

ORG held that the finding that the applicant \u2019s property rights had been restored in contravention of the law enabled it to consider that she had acquired those property rights in bad faith ( nes\u0105\u017eininga \u012fgij\u0117ja ) . It stated that the applicant and PERSON \u201c could not be considered bona fide acquirers merely because the land in question had become private property as a result of a decision adopted by a public authority \u201d . It also stated that when an individual knew or ought to have known that an administrative decision might be contrary to the law , he or she could not rely on his or her good faith .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further observed that even though the unlawful restoration of property rights had been the result of a decision adopted by the ORG , under the law it was not possible to order the ORG , and not the applicant , to return the money paid for the plot in question to PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court considered that requiring PERSON to return the plot to the ORG and the applicant to return the money to PERSON would not cause \u201c serious difficulties for the defendants \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .
