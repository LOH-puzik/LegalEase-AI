The applicant was arrested in TIME of CARDINAL DATE under LAW DATE in GPE by police officers of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) investigating the murder of a former member of ORG . The applicant was transported to the special holding centre for terrorist investigations at GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was interviewed for TIME on consecutive DATE by ORG police officers , beginning at TIME on DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the time when the applicant was arrested ( TIME on CARDINAL DATE ) , there was an initial decision made to defer the applicant \u2019s access to a solicitor by PERSON , the police officer in charge of the investigation . He communicated this decision to GPE police station by telephone and confirmed this in writing when he arrived in GPE . The applicant had by this time arrived in GPE and had requested a solicitor . At a review at TIME on DATE , the applicant was informed that his right to see a solicitor had been delayed for TIME . The deferral was therefore effective until TIME of CARDINAL DATE . His solicitor , PERSON , was informed of the deferral but did not attend until TIME on DATE . There was a period of time from TIME on DATE when the applicant was not being denied access to his solicitor . He made relevant admissions that TIME .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not see his solicitor until DATE , namely DATE . The applicant \u2019s first interview with his solicitor lasted TIME until TIME and the applicant made no complaint of ill - treatment during that visit . The applicant saw his solicitor again at TIME on DATE and again no complaint of ill - treatment was made in that interview , which lasted until TIME During the first interview with his solicitor , a policeman was present . The consultation took place within sight and hearing of the police officer who was in close proximity to the applicant and his solicitor . At the beginning of the interview , the police inspector told the solicitor in the presence of the applicant that no names were to be discussed or information conveyed which could assist other suspects and that the interview should be purely on legal advice .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was seen by doctors on a total of CARDINAL occasions during his stay in GPE , beginning with an examination following his arrival in GPE in TIME of CARDINAL DATE . He made no complaint of ill - treatment to any of the doctors who examined him . The doctors found no evidence to indicate any ill - treatment or mental handicap .", "CARDINAL . The police alleged that the applicant admitted his involvement in the murder during an interview in TIME of CARDINAL DATE . They further stated that in a later interview the applicant signed a statement to this effect and that thereafter he freely and voluntarily admitted additional terrorist activity and signed further statements .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that he had not volunteered the statements freely but , instead , that all the verbal and written statements had been extracted by ill - treatment , threats of ill - treatment , threats to his family and other oppressive conduct . The allegations of ill - treatment were denied by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . All of the verbal and written statements made by the applicant had been obtained by the police officers after the administration by them of cautions pursuant to LAW Order DATE , in the following terms :", "\u201c You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so but I must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court , your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you . If you do wish to say anything , what you say may be given in evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s solicitor was never permitted to be present at any of the applicant \u2019s interviews , nor was any independent person ; nor were the interviews recorded on video or audiotape .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , the applicant was transferred from GPE to PERSON station , where he was charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was tried by a single judge , PERSON , sitting without a jury , for a total of CARDINAL serious offences including , inter alia , murder , attempted murder , possession of firearms and ammunition with intent , possession of explosives with intent , false imprisonment , hijacking a motor vehicle , and membership of a proscribed organisation , namely ORG ( the \u201c IRA \u201d ) . He was found guilty on all counts .", "CARDINAL . The disputed verbal and written statements by the applicant constituted the only evidence connecting the applicant to the charges brought . The admissibility of the statements was challenged by the applicant on the basis that they had been obtained by torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or , alternatively , should be excluded in exercise of the judge \u2019s discretion . A voir dire ( submission on a point of law in the absence of the jury ) commenced and the applicant gave evidence over DATE which consisted of a highly detailed account of ill - treatment which he alleged he had experienced from the police . The officers denied ill - treating the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The events in the interviews had been filmed by television camera and the pictures relayed to a monitor screen in a special room at GPE police station . At all times , an officer of the rank of inspector was on duty for the purpose of viewing the monitor screens . A number of officers gave evidence and all of them told the court that they had seen no evidence of impropriety of any kind occurring during the interviews with the applicant . Indeed , none of them had ever witnessed an example of bad behaviour by an interviewing officer .", "CARDINAL . The doctors , who examined the applicant a number of times in GPE , gave evidence that the applicant had been cooperative and composed , that there were no signs of recent injuries and that the applicant did not complain of ill - treatment . Treatment had been given to the applicant in respect of his history of duodenal ulceration .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s account of the interrogation was rejected by the trial judge , who said :", "\u201c Having heard the officers concerned who impressed me as being honest and conscientious officers , I am absolutely convinced that all of [ the applicant \u2019s ] allegations of ill - treatment at this stage are completely unfounded ...", "In my view if there had been any truth in the account of ill - treatment given by [ the applicant ] his distress would have been obvious to the doctors ... None of the medical evidence therefore gave any credence to the account given by [ the applicant ] in the witness box and all of that evidence is consistent with his being treated with absolute propriety ...", "... I am satisfied ... that in no respect was [ the applicant ] subjected to any treatment which could be described as torture or inhuman or degrading treatment , violence or oppression in order to induce a confession from him . I am satisfied that he was not threatened in any way . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the trial , there was unchallenged independent medical evidence to the effect that :", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant had a full - scale intelligence quotient of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was on the borderline of mental retardation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant had a reading ability equivalent to that of an average CARDINAL-year - old child .", "CARDINAL . His suggestibility was average but he had a high level of compliance .", "CARDINAL . Evidence was given later in the trial by a psychologist that", "\u201c [ the applicant ] is a psychologically vulnerable man and in my view would have required appropriate support in the context of police interviews . [ The applicant \u2019s ] psychological vulnerabilities taken together with the lack of support from either the PERSON or an appropriate adult during the police interviews and the prolonged and intensive nature of the interviews would in my opinion be of relevance to the reliability of his admissions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In convicting the applicant , the judge rejected this evidence , finding that the applicant had not needed any form of independent support during the interviews and the police had been entitled to treat him as an ordinary member of society . He noted that the applicant \u2019s earliest admissions did not follow particularly prolonged or intensive questioning and that during those interviews he persisted with a consistent story told with an air of conviction . He also noted that no one thought to have the applicant \u2019s mental capacity investigated prior to the commencement of the trial . The trial judge stated :", "\u201c ... I am satisfied that [ the applicant ] was not suffering from such a degree of mental handicap that would have required the police to exercise any special consideration for him and that his memory , understanding and intellect were quite adequate to enable him to resist making any false confession under questioning in GPE and that the questioning was , therefore , not in any respect unfair to him .", "If he was an easier subject than others or more manageable I do not consider that that would be a matter which throws any doubt on the admissibility of any statements of confessions made by him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The police questioning which led to his confessions was therefore not unfair and the judge had no doubt about the reliability of the admissions made by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the question of access to a solicitor , the judge observed that the deferral of TIME was effective until TIME of CARDINAL DATE . However , the applicant \u2019s solicitor did not arrive until TIME on DATE . The trial judge noted that there had been a suggestion that the solicitor may have been unintentionally misled as to the length of time of the deferral but found , having heard the solicitor and police officers concerned , that he was satisfied that the solicitor was accurately informed that the deferral was for TIME . He further noted that it might well have been convenient for the solicitor to delay his visit to GPE until DATE because a number of other prisoners had had access deferred until then . In any event , it was not the deferral which prevented the applicant from seeing his solicitor after DATE in the TIME of DATE but the fact that his solicitor did not arrive until DATE . Incriminating admissions were made by the applicant at a time when he was no longer being denied access to a solicitor . The judge concluded that there was nothing improper in the decision to deny access for TIME , having regard to the police fears that messages might be passed through the solicitor with a view to alerting others implicated in offences .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Having considered the extent of the strength of character of the accused , his intellectual shortcomings and his nature I am quite satisfied that he was not a person for whom the regime of questioning in GPE would of itself be oppressive ...", "I am further satisfied that nothing was said or done during his questioning the effect of which upon him would justify the exercise of a discretion to exclude the statement ...", "I am satisfied that ... his admissions were made freely , and accept the police evidence that what triggered the making of admissions by this accused was the fact that the police were able to demonstrate to him that they had information available to them which discredited the alibi that he had given them ...", "In my view the particular circumstances of this case provided ample grounds for the belief that other persons could be alerted if a solicitor had seen this accused within TIME . In any case [ the applicant ] made no admission during TIME for which the solicitor had been deferred .", "I am satisfied that the deferral was right and proper in this case and that in any case it was not the deferral that resulted in the accused not seeing his solicitor during the early part of DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge further considered the applicant \u2019s complaints that a police officer had been present during the first legal consultation with his solicitor and whether this had prevented him getting the full benefit of his solicitor \u2019s advice . Evidence had been heard from the police inspector concerned who had stated that the purpose of sitting in to observe the interview was primarily to prevent information from being passed from the prisoner to the solicitor which might assist others suspected of involvement in the offence who had not yet been arrested . Under cross - examination , he stated that he had not been told of any codes that might be used and that it would be hard to identify such a code if it was used . The judge found , on the evidence of the applicant , his solicitor and the police officer , that the solicitor had not been in the least inhibited by the presence of the police officers and , according to the applicant , had been quite prepared to raise the crucial evidential issues with him . He was satisfied that an objective state of affairs existed justifying both the initial deferral of access and the supervision of the interview , namely , CARDINAL other suspects were still at large whom the police wished to interview .", "CARDINAL . The judge concluded that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the confessions were made freely and voluntarily . There was no ground for exercising his discretion to exclude any of the oral or written statements made by the applicant . The judge was accordingly satisfied that the applicant knew that he was playing a part in a murder plot and was therefore , inter alia , guilty of murder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to ORG of GPE . ORG noted that the inspector had authorised the postponement of access to a solicitor before the applicant had made a request for a solicitor , which was in technical breach of the statutory provision . ORG noted that there was no express sanction for breach of that provision . However , there was nothing unfair to the applicant as the deferral ran from the time of the arrest whenever the authorisation was given . ORG was satisfied that substantial reasons existed for the police to postpone access to a solicitor in this particular case pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) and ( e ) of GPE ( Emergency LAW DATE . In a judgment of DATE , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal stating , inter alia :", "\u201c We have no doubt that the learned trial judge was at all times aware of the need to bear the psychological evidence very much in mind when forming his conclusions both at the direction stage and when finally deciding if the ORG had established [ the applicant \u2019s ] guilt beyond reasonable doubt ...", "We are entirely satisfied that the learned trial judge was entitled to refuse the application for a direction [ regarding inadmissibility ] and to rule the various statements to be admissible ... Equally our perusal of the evidence does not suggest that the learned judge should , in the exercise of his discretion have excluded the statements , or any of them , from evidence ...", "This is an appeal in which the evidence was lengthy and detailed . We have carefully considered all the evidence and [ the applicant \u2019s counsel \u2019s ] closely reasoned submission . We have finally stood back from all the detail and looked at the case \u2018 in the round\u2019 as [ the applicant \u2019s counsel ] invited us to do . We are satisfied that [ the applicant \u2019s ] guilt was fully established by his admission and that his convictions are neither unsafe nor unsatisfactory . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s petition seeking leave to appeal to ORG was dismissed .", "CARDINAL .
