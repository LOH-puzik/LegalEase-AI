The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently being held in LOC ( GPE , ORG , GPE ) . Prior to his arrest he was the leader of ORG of Kurdistan ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was expelled from GPE , where he had been living for DATE . He arrived DATE in GPE , where the NORP authorities requested him to leave NORP territory within TIME and refused his application for political asylum . On DATE the applicant travelled to GPE in an aircraft that had been chartered by the NORP secret services . His application for political asylum in GPE was accepted by the PERSON , but the NORP Prime Minister did not implement that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to GPE where he made an application for political asylum . The NORP authorities initially detained him but subsequently placed him under house arrest . Although they refused to extradite him to GPE , they also rejected his application for refugee status and the applicant had to bow to pressure for him to leave GPE . After spending either CARDINAL or DATE in GPE he returned to GPE , probably on DATE . The following day ( DATE ) the applicant was taken to GPE . He was met at FAC by officials from ORG and put up at the NORP Ambassador 's residence . He lodged an application with the NORP Ambassador for political asylum in GPE , but never received a reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG announced that PERSON had been on board an aircraft that had landed at GPE on DATE and had entered NORP territory accompanied by NORP officials without declaring his identity or going through passport control . The announcement added that the Minister of ORG had convened the NORP Ambassador in GPE in order to elicit information about the applicant 's identity . After initially stating that the new arrival was not PERSON , on being pressed by the NORP authorities the Ambassador had gone on to acknowledge that he was . The Minister of ORG had been informed by the NORP Ambassador that the authorities in GPE agreed to arrange for PERSON departure from GPE .", "The NORP Minister of ORG also said that overseas NORP diplomatic missions had been the target of terrorist attacks and that the applicant 's presence in GPE constituted a major security risk . In those circumstances , ORG were surprised that GPE , a ORG with which it enjoyed friendly relations , could knowingly have put GPE in such a difficult position , exposing it to suspicion and the risk of attacks . Referring to the NORP Ambassador 's role in the events , ORG said that they had serious reservations about his credibility and had requested his immediate recall .", "The NORP Minister of ORG added that the NORP authorities had played no part in the applicant 's arrest and had had no say in his final destination . The Minister had not been informed of any operations by NORP security forces at the time of the applicant 's departure and there had been no consultations between the NORP and NORP Governments on the subject .", "CARDINAL . On DATE of his stay in GPE , the applicant was informed by the NORP Ambassador after the latter had returned from a meeting with the NORP Minister of ORG that he was free to leave for the destination of his choice and that the GPE was prepared to accept him .", "On DATE NORP officials went to ORG to take the applicant to the airport . The NORP Ambassador said that he wished to accompany the applicant to the airport in person and a discussion between the Ambassador and the NORP officials ensued . In the end , the applicant got into a car driven by a NORP official . On the way to the airport the car in which the applicant was travelling left the convoy and , taking a route reserved for security personnel in the international transit area of FAC , took him to an aircraft in which NORP officials were waiting for him . The applicant was then arrested after boarding the aircraft at TIME", "CARDINAL . The NORP courts had issued CARDINAL warrants for Mr \u00d6calan 's arrest and a wanted notice ( \u201c red notice \u201d ) had been circulated by ORG . In each of those documents the applicant was accused of founding an armed gang in order to destroy the territorial integrity of the ORG and of instigating various terrorist acts that had resulted in loss of life .", "From the moment of his arrest the applicant was accompanied by an army doctor throughout the flight from GPE to GPE . A video recording and photographs taken of PERSON in the aircraft for use by the police were leaked to the press and published . In the meantime , the inmates of \u0130mral\u0131 Prison were transferred to other prisons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was kept blindfolded throughout the flight except when the NORP officials wore masks . The blindfold was removed directly the officials put their masks on . According to the Government , the blindfold was removed as soon as the aircraft entered NORP airspace .", "The applicant was taken into custody at ORG on DATE . While being transferred from the airport in GPE to FAC he wore a hood . On photographs that were taken on the island of NORP in GPE , the applicant appears without a hood or blindfold . He later said that he had been given tranquillisers , probably at ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE onwards the applicant was interrogated by members of the security forces . On DATE a judge ruled on the basis of information in the case file that he should remain in police custody for a further DATE as the interrogation had not been completed .", "CARDINAL . The judges and prosecutors , who were from ORG , arrived on the island of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , CARDINAL lawyers instructed by his family sought leave from ORG on DATE to see him . They were told orally that only CARDINAL lawyer would be allowed access . Lawyers who went to GPE ( the embarkation point for the island of ORG ) on DATE were told by the administrative authorities that they could not visit the applicant . The applicant also alleges that his lawyers were harassed by a crowd at the instigation of plain - clothes police officers or at least with their tacit approval .", "CARDINAL . As soon as the applicant was detained , the island of ORG was decreed a prohibited military zone . According to the applicant , the security arrangements in his case were managed by a \u201c crisis desk \u201d set up at GPE . It was the crisis desk that was responsible for granting lawyers and other visitors access to the applicant . According to the Government , special measures were taken to ensure the applicant 's safety . He had many enemies who might have been tempted to make an attempt on his life . Likewise according to the Government , it was precisely for security reasons that lawyers were searched .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG at ORG questioned the applicant and took a statement from him as an accused . The applicant told the prosecutor that he was the founder of the ORG and its current leader . Initially , his and the ORG 's aim had been to found an independent NORP State , but with the passage of time they had changed their objective and sought to secure a share of power for the NORP as a free people who had played an important role in the founding of the LOC . The applicant confessed that village guards were a prime target for the ORG . He also confirmed that the ORG used violent methods against the civil population , in particular from DATE onwards ; he was personally opposed to such methods and had tried in vain to prevent their being used . He told the prosecutor that the warlords who wanted to seize power within the ORG had exerted some of their pressure on the NORP population ; some of them had been tried and found guilty by the ORG and had been executed with his personal approval . He acknowledged that ORG estimate of the number of those killed or wounded as a result of the ORG 's activities was fairly accurate ; that the actual number might even be higher ; and that he had ordered the attacks as part of the armed struggle being waged by the ORG . He added that he had decided in DATE to declare a ceasefire , acting on a request by the NORP President , PERSON , which had been conveyed to him by the NORP leader PERSON . The applicant also told the prosecutor that after leaving GPE on DATE he had gone first to GPE and then to GPE and GPE . When the latter CARDINAL countries refused to grant him the status of political refugee , he had been taken to GPE by the NORP secret services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appeared before a judge of ORG , who ordered that he should be detained pending trial . The applicant did not apply to ORG to have that decision set aside . Before the judge he repeated the statement he had made to the prosecutor . He said that decisions taken within the ORG were submitted to him for final approval as founder and leader of the organisation . In DATE the ORG 's activities had been political . In DATE and DATE the ORG had organised armed attacks on the agalar ( major landowners ) . In DATE , after the applicant had gone to GPE , the ORG had begun its paramilitary preparations . Since DATE the ORG had carried on an armed struggle within GPE . The persons in charge in each province decided on armed actions and the applicant had confirmed the general plan for such actions . He had taken the strategic and tactical decisions for the organisation as a whole . The units had carried out the decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE after he arrived in GPE the applicant 's NORP lawyer , Mr PERSON , asked to visit his client . He was prevented by members of the security forces from leaving the premises of ORG and was subsequently arrested together with CARDINAL other lawyers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities at FAC refused PERSON , PERSON and their partner Mr PERSON leave to enter GPE to visit the applicant , on the ground that they could not represent him in GPE and that PERSON past history ( she was suspected of having campaigned against GPE 's interests and of having taken part in meetings organised by the ORG ) gave rise to the risk of prejudice to public order in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was able to talk to CARDINAL of the QUANTITY lawyers who had asked to see him , Mr PERSON and Mr H. GPE . The first conversation took place in the presence of a judge and of members of the security forces wearing masks . The latter decided that it should not last longer than TIME . The record of that conversation was handed over to ORG . The applicant 's other representatives were given leave to have their authority to act before the ORG signed and to see their client later .", "CARDINAL . During the preliminary investigation from DATE , when the applicant was arrested , and DATE , when the trial began , the applicant had CARDINAL interviews with his lawyers . The dates and duration of those interviews were as follows : CARDINAL March ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME , TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) , DATE ( TIME ) and DATE ( TIME ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , his conversations with his lawyers were monitored from behind glass panels and filmed with a video camera . After the first CARDINAL short visits the applicant 's contact with his lawyers was restricted to CARDINAL visits a week , lasting TIME each . On each visit the lawyers were searched CARDINAL times and required to fill in a very detailed questionnaire . Likewise according to the applicant , he and his advisers were not allowed to exchange documents or take notes during these interviews . The applicants ' representatives were unable to give him either a copy of his case file ( other than the indictment , which was notified by the prosecution ) or any other material which would allow the applicant to prepare his defence .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , no restrictions were placed on the applicant as regards either the number of visits by his lawyers or their length . Apart from the first visit , which took place under the supervision of a judge and members of the security forces who were present in the same room as the applicant and his lawyers , the interviews were held in accordance with the provisions of LAW . In order to ensure their safety , the lawyers were taken to the island of ORG by boat after embarking at a private quay . Hotel rooms were booked for them near the embarkation point . Likewise according to the Government , no restrictions were placed on the applicant 's correspondence .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE delegates of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( the \u201c CPT \u201d ) visited PERSON . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the representatives of ORG they indicated that the applicant was physically in good health and that he had said that he had not suffered any ill - treatment since his arrest . His cell was of a high standard . The ORG drew the ORG 's attention to the fact that the applicant 's solitary confinement and his limited access to the open air could affect him psychologically .", "CARDINAL . The last visit by the ORG delegates to PERSON , of which the applicant is the sole inmate , took place during their visit to GPE from DATE . The delegates found that the cell occupied by the applicant was large enough to accommodate a prisoner and equipped with a bed , table , armchair and bookshelves . It also had an air - conditioning system , washing and toilet facilities and a window overlooking an inner courtyard . The applicant had access to books , newspapers and a radio , but not to television programmes or a telephone . On the other hand , he received twice DATE medical checks by doctors and was visited by his lawyers once DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , even before his trial began he was portrayed by a section of the media as a \u201c baby - killer \u201d . His statements made as an accused during the preliminary investigation were disclosed to the press even before they had been made available to his lawyers .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the media and journalists had shown avid interest in the \u00d6calan case and all sorts of comments were made as to whether or not the applicant should be found guilty . The applicant 's lawyers brought an action against a journalist whom they considered to have libelled the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In an indictment submitted on DATE ( and joined to several others drawn up in the applicant 's absence by various public prosecutors ' offices DATE ) ORG at ORG accused the applicant of activities carried out for the purpose of bringing about the secession of part of the national territory . He sought the death penalty under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The case file ran to CARDINAL pages and had been prepared by joining the files of CARDINAL sets of proceedings already instituted against the applicant by the various state security courts . The applicant 's lawyers were given access to the case file and the indictment on DATE . Since the judicial authorities had not been able to supply a copy of the file , the applicant 's lawyers had brought their own photocopier and finished copying the file on DATE . The prosecution had failed to place certain documents in it , such as those concerning the applicant 's arrest in GPE and transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL hearings held in GPE on DATE and DATE in the applicant 's absence were taken up with procedural matters , such as third - party applications to intervene in the proceedings and the measures to be taken for the hearings to be held on the island of ORG and for the attendance of the parties and the public at those hearings . According to the ORG , allegations that the lawyers were harassed by the police when they emerged from the first hearing in GPE on DATE are currently the subject of a criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . ORG , composed of CARDINAL civilian and CARDINAL military judge , held QUANTITY hearings on the island of ORG from DATE to DATE and these were attended by the applicant . The applicant told the court , among other things , that he reiterated the statements he had made to the prosecutor and the judge . He confirmed that he was the most senior ORG agent , that he led the organisation and that he had instructed the members of the organisation to carry out a number of acts . He stated that he had not been ill - treated or insulted since his arrest . Furthermore , the applicant 's representatives argued that ORG could not be regarded as an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of LAW . The applicant stated that , for his part , he accepted the court 's jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant said that he was willing to cooperate with ORG in order to bring to an end the acts of violence associated with the NORP question and he promised to halt the ORG 's armed struggle . He indicated that he wished to \u201c work for peace and fraternity and achieve that aim within GPE \u201d . He observed that , while he had initially envisaged an armed struggle for the independence of the population of NORP origin , that had been as a reaction to the ORG 's political pressure on that population . When circumstances had changed , he had altered his aim and limited his claims to autonomy or a recognition of the NORP ' cultural rights within a NORP society . He accepted political responsibility for the ORG 's general strategy but disclaimed criminal liability for the acts of violence which went beyond the ORG 's declared policy . In order to highlight the rapprochement between the ORG and the Government , he applied to have the ORG officials who had conducted negotiations with the ORG examined as witnesses for the defence . That application was refused by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyers ' applications for the communication of additional documents or for further investigations in order to collect more evidence were refused by ORG on the ground that they were delaying tactics .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyers complained to ORG about the restrictions and the difficulties they were having in conferring with their client . Their request to be permitted to confer with him during lunch breaks was accepted by ORG at the hearing on DATE .", "On DATE ORG ruled that the applicant was to be given access to the case file under the supervision of CARDINAL staff members and that the applicant 's lawyers were to be allowed to provide him with copies of documents from the case file .", "The lawyers did not appear at the hearing on DATE . At their request , the transcripts of that hearing and copies of the documents placed in the file were given to them and the applicant on DATE . CARDINAL of the applicant 's counsel thanked ORG for having instilled an atmosphere of calm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution made their final submissions . They sought the death penalty for the applicant , pursuant to LAW .", "The applicant 's advisers requested a DATE adjournment to enable them to prepare their final submissions . ORG granted them DATE , the statutory maximum allowed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE 's ORG amended LAW and excluded military members ( whether of the bench or of the prosecutor 's office ) from state security courts . Similar amendments were made on DATE to the PERSON on ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the judge appointed to replace the military judge sat for the first time on the bench of ORG . ORG noted that the new judge had already read the file and the transcripts , in accordance with LAW , and that he had followed the proceedings from the outset and had attended the hearings .", "The applicant 's counsel opposed the appointment of the non - military judge owing to his previous involvement in the case . Their application for an order requiring him to stand down was dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE the applicant 's counsel set out the applicant 's substantive defence to the charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing the applicant 's final representations , ORG found the applicant guilty of carrying out acts designed to bring about the secession of part of GPE 's territory and of training and leading a gang of armed terrorists for that purpose . It sentenced him to death , pursuant to LAW . ORG held that the applicant was the founder and principal leader of the unlawful organisation the ORG . The aim of the latter was to detach a part of the territory of GPE so as to form a NORP State with a political regime based on NORP - Leninist ideology . The court held that it had been established that , following decisions taken by the applicant and on his orders and instructions , the ORG had carried out several armed attacks , bomb attacks , acts of sabotage and armed robberies , and that in the course of those acts of violence CARDINAL of civilians , soldiers , police officers , village guards and public servants had been killed . The court did not accept that there were mitigating circumstances allowing the death penalty to be commuted to life imprisonment , having regard to , among other things , the very large number and the seriousness of the acts of violence , the CARDINAL of deaths caused by them , including those of children , women and old people , and the major , pressing threat to the country that those acts posed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment , which , on account of the gravity of the sentence , was in any event subject to review by ORG automatically .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment adopted on CARDINAL DATE and delivered on DATE ORG affirmed the judgment of DATE in every respect . It held that the replacement of the military judge by a civilian judge during the trial did not require the earlier procedural steps to be taken again seeing that the new judge had followed the proceedings from the beginning and that the law itself required that the proceedings should continue from the stage they had reached at the time of the replacement . ORG also pointed out that ORG was empowered by law to hold its hearings outside the area of its territorial jurisdiction , among other reasons on security grounds .", "CARDINAL . As to the merits , ORG had regard to the fact that the applicant was the founder and chairman of the ORG . It referred to the latter 's aim and activities , namely that it sought the foundation of a NORP State on a territory which GPE should be made to cede after an armed struggle and to that end carried out armed attacks and sabotage against the armed forces and industrial LOC and tourist facilities in the hope of weakening the authority of the ORG . The ORG also had a political front ( the ERNK ) and a military wing ( the ORG ) , which operated under its control . Its income was derived mainly from \u201c taxes \u201d , \u201c fines \u201d , gifts , subscriptions and the proceeds of armed robberies , gun - running and drug trafficking . According to ORG , the applicant led all CARDINAL of these groupings . In his speeches at party conferences , in his radio and television appearances and in the orders he had given to his activists , the applicant had instructed his men to resort to violence , indicated combat tactics , imposed penalties on those who did not obey his instructions and incited the civilian population to translate words into deeds . As a result of the acts of violence carried out by the ORG from DATE up until the applicant 's arrest ( in all , CARDINAL armed attacks , CARDINAL bomb attacks , CARDINAL armed robberies and CARDINAL kidnappings ) CARDINAL civilians , CARDINAL soldiers , CARDINAL policemen and CARDINAL village guards had died .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the ORG , founded and led by the applicant , had represented a substantial , serious and pressing threat to the country 's integrity . It ruled that the acts of which the applicant was accused matched those which constituted the offence laid down in LAW and that it was not necessary , in order that that provision should apply , for the applicant \u2013 the founder and chairman of the ORG and the instigator of the acts of violence committed by that organisation DATE to have used a weapon himself .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Article CARDINAL of the LAW was amended so that the death penalty could no longer be ordered or implemented other than in time of war or of imminent threat of war or for acts of terrorism .", "By PERSON no . CARDINAL , which was published on DATE , ORG resolved , inter alia , to abolish the death penalty in peacetime ( that is to say except in time of war or of an imminent threat of war ) by amending the relevant legislation , including LAW . As a result of the amendments , a prisoner whose death sentence for an act of terrorism has been commuted to life imprisonment must spend the rest of his life in prison .", "In a letter to ORG , the Government declared : \u201c PERSON no longer faces the execution of the death penalty as finalised on DATE by the judgment of ORG \u201d .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG commuted the applicant 's death sentence to life imprisonment . It ruled that the offences under LAW of which the applicant was accused had been committed in peacetime and constituted terrorist acts .", "ORG ( ORG , PERSON ) , a political party with representatives in ORG , applied to ORG for an order setting aside certain provisions of PERSON no . MONEY , including the provision abolishing the death penalty in peacetime for persons found guilty of terrorist offences . ORG dismissed that application in a judgment of DATE .", "On DATE CARDINAL trade unions \u2013 ORG and ORG ( representing teachers ) DATE which had intervened in the criminal proceedings on behalf of their deceased members , appealed on points of law against the judgment of DATE by which the applicant 's death sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment . They argued that the ORG 's activities in south - east GPE should be regarded as constituting \u201c an imminent threat of war \u201d . Those proceedings are still pending .", "CARDINAL . Before the LAW was amended on DATE , Article CARDINAL provided that ORG were composed of a president , CARDINAL other regular members and CARDINAL substitute members . The President of ORG , CARDINAL of the regular members and CARDINAL of the substitute members were appointed from among civilian judges , and the other regular member and substitute member were appointed from among military judges .", "CARDINAL .
