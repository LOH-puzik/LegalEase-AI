They are represented by Mr PERSON , a practising lawyer in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as they have been submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants maintain that their families had de facto possession ( zilyedlik ) of an area of land in LOC in GPE for DATE . They allege that over DATE their ascendants had been leasing the land to various villagers and had successfully claimed and defended their rights over the land .", "According to the applicants , CARDINAL of their ancestors in DATE leased the land to a family in the village ( a\u015firet ) . For reasons which are unknown , the money which was received in rent for the lease of the land was paid directly to the village administration . The ancestor sued ORG for the return of the money , claiming that the latter had unlawfully retained it . However , their ancestor and the village mayor ( GPE ) reached a friendly settlement ( sulh ) . According to the terms of that settlement , the ancestor agreed that the village mayor could collect and keep the rent due under the lease up until DATE . In return the mayor agreed that , after DATE , \u201c the village people \u201d would respect the ancestor \u2019s property ( m\u00fclkiyet ) rights over the land .

In a judgment dated CARDINAL DATE ORG acquitted the former mayor of the charge .", "In DATE several villagers requested ORG ) to rule that the applicants\u2019 ancestors had unlawfully interfered with their use of the land . In its judgment of DATE that court held that the consent of the former mayor of the village to the friendly settlement which was registered with ORG on DATE did not bind the villagers . The court nevertheless found that the plaintiff villagers\u2019 claims to be in de facto possession ( zilyedlik ) of the land were manifestly ill - founded . On the other hand , the court also accepted that the villagers had built houses and barns on the land and had cultivated fruit gardens in good - faith and with the knowledge of the applicants\u2019 ancestors . For that reason , it held that the latter had interfered with the plaintiffs\u2019 possessions on the land . It would appear that the applicants\u2019 ancestors did not appeal .", "In DATE other villagers resident in LOC challenged the decision of ORG of DATE before ORG ) . However , a friendly settlement ( sulh ) was reached between the applicants\u2019 ancestors and the plaintiff villagers according to which the former accepted the villagers\u2019 property rights with respect to a certain part of the disputed land .

The latter complained to ORG under PERSON No . DATE which protects de facto possessors of immovable property against third party interferences . The Governor ordered the villagers to leave the land with the exception of that part of the land which they used as meadowland ( mera ) .", "At some stage , certain villagers together with ORG requested ORG ) to annul the title deed to the land which had been registered by the ORG ancestor with the land registry of ORG in DATE . On DATE the court concluded that the mayor was not entitled to enter into a friendly settlement on behalf of the village in the absence of a decision of ORG ( PERSON ) . The court nevertheless ruled that the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that the disputed land was meadowland and as such the property of the LOC . The plaintiff village and the villagers appealed . The applicants have not provided a copy of the decision of ORG .", "Following an official cadastre measurement ( tapulama tesbiti ) dated DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) identified the disputed land as \u201c village heritage \u201d and classified it as meadowland , which was to be registered as the property of the village .", "On an unknown date the applicants challenged the decision of ORG before ORG . The court held on DATE that the applicants had to lodge their complaint with ORG ( \u0130tiraz GPE ) of ORG ( Tapulama M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc ) and for that reason the file was transferred to the latter authority .", "On DATE ORG of ORG ( Tapulama M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc ) rejected the ORG complaints .", "On DATE and DATE , the applicants challenged the decision of the CARDINAL DATE before ORG . The respondents were ORG ( legal entity ) represented by its mayor ( muhtar ) and GPE PERSON ) of ORG . The applicants requested that the administrative classification be annulled and their former registration as owners in the land registry ( tapu k\u00fct\u00fc\u011f\u00fc ) be reconfirmed . ORG of ORG ( PERSON ) also challenged the decision before the same court , claiming that certain lots which were registered as the property of GPE village were in fact the property of the ORG .", "In support of their claims , the applicants referred to the events surrounding the land since DATE . They argued that their property rights as the undisputed owners of the land had been determined and affirmed by the DATE court decision and that no other court could alter that decision .", "ORG heard all the concerned parties as well as witnesses . The court commissioned the preparation of expert reports on the disputed land and also inspected the site .", "On DATE ORG concluded that the classification of the land as meadowland by ORG and the registration of LOC as the owner was lawful . The court also ruled that certain parts of the disputed land were the property of ORG of ORG . In its reasoning the court held that the judgment of ORG of DATE only pertained to a dispute over receivables between CARDINAL parties ( CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 ancestors and the village ) and was only intended to register the friendly settlement reached . According to the court , the DATE judgment was neither a determination of ownership of the land nor a legal basis for registering the applicants\u2019 title to it in the land register in DATE .", "The applicants appealed . They complained that the trial court did not investigate the case sufficiently . They also claimed that the court could not give a judgment which was in contradiction to the judgment of the Kadirli Magistrate \u2019s Court of DATE .", "On DATE the CARDINALth Chamber of ORG upheld the judgment of ORG . It ruled that the lower court had investigated the case sufficiently and evaluated the evidence in accordance with the law . It concluded that the DATE registration of the applicants as owners in the land registry was groundless since it was not based on a judgment validating title to the land ( tescil ilam\u0131 ) . According to ORG , the DATE judgment of ORG did not affect the rights of ORG of the PERSON village since it was not a party to the friendly settlement . It added that the meadowland was public property and bona fide possessors thereof could not acquire property rights with the passage of time . The ORG furthermore found that in any event the land was never in the undisputed and uninterrupted possession of the applicants for DATE . The ORG nevertheless stated that it was not the first instance court \u2019s task to determine the true owners of the lots . The trial court should have confined itself to ordering that the classification of the land as meadowland be registered as such in the relevant register . The ORG corrected the corresponding parts of the trial court \u2019s judgment .", "The applicants asked for the correction ( karar d\u00fczeltme ) of ORG judgment . On DATE Chamber of ORG rejected their request ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
