On DATE , with the help of an agent , he went by plane to GPE . The agent had picked him up at the airport in GPE and driven him to a centre where he could request asylum . He could not explain why he was in possession of a train ticket issued on DATE for the town where his brother - in - law lived . The applicant wanted to live in GPE with his son . It was better than living in GPE . The applicant had not had contact with his youngest son since DATE and his brother remained in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In an asylum application form of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant added that while staying in the refugee camp his eldest son had been arrested CARDINAL times and the applicant had been arrested twice . To leave the camp it had been obligatory to obtain permission from the military . In DATE the applicant helped his eldest son leave the country . While in GPE the applicant was arrested and detained CARDINAL times by the authorities in order to check whether he had permission to stay there . When a peace agreement was concluded in DATE , the applicant went to GPE to live with his brother . The applicant 's nephew in GPE had been killed by the authorities on DATE because he was suspected of being an NORP member . Thereafter the applicant was constantly harassed by the military forces and he also had problems with the NORP .", "CARDINAL .

He had not had any contact with anybody in his country since his departure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's request for asylum was refused by ORG , which found that the applicant failed to fulfil the criteria under section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) , notably because his relationship with the ORG was so remote that he would not be of sufficient interest to the authorities or in real and concrete danger of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW upon return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( PERSON ) before which an oral hearing was held on DATE . It appears that the applicant maintained that his brother had moved to GPE ( and not died from an illness as previously stated ) . Also , the applicant explained that he had in fact seen the nephew being shot . The other people in the village and the applicant 's sister - in - law reported to the ORG who had informed the authorities about the nephew 's activities , and consequently the informer , a woman , was killed by the NORP . ORG upheld the decision to refuse to grant the applicant asylum on DATE . It attached importance to the applicant 's statement that the visits by the authorities concerned the young people of the household , and found that the applicant was not himself an object of interest to the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's request for a residence permit on humanitarian grounds under section CARDINAL b , subsection l , of LAW was refused by ORG . In its decision ORG took account , inter alia , of the applicant 's age and health and found that , according to the information available , the applicant did not suffer from any physical or mental illness of a very serious nature , and that no circumstances otherwise provided any basis for granting a residence permit on humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) , an NGO , requested that ORG reopen the case . It referred to the applicant 's previous explanations and the general deterioration of the security situation in GPE . It also added that , according to the applicant 's eldest son , it was in fact the applicant who had reported to the NORP who it was that had informed the authorities on the nephew 's membership . Allegedly , the authorities were therefore interested in the applicant . The eldest son had also informed the applicant 's representative that the killed nephew 's brother had stated that the authorities were looking for the applicant after his departure . Moreover , the eldest son had been granted asylum status in GPE due to his affiliation with the NORP and because he had been tortured during an investigation in DATE .

On DATE , on the basis of the most recent background information concerning GPE including , inter alia , a Memorandum of CARDINAL DATE prepared by ORG , ORG decided to review the suspended cases , including the applicant 's case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to reopen the applicant 's case as it found that the most recent general background information would not lead to a revised assessment of the case . More specifically in its letter to the applicant 's representative it stated as follows :", "\u201c ... ORG still finds that your client 's fear of the ORG and the Sri NORP authorities does not warrant a residence permit under section CARDINAL of LAW . In that connection , ORG refers to the fact that your client stated during the asylum procedures that he had not been a member of or sympathised with the ORG and that he had not been sought by or had problems with the NORP at any time prior to his departure . He stated that the family had no contact with the NORP while he lived with his brother . On the contrary , the NORP supposedly avenged the murder of your client 's nephew by killing the woman who had allegedly informed on your client 's nephew to the authorities . ORG thus finds itself unable to accept the supposition that your client has outstanding issues with the ORG which , in fact , was defeated in DATE . Your client has also referred to fear of persecution by the Sri NORP authorities . In this connection , ORG refers to the fact that during the asylum procedures your client stated that personally he was not an object of interest to the authorities , that he was solely questioned about his knowledge of other ORG members in connection with the murder of his nephew which took place DATE , and that personally he has not been persecuted or threatened in his country of origin . Your client also left his country of origin without any problems using his own genuine passport . Thus , the ORG finds that it has not been rendered probable that your client would be of interest to the Sri NORP authorities or suspected of supporting the NORP . The possibility that as an ethnic GPE from northern GPE your client risks being questioned and investigated by the authorities upon entry into his country of origin does not lead to a revised assessment of the case under asylum law . The individuals at particular risk of being detained and investigated upon entry in GPE are young NORP , men in particular , from northern and eastern GPE ; those without ID ; those not resident or employed in GPE ; and those recently returned from the LOC , see GPE ORG to GPE , GPE DATE . Regardless of whether it is accepted as a fact that the Sri NORP authorities have suspected your client of supporting the NORP , it does not lead to a revised assessment . In this respect , ORG refers to the fact that it appears from the background material available to ORG that , in general , individuals who have supported the ORG on a lower level are not of interest to the authorities . Thus , generally , only high profile members of the NORP who are still active and wanted , or individuals wanted for serious criminal offences are of interest to the authorities , see ORG , Operational Guidance Note , GPE , DATE , and ORG to GPE , GPE DATE . Your client has also referred to a fear of the general situation of insecurity in GPE and the fact that he is old and wants to live in GPE where there is peace and quiet . Moreover , he has no family in his country of origin to take care of him , but he has agreed with his son living in GPE that he can stay with the son and be provided for . As in the previous decisions in the case , ORG still finds that the general situation for ethnic NORP in GPE is not of such nature that it in itself warrants a residence permit under LAW . Thus , ORG fully relies on the decisions of DATE and DATE . Against that background , the ORG still finds that it has not been rendered probable that , in case of return to GPE , your client would be at concrete and individual risk of persecution as covered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , or that your client would be at a real risk of outrages as covered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . ORG further states that ORG has no authority to decide whether your client could be granted a residence permit under other provisions of LAW . Such authority lies with ORG and ORG . It should be noted that your client 's time - limit for departure is still postponed on the basis of the request of DATE from ORG . If your client 's lawful stay in GPE lapses , he must leave the country immediately , see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . As appears from the decision of ORG , your client may be forcibly returned to GPE if he does not leave voluntarily , see section GPE , cf . section CARDINAL , of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the GPE , nearly the entire population from the territory formerly held by the NORP in the LOC ( CARDINAL NORP ) has been confined to heavily militarized camps in the LOC region . Although the government has gradually reduced the military presence in the camps and has pledged to start the progressive return to their villages of origin of the majority of those in the camps , it is clear that this may take a considerable amount of time .

On several occasions , the government expelled foreign journalists and aid workers who had collected and publicized information about camp conditions , or did not renew their visas . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

For instance , many of the areas of return are riddled with mines and unexploded ordnance . Not all are considered to be of high risk , particularly those away from former frontlines , but mine - risk surveys and the demarcation of no - go areas are urgently needed .", "Other key obstacles to return include the need to re - establish administrative structures in areas formerly held by ORG ; the destruction or damaged condition of public infrastructure and private homes ; and the breakdown of the economy - including agriculture and fisheries .", "The Government of GPE is planning the return framework , and it has called on ORG for support with return transport , non - food items , return shelter , livelihoods support and assistance in building the capacity of local authorities .", "With some progress having been recently achieved , it is hoped that a substantial number of IDPs will be able to return to their places of origin in DATE , but a large portion of new IDPs are also likely to remain in the camps and with host families until well into DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

There was not a great deal of available information about the profile of NORP targeted for abduction , although it appeared that people linked to the media might be more vulnerable . Police did not generally carry out effective investigations .

In general those most likely to be questioned were young NORP from the north and east ; those without ID ; those not resident or employed in GPE ; and those recently returned from the West . However , most sources said that arrests at checkpoints were rare and none had been reported since DATE . It was reportedly fairly likely that someone would be stopped at a checkpoint en route from the airport to GPE . Finally , it clarified that people who wished to live in GPE but did not originate from there must register with the local police station with a national ID card or full passport , and details of planned length and purpose of stay . In theory , whilst anyone was entitled to register to stay in GPE , some sources suggested that young NORP men originally from the north or east of the country could encounter difficulties and face closer scrutiny . The presence of any of the risk factors set out above would also attract greater attention from the police .", "\u201c The significant majority of reported cases of human rights violations in GPE involve persons of NORP ethnicity who originate from the LOC and LOC ... In Government - controlled areas , NORP who originate from the LOC and the LOC , which are , or have been under ORG control , are frequently suspected as being associated with the NORP . For this reason , NORP from the LOC and the LOC are at heightened risk of human rights violations related to the implementation of anti - terrorism and anti - insurgency measures . While this risk exists in all parts of GPE , it is greatest in areas in which the ORG remains active , and where security measures are heaviest , in particular the LOC and parts of the LOC , and in and around GPE . \u201d", "\u201c The country of origin information that ORG has considered indicates that NORP from LOC continue to face a significant risk of suffering serious human rights violations in the region ( and elsewhere in the country ) because of their race ( ethnicity ) or ( imputed ) political opinion . NORP in the LOC are still heavily targeted in the security and anti - terrorism measures described in LAW . Wide scale detention and confinement of NORP from the LOC remains a serious concern . ORG paramilitary elements also continue to operate with impunity against NORP in the LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG from GPE of DATE , which superseded the DATE Guidelines contained information on the particular profiles for which international protection needs may arise in the current context . It was stated that :", "\u201c given the cessation of hostilities , NORP originating from the north of the country are no longer in need of international protection under broader refugee criteria or complementary forms of protection solely on the basis of risk of indiscriminate harm . In light of the improved human rights and security situation in GPE , there is no longer a need for group - based protection mechanisms or for a presumption of eligibility for NORP of NORP ethnicity originating from the north of the country . It is important to bear in mind that the situation is still evolving , which has made the drafting of these LAW particularly complex . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In summary , the following were ORG 's recommendations : All claims by asylum seekers from GPE", "( i ) persons suspected of having links with ORG ( NORP ) ;", "( ii ) journalists and other media professionals ;", "( iii ) civil society and human rights activists ;", "( iv ) women and children with certain profiles ; and", "( v ) lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( ORG ) individuals .", "It was also stated that in the light of GPE DATE internal armed conflict , and a record of serious human rights violations and transgressions of international humanitarian law , exclusion considerations under LAW may arise in relation to individual asylum seeker claims by GPE asylum seekers .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reported in DATE that the Colombo Police force had opened CARDINAL special units in GPE suburbs able to take statements in GPE , with plans for more .
