CARDINAL/CARDINAL had annulled the applicability of all legal provisions enacted during the NORP occupation on NORP territory . The applicant \u2019s objection that civil cases brought by NORP citizens residing in the frontier territories of former GPE had fallen within the NORP legal order until Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL came into force , was irrelevant as the Sudetenland had been transferred to ORG by virtue of LAW , which had later been declared null and void ex tunc .
