{"ITEMID": "001-4520", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 1999, "DOCNAME": "ANDRIC v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , presently resides in GPE , GPE . In his application form , he states that he has NORP nationality .", "", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and requested asylum . He stated that he was NORP . Before leaving for GPE , he had been living in PERSON . He held also a NORP passport but this was to be considered as a travel document only . In DATE , while serving as a policeman in GPE , he refused to join the NORP forces and , as a consequence , he was accused of having stolen CARDINAL rifles from the police station . Later , he was placed in a special unit from which he could not resign . Resenting police attacks on NORP and being unable to handle the mental and physical stress , he later deserted from that unit . Further , in DATE PERSON was occupied by NORP troops . Along with other residents , the applicant participated in the defence of the village . Later , he was forced to leave the village and , on DATE , he arrived in GPE with his parents and siblings . Allegedly , if returned to GPE , he would risk being sent to GPE where he could be sentenced to DATE in prison for refusing to bear arms .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request and ordered his deportation to GPE . ORG called into question the credibility of the applicant \u2019s statements concerning his military and police activities as he had changed the statements during the course of the investigation . Finding that the applicant held both NORP and NORP citizenship , the ORG referred to a decision concerning asylum seekers with such double nationality taken by ORG on DATE . According to the decision , the prevailing situation in GPE rendered deportations to that country impossible . Consequently , in assessing applications from these asylum seekers , the crucial question was whether they could be afforded protection in GPE . ORG noted that , according to available information , persons in the applicant \u2019s situation did not risk to be sent from GPE to GPE against their will . Moreover , no acts of warfare had taken place on NORP territory for some time and a cease - fire had been agreed upon by the contending parties . Thus , there was no apparent risk that NORP citizens in general would be forced to take part in armed conflict . Further , the applicant had failed to show that he personally faced such a risk .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . On DATE ORG , sharing the opinion of ORG , rejected the appeal .", "The applicant later requested a temporary residence permit in GPE . By a decision of DATE ORG granted the applicant such a permit until DATE and quashed the deportation order . In so doing , ORG referred to a Government decision of CARDINAL DATE according to which the worsened situation in GPE constituted an impediment to the deportation of asylum seekers to that country .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a new application for a residence permit . He referred to his previous statements . Further , in a final statement of DATE he claimed that he should be granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds on account of the time he had spent in GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s new application and ordered his deportation to GPE . ORG had regard to a guiding decision taken by ORG on DATE . In that decision the ORG stated , inter alia , the following :", "( Translation )", "\u201c As regards the situation in GPE and the region , the ongoing peace process , based on a general agreement on peace in GPE , has lead to stabilisation . The relations between GPE and GPE have improved . GPE has been admitted into ORG . Acts of warfare have not occurred on NORP territory since DATE . The risk of further conflicts appears unlikely . The general situation in GPE has improved in such a way since the Government \u2019s previous assessment in DATE that nowadays NORP citizens can generally be afforded protection in GPE . \u201d", "ORG noted that ORG view had been confirmed by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) and ORG . As in the previous decisions taken concerning the applicant , ORG found that he could not be sent back to GPE . With regard to the possible deportation to GPE , the ORG noted that no new circumstances had been invoked by the applicant . Consequently , ORG shared the opinions expressed in its decision of DATE and the decision taken by ORG on DATE . Furthermore , ORG found that there were no reasons of a humanitarian nature to grant the applicant a residence permit .", "Following the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG , on DATE , quashed ORG decision and referred the case back for re - examination . ORG found that no oral hearing had been held by ORG , as required by law .", "ORG held an oral hearing in the case on DATE during which the applicant stated that , despite the fact that he held a NORP passport , he did not possess the full rights of a NORP citizen . Moreover , his parents and one of his brothers lived in GPE where they had difficulties to support themselves . In GPE nothing in particular would happen to the applicant but it would be hard for him to find work and a place to live .", "In a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s new application on the same grounds as those expressed in the quashed decision . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG noted that the applicant is an ethnic NORP and , as such , would be at risk in his NORP home district , dominated by NORP . However , the applicant \u2019s statements did not indicate that he would face ill - treatment in GPE .", "In medical certificates issued by the psychiatric clinic at the hospital in GPE on DATE and DATE chief physician PERSON and therapist PERSON stated that the applicant had undergone treatment for some time at the clinic for a post - traumatic stress syndrome . Allegedly , the enforcement of the deportation order would seriously impair his mental state and could lead to a suicide attempt . The clinic submitted the first certificate to ORG and requested that the enforcement be suspended .", "By a decision of DATE ORG suspended the enforcement of the deportation order for an unspecified period of time ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
