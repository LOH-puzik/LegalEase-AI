In DATE , the school conference ( PERSON ) \u2013 a body established at every school consisting of the school \u2019s principal and elected representatives of teachers , parents and pupils \u2013 had further decided that a DATE school theatre workshop \u201c PERSON geh\u00f6rt mir \u201d ( \u201c My body is mine \u201d ) should be organised at regular intervals as a mandatory school event for children in DATE , comprising the age group DATE , for the purpose of raising awareness of the problem of sexual abuse of children by strangers or family members with a view to its prevention .", "The subject of prevention of sexual abuse is part of the official curriculum in the Federal Land of GPE and the said theatre workshop is run at numerous schools in the Land . In the course of role play , children are presented with different situations in which sexual abuse might occur and are taught that they may resist behaviour that makes them feel uncomfortable and how to report such behaviour to a person of trust if need be . Parents were informed of the content and purpose of the workshop prior to its implementation in DATE . DATE workshop modules took place on CARDINAL and DATE and on CARDINAL and DATE , as well as during school terms in subsequent DATE .", "In addition , it is a school tradition at the PERSON primary school to organise an DATE carnival celebration for pupils called the \u201c PERSON \u201d . By a decision of the school conference of DATE , the celebrations for DATE were fixed for DATE and parents were informed accordingly . Attendance at the celebrations is compulsory until the official end of TIME school lessons . Children are free to dress up and wear costumes during the celebrations and to participate in a carnival procession that is organised in the school yard following compulsory school hours . Since DATE the school has offered swimming classes or exercise in the gym as an alternative activity for children who do not wish to attend the compulsory school carnival celebrations in the TIME .", "In DATE PERSON and PERSON attended DATE of the LOC public primary school . By letter dated DATE , the parents of the children who attended DATE were informed that CARDINAL sexual education lessons were to be held as from DATE dealing with subjects such as procreation , pregnancy and child birth . They were further informed that parents had the opportunity to look at the book to be used for these lessons as from the following school DATE that is , on DATE .", "After having looked at the book , the ORG and PERSON parents , together with other parents belonging to ORG and whose children attended the same school , requested that their children be exempted from sex education classes in the period from CARDINAL to DATE . They asserted that their children had been raised without the negative influence of the media , had been used to modest and chaste sexual behaviour at home and did thus not have the necessary maturity to receive the envisaged sex education . The parents objected in particular to the book \u2019s content , which in their opinion was partly pornographic and contrary to NORP sexual ethics requiring that sex should be limited to matrimony . In their view , it set forth a liberal , emancipatory image of sexuality which was not consistent with their religious and other moral beliefs and would lead to premature \u201c sexualisation \u201d of the children .", "The school refused the request on the grounds that , according to the relevant guidelines and the curriculum , attendance at the lessons was mandatory . PERSON and PERSON attended the first CARDINAL sex education lessons . Following the refusal of a further request to exempt their children from sex education classes , several parents belonging to ORG , including the ORG and PERSON parents , appeared in the school building on DATE and prevented their children from attending the next sexual education lesson , against the school principal \u2019s wishes . The principal and class teacher subsequently decided to hold the lessons at irregular intervals and at TIME in order to hinder any obstruction by the parents . Consequently , the parents kept their children off school for DATE of CARDINAL to DATE , during which the remaining sexual education lessons were held .", "PERSON and PERSON , as well as PERSON and PERSON , were each fined MONEY ( ORG ) for not sending their children to school during the aforementioned period . ORG upheld the fines imposed in the case of the ORG couple by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE and in the case of the PERSON couple by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , holding that to keep the children off school without having been granted the necessary exemption by the school \u2019s principal had not been justified .", "In its judgment of DATE the court held that the GPE right to educate their children and their right to freedom of religion was restricted by the ORG \u2019s mandate to provide for education , which was implemented by means of compulsory schooling . The neutral transmission of knowledge regarding reproduction , contraception and so forth in school did not prevent the parents from conveying their moral values to their children and did not infringe the personal rights of the children .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court further specified that the lessons had been held in accordance with the underlying legal provisions and the ensuing guidelines and the curriculum , which had been based on current scientific and educational standards . The same was true for the teaching materials used , which had delicately introduced the subject of sexuality and childbirth to the reader and which had helped to counteract any possible sense of shame . Sexual education for the concerned age group was necessary with a view to enabling children to deal critically with influences from the society , instead of avoiding them and being isolated . The court specified that in any event the applicants had not been entitled to prevent their children from attending mandatory lessons but could have used legal means to obtain an exemption for the children from the lessons at issue by , for instance , lodging a request for interim measures with the competent administrative courts .", "ORG dismissed appeals on points of law subsequently brought against the above judgments by a decision of CARDINAL DATE with respect to the ORG couple and by a decision of CARDINAL DATE with respect to the PERSON couple . ORG found that it was established case - law that compulsory schooling constituted an admissible restriction of GPE rights to freedom of religion and to educate their children . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stressed in addition that the ORG \u2019s mandate to provide education was not limited to the transmission of knowledge but also aimed at educating responsible and emancipated citizens capable of participating in the democratic processes of a pluralistic society with a view , in particular , to integrating minorities and avoiding the formation of religiously or ideologically motivated \u201c parallel societies \u201d .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively ORG refused to admit the related constitutional complaints without providing reasons .", "On DATE PERSON and PERSON also kept CARDINAL of their daughters , who was born in DATE , off school , as the theatre workshop \u201c My body is mine \u201d was running on DATE . They also prevented her from attending accompanying sexual education classes in DATE . They argued that , while they were not opposed to sexual education in school in general , they regarded the particular curriculum used as being harmful to the moral development of their daughter . They were fined EUR CARDINAL each .", "ORG upheld the fines by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It held that the transmission of knowledge in the field of sexual violence and abuse with a view to providing children with tools to find help in difficult situations also fell within the educational mandate of the ORG and that the religious motives cited by the parents did not constitute sufficient justification to prevent the child \u2019s school attendance . It further found that the fine of ORG CARDINAL had been justified in view of the previous conviction of the couple by the court \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law brought by the couple by a decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit their subsequent constitutional complaint without providing reasons .", "On CARDINAL and DATE PERSON and PERSON prevented CARDINAL of their children , and PERSON and PERSON prevented CARDINAL of their children , who would have been in the envisaged age group , from attending the school theatre workshop \u201c My body is mine \u201d . They stated that it was incompatible with their religious convictions to make a child \u2019s own feelings and will the basis of his or her sexual behaviour , as this would encourage them to act according to their sexual desire like an adult , lose their sense of shame and engage in sexual acts with adults . The biblical doctrine of chastity , limiting sexuality to matrimony , constituted sufficient protection against sexual abuse and there was no scientific proof that the theatre workshop had a preventive effect in this respect .", "On DATE , each of PERSON and PERSON and PERSON and PERSON further prevented CARDINAL of their respective children from attending the school carnival celebrations on the grounds that they were inconsistent with their religious and moral beliefs and the religious education they provided to their children . They stated that , in their opinion , the \u201c PERSON \u201d carnival was a NORP festivity which was directed by carnal desire and accompanied by immoral and uninhibited behaviour . They claimed that they had not been aware that their children would have had the alternative opportunity to attend swimming lessons and that they had not sent their children to school in order that the children not be exposed to the carnival celebrations in the classroom or the gym . Compulsory attendance at such an event constituted a violation of their freedom of conscience and religion , as well as their right to educate their children .", "Each of ORG , PERSON and PERSON were fined LAW and PERSON and PERSON were both fined ORG CARDINAL by the school authorities for not sending their children to the mandatory school events without having obtained prior exemption from the school principal .", "ORG upheld the fines by separate judgments of DATE in respect of each of the CARDINAL couples .", "Concerning the school theatre workshop , it found that the GPE constitutionally guaranteed right to educate their children in accordance with their religious and moral beliefs and their children \u2019s right to freely determine their attitude towards sexual matters were on an equal footing with \u2013 and restricted by DATE the ORG \u2019s mandate to provide for school education . While the ORG could pursue its own educational goals , it had to be neutral and tolerant towards the GPE views and refrain from systematic political , ideological or moral manipulation . As regards sexual education in school , the school authorities had had to take into account the children \u2019s natural sense of shame and had been required to consider the GPE related moral and religious beliefs . The court was of the opinion that the school theatre workshop in the case at hand had been solely aimed at raising awareness regarding the subject of sexual abuse , which was undeniably a matter where there was a need for action by the ORG in order to protect children at an early stage . The school event had not promoted or rejected specific sexual behaviour and had not put into question any sexual doctrine based on the applicants\u2019 religious beliefs .", "As regards the carnival celebrations , the court found that , as they had not been accompanied by any religious activities and their sole purpose had been that the pupils could celebrate together until TIME lessons , the ORG \u2019s duty of neutrality and tolerance had been observed . Furthermore , the children had had the opportunity to attend alternative events and their parents must have been aware of that alternative , which had also showed that the school authorities had tried to accommodate the religious and moral beliefs of the several children belonging to the GPE faith in the local primary school to the extent possible , bearing in mind the proper functioning of the school system .", "ORG dismissed appeals on points of law lodged by each of the couples . It did so by decisions of CARDINAL DATE with respect to PERSON and PERSON and PERSON and PERSON and by CARDINAL decisions of DATE it dismissed related complaints by the CARDINAL couples of a violation of their right to be heard .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by PERSON and PERSON against ORG judgment of DATE . ORG decision was served on their counsel on DATE .", "On DATE ORG , by a reasoned decision , refused to admit a constitutional complaint lodged by PERSON and PERSON against the above - mentioned decisions rendered in their respect . ORG reiterated that the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of religion in conjunction with the right of parents to care for and educate their children comprised the GPE right to impart their religious and moral beliefs to their children and protect them from diverging opinions . However , the LAW also called on the ORG to provide school education , a mandate that was implemented by means of compulsory schooling , which therefore constituted an admissible restriction of the GPE right to educate their children . While the ORG had the right to pursue its own educational goals , it was nevertheless under an obligation to act in a neutral and tolerant manner vis - \u00e0 - vis the educational views of parents . The ORG had to refrain from measures aiming at systematic manipulation in respect of specific political or ideological concepts and from identifying itself with a particular belief or ideology in order not to jeopardise religious peace in society .", "ORG found that the decisions of the domestic courts in the case at hand had complied with these principles . ORG had correctly assessed that the school theatre workshop , raising the children \u2019s awareness of possible sexual abuse and presenting ways of preventing it , had not infringed the school authorities\u2019 obligation of neutrality . The workshop would not have put into question the GPE sexual education based on their religious convictions , as the children would not have been influenced to approve of or reject specific sexual behaviour . The ORG allegations that the theatre workshop promoted \u201c free sexuality \u201d for children or constituted grooming of the children for paedophilia had neither been supported by the facts as established by the lower courts nor by the content of the teaching materials used for the theatre workshop . In the light of these considerations , there was nothing to establish that the lower courts had misjudged the scope of the GPE right to freedom of religion and to educate their children according to their religious and moral beliefs .", "ORG further held that ORG finding that the \u201c PERSON \u201d carnival event had not infringed the ORG \u2019s obligation of neutrality was unobjectionable , taking into account that the event had not been connected with religious acts and that the children had been under no obligation to dress up or wear costumes or actively participate in the celebrations . The same was true for ORG finding that the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of religion and their right to educate their children had not required that the school authorities prevent the applicants\u2019 children from witnessing the other ORG . Such tension between the religious convictions of a minority and the conflicting traditions of the majority resulting from school attendance were acceptable as a matter of principle . This was even more obvious where , as in the case at hand , the school authorities had attempted to strike a balance between the GPE constitutional rights and the ORG \u2019s mandate to provide education by offering alternative events .", "By a decision of the same date , ORG also refused to admit a constitutional complaint lodged by PERSON and PERSON without providing reasons . The decisions were not posted to the claimants before CARDINAL DATE .", "In view of ORG decisions with respect to their relatives , PERSON and PERSON refrained from lodging a constitutional complaint .", "It appears that on subsequent occasions in following school terms , the CARDINAL PERSON couples continued to prevent those of their children who were subject to CARDINAL or the other of the aforementioned compulsory sexual education modules or school events from attending them . The parents were subject to ever increasing fines , which they deemed to be unlawful and refused to pay . As attempts by the domestic authorities to enforce payment were to no avail , the parents were each sentenced to imprisonment in lieu of payment for up to DATE .", "For instance , by separate decisions of ORG of DATE , PERSON was sentenced to a fine of ORG CARDINAL and PERSON to a fine of EUR CARDINAL for not sending several of their children to compulsory school events on repeated occasions . Following fruitless attempts to enforce payment of such fines , an application by the public prosecutor to impose a prison sentence of DATE with respect to PERSON and DATE with respect to PERSON was granted by separate decisions of ORG on DATE .", "PERSON subsequent appeal was dismissed by a decision of ORG on CARDINAL DATE . The court held that the applicant \u2019s imprisonment had been lawful and had not been disproportionate . It emphasised that the applicant had initially been fined and that imprisonment had not been a sanction for the administrative offence on which the fine had been based but solely a means to enforce the applicant \u2019s payment obligation . The question of whether the imposition of the underlying fine had been lawful was not the subject of the proceedings regarding the prison sentence . ORG further held that the length of the sentence imposed had been in line with ORG practice and had thus been proportionate .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed an appeal brought by PERSON against the imprisonment order with similar reasoning . However , when comparing the length of the sentence imposed with previous sentences imposed by ORG for unpaid fines ( such as DATE for a fine of LAW and forty days for a fine in the amount of ORG MONEY ) , the court found that the sentence of DATE handed down to PERSON had been excessive and reduced it to DATE .", "No further court decisions with respect to imprisonment orders relating to other members of the PERSON family were submitted to the ORG . However , according to information submitted by the ORG counsel , similar sentences were imposed on all of the parents . It appears that PERSON served a prison sentence from CARDINAL DATE to CARDINAL DATE and that his wife PERSON was sentenced by a decision of ORG on DATE to a prison sentence of DATE for non - payment of a fine in the amount of ORG CARDINAL , service of which sentence commenced on an unknown date in DATE . Her request for immediate release from prison lodged with ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG on the grounds that , in particular , the length of her prison sentence had been disproportionate in breach of LAW and had caused irreparable damage to her family life as protected by LAW , was rejected by the President of the Fifth Section on DATE .", "It further appears that similar prison sentences imposed on PERSON and PERSON were adjourned because of PERSON being pregnant and PERSON nursing a newborn child .", "Pursuant to LAW , freedom of religion shall be inviolable and its undisturbed practice shall be guaranteed .", "While DATE ( CARDINAL ) of LAW acknowledges that the care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them , its LAW stipulates that the entire school system shall be under the supervision of the state . LAW CARDINAL guarantees , inter alia , the right to establish private schools . Private schools that serve as alternatives to state schools shall require the approval of the state and shall be subject to the laws of the L\u00e4nder . Paragraph CARDINAL states that private primary schools shall be approved only if the educational authority finds that the school serves a special educational interest or if , on the application of parents or guardians , it is to be established as a denominational or interdenominational school or as a school based on a particular philosophy and no state primary school of that type exists in the municipality .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW of the Federal Land of GPE ( Schulgesetz NRW ) , sexual education in school complements sexual education by a child \u2019s parents . Its aim is to provide pupils with knowledge of biological , ethical , social and cultural aspects of sexuality according to their age and maturity in order to enable them to develop their own moral views and an independent approach towards their own sexuality . Sexual education should encourage tolerance between human beings irrespective of their sexual orientation and identity . Paragraph CARDINAL of the said provision stipulates that parents have to be informed in due course of the purpose and content of school sexual education .", "Primary schooling in GPE comprises DATE . Pursuant to GPE and LAW of the Federal Land of GPE ( ORG ) , compulsory primary schooling starts at DATE and applies to all children having their residence in GPE . Children are obliged to regularly attend classes and all other mandatory school events and parents are responsible for ensuring regular attendance by their children . At the request of a child \u2019s parents , a school \u2019s principal may exempt pupils from certain classes or school events in the event that important reasons justify such exemption ( sections GPE ) , CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , PERSON ) , PERSON ) , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . Failure by the parents to ensure their children \u2019s attendance constitutes an administrative offence which may result in the imposition of a fine ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , fines may range from ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL depending on the nature of the offence . Section CARDINAL of the said LAW specifies that in the event of several fines each of them shall be determined separately . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the same LAW , the competent court may order arrest to enforce the payment of a fine in the event that : ( i ) the amount has not been paid within DATE following entry into force of the decision by which it was imposed ; ( ii ) it has not been established that the debtor is unable to pay ; and provided that ( iii ) the debtor has been informed of the possibility of his arrest . The duration of the arrest in lieu of payment may not exceed DATE and in the event of several fines imposed by CARDINAL decision it may not exceed a period of DATE .
