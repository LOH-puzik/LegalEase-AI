The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agents , PERSON and PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 mother owned a building and a plot of land of QUANTITY in GPE . The property was expropriated in DATE , against the payment of monetary compensation of CARDINAL old NORP levs ( ORG ) . Initially , the plot was designated for the creation of a public garden and in DATE it was allocated for the construction of a street . However , none of these projects took shape . In DATE the municipal authorities rented the property to ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the adoption of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicants requested the mayor of GPE to quash the expropriation order and restore their property rights to the plot of land and the building on it . On an unspecified date the mayor rejected their request , reasoning that the building previously owned by the ORG mother had been pulled down and that a new building used as a church had been erected in its place , and that the area around this new building had been developed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought judicial review of the above decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG set aside the mayor \u2019s decision and quashed the DATE expropriation order , finding that the preconditions for restitution under LAW had been met . None of the projects for which the property had been taken , namely the creation of a public garden and the construction of a street , had been pursued . The domestic court noted in addition that the expropriated building existed and , in so far as in DATE it had been reconstructed to serve as a church , such reconstruction had not been envisaged by the respective urban development plans .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicants paid back the sum received in compensation at the time of expropriation , to allow the quashing of the expropriation order to take effect . As a result of inflation and the depreciation of NORP currency , at that time the sum represented about MONEY ( DEM ) . On DATE the mayor of GPE ordered the strike out of the plot of land from the register of municipal properties , in accordance with the decision of ORG , but refused to do so in regard of the \u201c building erected by permission no . CARDINAL of DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were thus unable to take possession of the property , which continued to be occupied by ORG of GPE . On DATE , the applicants brought a rei vindicatio action against the ORG . Initially the claim was also directed against ORG in GPE ; however , subsequently the proceedings in respect of it were dropped .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings , ORG ( and , in the beginning , ORG ) argued that the preconditions for restitution had not been met , in particular because the building formerly owned by the applicants\u2019 mother had been demolished as it had been entirely \u201c worn out \u201d , and the ORG had built a completely new and bigger building , through donations from its parish and according to the approved construction plans . In order to establish these facts , the ORG presented plans and called witnesses . Still , the ORG conceded that the land and the building it was using were municipallyowned and that it rented the property . In the event that the courts would find that the property was to be returned to the applicants , the ORG claimed that the applicants had to be ordered to reimburse the cost of the improvements made by it , and requested to be allowed to retain the property until payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , which examined the case at first instance , allowed a request by ORG of GPE for the GPE municipality to be joined to the proceedings as a third party . The municipality also argued in the course of the proceedings that the building claimed by the applicants was a new one , which meant that the preconditions for its restitution were not satisfied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the ORG claims , finding , first , that they were the owners of the plot of land on the strength of the decision of CARDINAL DATE , and , second , that they were also the owners of the new building , which had been erected without the requisite re - allocation of the plot for that purpose and all necessary authorisations , and property to which had to follow property to the land . It found further that the defendant church was occupying the property without any valid legal basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment and remitted the case to ORG , which once again allowed the ORG claim in a judgment of DATE . Again , it found that the applicants were the owners of the land and the building and that , after the restitution , the defendant church was occupying them without any legal basis .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the defendant church , on DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment and allowed the ORG claim in part . It found that in DATE , when it had been rented out to the defendant church , the building taken from the ORG mother had been pulled down and a much bigger , entirely new building had been built ; it had become the property of the ORG , later of the municipality . It was irrelevant under LAW whether the new building \u2019s construction had been duly authorised or not . Accordingly , the new building , the land on which it was standing , and the necessary adjoining land , totalling QUANTITY , could not be subject to restitution . On the other hand , the applicants\u2019 property rights had been validly restored in respect of QUANTITY of the land and the defendant church had to vacate that part of the property .", "CARDINAL . As to the decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG noted that \u201c it did not have res judicata effect as regards the property dispute \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed their appeal . It confirmed ORG finding that the building claimed by the applicants was not the CARDINAL taken from their mother , but a new one , erected in DATE and thus not subject to restitution . It held in addition as follows :", "\u201c The main issue in the case , as raised in the appeal on points of law is : what is the significance for the legal dispute of the [ decision of DATE ] ? ORG finds that ORG was right to reach the conclusion that the decision at issue had been given in administrative proceedings concerning the revocation of the expropriation . It does not have res judicata effect in respect of the dispute concerning the ownership of the property at issue ... Of course , in the present litigation the court is obliged , on the basis of the evidence presented , to establish all the circumstances related to the alleged property rights disputed by the parties . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
