The applicant denied having any affiliation with the illegal organisation and contested the accuracy of the evidence presented to him . He maintained that he had assisted certain members of ORG as a lawyer and that he always acted within the limits of his profession , without directing those people \u2019s submissions as alleged . He further maintained that certain information in the illegal organisation \u2019s background report , such as the ages of his siblings , was wrong and that this in itself proved that he had not provided the information . He did not benefit from the assistance of a lawyer during questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave statements before the investigating judge of ORG , this time together with his business partner , who was accused of being a member of the same illegal organisation . He reiterated his submissions given to the public prosecutor and added that the fact that he had provided legal assistance to some members of the illegal organisation might have been perceived as a demonstration of support by certain people .

The court held that the applicant should be released pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following statements made by a certain ORG , the public prosecutor drew up another bill of indictment against the applicant , once again accusing him of membership of an illegal organisation .

In that connection , he referred to the statements of a certain GPE , who had maintained before both the police and the public prosecutor that the applicant had been a recruiter for the illegal organisation , had given courses to new members and had been in charge of certain cells .

The applicant \u2019s lawyer further challenged the credibility of these two ORG statements . In that connection , he argued that ORG had not repeated his police statements against the applicant at a later point as alleged by the public prosecutor in his written opinion . The lawyer further noted that ORG had claimed to have taken courses run by the applicant until the latter started his military service and asked the trial court to obtain information as regards the dates the applicant had served in the army in order to prove that those allegations were not credible .", "CARDINAL .
