He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant deposited an amount of MONEY ( hereafter \u201c the USD \u201d ) in cash with Mr Nevmerzhytsky , who at the relevant time was the Head of the GPE office of ORG ( hereafter \u201c the Bank \u201d ) . PERSON issued a receipt for this money , in which he undertook to repay it immediately on the applicant \u2019s demand . The receipt was countersigned by the applicant and CARDINAL witnesses .", "On DATE , in the course of an ongoing preliminary criminal inquiry , the premises of the ORG were searched by the police and an amount of ORG in cash was seized which had been stored underneath the table of an employee .", "On DATE ORG of ORG of ORG of GPE in GPE began a criminal investigation into allegations of illegal currency transactions that had allegedly been committed by PERSON . Subsequently this charge was dropped and he was charged with financial fraud , forgery committed by an official , aggravated forgery , abuse of power , tax evasion , aggravated fictitious trading and aiding and abetting the concealment of the proceeds of currency sales ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) .", "On DATE a police investigator ordered that the money seized at the premises of the ORG be attached to the file in the criminal case against PERSON and be used in the subsequent trial as real evidence .", "On DATE the applicant was put on the list of wanted persons for his alleged involvement in illegal currency transactions . On DATE he was apprehended by the police . On DATE the applicant was formally charged with engaging in illegal currency transactions .", "On DATE the investigator discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant , holding that there was no evidence that the applicant had been aware of the fact that Mr Nevmerzhytsky had conducted illegal financial transactions .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a civil - party application in the context of the criminal case against PERSON , asserting his rights to the money seized at the bank in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "On DATE the investigator dealing with case against Mr Nevmerzhytsky , allowed the applicant to join the proceedings as a civil claimant . In his decision the investigator stated , inter alia , that the applicant had a valid claim for part of the money seized at the premises of the ORG .", "During the trial proceedings against PERSON , which started in DATE and continued , with several interruptions ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) , until DATE , the applicant was heard as a witness . He stated that on several occasions in DATE and DATE he had deposited cash with the defendant , including the amount USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL , handed over on DATE .", "On DATE ORG convicted PERSON of repeated financial fraud , acts in preparation of financial fraud , forgery committed by an official , aggravated forgery and abuse of power . It sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , and ordered the confiscation of all his personal property . The trial court acquitted him of the offences of aiding and abetting the concealment of the proceeds of currency sales , tax evasion and aggravated fictitious trading . ORG also ordered the amount of ORG forfeited to the ORG as its rightful owner had not been established during the hearings .", "On DATE ORG issued a separate ruling , noting that the investigating authorities had permitted the applicant to join the proceedings as a civil claimant on the ground that in DATE and DATE he had deposited substantial amounts in cash with PERSON . However , the applicant could not be a party to the criminal proceedings as the authorities had failed to verify the source of this money and the lawfulness thereof . ORG suggested that the investigating authorities should reconsider their decision of DATE to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant . There is no indication that the criminal investigation against the applicant was ever reopened .", "On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against the judgment of DATE , stating that ORG had unfairly denied him access to the proceedings in his capacity as civil claimant . The applicant further complained that the trial court had unreasonably ordered the forfeiture of the cash seized at the LOC of the ORG , as the major part of this money belonged to him .", "Pursuant to LAW , the applicant \u2019s appeal in cassation was handed over to ORG , which examined its compliance with the relevant procedural requirements ( see the relevant domestic law below ) . On DATE this court declared the appeal inadmissible as the applicant was not a party to the criminal trial and therefore not entitled to appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant challenged this decision before ORG .", "On DATE ORG , following a hearing held in presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer , upheld ORG finding that the applicant was not a civil party to the criminal proceedings against PERSON and was therefore not entitled to file an appeal against the judgment of DATE . ORG stated , inter alia , that the amount of cash seized during the search differed from that deposited by the applicant with PERSON on DATE and that the seized cash did not have any features that would permit to identify it as that belonging to the applicant . Moreover , it was highly improbable that such a significant sum of money would be stored for DATE ( from DATE ) by the bank employees in the counter hall underneath a table .", "CARDINAL .
