In addition , no diagnostic imaging of the abdomen ( diagnostyka obrazowa jamy brzusznej ) was performed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Y \u2019s condition deteriorated . She was transferred to ORG .

She maintained that Y had not requested to leave the hospital , but had been sent home .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that during her daughter \u2019s stay in the surgical department of ORG the head of that department commented that \u201c it is absurd to spend DATE treating an abscess . [ Y ] is too busy with her bottom , instead of taking care of something else \u201d , referring to the pregnancy .

The applicant submitted that the doctor had stated that \u201c my conscience does not allow me \u201d , but had not formalised his objection or directed Y to another doctor .", "CARDINAL . The Government argued that during the investigation instituted by ORG in ORG it had been established that none of the doctors at ORG had based their refusal to perform a full endoscopy on a \u201c conscience clause \u201d ( klauzula sumienia ) . The decision not to perform a full endoscopy was taken because there were no medical grounds for such an examination , and not because of Y \u2019s pregnancy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked ORG to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s daughter \u2019s death . The lawyer submitted medical charts from CARDINAL hospitals and asked the prosecutor to obtain full medical documentation . The applicant was questioned by the prosecutor on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution requested the Collegium PERSON in GPE and ORG in ORG to issue an opinion as to whether an exhumation would be possible in Y \u2019s case . Both universities replied that an exhumation of Y \u2019s body would not have enabled an opinion to be given on the cause of her death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor opened an investigation of possible unintentional homicide of the applicant \u2019s daughter ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor decided to appoint an expert from ORG of the Collegium PERSON in GPE , to evaluate the treatment provided to the patient , and to establish whether there was a direct causal link between any irregularities in ORG treatment and her death . However , PERSON informed the prosecutor that no autopsy was carried out following the applicant \u2019s daughter \u2019s death , and that exhumation of her body at a later stage would not have enabled an opinion to be given on the cause of death . A similar opinion was issued by ORG in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in Gda\u0144sk , on DATE ORG in GPE , and on DATE ORG in GPE refused to provide an opinion in LOC case due to their workload in other cases and lack of staff .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the Minister of Health convened a special expert committee to investigate ORG treatment and the circumstances of her death . The aim of the committee was to inquire in respect of all the hospitals involved in ORG treatment as regards their organisation and methods of treatment and the availability of those methods . On DATE the committee concluded that the death had been directly caused by sepsis . The committee noted however , that during ORG stay in ORG , despite her history of inflammatory bowel disease the doctors failed to perform a diagnostic imaging test on her abdomen . In addition , an earlier diagnosis of sepsis and the establishment of its original cause in ORG ( most probably PERSON - Crohn disease ) and a possible decision about surgical treatment would have had an impact on ORG \u2019s situation . The committee \u2019s report was signed by several national consultants in various fields of health care . CARDINAL members of the committee , who were not medical experts , did not sign the report : professor of criminal law GPE , and GPE , the head of an NGO working in the field of reproductive rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office asked national consultants in gastroenterology , gynaecology and vascular surgery to submit opinions on ORG treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert gastroenterologist stated in her opinion that the original cause of sepsis could not be determined due to the fact that an autopsy had not been performed on Y \u2019s body .", "CARDINAL . The investigation of the death of the applicant \u2019s daughter was extended several times . It was then suspended , on DATE . The prosecutor referred to the need to obtain expert opinions and the fact that the waiting time for such opinions was DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Altogether the prosecution obtained opinions from CARDINAL medical experts . The experts were subsequently heard by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . During the investigation , there were several changes of prosecutor : CARDINAL prosecutors handled the investigation at different stages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , an expert gastroenterologist , considered it surprising that Y had not undergone an ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen . He further stressed that she could have had an MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) to determine the cause of the abscess . Lastly , an autopsy would have allowed the original cause of the sepsis to be determined . In an additional opinion of DATE PERSON considered that in both hospitals , Pi\u0142a and PERSON , the doctors failed to do an MRI . However , he stressed that the lack of adequate examination in LOC case should be treated not as medical malpractice but as lack of due diligence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG resumed and discontinued the investigation . The prosecutor concluded that on the basis of the experts\u2019 opinions there was no ground for any doubts or objections as to the treatment received by the applicant \u2019s daughter . Failure to conduct an MRI should be considered a lack of due diligence and not medical malpractice . It could no longer be said that an earlier operation would have saved Y \u2019s life . Consequently , no direct link had been established between the treatment and the death of the applicant \u2019s daughter .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision . The court referred to the complicated nature of the case and the fact that no autopsy was performed , and therefore it was impossible to establish whether Y suffered from PERSON disease . The court considered that there were no grounds for continuation of the investigation of ORG death .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that the prosecutor had not obtained the necessary information , such as full medical records , to assist experts in forming their opinions . The ORG maintained that the prosecutor had obtained full medical records from all the hospitals attended by the applicant \u2019s daughter in GPE , ORG and FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also stated that the prosecutor had the applicant \u2019s daughter . The ORG argued that the prosecutor had examined the issue of colonoscopy and the investigation had been focused on Y \u2019s cause of death : in particular , on the question whether her treatment had been adequate to the diagnosis and whether further tests , such as a full endoscopy and a diagnostic imaging test , could have prevented ORG death .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that the CARDINAL members of the special expert committee ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) who had not signed the report of DATE had not been allowed to participate in the committee \u2019s discussions and therefore did not have access to the medical files . The Government disagreed . They drew the ORG \u2019s attention to the fact that all the medical specialists had signed the report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Agent for Disciplinary Matters ( Okregowy PERSON ) ( \u201c Disciplinary Agent \u201d ) instituted disciplinary proceedings against the doctors who had treated PERSON After consulting several experts and hearing witnesses , he concluded that there was no evidence of medical malpractice .

There is no indication in the medical files of ORG stay in ORG ( CARDINAL May-CARDINAL DATE ) that she had given permission for third parties to have access to these files . For these reasons , in DATE the hospital refused the applicant access to the medical files", "CARDINAL . Medical files of ORG stay in ORG ( DATE to DATE and DATE ) indicate that Y specified that the applicant was entitled to obtain documentation on her stay in the hospital . The hospital granted access to these files to ORG ( on DATE and CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) and to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Medical files in ORG do not indicate that Y allowed third - party access to her medical files . For this reason the hospital refused the applicant access to these files .", "CARDINAL . The ORG maintained that the applicant had not requested the NORP hospital to give her access to Y \u2019s files . The applicant disagreed . She submitted , without specifying any details , that she had twice asked the hospital for these files but had not been granted access .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that on DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office requested the relevant hospitals to provide files on ORG \u2019s treatment .
