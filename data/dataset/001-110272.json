Although the applicant was not present , he was represented by senior counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was refused leave to appeal against the confiscation order . In DATE the full court of ORG refused the applicant \u2019s renewed application for leave to appeal against the confiscation order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an enforcement and receivership order was made against the applicant in order to seek to recover the sums specified in the compensation order , as only GBP CARDINAL had been recovered by the Official Receiver .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a request to ORG for the applicant \u2019s extradition , pursuant to LAW DATE ( \u201c the ECE \u201d ) , as a convicted person and as an accused person . The request was made on the basis that the applicant had been convicted of conspiracy and money laundering offences and was accused of an offence of escape from lawful custody .", "CARDINAL . An accompanying witness statement by a Revenue and ORG set out the offences of which the applicant had been convicted , together with the relevant law . It noted that the applicant \u2019s return was sought in order to serve the remainder of the sentence of DATE imprisonment imposed on him . It referred to the confiscation order and concluded :", "\u201c ... It is established law that a default sentence so imposed constitutes part of the overall penalty . [ The applicant \u2019s ] return to GPE is therefore sought in respect of any activation of the default sentence which may become necessary . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

By diplomatic note of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , ORG in GPE enclosed the response of Her ORG Revenue and ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The response was in the following terms :", "\u201c It is important to make clear that there is no charge , in existence or proposed , for evasion or non - payment of the order . The extradition of PERSON is not sought in respect of non - payment of the confiscation order which was made against him ; it is sought in respect of one charge of escape from lawful custody and to finish serving the term of imprisonment passed on him in respect of the offence of conspiracy to cheat .", "The confiscation order was part of the sentence passed on PERSON . The effect of the relevant legislation is that such orders are treated in the same way as fines . When a ORG imposes a fine on any person , they may allow that person time to pay the fine but they must make an order fixing a term of imprisonment which that person must serve as a last resort if the sum they owe has not been paid or recovered . The confiscation order in this case was made on DATE , the judge allowed PERSON time to pay until DATE , and set a term of imprisonment in default of DATE . The order remains outstanding and this office has been taking steps to enforce it .", "Activation of a default sentence is CARDINAL of the many means available to the court to enforce outstanding orders . The court can initiate activation of its own volition or the prosecutor can invite the court to do so . Before activating the default sentence , judges are under a duty to enquire into the defendant \u2019s proposals for payment and to determine whether any of the other methods of enforcement might be effective . [ The applicant ] would have the opportunity to make representations throughout this process . [ The applicant ] still has the option to pay the confiscation order at any time and if his assets are insufficient to meet the confiscation order he may apply to ORG for a certificate of inadequacy . If CARDINAL is granted , he may then apply to ORG to reduce the amount of the confiscation order ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued its decision on extradition . The decision noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG requested the arrest and extradition of the party concerned to serve the remainder of a prison sentence of DATE handed down by ORG on DATE for fraud and money laundering .", "CARDINAL . In a diplomatic note of DATE , ORG in GPE requested the extradition of the party concerned . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In a diplomatic note of CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the ORG [ ORG ] that the extradition of the party concerned was not being requested for non - payment of the amount of the confiscation ordered by way of the decision of DATE of ORG , but was being requested for the absconding . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision noted that for extradition to be ordered , the offence for which it was sought had to be an offence in both countries . As regards the offence for which the DATE sentence was imposed , ORG considered in some detail the facts behind the offence . It noted the applicant \u2019s objection that the request for extradition was not clear regarding whether it was also requested for the offence of absconding and for non - payment of the amount confiscated which were not punishable under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . ORG ruled that since LAW did not punish a person who absconded , the extradition would not be granted for the act of absconding . It noted that the extradition was not requested for the non - payment of the confiscation order and that there was no need to ask the NORP authorities to give any guarantees , as nothing suggested that they would not adhere to the rule that a person could only be tried for the offence for which he had been extradited .", "CARDINAL . It granted the extradition for the acts described in the extradition request of ORG of DATE and its additional documents of DATE and DATE , excluding the acts of absconding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . It summarised the facts of the case , and noted that ORG had declared that extradition was only being sought for the acts of absconding , and not for non - payment of the confiscation order .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicant \u2019s criticism of the decision of ORG for failing to exclude extradition for the purpose of initiating proceedings regarding the non - payment of the confiscation order , the court noted that the NORP authorities had expressly stated that extradition was not requested for non - payment of the amount in the confiscation order and held that this statement was sufficiently clear and appropriate for the purposes of removing the applicant \u2019s doubts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . On DATE ORG ruled that the appeal was inadmissible . In its judgment , it summarised the findings of ORG :", "\u201c ... The applicant authority had clearly waived the right to apply for extradition for the sentence relating to non - payment of the confiscation [ order ] ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was extradited to GPE and returned to prison to complete his sentence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the ORG applied to ORG to enforce the DATE term of imprisonment imposed on the applicant in default of payment of the confiscation order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG sent an email to ORG stating that this would amount to a violation of the rule of specialty .", "CARDINAL .

The request for extradition in respect of the latter offence was refused .

This decision appears to be made on a misunderstanding of the requesting ORG \u2019s position as is set out in the documents provided to ORG in support of the extradition request . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Referring to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG explained that the sentence for the extradition offence was made up of CARDINAL component , and covered the prison sentence for the wrongdoing , the financial penalty in the confiscation order and the custodial penalty that flowed from the non - payment . The letter concluded :", "\u201c I take this opportunity to assure the Government of ORG that the GPE is committed to its international obligations and has no intention of dishonouring the principle of specialty .", "However , for reasons which I trust are apparent from what is set out herein , imposition of the default sentence in these circumstances can not be considered to be a breach of the GPE \u2019s specialty obligations , either as set out in the ORG or in GPE domestic legislation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to ORG indicating that if the GPE authorities intended to ask for the extension of the extradition to include the non - payment of the confiscation order , they would have to proceed in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG application to enforce the default term came before ORG . The applicant argued that the proceedings were barred by the rule of specialty , which restricts prosecution or punishment of an extradited person to the offence for which extradition was granted . The District Judge considered the applicant \u2019s claim to be arguable but was of the view that only ORG had jurisdiction to consider an abuse of process argument . He therefore adjourned the proceedings to allow the parties to bring judicial review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim for judicial review seeking an order that the District Judge be prohibited from proceeding to examine ORG application because the proceedings were an abuse of process ; and an order that the District Judge be prohibited from proceeding to examine ORG application because it constituted a breach of section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged a claim for judicial review seeking , inter alia , a declaration that the application to enforce the default term did not constitute an abuse of process and a declaration that the application to enforce the default term did not constitute a breach of section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted leave in respect of ORG application . The CARDINAL claims were later joined and consideration of the applicant \u2019s request for leave was adjourned for consideration by the full court at the substantive hearing in ORG claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place in both claims . The court heard argument from counsel for both parties . At the conclusion of the hearing , ORG granted ORG application for judicial review , refused the applicant \u2019s application for permission to apply for judicial review and indicated that it would hand down a reasoned judgment in due course .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG resumed the hearing of ORG application . LOC ordered the applicant to serve the DATE term .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down its reasoned judgment in the judicial review claims . It noted that this was not a case where it was being suggested that there had been \u201c a deliberate abuse \u201d of the extradition proceedings or that the NORP authorities were deliberately misled or that the extradition proceedings were improperly manipulated .", "CARDINAL . The court held that it was entirely satisfied that the default term formed part of the original sentence , since it was an integral part of the confiscation order which , it was common ground , was unarguably part of the original sentence . It considered the argument that enforcement of the default term involved proving the commission of a further separate offence to be wholly artificial and had no hesitation in rejecting it .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s alternative argument that if the default term did form part of the original sentence and proceedings to enforce it were a process in which the applicant would be dealt with for the original offences , then there should be a mechanism for dealing with the express reservation of the NORP authorities , the court was again satisfied that there was no substance in this submission , and held that the NORP reservation was the result of their misunderstanding of the extent of GPE \u201c clearly expressed request \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court summarised the various exchanges between the NORP and NORP authorities prior to the applicant \u2019s extradition and agreed with counsel for ORG that the NORP diplomatic note of DATE , read as a whole , made it perfectly clear that extradition was not required in respect of any charge of non - payment of the confiscation order , since there was no such actual or proposed charge because the order in question formed part of the sentence imposed for the offences of which the applicant had been convicted and in respect of which his extradition was being sought . It continued :", "\u201c In other words , it was not necessary to seek extradition specifically for the non - payment because the confiscation order was merely part of the sentence for the offences for which he was to be extradited and was not a separate charge in its own right . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It concluded that the imposition of the default term would offend neither the rule of specialty in section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act nor under LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the argument that the enforcement of the default term constituted an abuse of process , the court found :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... In the light of our decision that there is no infringement of the rule of specialty in this case , we have come to the firm conclusion that there is no abuse of process involved in proceeding to enforce the default term against PERSON in the circumstances of this case , notwithstanding the misunderstanding of the position by the NORP authorities and their expressed reservation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It concluded that the decisions and comments of the NORP courts in respect of the default term for non - payment of the confiscation order were simply not binding on the courts of GPE and the rule of specialty had not been infringed . For the reasons given , the court was satisfied that GPE had not deliberately misled the NORP authorities , that it had always made its intentions clear and that there had been no improper or unfair manipulation of the processes of extradition or for the enforcement of the default term .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for certification of points of law of general public importance and for leave to appeal against the judgment of ORG . On DATE the court refused the applications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by letter to ORG , ORG reiterated :", "\u201c By means of the diplomatic note dated DATE , the ORG sent the ORG [ ORG and Police ] a letter from the NORP authorities showing that extradition was not required for the non - payment of the confiscation order . In accordance with this letter , this aspect has been withdrawn from the extradition proceedings and has not been dealt with in the decision . Therefore , extradition has not been granted for the non - payment of the confiscation order . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

He is currently in detention pursuant to the default term of imprisonment imposed in respect of the non - payment of the confiscation order .", "DATE . On DATE ORG in GPE forwarded a Diplomatic Note to ORG reiterating its contention that the activation of the default term did not violate the principle of specialty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG responded to the Note . It indicated that it disagreed with the interpretation of the NORP authorities and courts of the rule of specialty and reiterated that in its view subjecting the applicant to the default term of imprisonment violated that rule . It requested the NORP authorities either to request an extension of their extradition request pursuant to LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or to release the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) provided for the making of confiscation orders .

In the context of criminal law , a person may be required to pay a sum of money by way of a fine following conviction for a criminal offence . If the fine is unpaid , the party in default will receive an equivalent prison sentence , which extinguishes the fine .
