NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently serving a prison term in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , from ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , who was serving in ORG at the time of the incident , was leaving a bar in GPE when he saw a group of CARDINAL young people in the street outside the bar . Some of them got into a brawl with CARDINAL GPE men . The applicant ran towards them , brandished a knife and started waving it at the group . During the ensuing fight he stabbed and killed CARDINAL of the young people in the assembled group , the CARDINAL-year - old son of a politician . He also seriously injured another young man . Shortly afterwards , QUANTITY police officers arrived and arrested the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was tried for murder . His defence was that he had attempted to protect the GPE men who had been attacked by the group of young people . He also claimed that he had used his knife in self - defence when the group had become violent towards him . The prosecution maintained that the applicant had run into the group in a determined way in order to administer justice . By the time he had intervened , the attack on the GPE had come to an end and he had not been acting in self - defence when he had stabbed CARDINAL members of the group .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted of murder in DATE . The sentence was upheld on appeal and cassation . The applicant is currently serving a CARDINAL-year sentence in FAC . Both the case and the applicant have attracted significant public attention and extensive media coverage in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s close and extended family members \u2013 parents , siblings , grandparents , cousins , aunts and uncle \u2013 live in GPE ; he has no partner or children in GPE . Each journey between GPE and GPE for the CARDINAL-minute time slots allowed for visits involves substantial expense and absence from GPE for DATE . Because of such constraints , the applicant \u2019s parents have only managed to see him once DATE since he was imprisoned . Such visits have also become increasingly difficult for them with time . His grandparents are in DATE and so the journey to GPE has become almost impossible for them . A number of cousins and other close relatives , including an uncle and QUANTITY aunts to whom the applicant is very close , are unable to make the journey at all .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the information in the case file , it is clear that the applicant has been receiving regular visits in prison DATE from family members , friends and acquaintances ; in particular , he was visited CARDINAL times DATE and DATE ; CARDINAL of those visits were from family members . Visits have been authorised when requested , including during periods falling outside the standard prison visiting schedule . According to a psychological assessment , made in DATE and submitted by the NORP authorities , the applicant is socially and emotionally balanced and mature , with realistic self - esteem , a preserved sense of humour and no signs of depressive tendencies , stress or anxiety . He is the chairperson of ORG and is fluent in the NORP language , both orally and in writing . He displays leadership potential and strives to dominate in the prison community in which he is well integrated ; he is popular among other inmates , both foreigners and NORP , whom he is known to frequently assist with the drafting of their requests and/or complaints to the prison administration . He is housed in the wing for foreigners , assists foreign prisoners by interpreting between NORP and NORP when necessary , and has regular access to a computer room , for TIME a day , which makes it possible for him to pursue a distancelearning university course leading to a degree . The applicant actively corresponds in writing with family and friends .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the applicant \u2019s initiative , the NORP authorities contacted the NORP authorities about the possibility of transferring the applicant to GPE for him to continue to serve his sentence there . On DATE ORG replied in writing that the question of the applicant \u2019s transfer could only be considered once he had paid outstanding damages to the victims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a representative of the NORP Attorney General wrote to ORG , formally seeking ORG agreement to transfer the applicant under ORG on ORG of DATE ( the \u201c LAW \u201d , see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . The NORP authorities pointed out that the applicant met the eligibility conditions for the transfer of international prisoners and proposed a number of conditions in that respect . They included the following : that his transfer would not take place until his debts in GPE had been paid ; that the applicant would continue to serve his prison sentence in full in GPE and would become eligible for early release once he had served CARDINAL of it , this also being an option under NORP law ; that all reductions of the applicant \u2019s sentence confirmed by the NORP authorities would be reflected in the remaining sentence ; and that if the applicant benefitted from a conditional early release in GPE , he would be subject to parole conditions .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , sent via ORG , ORG informed the NORP Attorney General that the applicant \u2019s transfer had been refused . The letter emphasised that , having carefully considered the relevant provisions in LAW law , the prosecutor found that the conditions for transfer were not met . In particular , transfer was an option and not a mandatory consequence of a request made under LAW . The applicant still needed to serve over DATE of his CARDINAL-year sentence . Importantly , he had not shown remorse and had categorically been denying personal responsibility for the crime he had committed . In addition , he had expressed a negative and suspicious attitude towards the NORP justice system as a whole and had been demonstrating hostility and mistrust towards the orders issued by members of the prison administration . In view of the above and of the fact that he had only served a fraction of his sentence , the prosecutor found that the purpose of the punishment , including for the purposes of international law , namely to turn the convicted individual into a law - abiding citizen , had not been achieved .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG announced publicly the refusal to allow the transfer of the applicant to serve the remainder of his sentence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to ORG against the refusal to transfer him to GPE . In particular , he emphasised that the refusal was against the fundamental rationale behind LAW , which was to provide a possibility for GPE to cooperate towards achieving the purposes of justice and the social rehabilitation of convicted individuals . ORG declared the appeal inadmissible , finding that the Prosecutor \u2019s refusal to transfer the applicant was not an individual administrative act , given that the ORG was part of the judicial and not the executive branch of power .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . In a final decision of DATE , ORG held that the refusal of ORG was not amenable to review by the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL regulates the transfer of individuals who have been sentenced . ORG is the competent national authority to decide on requests for the transfer of foreigners convicted by a NORP court to their country of nationality in order to serve their sentence . ORG agrees such transfers with the relevant competent body of the administering State , after agreement by the prisoner in question .", "CARDINAL . A new provision in LAW , LAW , in force since DATE , provides a possibility for an individual serving a sentence of imprisonment to personally request conditional early release under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW if he or she has served CARDINAL of the prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . The Transfer Convention provides for a formal mechanism by which prisoners can be transferred from CARDINAL to another contracting ORG . Both member GPE and non - member ORG can accede to this LAW , which entered into force on DATE in respect of GPE and on DATE in respect of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Explanatory Report to LAW states in paragraph CARDINAL that the purpose of the Convention is :", "\u201c to facilitate the transfer of foreign prisoners to their home countries . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Parties undertake to afford each other the widest measure of co - operation in respect of the transfer of sentenced persons in accordance with the provisions of this Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP A person sentenced in the territory of a ORG may be transferred to the territory of another ORG , in accordance with the provisions of this Convention , in order to serve the sentence imposed on him . To that end , he may express his interest to the sentencing ORG or to the administering ORG in being transferred under this Convention . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL sets out various conditions which must be met in order for a person to be transferred . A sentenced person may be transferred only if he is a national of the administering State . Both the sentencing and the administering State must consent to the transfer .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , any sentenced person to whom LAW may apply shall be informed by the sentencing State of the substance of this LAW and if she or he expressed an interest in being transferred under this LAW , the sentencing ORG shall so inform the administering ORG as soon as practicable after the judgment becomes final ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
