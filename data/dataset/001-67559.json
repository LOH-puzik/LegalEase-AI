The applicants , PERSON and ORG , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE and live in GPE and GPE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were owners of a former company called PERSON ( hereinafter \u201c the applicants ' company \u201d ) , which was a claimant in civil proceedings initiated on DATE against another company called ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the GPE company \u201d ) . The proceedings concerned a dispute about the sale of movable property : the ORG company had refused to pay the applicants ' company the purchase price of an engine as they claimed , inter alia , that it did not contain all the components ordered .", "CARDINAL . The lawyer of the ORG company in the proceedings before ORG and in the lodging of an appeal with ORG on DATE was ORG , who was also at that time a judicial secretary ( hovioikeudenviskaali , hovr\u00e4ttsfiskal ) at ORG . Together with her husband , she owned a law firm until DATE . At the material time , PERSON worked part - time for the law firm as a partner , having been given permission to do so by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In her notice of appeal of CARDINAL DATE on behalf of the GPE company ORG submitted to ORG , inter alia , that the applicants ' company \u201c seems to use concepts quite carelessly in its agreements in general \u201d ; that \u201c what is essential about the case is that the seller must not act fraudulently and must not , even in good faith , draw up agreements the contents of which are unclear \u201d ; and , further , that \u201c if we follow the logic of ORG , overcharging is not a crime if you manage to overcharge CARDINAL victim \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The final decision in the above case was given by ORG on DATE in favour of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' company was also the claimant in another set of civil proceedings initiated on CARDINAL DATE in ORG ( kihlakunnanoikeus , h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tten ) , in which the respondent was an investment bank . That case concerned the bank 's refusal to grant the applicants ' company a bank guarantee for acquiring financing from abroad , and compensation for the ensuing loss of business profits . The applicants maintained , inter alia , that their company had been dissolved in DATE because of the bank 's failure to fulfil its contractual obligations . The applicants claimed , inter alia , MONEY ( ORG , equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) ) in compensation for the business they had lost .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused to examine the applicants ' claims as it found them to be too unspecific to provide a basis for any court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) remitted the case to ORG ( from DATE k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , finding that ORG should have examined the applicants ' claims . ORG did not take part in those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was opened for re - examination by ORG . It found that although the bank had breached its obligations towards the applicants ' company , it had not caused the company 's liquidation , and dismissed its claims on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' company appealed against that decision to ORG , which upheld ORG decision and dismissed the appeal on DATE . The bench of ORG which examined the case was composed of CARDINAL judges , including PERSON , who was now a judge .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' company requested leave to appeal to ORG , stating , inter alia , that PERSON was biased as she had taken part in other proceedings in DATE ( the first set of proceedings ) , in which the opposing party had been represented by the law firm in which ORG had been a partner at that time . She had , for example , signed her client 's submissions to ORG and to ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before making its decision concerning the request for leave to appeal , ORG requested a statement from ORG The statement , dated DATE ( the date was apparently erroneous in that DATE should have been DATE ) , read as follows :", "\u201c In addition to full - time judge 's duties , I practised law as a partner in a law firm on a part - time basis , with the permission of the President of ORG , until DATE , when the firm was closed down . Thereafter I have had no part - time duties .", "It is true that our law firm represented a client in a civil case between [ the GPE company ] and [ the applicants ' company ] before ORG . At that time the pleadings before ORG were handled by GPE ... and , after an appeal was lodged with ORG , the pleadings before ORG were handled by the advocate PERSON , as I found that it was not appropriate for me to continue with the case in ORG .", "At the time of participating in the consideration of the present civil case between [ the applicants ' company ] and the investment bank , I did not even remember that our law firm , which had been closed down , had DATE represented a client in a different case in which [ the applicants ' company ] was the opposing party . Thus , no question of possible disqualification arose to be considered .", "My personal view is that , when assessed on objective grounds , [ the applicants ' company ] had no real reason to doubt my impartiality , considering in particular that the period of time between my earlier representation and the decision - making stage in the present case was long , and that there was no factual link between the CARDINAL cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicants ' company leave to appeal . According to the decision , Judge PERSON 's statement had been communicated to the applicants for information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied to ORG for annulment of the decision , again drawing attention , inter alia , to the alleged bias on the part of ORG The application was refused by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The provisions concerning the disqualification of judges were at the relevant time contained in LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) . It contained a list of grounds on which a judge might be disqualified . The relevant provisions concerning the impartiality of judges were subsequently amended ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the domestic courts ' case - law , the question of possible bias on the part of a judge was addressed , inter alia , by assessing whether his or her earlier activities as legal counsel constituted a justified reason to doubt his or her impartiality .", "CARDINAL . ORG found in a decision of DATE ( no . CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) that a judge was not disqualified on the ground that he had earlier assisted CARDINAL of the parties to the case in separate proceedings , as his duties as a legal representative and counsel did not pertain to the case at hand and his conduct and standpoint in his capacity as counsel or legal representative did not give rise to any objective reason to doubt his impartiality in respect of matters concerning the other party .", "CARDINAL . LAW , section CARDINAL ( Act no . PERSON ) , of the Code of Judicial Procedure provides that the deadline for lodging an appeal is DATE from the date when the decision of ORG was delivered or made available to the parties . LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Code of Judicial Procedure , as in force at the relevant time , corresponded in essence to the current provision in the above - mentioned respects ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
