On DATE a CARDINAL - member commission of the ORG decided by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL that the advertisements breached ORG and LAW ( Decency ) and CARDINAL ( Religion ) of the Code of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG commission held :", "\u201c In the commission \u2019s view , the advertisements may lead to dissatisfaction of religious people . [ The advertisements might be seen as ] humiliating and degrading people because of their faith , convictions or opinions . Religious people always react very sensitively to any use of religious symbols or religious personalities in advertising , so we suggest avoiding the possibility of offending their dignity .", "In this case the game has gone too far .

On DATE the ORG received a complaint from a law firm in GPE concerning the advertisements .

It asked the SCRPA to fine the applicant company and to order it to remove the advertisements as being contrary to public order and public morals .", "CARDINAL . The ORG forwarded the aforementioned complaints and the ORG opinion ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) to ORG ( ORG ne maisto produkt\u0173 inspekcija DATE hereinafter \u201c the Inspectorate \u201d ) . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant company that the advertisements were possibly in violation of LAW ) of ORG as being contrary to public morals ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It stated :", "\u201c The ORG , having examined the material presented to it , is of the view that the advertisements use religious symbols in a disrespectful and inappropriate manner . Religious people always react very sensitively to any use of religious symbols or religious personalities in advertising . The use of religious symbols for superficial purposes may offend religious people . Advertisements must not include statements or visuals which are offensive to religious feelings or show disrespect for religious people . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant company submitted written explanations to the ORG . It firstly submitted that in the advertisements the word \u201c PERSON \u201d was used not as an address to a religious personality but as an emotional interjection which was common in spoken NORP , similar to \u201c oh my God ! \u201d , \u201c oh Lord ! \u201d , \u201c God forbid ! \u201d ( PERSON , GPE , gink Dieve ) and many others . The applicant company argued that , because of its common use to express one \u2019s emotions , that word had lost its exclusively religious significance . It further submitted that the people depicted in the advertisements could not be unambiguously considered as resembling religious figures , but even if they were , that depiction was aesthetically pleasant and not disrespectful , unlike various kitschy and low - quality religious items typically sold in markets . It further contended that , in the absence of a State religion in GPE , the interests of CARDINAL ORG group DATE practising NORP \u2013 could not be equated to those of the entire society . It lastly submitted that the ORG opinion had been based on emotional assessment but not on any proven facts , as demonstrated in particular by such phrases as \u201c religious people always react very sensitively to any use of religious symbols or religious personalities in advertising \u201d or \u201c the game has gone too far \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant company therefore argued that the advertisements had not breached any law and that holding to the contrary would be detrimental to the right to freedom of thought and expression , protected by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG drew up a report of a violation of ORG against the applicant company . The report essentially repeated the contents of the ORG \u2019s previous letter to the applicant company ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , adding that \u201c advertisements of such nature offend[ed ] religious feelings \u201d and \u201c the basic respect for spirituality [ was ] disappearing \u201d ( nelieka elementarios pagarbos dvasingumui ) . It was forwarded to the SCRPA .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the SCRPA asked ORG ( NORP vyskup\u0173 konferencija ) , which is the territorial authority of ORG in GPE , for an opinion on the advertisements . On DATE the latter submitted the following opinion :", "\u201c Religious symbols are not just simple signs , pictures or logos . In the NORP tradition , a religious symbol is a visible sign representing the invisible sacred reality .", "The advertisements ... make both visual and written references to religious sacred objects , such as a rosary , the names of PERSON and PERSON , and the symbol of the PERSON .", "NORP and PERSON , as symbols of faith , represent certain moral values and embody ethical perfection , and for that they are examples of appropriate behaviour and desirable life for the faithful . The inappropriate depiction of NORP and PERSON in the advertisements encourages a frivolous attitude towards the ethical values of the NORP faith , and promotes a lifestyle which is incompatible with the principles of a religious person . The persons of NORP and PERSON are thereby degraded as symbols of the sacredness of the NORP faith . For that reason , such depiction offends the feelings of religious people . The degrading and distortion of religious symbols by purposely changing their meaning is contrary to public morals , especially when it is done in pursuit of commercial gain , and must therefore not be allowed , in line with LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the SCRPA held a meeting in which representatives of the applicant company , ORG and ORG participated . A representative of ORG repeated its previous position ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and stated that it had received complaints from CARDINAL religious individuals concerning the advertisements . Representatives of the applicant company also expressed essentially the same position as in their previous submissions to the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They in particular argued that the people depicted in the advertisements differed in several aspects from the depiction of PERSON and PERSON in religious art , and that an educated and cosmopolitan society would not equate every picture with such article They further submitted that the advertisements had relied on wordplay and they had been meant to be funny but not to offend anyone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the SCRPA adopted a decision against the applicant company concerning a violation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It noted that the concept of \u201c public morals \u201d was not defined in any legal instruments , but it necessarily implied respect for the rights and interests of others . It also stated that \u201c advertising must be tasteful and correspond to the highest moral standards \u201d and that \u201c advertising which might humiliate or degrade people because of their faith , convictions or opinions must be considered immoral and unacceptable \u201d . The SCRPA considered that \u201c the elements of the advertisements taken together \u2013 the persons , symbols and their positioning \u2013 would create an impression for the average consumer that the depicted persons and objects were related to religious symbols \u201d . It further stated :", "\u201c When determining whether the use of religious symbols in the present case was contrary to public morals , [ the SCRPA ] notes that religious people react very sensitively to any use of religious symbols or religious persons in advertising , especially when the chosen form of artistic expression is not acceptable to society \u2013 for example , the bodies of PERSON and PERSON are adorned with tattoos . [ The SCRPA ] also agrees with ORG that the use of religious symbols for commercial gain in the present case exceeds the limits of tolerance . [ The SCRPA ] considers that using the name of God for commercial purpose is not in line with public morals . With that in mind , [ the SCRPA ] notes that the inappropriate depiction of NORP and PERSON in the advertisements in question encourages a frivolous attitude towards the ethical values of the NORP faith , promotes a lifestyle which is incompatible with the principles of a religious person , and that way the persons of NORP and PERSON are degraded as the sacred symbols of NORP ...", "In addition , the inappropriate depiction of NORP and PERSON in the advertisements was not only likely to offend the feelings of religious people but actually offended them because [ the SCRPA ] has received complaints about them ... and ORG has received a letter expressing dissatisfaction of the [ nearly a CARDINAL ] religious individuals , which demonstrates that the feelings of religious people have been offended .", "It must be emphasised that respect for religion is undoubtedly a moral value . Accordingly , disrespecting religion breaches public morals . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the SCRPA concluded that the advertisements had breached LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . When determining the penalty , it took into account several circumstances : the advertisements had been displayed in public places and must have reached a wide audience , and there had been complaints about them ; at the same time , the advertisements had only been displayed for DATE and only in the city of GPE ; the applicant company had stopped displaying them after it had been warned by the authorities , and it had cooperated with the SCRPA ; it had been the first such violation committed by the applicant company . As a result , the applicant company was given a fine of CARDINAL NORP litai ( LTL \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company brought a complaint concerning the SCRPA \u2019s decision ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) before an administrative court . It argued that the persons and objects shown in the advertisements were not related to religious symbols : neither the characters themselves nor their clothes , positions or facial expressions were similar to the depiction of PERSON and PERSON in religious art ; the only physical similarity was the long hair of the man but every man with long hair could not be presumed to be a depiction of PERSON . The applicant company also submitted that the expressions \u201c PERSON ! \u201d , \u201c Dear PERSON ! \u201d and \u201c PERSON [ and ] PERSON ! \u201d were widely used in spoken language as emotional interjections , and the advertisements had used them for the purpose of wordplay , not as a reference to religion .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company further argued that ORG did not explicitly prohibit all use of religious symbols in advertising but only when such use may offend the sentiments of others or incite hatred ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It submitted that the advertisements were not offensive or disrespectful in any way , and that the SCRPA had not justified why they \u201c exceeded the limits of tolerance \u201d or why \u201c using the name of God for commercial purposes [ was ] not in line with public morals \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant company also submitted that complaints by CARDINAL individuals ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) were not sufficient to find that the majority of religious people in GPE had been offended by the advertisements .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant company submitted that the advertisements were a product of artistic activity and were therefore protected freedom of expression , guaranteed by the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s complaint . The court considered that the SCRPA had correctly assessed all the relevant circumstances ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , and concluded that \u201c the form of advertising used by [ the applicant company was ] prohibited because it distort[ed ] the main purpose of a religious symbol ( an object of religion ) respected by a religious community \u2013 that purpose being to refer to a deity or to holiness \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company appealed against that decision . In its appeal it repeated the arguments raised in its initial complaint ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . It also provided CARDINAL examples of other advertisements for various products which had depicted religious figures , religious symbols and NORP priests \u2013 one of those was an advertisement for beer depicting a wooden figure of PERSON , common in the NORP folk art ( ORG ) . The applicant company argued that such examples strengthened its argument that the use of religious symbols in advertising was not prohibited as such , unless it was offensive or hateful \u2013 and it submitted that its advertisements did not fall into either of those categories , as they did not include any slogans or visuals directly degrading religious people or inciting religious hatred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal . The court held :", "\u201c The entirety of the evidence in the present case gives grounds to conclude that the advertisements displayed by [ the applicant company ] are clearly contrary to public morals , because religion , as a certain type of world view , unavoidably contributes to the moral development of the society ; symbols of a religious nature occupy a significant place in the system of spiritual values of individuals and the society , and their inappropriate use demeans them [ and ] is contrary to universally accepted moral and ethical norms . The form of advertising [ chosen by the applicant company ] does not conform to good morals and to the principles of respecting the values of the NORP faith and its sacred symbols , and [ the advertisements ] therefore breach DATE ) of ORG .", "...", "In its appeal [ the applicant company ] alleges that there are no objective grounds to find that the advertisements offended the feelings of religious people ... It must be noted that the case file includes a letter by CARDINAL religious individuals , sent to ORG , expressing dissatisfaction with the advertisements in question . This refutes [ the applicant company \u2019s ] arguments and they are thereby dismissed as unfounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG asked that court to examine whether there were grounds for reopening the proceedings in the applicant company \u2019s case ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) . He considered that it was necessary to assess whether the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had adequately addressed the applicant company \u2019s arguments related to the permissible restrictions of freedom of expression , guaranteed by the LAW and various international legal instruments , and whether it had properly examined the necessity and proportionality of restricting that freedom , in line with the relevant case - law of ORG . The President submitted that if any such shortcomings were identified , that would give grounds to believe that ORG had incorrectly applied the substantive law and that its case - law was developing in an erroneous direction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a different panel of ORG refused to reopen the proceedings in the applicant company \u2019s case . It emphasised that proceedings which had been concluded by a final court decision could be reopened only when there had been a manifest error in the interpretation or application of the law , and not when it was merely possible to interpret that law differently .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the freedom of expression , guaranteed by the LAW , was not absolute and could be restricted ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) , and CARDINAL of the permissible restrictions was provided in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It stated that the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had not denied the applicant company \u2019s right to freedom of expression , but it had sought to balance that right against public morals , and the latter had been given priority . The court considered that the decision of DATE had not denied the essence of the applicant company \u2019s right and had not been manifestly disproportionate because the fine had been close to the minimum provided in law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , so there were no grounds to find that the law had been interpreted or applied incorrectly .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that the advertisements had had a purely commercial purpose and had not been intended to contribute to any public debate concerning religion or religious symbols . Referring to the judgments of ORG in PERSON and Others v. GPE ( CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and OttoPremingerInstitut v. GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , it stated that it was not possible to discern throughout LOC a uniform conception of the significance of religion in society and that even within a single country such conceptions might vary ; for that reason it was not possible to arrive at a comprehensive definition of what constituted a permissible interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression where such expression was directed against the religious feelings of others , and a certain margin of appreciation was therefore to be left to the national authorities in assessing the existence and extent of the necessity of such interference . ORG considered that the panel which had adopted the decision of DATE had taken into account the fact that ORG was the religion of a very big part of the NORP population and that the use of its most important symbols in the advertisements , which distorted their meaning , offended the feelings of religious people .", "CARDINAL . ORG thus concluded that the decision of DATE had adequately justified the restriction of the applicant company \u2019s freedom of expression and had correctly applied LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
