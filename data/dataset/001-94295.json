The present application has its background in a civil dispute over securities dealings between ORG ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c GPE ) and a NORP securities broker , PERSON , based in GPE . In DATE the latter brought proceedings against the former before ORG ( tingrett ) , requesting an order that the applicant company pay an amount of MONEY ( ORG ) plus interest in respect of shares PERSON had purchased for the applicant company . The applicant company , which received the summons in DATE , contested the action and brought a counter - action requesting an order that PERSON pay compensation , the amount of which was to be determined in subsequent proceedings , with regard to losses sustained by the applicant company due to information and advice received from PERSON .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG ordered the applicant company to pay PERSON NOK CARDINAL plus interest and dismissed any claim against the latter . Each party was to bear its own costs .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company then lodged an appeal with ORG ( lagmannsrett ) .", "CARDINAL . In its appeal to ORG the applicant company requested that , as had been done before ORG , adjudication in the counter - action , notably concerning the amount of the applicant company \u2019s counter - claim and related causation issues , be disjoined in accordance with LAW . Pursuant to that provision , separate proceedings were contingent on the other party \u2019s agreement . After a preparatory meeting and exchanges of written pleadings on the issue , Mr Justice PERSON , acting as the rapporteur judge of ORG , decided on DATE not to disjoin either the proceedings or the adjudication , finding insufficient basis for an agreement between the parties to this effect .", "CARDINAL . At the preparatory stage ORG decided , in view of the financial character of the subject matter , to sit with CARDINAL lay members with expertise in financial matters and invited the parties to propose candidates . The applicant company did not make any proposal . PERSON proposed PERSON ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c Mr A. \u201d or \u201c lay member PERSON ) , an economist , and the applicant company did not object within the set time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court appointed PERSON as lay member , after having specified the impartiality requirement , and informed the parties about the prospective appointment of a second lay member , Mr NORP , an economist . However , since it turned out that Mr NORP did not satisfy the impartiality requirement , he was replaced by PERSON ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c Mr B. \u201d or \u201c lay member PERSON ) , a chartered accountant .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime the applicant company appealed against ORG decision of DATE to ORG disputing the necessity and desirability of appointing lay members in general . It also contested the procedure whereby PERSON had been appointed on the proposal of PERSON and not on a joint proposal by the parties . The applicant company questioned whether PERSON professional background made him suitable as an expert in the case . On CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG decision , finding that the appeal had no prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . ORG held an oral hearing DATE or so between DATE and DATE at which each party was represented by counsel and an assistant lawyer . From the outset it was composed of CARDINAL professional judges \u2013 Mr ORG , President , Mr Justice PERSON and Mr Justice Nesheim , ad hoc judge DATE and CARDINAL expert lay judges , PERSON and PERSON", "CARDINAL . There were no objections to the composition of ORG at the opening of the hearing on DATE ( section CARDINAL of ORG ( domstolloven ) - PERSON of CARDINAL DATE no . CARDINAL , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE and on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE the lawyers for the applicant company made their opening address .", "CARDINAL . On the last - mentioned date the Presiding Judge of ORG drew the parties\u2019 attention to the fact that it was considering whether ( as requested by the applicant company \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) it would be appropriate to disjoin the proceedings , as provided for in LAW ( NORP ) , in respect of point QUANTITY of the counter - action and invited the parties to give further consideration to the matter .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE counsel for the applicant company continued his address and entered his plea . Thereafter the assistant lawyer for the respondent began his opening address . At some point during this address lay member PERSON informed the parties that , in his capacity as an employee of ORG , he had been involved in an assignment for ORG and ORG in connection with the listing of a company on the stock exchange . The parties gave notice that they wished to consider this matter in further detail and to revert later to the question whether PERSON should be able to sit in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before adjourning the proceedings on DATE , the Presiding Judge provided the parties with further information on the question of disjoining the proceedings with regard to the first point of the counter - action . The parties were asked to give their final comments on this question before counsel for the respondent commenced his opening address in respect of the counter - action .", "CARDINAL . When the proceedings resumed on DATE , DATE , the Presiding Judge opened by taking up the question of the eligibility of PERSON in response to the pleadings on this subject submitted by the applicant company \u2019s lawyer . PERSON then provided further details of his relationship with PERSON . Since some of the questions raised by the applicant company required further investigation by PERSON , it was agreed that the issue of the lay member \u2019s ability to take part in the case should be adjourned until DATE .", "The assistant lawyer for the respondent then continued his opening address and entered his pleas .", "The Presiding Judge informed the parties that the ORG intended to rule on the various procedural questions raised in the case DATE .", "CARDINAL . When the proceedings resumed in TIME of the following day , DATE , counsel for the applicant company asked that PERSON be absent from the pleadings regarding his eligibility . ORG adjourned briefly to consider the question and , when the proceedings resumed , decided that PERSON should not take part in the subsequent exchanges on the question .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for each of the parties then made submissions on the question of eligibility with reference to section CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The parties were then given the opportunity to argue their views on the question of disjoining the proceedings as provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . At TIME ORG adjourned the proceedings until TIME and withdrew to deliberate and vote in camera on the questions of eligibility and disjoinder .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE ( DATE ) ORG convened again , sitting with the professional judges and lay member PERSON delivered CARDINAL decisions , signed by the CARDINAL professional judges and lay member PERSON , but not by lay member PERSON , who had not taken part .", "CARDINAL . The first decision concerned the disqualification matter , in which ORG observed inter alia :", "\u201c During the appeal proceedings lay member [ Mr A. ] , who is an economist , remembered a circumstance that he thought appropriate to mention to the other members of the bench and which was then passed on to the parties .", "[ Mr A. ] is a partner in ORG . At the time of writing this company is engaged in an assignment for ORG ( referred to hereafter as PERSON ) , the parent company of CARDINAL of the parties in this case , ORG ASA . In collaboration with a second company , ORG , ORG has undertaken a consultancy assignment for a company seeking to be listed on ORG . PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 assignment consists of providing certain auditing and accounting services in connection with the stock - exchange launch . The assignment was given DATE following a tendering competition and , according to the information provided , most of the work on the assignment is being performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 GPE office . [ Mr A ] has been entrusted with the task of providing advice in connection with the assignment and will thus be CARDINAL of the people who will provide the services in question . In this context he has also had some direct contact with a representative of PERSON . According to the submitted documents , the fee for the assignment will be approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The assignment has not yet been completed . The company seeking listing will ultimately be liable for payment to ORG .", "After [ Mr A. ] had explained the situation , the [ applicant company ] requested further information from the opposing party and the parties subsequently exchanged pleadings on the question of eligibility . At DATE \u2019s hearing Advocate PERSON , acting for [ the applicant company ] , filed an objection to the eligibility of lay member [ Mr A. ] . The parties were given the opportunity to comment on the question . [ Mr A. ] was not present in court during the submissions and decision on the question of his eligibility .", "[ The applicant company ] argues that lay member [ Mr A. ] is disqualified pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG . The company refers , among other things , to the information that ORG has obtained MONEY of the commissions carried out for FAC during DATE . A commission concerning a stock market introduction is very prestigious and is currently a rare occurrence . It is obvious that ORG has considerable interest in obtaining this type and other kinds of assignments from FAC , a main actor in this market . As a partner in ORG , [ Mr A. ] has a direct financial interest in the company \u2019s income and future income potential . What is decisive is how this matter would appear to the public . The counter - action in the case concerns a considerable compensation claim against ORG . According to the information available , there is currently no activity in this company , and it is obvious that , for the purposes of the impartiality issue , this company ought to be identified with PERSON , which has continued the daughter company \u2019s activity . There is clearly too close a connection between [ Mr A. ] and the respondent for [ Mr A. ] to serve as a judge in the case . A further disqualifying circumstance is that [ Mr E. ] of PERSON is a central witness in the case with regard to the question whether [ the applicant company \u2019s ] representative during a meeting with ORG , attended by [ Mr E. ] , made statements which could provide a basis for demanding confiscation of assets . It is untenable for [ Mr A. ] to assess whether the witness statement from a person with whom he has a relationship of continuous professional cooperation is valid .", "At the preparatory stage [ the applicant company ] was particularly concerned about the need for any lay members appointed to have sufficient independence from the parties and in this connection the company pointed to the close business relations between the large companies in the financial sector . It should also be emphasised that the law firm of counsel for the respondent carried out commissions for ORG in connection with the stock market introduction . ...", "ORG claim that lay member [ Mr A. ] is not disqualified from taking part in the case . His connection to the respondent in the appeal is too loose . This is illustrated by the fact that it never occurred to [ Mr A. ] in the beginning that there could be a ground for disqualifying him . The assignment in question is very small and [ Mr A. ] does not play a central role in it . His role is primarily to provide advice to PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 office in GPE , which is handling the consultancy . Bills and fees are addressed to PERSON and ORG , but it is the company which is to be introduced on the stock market which will cover the costs . [ Mr A. ] does not have any DATE or permanent dealing with the consultancy . This is a CARDINAL - off consultancy consisting in objective accountancy considerations . [ Mr A. ] is not personally a contractual party and ORG has no direct or indirect interest in the outcome of the court case . [ Mr A. ] will be removed from the consultancy . No one from counsel \u2019s law firm who is directly involved in the case has been aware of the matter . The law firm has no commission for ORG in connection with the stock market introduction but only for the company whose introduction is being sought .", "The NORP financial milieu is small and there are very few large accountancy firms that are able to take on such consultancies . A strict interpretation of section CARDINAL of ORG would lead to a very narrow choice of competent lay members in cases where particular competence in finance and accountancy is required . ...", "ORG is of the view that there is nothing to suggest that lay member [ Mr A. ] is not fully able to reach an impartial decision in the case , notwithstanding the contractual relationship between PERSON and ORG . It is noted that [ Mr A. ] himself did not view this relationship as a problem , and it was not until DATE of the proceedings that it occurred to him that he should mention the relationship . This is not decisive , however , since the question of disqualification must be considered on the basis of a more general assessment of what relationship between a lay member and a party will be deemed unacceptable pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG .", "ORG notes that objections to the eligibility of the lay member have been entered by [ the applicant company ] and the court refers to [ the applicant company ] \u2019s submissions as cited above . Having considered the matter in its entirety , the ORG is of the view that , in the light of the circumstances , lay member [ Mr A. ] should withdraw .", "The decision is unanimous .", "Conclusion", "[ Mr A. ] is ordered to withdraw . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the second decision ORG decided to disjoin the proceedings :", "\u201c Having put the question to the parties of disjoining the proceedings as provided for in LAW , the ORG unanimously decided with respect to the counter - action \u2013 item CARDINAL of the [ applicant company \u2019s ] statement of claim DATE that the following CARDINAL questions should be considered first :", "CARDINAL . Whether , in the light of the negotiating situation between the parties , ORG were in breach of their obligations in relation to [ the applicant company ] , in other words whether there was an obligation for SCC not to apply for attachment in GPE , GPE and/or GPE .", "CARDINAL . Whether there exist other fault - based or strict grounds for liability in connection with the applications for attachment in GPE , GPE and GPE .", "The decision means that for the time being the court will not review questions relating to a causal link in respect of the alleged losses or the question whether there should be imputation of liability between the [ the applicant company ] and the company PERSON .", "After the proceedings had been completed in accordance with this decision , ORG ruled , following deliberations , that a decision should be rendered in both the primary and the counter - action on the basis of the decision adopted .", "CARDINAL . When the proceedings resumed on DATE , counsel for the applicant company filed a motion for the case to be discontinued on the grounds of ORG order of DATE requiring lay member PERSON to withdraw . Counsel for the respondent objected . Thereafter the Presiding Judge informed the parties that ORG had unanimously decided that the proceedings should continue , as provided for in LAW ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In this regard ORG stated the following in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE :", "\u201c The disqualification of the lay member [ Mr A. ] did not disqualify the other judges and the need for expert evidence was safeguarded in the further proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the transcripts of ORG hearings , it subsequently heard the case from CARDINAL to DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG reiterated its decision of DATE on the disjoinder of the proceedings and affirmed that the appeal proceedings had been conducted in accordance with this decision until DATE . It further stated that , after its deliberations held on DATE and DATE , it had decided to close the proceedings and adjudicate the case DATE both the principal action and the counter - action as it had been pleaded .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment in the main and ordered the applicant company to pay specified amounts for PERSON legal costs both before ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG judgment , at an unspecified time after ORG judgment of DATE , ORG \u2019s broker activity had been taken over by the parent company ORG and since then the former company had had no economic activity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company sought to appeal against ORG procedure and judgment to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the procedure , the applicant company argued that the High Court judgment ought to be quashed , notably on the ground that the court had been unlawfully constituted . This was due to the participation of lay member PERSON , who had been disqualified under LAW ( LAW , item QUANTITY , of DATE ) . In the alternative , the applicant company maintained that lay member PERSON \u2019s participation must have had an influence on the High Court judgment ( LAW ) . The proceedings had lasted for \u201c DATE by the time lay member PERSON was ordered to withdraw . The substantive questions concerned relatively old facts , which meant that the parties\u2019 pleadings and the case documents would be central to ORG determination of the case . Moreover , the respective decisions to disqualify lay member PERSON and disjoin the proceedings had been taken in the same court session . A decision to disjoin the proceedings presupposed that the judges had discussed the substance of the case , an issue that had been raised on DATE of the hearing already . In the further alternative , the applicant submitted that ORG decision to continue the proceedings with reference to section CARDINAL of ORG after A. \u2019s withdrawal had constituted an error of procedure .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that in its notice of appeal of DATE to ORG , the applicant company reiterated , inter alia , that it \u201c had consistently argued in favour of disjoining the proceedings before ORG , as had been done before ORG , in accordance with LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) refused the applicant company leave to appeal with regard to ORG procedure , finding it obvious that the appeal had no prospects of success . As for the remainder , ORG refused the applicant company leave on the ground that the appeal represented no interest beyond the particular case and that no other reason warranted the appeal being heard by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The requirements of impartiality of judges and lay members are set out in sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of ORG ( domstolloven ) \u2013 PERSON of CARDINAL DATE no . CARDINAL .
