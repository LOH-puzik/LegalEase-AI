NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , following a nationalisation process ( for more detailed historical background see PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , the applicant \u2019s predecessors settled in an apartment in GPE street , GPE , which was later rented by the applicant \u2019s father . The applicant and her family lived in the apartment until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the dwelling house was denationalised and taken over by a private person . The new owner requested the applicant \u2019s family to leave the apartment , alleging that it was unfit for occupation and required urgent repair . The dispute over the right to rent the apartment resulted in several sets of court proceedings between the applicant \u2019s family and the landlord .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the landlord brought a claim for eviction of the applicant \u2019s family , without providing alternative accommodation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON of ORG upheld the claim . On the basis of the parties\u2019 statements and case materials , the court found that : ( CARDINAL ) even in the absence of a written rental agreement between the parties , the applicant had been renting the contested apartment ; ( CARDINAL ) the apartment needed renovation and the plaintiff had proved his intention to carry out the necessary work , and therefore the condition for terminating the rental agreement had been met ; ( CARDINAL ) the plaintiff had warned the tenants about the termination of the rental agreement in accordance with a procedure provided by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an appeal by the applicant was dismissed by ORG , which on DATE issued an execution order .", "CARDINAL . The decision became final in DATE when the ORG of ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . While the above proceedings were pending , in DATE the landlord brought a claim against the applicant and her family asking the court to order the tenants to give him access to the apartment . He argued that certain parts of the apartment were in a critical condition and required urgent repair owing to the fact that the wooden construction between the floors was decayed and risked collapsing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON of ORG , in the absence of the applicant and her family , upheld the claim . The applicant and her family were duly informed of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was subject to appeal . Owing to its urgent nature , the lower court ordered the immediate execution of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the other defendants appealed and refused to implement the judgment . Following the bailiff \u2019s report that execution of the judgment was impossible , Judge PERSON on DATE and DATE imposed a fine of QUANTITY ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) and ORG CARDINAL ( LAW ) on each of the CARDINAL defendants , including the applicant . Upon appeal by the applicant , ORG quashed the decisions in a final ruling on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , ORG of GPE had on various occasions imposed fines on the applicant and her family for failing to allow the landlord to enter the apartment , in breach of LAW in force at the time . On CARDINAL occasion in DATE Judge PERSON had made a decision relating to an administrative fine imposed on CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s family members ; in the decision she had identified shortcomings in the administrative offence proceedings and discontinued them . The decision was final .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE a bailiff attempted to carry out the eviction in accordance with the order issued on DATE . The applicant and her family allegedly refused to leave the apartment , arguing that the eviction was unlawful . The landlord therefore proceeded to have the doors of the apartment opened by force , but it was discovered that the entrance was blocked with furniture and it was impossible to enter . An incident arose between the workers assigned by the bailiff and the people who were at the apartment during the eviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the landlord brought a civil claim for damages against the applicant and her family for the broken apartment door and for damage to belongings of other people involved in the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lower court , in the absence of the defendants , upheld the claim and ordered the defendants to pay ORG CARDINAL ( around EUR CARDINAL ) in damages .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that opening the doors by force had not been necessary , and that the court had failed to establish a causal link between the actions of each of the defendants and the alleged damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , examined the applicant \u2019s appeal , with Judge PERSON as CARDINAL of the judges . At the beginning of the hearing the applicant challenged Judge PERSON \u2019s impartiality , arguing that she had evicted her family from the apartment and that therefore she might have an interest in the case .", "CARDINAL . The court dismissed the objection and since there were no other requests received by the parties , continued to examine the appeal on the merits . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court partly upheld the claim . It observed that the applicant \u2019s family had been evicted from the apartment in accordance with a valid court judgment and that witness statements had established that on DATE the defendants had objected to the request by the court bailiff . In the court \u2019s opinion there was no doubt that the plaintiff had sustained damage and that the lower court had correctly found that the damage had been caused by the applicant and her family because the eviction concerned all of them .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an appeal on points of law the applicant noted that she had raised objections against Judge PERSON , listing all the decisions the judge had previously made .", "CARDINAL .
