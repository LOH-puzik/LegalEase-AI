NORP In DATE the applicant , born in DATE , was a soldier of the regular forces in ORG . On DATE the Special Investigations Branch of the military police ( \u201c SIB \u201d ) began investigating charges against him in relation to the misuse of travel warrants . The applicant was due to be interviewed on CARDINAL DATE and went missing from his unit . On DATE he was arrested by the civilian police and returned to his unit . His commanding officer dealt with the charge summarily and sentenced him to , inter alia , CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant served DATE ( after remission for good conduct in detention ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was therefore due for release on CARDINAL DATE but his detention continued on the basis of the suspected offences that were being investigated by the ORG . On CARDINAL and DATE the applicant was interviewed by the ORG and he was advised by a civilian solicitor during those interviews . The applicant then instructed his current representative on DATE . On DATE the applicant was brought before his commanding officer and a charge sheet recording CARDINAL charge under LAW DATE relating to the making of fraudulent motor mileage claims was read to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a further charge sheet was read to the applicant which included CARDINAL additional and similar charges ( obtaining property by deception ) and the applicant was remanded for trial by court - martial . On DATE the applicant applied for legal aid under the army legal aid scheme , which was granted as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant commenced habeas corpus proceedings in the ORG requesting his release on the grounds , inter alia , that he had not been given a formal hearing at which he was informed of the case against him and was able to present his own case for release , and on the grounds of the delay in holding the court - martial . The army authorities admitted that due to an \u201c administrative oversight \u201d the applicant had not been charged until DATE . On DATE the army authorities undertook to the ORG to release the applicant from close to open arrest and he was so released on DATE . The form of order of ORG recorded the pleadings before it and the ORG \u2019s undertaking to release the applicant , but included no other order except to award costs to the applicant . The applicant was released from open arrest in DATE and was sent on leave .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted further proceedings in the High Court for compensation from ORG in respect of his detention from DATE to DATE . The applicant alleged unlawful detention , breach of a duty of care , false imprisonment and trespass to the person . The defence filed by the army authorities in those proceedings accepted that the applicant had not been charged until DATE , initially because the investigation of the charges had been impeded by his absence and , subsequently , due to an error associated with the replacement of the applicant \u2019s commanding officer . The authorities therefore accepted that the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE was unlawful . Various other admissions were made by the army authorities as regards the failure properly to complete certain delay reports , but it was denied that these latter omissions rendered the applicant \u2019s subsequent detention unlawful . The applicant had also claimed , and the army authorities denied , that there had been a violation of the rules of natural justice and of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The matter was settled on DATE , the applicant being paid a substantial sum of money and his costs .", "CARDINAL . Although a district court - martial was initially convened by order of DATE to try the applicant , it was postponed on a number of occasions . In DATE the applicant was charged with further but similar offences and , on DATE , the army authorities directed that the applicant be tried by court - martial on the CARDINAL outstanding charges against him . On DATE the applicant was tried by general court - martial . He pleaded guilty to offences of obtaining property by deception to the value of \u00a3 MONEY and was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment of which he was to serve DATE . The reviewing authority later reduced this sentence to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and the applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG is pending .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the provisions governing the prosecution and pre - trial detention of accused members of the army were contained in LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , in the Rules of Procedure ( Army ) DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) and in FAC for the ORG DATE ( \u201c the Queen 's Regulations \u201d ) .", "Subsequent to the relevant facts of the present case , the law has been amended by , inter alia , LAW ( see the GPE v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and ORG , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and by the Investigation and Summary Dealing ( Army ) Regulations DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal provisions relevant to the present application are set out in detail in the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. the GPE ( judgment of DATE , to be published in the Official Reports of selected Judgments and Decisions ) . The main provisions are summarised below .", "CARDINAL . In general terms , the commanding officer of an accused retains numerous powers and duties in relation to the arrest and pre - trial detention of an accused and in respect of the investigation and subsequent prosecution of charges . If the accused is a soldier ( as opposed to an officer ) , the commanding officer 's powers are broader as regards the investigation and pursuit of charges against an accused .", "CARDINAL . Any allegation that a person subject to military law has committed an offence under LAW must be reported to that person 's commanding officer . The latter may investigate the charge ( section QUANTITY ) and may issue a warrant for the arrest of a person who is accused of certain charges .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the commanding officer of an accused must , unless it is impracticable , within TIME of becoming aware that an accused is detained , have such person brought before him , inform him of the charge against him and begin to investigate it . If the investigation has not begun within TIME , the commanding officer must report the case to a higher authority together with the reasons for the delay in commencing the investigation ( Rule CARDINAL of the DATE Rules ) .", "CARDINAL . Commanding officers are responsible for ensuring that in each case the need to keep an accused in detention , together with the form of that detention , is kept under constant review ( paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ) . However , ultimate responsibility initially lies with the officer convening the court - martial and , as the pre - trial detention continues , with the convening officer \u2019s superior officer and , finally , with the Commander in Chief of the accused ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "If the detention of an accused is considered necessary , the category of detention ( close arrest or open arrest ) is to be determined in the interests of the service and by the nature of the alleged offence . Generally , a person is to be placed under close arrest only when confinement is necessary to ensure his safe custody or to maintain discipline . The circumstances which would warrant placing an accused under close arrest include those where the accused is deliberately trying to undermine discipline , is likely to injure himself or others , or is likely to suborn witnesses , where he has not surrendered but has been apprehended as an illegal absentee , or has habitually absented himself , and where , having regard to the nature or prevalence of the alleged offence which is under investigation , it is undesirable in the interests of discipline that he should be at large or allowed to consort with his comrades ( paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The commanding officer is responsible for the compilation of the abstract of evidence during the investigation . The abstract consists of the evidence of each witness considered necessary to prove the charge . Once it is compiled , the accused is given a copy , he is cautioned as to the use that could be made of any evidence he may submit and statements submitted by the accused are attached to the abstract of evidence ( Rule CARDINAL of the DATE Rules ) . The pamphlet entitled \u201c Rights of a Soldier \u201d describes the purpose of the extract of evidence as , inter alia , to \u201c provide a brief for the prosecutor at trial \u201d and to inform the accused of the evidence which will be given at trial .", "CARDINAL . The commanding officer can also decide how a charge will be proceeded with after investigation . The commanding officer can deal summarily with or dismiss certain charges and can stay the proceedings against an accused ( sections CARDINAL and ORG of the DATE Act ) . He can also decide that the accused should be tried by court - martial and he must take the necessary steps in this respect ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . The necessary steps include ( LAW ) sending to a higher authority a draft charge sheet signed by the commanding officer , the abstract of evidence , a statement of character together with the service record of the accused , and the commanding officer \u2019s recommendation as to how the charge should be proceeded with ( for example , by district or general court martial ) . It is the higher authority who takes the final decision as to whether a court - martial is to be convened , and it is the convening officer of that court - martial who finally decides on the charges to be retained against an accused , although the latter generally does so by countersigning the draft charge sheet submitted by the commanding officer ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
