NORP The applicant , PERSON . , is a private limited company with its registered office in GPE . It was represented before the ORG by Mr J. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE . Further details concerning the present CARDINAL applications lodged by the applicant company are set out in the appendix .", "The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the cases , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company concluded a contract with ORG , a public - law institution . Under that contract , taken together with CARDINAL additional ones concluded on DATE and DATE , the applicant company acquired the right , in exchange for compensation to ORG , to recover unpaid broadcast receiver licences in CARDINAL cases , plus additional sums for default on those payments .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company sued the individuals and legal persons who had refused to pay the debt which it had acquired the right to recover . The applicant company prepared individual actions , with a request for payment notices to be issued against the debtors . Given the number of defendants concerned , the actions were generated by computer software and recorded on ORG ( DVD ) . In the course of DATE the DVDs were sent to the district courts concerned , accompanied by an explanatory letter .", "CARDINAL . The courts refused to register the actions , indicating that they lacked the equipment to receive and process submissions made and signed electronically .", "CARDINAL . In view of the differing practice of ORG in respect of the applicant \u2019s ensuing complaints , the ORG found , on DATE , a breach of the applicant \u2019s right of access to court in respect of cases where the applicant had been unable to obtain redress at the domestic level ( see Lawyer Partners a.s . v. GPE , CARDINAL . CARDINAL , ORG , ORG , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG , CARDINAL , ORG , ORG , ORG , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , NORP and DATE , ORG DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant company brought proceedings against the ORG , in which it claimed compensation for damage resulting from the failure to register the actions submitted electronically . In a submission of DATE the applicant company stated that the courts dealing with the claims for damages had asked it to pay prohibitively high deposits in respect of costs and expenses , in accordance with an amendment to LAW enacted which took effect on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the present cases the applicant lodged CARDINAL actions with twentyone different district courts in DATE , DATE and DATE . The actions concerned unpaid broadcast receiver licences and they were signed electronically and filed on DVDs . The district courts concerned were unable to register and proceed with the actions as they lacked the necessary equipment . The applicant sought redress before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court delivered CARDINAL judgments in which it found that the district courts concerned had breached the applicant \u2019s right of access to court as guaranteed by LAW , in that they had refused to register its actions . It ordered the courts involved ( with the exception of ORG , which had expressed its readiness to do so in the meantime ) to proceed with such actions in accordance with the relevant provisions of LAW . The judgments explicitly stated that the actions of the applicant should have legal effect from the time they were first submitted to the courts concerned , regardless of any technical impediments preventing that date from being automatically generated within the electronic registration system .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further ordered the district courts involved to reimburse the applicant company \u2019s costs in CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judgments . In the remaining CARDINAL judgments ORG found that it had already ruled in a number of cases lodged by the applicant that the courts had a duty to process submissions made electronically . That fact had to be taken into account when deciding on the applicant \u2019s claim for costs .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the above findings sufficiently redressed the situation complained of . With reference to the ORG \u2019s practice under LAW it therefore dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims for just satisfaction , which amounted to MONEY ( ORG ) in respect of each individual action registered on the DVDs . Further details concerning the actions and ORG judgments are set out in the appendix .", "CARDINAL . In the period subsequent to ORG judgments in the present cases , the ordinary courts proceeded or attempted to proceed with the applicant \u2019s cases as follows .", "CARDINAL . In proceedings before ORG the applicant company first indicated that it would provide a reserve copy of the DVDs . That proposal was accepted by ORG . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed the court that it would not submit the DVDs as they had been submitted to ORG in the context of its application . The applicant sent the same reply to CARDINAL other district courts which had asked it to submit the DVDs with its claims . As a result , those courts have not proceeded with the cases .", "CARDINAL . In the other cases the district courts concerned registered the actions while considering them as having been lodged on the corresponding dates in DATE . They did so on the basis of the DVDs which they had obtained either from the applicant or ORG , or by processing their own copy of the applicant \u2019s original submission in electronic form . Several courts determined the merits of the applicant \u2019s claims . CARDINAL other district courts abandoned proceedings as the applicant had not paid the court fees .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court shall decide on complaints lodged by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms or of human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in international treaties ratified by GPE ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court .", "CARDINAL . When the Constitutional Court finds that a complaint is justified , it shall deliver a decision stating that a person \u2019s rights or freedoms set out in paragraph CARDINAL have been violated as a result of a final decision , by a particular measure or by means of other interference . It shall quash such a decision , measure or other interference . When the violation found is the result of a failure to act , ORG may order [ the authority ] which violated the rights or freedoms in question to take the necessary action . At the same time ORG may return the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings , order the authority concerned to abstain from violating fundamental rights and freedoms ... or , where appropriate , order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph CARDINAL to restore the situation existing prior to the violation .", "CARDINAL .
