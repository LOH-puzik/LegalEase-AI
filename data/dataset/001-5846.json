On DATE she applied for such membership , pursuant to ORG and CARDINAL of LAW , which provide that every private practising notary must be a member of a notary chamber .", "The applicant submits that she was informed by the president of ORG that she was required to pay a membership entry fee of CARDINAL times the minimum reference tariff ( \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430 ) , which at the time equalled MONEY ( RUR ) / ( CARDINAL FF ) .

In DATE ORG adjourned the proceedings awaiting the decision of ORG .", "On DATE ORG , after a hearing held on DATE , ruled that compulsory membership of a notary chamber is not contrary to Articles DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW . It stated , inter alia , that notary chambers perform important public law functions , which include the supervision of the exercise of private notaries\u2019 professional duties , and the right to address a court with a request to deprive a notary of the right to practise because of a violation of the law . Having regard to these public law functions and duties , ORG found that the principle of voluntary membership could not apply to notary chambers . As regards the status of notary chambers , ORG added that they were to be considered as non - governmental organisations taking part in ORG power . Further , it ruled that membership of a notary chamber should not be subjected to conditions other than those established by law , in particular membership fees which are not foreseen by the notary legislation .", "On DATE , following the ORG decision , ORG held that ORG decision of DATE was in accordance with the law and should remain unchanged .", "Subsequently , ORG requested ORG to order the applicant to pay its legal costs ( MONEY ) . On DATE ORG partly granted this claim and ordered the applicant to pay the MONEY . The applicant did not lodge an appeal against that decision .", "Article CARDINAL provides that in performing notary acts , notaries have equal rights and duties , irrespective of whether they are employed by ORG notary offices or in private practice . Documents authenticated by notaries are of equal legal validity .

Persons who intend to obtain a license to conduct notary acts may also be members . Notary chambers shall be formed in each republic within GPE , in an autonomous region , autonomous areas , territories and regions , and in the cities of GPE and GPE .
