On DATE the first applicant asked the investigators to provide her with unrestricted access to the investigation file .

For the most part , they received no answer and the replies that did come in were negative .", "CARDINAL . DATE the investigation in criminal case no . DATE was suspended and resumed on CARDINAL occasions . Each suspension of the proceedings was overruled by the supervising body as premature and unlawful . The last suspension took place on DATE , but the investigation was resumed on DATE . It is still pending .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant appealed to ORG in PERSON against the ORG refusal to provide her with unrestricted access to file no . DATE . She sought a ruling obliging the investigators to provide her with full access , to resume the investigation , which had been suspended , and to carry it out in an effective manner . She also asked for free legal counsel to assist her in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Zavodskoy ORG allowed the complaint in part . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG granted the request for full access to the case file . The request for free legal assistance was dismissed for lack of grounds in domestic law .", "CARDINAL . The applicants maintained that it was beyond reasonable doubt that the men who had taken away and then killed Mr Islam Deniyev had been ORG agents . In support of that assertion they referred to the ample evidence contained in their submissions and the criminal investigation file . They submitted that they had made a prima facie case that their relative had been abducted and killed by ORG agents and that the essential facts underlying their complaint had not been challenged by the Government .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not contest the essential facts as presented by the applicants . At the same time , they claimed that the investigation had not obtained information proving that ORG agents had been involved in the detention or killing of the applicants\u2019 relative .", "CARDINAL . A number of principles have been developed by ORG when it has been faced with the task of establishing the facts of events on which the parties disagree ( see PERSON v. \u201c the former GPE \u201d [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) : the factual findings should be based on the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d ; and such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII , and ORG and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVIII ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has dealt with a whole series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances and killings in GPE . Applying the abovementioned principles , it has concluded that if applicants make a prima facie case of abduction and killing by servicemen , this is sufficient for them to show that their relatives fell within the control of the authorities , and it is then for the Government to discharge their burden of proof , either by disclosing any documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred ( see , among many examples , GPE and Others , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . If the Government fail to rebut that presumption , this will entail a violation of LAW in its substantive part . Conversely , where applicants fail to make a prima facie case , the burden of proof can not be reversed ( see , for example , ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ; LOC v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ; and PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the circumstances of the present case , the ORG notes that the documents from the investigation file provided by the Government ( see , for example , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) demonstrate that Mr PERSON was detained on DATE at the roadblock by a group of armed servicemen and that his remains were discovered DATE , in DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The next point to be considered is whether there is a causal link between the detention of Mr ORG by ORG servicemen at the roadblock and his death . The ORG reiterates in this connection that where the events in issue lie wholly , or in large part , within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities , such as in cases where persons are under their control in custody , strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention . Indeed , the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation ( see , among many authorities , ORG , cited above LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the present case there was no news of Mr Islam Deniyev between his detention on DATE at the roadblock and the discovery of his remains in DATE . ORG also notes that although a forensic expert examination was carried out on the remains , it failed to establish the cause of his death ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not dispute the circumstances of the discovery of the remains . The link between the detention and the death of Mr Islam Deniyev was , moreover , assumed in the domestic proceedings as the investigations into the abduction and the death were joined ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Government did not provide any substantiated version of the events to refute the version presented by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The ORG finds that the facts of the present case strongly suggest that the death of Mr PERSON was part of the same sequence of events as his abduction and support the conclusion that he was executed extrajudicially by ORG agents . In these circumstances , the ORG finds that the ORG is responsible for the death of the applicants\u2019 relative .", "CARDINAL . For the above reasons the ORG considers that it has been established that Mr PERSON was killed following his unacknowledged detention by ORG servicemen ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
