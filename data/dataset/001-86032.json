The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was detained on suspicion of having committed a crime punishable under LAW ( attempted kidnapping by a group ) . A report on his detention stated that eyewitnesses , including victims , had identified him as the perpetrator and that other grounds existed for suspecting him of having committed the crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator ordered him to be detained pending trial pursuant to LAW . The investigator took into account the dangerousness and seriousness of the offence , the risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding and obstructing the investigation , and the need to examine his implication in other similar crimes . DATE , the order was upheld by the acting prosecutor of the north - east administrative district of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged on several counts , including the use of violence dangerous to life against a ORG official in the performance of his duties , attempted aggravated kidnapping by an organised group and conspiracy to murder . The investigation established that the applicant had entered into agreement with ORG , the head of an organised criminal group acting in GPE and LOC , and had commissioned him in DATE and then in DATE to beat F. and T. , who had occupied senior positions in the ORG office . F. had been beaten up by CARDINAL persons , the identity of CARDINAL of whom had not been established by the investigation , with baseball bats in the porch of his apartment block ; he had suffered open craniocerebral trauma as a result . T. had been beaten up and had received knife wounds . The investigation also established that later in DATE the applicant had commissioned the same organised group to kidnap PERSON . , for the purpose of blackmail . Each time the applicant had paid P. remuneration . He had allegedly acted on the instructions of a person whose identity had not been established by the investigation . As well as these CARDINAL criminal cases joined into CARDINAL case , the latter was joined with CARDINAL more case of infliction of bodily harm involving the same organised group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the investigator ordered that the term of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention be extended . He stated , inter alia , that it was necessary to carry out a range of investigation measures in order to establish the identity of other persons involved in the kidnapping of Sh . and to ascertain the applicant \u2019s participation in that crime , to finalise the preparation of the charges and to enable the applicant to examine the materials of the case file . The requests contained the circumstances of the crimes , as established by the investigation , and the description of evidence collected by the investigation . On DATE the prosecutor of the north - east administrative circuit of GPE approved the order of DATE and extended the term of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE . The investigator \u2019s order of DATE was supported by the prosecutor of the north - east administrative circuit of GPE and the prosecutor of GPE and was approved , on DATE , by a deputy prosecutor general , who extended the term of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s advocate challenged the detention as unlawful and unjustified . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE a judge of ORG of GPE dismissed the complaint . The judge found that the nature , seriousness and circumstances of the offences of which the applicant stood accused and their danger to the public warranted the detention orders . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator ordered a further extension of the applicant \u2019s detention . The order reflected the state of investigation in the case against the applicant and CARDINAL other persons including what had been done since the last extension of the applicant \u2019s detention . Thus , CARDINAL more accomplice in the crime against F. had been identified and arrested ; evidence of participation by several other individuals in the crime against ORG had been examined ; the defendants had examined expert reports ; and more documentary evidence had been collected . The investigator submitted that it was necessary to finalise the charges against the applicant and for him to examine the voluminous case file , which would require additional time . On the basis of those considerations and having regard to the seriousness of the offences of which the applicant stood accused , the investigator ordered the applicant \u2019s detention to be extended until DATE . The prosecutor of the north - east administrative circuit of GPE and the GPE prosecutor supported the order and on DATE a deputy prosecutor general approved it .", "CARDINAL . On a further request by the investigator , approved by the regional and city prosecutor , a deputy prosecutor general of GPE extended , on DATE , the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention further , until DATE , on the grounds that the applicant was liable to abscond , resume his criminal activity and obstruct the investigation and in view of the gravity of the offences of which the applicant stood accused and the need for him to examine the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the investigation in the case had been completed and the indictment approved , the case against the applicant and his co - defendants was transferred to ORG for trial .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of a judge of ORG of DATE the hearing was set down for DATE and an order was made for the applicant \u2019s continued detention . The applicant did not appeal against the decision .", "CARDINAL . Between DATE and DATE the hearing was adjourned for reasons attributable to the applicant \u2019s co - defendants .", "CARDINAL . The trial commenced on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer of CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s codefendants , PERSON PERSON , lodged an application seeking an order for his client to be made the subject of an outpatient psychiatric examination . The application was supported by all the other defendants and their lawyers . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court granted the application and adjourned the hearing , first until DATE and then until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a further application by PERSON PERSON \u2019s lawyer , supported by all the other defendants , the court ordered that PERSON PERSON be made the subject of an inpatient psychiatric examination with a view to determining whether he could be held responsible for the offences of which he stood accused . It also adjourned the hearing until the experts\u2019 report was available and ordered that the applicant should remain in custody .", "CARDINAL . The experts\u2019 report on PERSON PERSON \u2019s condition was issued on DATE and DATE Mr PERSON was brought back to his detention facility , of which the court was informed .", "CARDINAL . The trial recommenced on DATE and was then adjourned until DATE , owing to the illness of CARDINAL of the defendants and the need to summon witnesses . The hearing was held on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutor lodged an application , based on expert opinion , seeking an order for Mr PERSON to receive compulsory inpatient psychiatric treatment and requesting the postponement of the proceedings in consequence . On DATE the court granted the prosecutor \u2019s request and ordered that Mr Grachev undergo compulsory inpatient psychiatric treatment until his condition improved . The court further ruled that the examination of the case against the other defendants , separately from Mr PERSON \u2019s case , would undermine the thoroughness and objectivity of the trial . The court therefore adjourned examination of the case until PERSON health condition had improved . The court stated that it took into account PERSON diagnosis , which did not require lengthy inpatient treatment for him .", "CARDINAL . Submitting no objections to that decision , the applicant however requested to be released , subject to an undertaking not to leave his place of residence , referring to the uncertainty as to the duration of PERSON PERSON \u2019s treatment , his own lack of previous convictions , his permanent place of residence in GPE , the fact that he had a wife and small child dependent upon him for support and the fact that his state of health required regular examinations by specialists of a kind not available at the detention facility . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the request for release made by the applicant and his CARDINAL co - defendants on the ground of the seriousness of the offences of which they stood accused .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s lawyers lodged an appeal against this decision , requesting that the applicant be released from custody and instead , as a preventive measure , be required to give an undertaking not to leave his place of residence . They pointed once again to the uncertainty as to the duration of Mr PERSON \u2019s treatment , during which time the case would lie dormant , and to the length of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , which had begun in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s lawyer also lodged an appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . Relying on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , he complained that the unlimited extension of the pre - trial detention of his client and the other defendants in the case , including the applicant , constituted an unlawful and excessive restriction of their rights , which completely disregarded their right to liberty . In practice , the decision of CARDINAL DATE anticipated , by means of pre - trial detention , their future conviction and punishment , in breach of the principle of presumption of innocence . The lawyer also argued that the order extending the GPE pre - trial detention for an indefinite DATE until the as yet unknown date of Mr PERSON \u2019s recovery \u2013 exceeded permissible restrictions on human rights and freedoms .", "CARDINAL . DATE the appeals were not examined as one of the defence lawyers was on DATE leave . On DATE ORG of GPE dismissed both appeals and upheld the decision . It stated that the lower court had taken into account the experts\u2019 opinion of the short - term character of PERSON PERSON \u2019s disease and ordered his compulsory treatment in accordance with the law , which provided that such treatment could be ordered if a person \u2019s mental state posed a danger to that person and others and required permanent and intensive observation . ORG held that the reasons given in support of the request for the applicant \u2019s release could not be considered cogent as the applicant stood accused of serious crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the case file had been returned to the trial court , the hearing was set down for DATE , and then adjourned to DATE owing to the failure of the defence lawyers to appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court , having heard evidence from the defence , who had requested the release of the applicant and his CARDINAL codefendants and substitution of the detention measure with another preventive measure not involving deprivation of liberty , granted the prosecutor \u2019s request and extended the pre - trial detention of the applicant and his co - defendants until DATE . The court gave as reasons for its decision the fact that the applicant and his co - defendants had been charged with a particularly serious offence ( conspiracy to murder by an organised group with aggravated circumstances ) and that there were no grounds for annulling or altering the preventive measure chosen . By a decision of DATE , at the prosecutor \u2019s request , a further extension in respect of the same persons was ordered until DATE , on the same ground . The court further referred to a decision of a medical committee of DATE to terminate PERSON PERSON \u2019s compulsory treatment . The applicant did not appeal against these decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial resumed . On DATE the court , at the prosecutor \u2019s request , ordered Mr PERSON to be made the subject of an inpatient psychiatric expert examination with a view to determining whether he could be held responsible for the offences of which he stood accused , and extended the pre - trial detention of the applicant and CARDINAL other defendants until DATE on the ground of the seriousness of the offences of which they stood accused .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s psychiatric expert examination was carried out on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the hearing in the case be held on DATE . On that date it ordered that the pre - trial detention of the applicant and CARDINAL other defendants be extended from DATE until DATE inclusive , on the ground that they were accused of particularly serious offences and were liable to abscond and obstructir respective personalities . The court stated in its decision that it had had no opportunity to discuss the question of the preventive measure in respect of the applicant and the other defendants , whose pre - trial detention had previously been extended until DATE . The court noted that the case file had been kept throughout this period at the expert institution which had carried out Mr PERSON \u2019s psychiatric examination .", "CARDINAL . Between DATE and DATE and on DATE the hearing was adjourned for reasons imputable to the applicant \u2019s co - defendants . The hearing in the case ended on DATE and the court started its deliberations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment in the case against the applicant and CARDINAL other defendants . The applicant was convicted of attempted kidnapping as part of an organised group , inciting malfeasance in public office and aiding and abetting an assault on a ORG official . The prosecutor dropped some other charges against him , including conspiracy to murder by an organised group with aggravated circumstances . The applicant was acquitted on the remaining charges . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The period of his pre - trial detention commencing on CARDINAL DATE was counted towards the term of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged against the judgment , which came into effect on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE ordered the applicant \u2019s early conditional release .", "CARDINAL .
