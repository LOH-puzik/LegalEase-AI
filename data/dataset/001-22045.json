THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , has both NORP and NORP nationality . He was born in DATE and is living in GPE , the GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant , when living in GPE , entered into a traditional / religious marriage ( i.e. a non - civil marriage ) with a NORP woman . Out of this relationship twins were born in DATE , PERSON and GPE PERSON . In DATE the relationship between the applicant and his partner ended . The applicant submits that their mother did not wish to continue to take care of the twins and that he has since taken care of them . He has not been in contact with the mother since and her whereabouts are unknown to him .", "In DATE the applicant entered the GPE for the first time . On DATE he was expelled from the GPE on the grounds that he was staying in the country illegally .", "On DATE the applicant married Ms. PERSON , a NORP national . The wedding took place in GPE and the couple lived there for a short period together with the applicant \u2019s children . At DATE the applicant \u2019s wife decided to move back to the GPE . The applicant followed her and entered the GPE on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant obtained a residence permit to stay with his wife . CARDINAL child was born to the applicant and Ms. PERSON . Their marriage lasted until DATE , when it was dissolved . On CARDINAL May CARDINAL the applicant obtained NORP nationality .", "On DATE the applicant married Ms. PERSON . They were divorced on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant entered into a traditional / religious marriage with Ms. PERSON of NORP nationality . Ms. PERSON has since obtained NORP nationality . On DATE they concluded a cohabitation contract ( samenlevingscontract ) .", "The applicant submits that his CARDINAL former partners , Ms. PERSON and Ms. PERSON , did not want to have his children brought into the family and refused to take care of their upbringing , whereas Ms. PERSON had no objection to taking care of them and loves them as if they were her own . The applicant further submits that he was unable to let the children come to the GPE earlier as this would have been refused on the grounds of his lack of sufficient means of subsistence as required under NORP law .", "Upon the applicant \u2019s departure from GPE , his CARDINAL children were initially , and temporarily , housed with a friend of the applicant \u2019s in GPE . After DATE the children could no longer be taken care of by that friend and had to move to the house of another friend - a Mr Aboya - who , after having started a family of his own , no longer wanted to take care of the applicant \u2019s children .", "The applicant submits that his friends merely provided temporary accommodation for his children and were not effectively exercising parental authority over them . He took parental decisions , and he also paid all his children \u2019s living expenses . From DATE he has been visiting his children CARDINAL times per year , being employed by an airline company enabling him to travel at cheaper rates .", "The relation between the applicant and PERSON worsened when he discovered that in the latter \u2019s family , funds , which he had sent for his children , were used for other purposes . Thus , money intended to cover school fees was allegedly appropriated by PERSON , as a result of which the children were unable to go to school in GPE .", "In DATE the then DATE twins travelled to the GPE on a tourist visa . They have been living with the applicant and Ms. PERSON ever since . On DATE the applicant applied for a residence permit ( vergunning tot verblijf ) for his children .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) rejected the request , finding that the conditions under which family reunification could be allowed had not been fulfilled . Thus , no evidence had been produced either as to the existence of family ties prior to the applicant \u2019s residence in the GPE , or of contacts between the father and the children having been maintained . Neither was there any evidence that the applicant had supported his children financially . The ORG Secretary noted , inter alia , that the applicant , since his arrival in the GPE , had formed a new family twice . The situation in GPE was not found to be of such a nature that the children could not return there , and neither had they become integrated in the GPE to such an extent that a return to GPE could not be expected of them .", "On DATE the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the ORG Secretary against his decision . On DATE the ORG Secretary rejected the objection , finding that the family ties between father and children had been broken in view of the fact that the applicant \u2019s leaving the twins in the care of friends for DATE could not be considered to have been a temporary measure . The ORG Secretary concluded that even if the situation in GPE was less favourable for the children than the one in the GPE , they should nevertheless be presumed capable of fending for themselves without requiring intensive supervision and , if necessary , with financial support from the GPE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) sitting in GPE . He argued that the interpretation given by the domestic authorities of \u201c family \u201d was not in line with LAW and the case - law of the Court . He further emphasised the difficulties which his children would face if returned to GPE , with no adequate accommodation or care , whereas he was capable of taking care of them in the GPE .", "On DATE a person responsible for the children at school reported that they were suffering emotional problems as a result of their experiences in GPE and that especially PERSON would benefit from a social rehabilitation programme .", "On DATE a hearing took place before ORG during which it appeared that , contrary to earlier statements by the applicant , the children had stayed with their grandmother in GPE for DATE and that regular contacts also existed between the children and their mother .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . It held that the burden of proof as to the continued existence of family ties lay with the applicant and that he had failed to produce sufficient evidence of such family ties . In addition , no evidence confirming the applicant \u2019s financial support or the actual exercise of parental authority over the children had been produced .", "In respect of LAW found that the current level of family life between the applicant and his children had been created at a time when the children were not allowed to be in the GPE . Therefore , the decision to refuse them residence was not aimed at depriving them of a previously granted right to family reunification . ORG concluded that LAW did not impose a positive obligation on the ORG to respect an alien \u2019s choice to exercise his family life in the GPE . It was further held that sufficient facilities for the care of the children existed in GPE .", "On DATE temporary guardianship ( voorlopige voogdij ) of the applicant \u2019s daughter GPE was attributed by the ORG Judge ( kinderrechter ) of PERSON to a child care organisation , on the grounds that the applicant was not properly fulfilling his parental duties .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) filed a request with ORG ( kantongerecht ) of PERSON for the applicant nevertheless to be awarded parental authority ( ouderlijk gezag ) over his daughter GPE .", "On DATE ORG judge awarded the applicant parental authority over his daughter GPE and issued a supervision order ( ondertoezichtstelling ) whereby a child care organisation was charged with providing the applicant and his daughter the necessary support .", "On DATE ORG ( GPE ) of GPE confiscated the children \u2019s passports and ordered them to leave the country .", "LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) provides that a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) is required for an alien who wishes remain in the GPE for a period of DATE .", "The policy for admission for family reunification purposes is laid down in LAW of FAC ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) . This provides , insofar as relevant , that a residence permit for the purposes of family reunification may be granted to a parent of NORP nationality with minor children , when the children factually belong to his / her family and family ties with one of the parents already existed abroad . Family ties are considered to have definitely ceased to exist in case of long - term integration of the child into another family while the parent(s ) no longer exercise parental authority and no longer provide for the cost of upbringing and care of the child ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
