Mr PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE , resides at GPE , in the ORG department ; he is a farmer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE police officers ( gendarmes ) arrested him and seized at his home various articles and documents , in particular arms and ammunition . They were acting in connection with an inquiry into a bomb attack carried out in TIME CARDINAL DATE against ORG police station ( gendarmerie ) , responsibility for which was subsequently claimed by Iparretarrak , a clandestine NORP separatist movement .", "CARDINAL . The following day a GPE investigating judge remanded the applicant in custody after having charged him under the following CARDINAL heads : first , unauthorised possession of a category I weapon and category I ammunition , transport without a lawful reason of such a weapon and ammunition and of a category VI weapon , possession without a lawful reason of incendiary devices and criminal conspiracy ; second , using explosives to cause criminal damage to another person \u2019s immoveable property , in connection with an earlier attack against another police station - then under construction - , that of ORG , in TIME to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL sets of proceedings were conducted in parallel both as regards review of the detention on remand and for the investigation and trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG investigating judge dismissed an application for release which Mr PERSON had submitted to him .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant , ORG ( chambre d\u2019accusation ) of ORG upheld the investigating judge \u2019s order , on DATE , on the following grounds :", "\" ...", "... PERSON said that he was a member of Iparretarrak , admitted ownership of the arms , ammunition and unlawful or suspect articles found in the cars and at his home , stated that the electrical mechanisms were to be used by the organisation for the detonation of explosives at targets of which he was unaware and acknowledged having even participated as driver in the expedition of CARDINAL - CARDINAL DATE , the objective of which had been the police barracks under construction at ORG , which were partly destroyed that night by explosives .", "PERSON was therefore properly charged and remanded in custody , when brought before the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE , in respect of CARDINAL investigations :", "- the first concerns a charge of using explosives to cause criminal damage to another person \u2019s immoveable property ( in connection with the destruction of the NORP police station ) ;", "- the second , which is the subject of the prosecution report before us , concerns charges of unauthorised possession of a category I weapon and category I ammunition , transport without a lawful reason of such a weapon and ammunition and of a category VI weapon , possession without a lawful reason of incendiary devices and criminal conspiracy .", "...", "When he was interviewed as to the substance of the charges on DATE , ORG , who had admitted the offences when he first appeared , refused to make any further statements .", "Expert examinations were carried out on the firearm and the ammunition seized , which were of the same type as those normally used by the NORP revolutionary group , Iparretarrak .", "The alleged offences are therefore manifestly serious ones and in the light of the available evidence the accused \u2019s continued detention on remand is fully justified in order to prevent him from absconding since he could go into hiding like other members of the organisation . Detention is also the only means of ensuring that he does not re - offend . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG was composed of Mr Svahn , President , PERSON and PERSON , judges , appointed on DATE by the general assembly of ORG ( Article CARDINAL , fourth sub - paragraph , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared void the flagrante delicto investigation concerning PERSON , as well as all the subsequent proceedings . It found as follows :", "\" ...", "The flagrante delicto procedure confers on police officers by way of exception some of the widest powers of the investigating judge , including those which seriously encroach on individual freedoms such as the inviolability of a person \u2019s home . That is why a strict interpretation is called for of the criteria authorising what are \u2018 veritable investigative powers\u2019 ( PERSON and PERSON , ORG p\u00e9nal g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale , DATE edition , volume II , no . CARDINAL ) .", "Admittedly LAW , which defines the conditions for an investigation under the flagrante delicto procedure , does not indicate any time - limit for such an investigation , with the result that the surprisingly long duration - QUANTITY days - of that carried out following the criminal bomb attack at GPE is not sufficient to entail its nullity , but this extension beyond the usual period in such circumstances exposed the police officers to the risk of losing sight of the conditions laid down in the relevant provision . Thus the measures taken by them against PERSON are open to the following criticisms :", "In the first place , for the period from DATE QUANTITY January TIME no measure is mentioned in the recapitulatory report and no official record appears in the file of the proceedings . This interruption of over twenty- TIME removed any justification for the very prolonged continuation of the inquiry under the flagrante delicto procedure .", "Secondly , the attention of the police officers was finally drawn to PERSON not only because he was known to be sympathetic to the NORP separatist movements , but also by the information received on DATE that this new suspect sometimes drove a ORG CARDINAL of the same colour as a ORG which had been noticed in a street of GPE on TIME of the attack . Yet it is \u2018 within a very short time after DATE ( LAW ORG [ Code of Criminal Procedure ] ) that the persons suspected must manifest \u2018 marks or ORG and this temporal condition can not be regarded as satisfied where the clue which led the investigators to ORG home was only discovered by them DATE after the offences had been committed .", "Finally , there can be no doubt that the procedural irregularity justifiably complained of has caused prejudice to the accused . The defence is therefore well - founded in claiming that the search which led to the discovery of various articles for the possession of which ORG is charged and which led to the confessions relied on by the prosecution was void . \"", "CARDINAL .

[ , whereby the appellant alleges as follows ] :", "\u2018 In so far as it appears from the interlocutory decision of DATE that ORG was composed of PERSON , sitting as President , and PERSON and PERSON , judges ;", "in the first place , these judges had sat in the same case as members of the indictment division which , in CARDINAL decisions dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE , had confirmed orders refusing the applicant \u2019s release ; having thus been involved in the case at the stage of the investigation , they were precluded by virtue of the provisions of LAW from subsequently participating in the trial and ruling on whether the offence had been committed and on the accused \u2019s guilt ;", "secondly , LAW provides that \u2018 everyone is entitled to a ... hearing ... by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law ... \u2019 . ORG has already held that impartiality must be assessed according to an objective test making it possible to affirm that a court affords sufficient guarantees to rule out any legitimate doubts in this respect ; that was not the case in this instance , since , having given on QUANTITY occasions , as members of an indictment division , decisions confirming orders refusing the applicant \u2019s release , these judges had necessarily carried out a preliminary examination of the merits and adopted a position on the value of the evidence and clues against the accused , so that they were precluded from subsequently participating in the trial and ruling on whether the offence had been committed and the accused \u2019s ORG ;", "The fact that judges of ORG which gave the contested decisions had , in the same case , as members of ORG , previously ruled on the accused \u2019s detention on remand is not a ground for quashing a judgment , since no statutory provision prohibits on pain of nullity the members of the indictment division which has given such a ruling from subsequently sitting in ORG before which the case comes and , furthermore , such participation is not contrary to the requirement of impartiality laid down in DATE ( article CARDINAL ) of LAW ... ;", "Accordingly , ORG is satisfied that the court was lawfully composed ;", "The submission must therefore fail . \"", "The second submission concerned the lack of a statement of reasons , the failure to reply to final submissions , the lack of a legal basis and the violation of the rights of the defence ( Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention ) .", "The remaining submissions were founded on the lack of a record of the oath of the CARDINAL witnesses who testified at the appeal hearing on DATE ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) as well as the failure to state reasons and the lack of a legal basis for the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG CARDINAL of the Criminal Code and CARDINAL of LAW ) , and not the lawfulness of the composition of ORG in these proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
