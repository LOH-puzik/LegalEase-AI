As of DATE , he has been serving a prison sentence in GPE prison no . CARDINAL . The second applicant is his wife who was born in DATE . She lives in Horlivka with her mother , the third applicant , who was born in DATE . The fourth applicant , the mother of the first applicant , was born in DATE and died on DATE . The first applicant expressed wish to pursue his mother \u2019s complaints on her behalf .", "CARDINAL . At TIME DATE , shortly after TIME , the second applicant had a conflict with a police officer , PERSON , who was a colleague of her husband .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant \u2019s account of the events was as follows . When walking in the street with a friend , PERSON , she heard somebody running after them . That person pushed her on the shoulder . Having turned , she saw PERSON , whom she knew . He was wearing plain clothes and appeared to be heavily drunk . When she asked him what the matter was , PERSON shouted that he would subject her to a body search , without explanation . He snatched her bag from her . Having searched its contents , he threw it on the ground . Then PERSON grabbed the second applicant by the neck and started strangling her . In reply to her protests , he noted that the local prosecutor was there next to him and that it was pointless to complain . He hit the second applicant twice in the head with something heavy , which , in her opinion , could have been a mobile phone . At that moment the first applicant telephoned his wife \u2019s friend PERSON , who was then with her , to find out whether everything was fine ( as his wife had not returned home at the expected time and was not answering his telephone calls ) . Having found out about the incident , the first applicant went there . PERSON threatened him in a rude manner with dismissal . He let the second applicant go only after CARDINAL other police officers in plain clothes , who happened to be there , approached them .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant \u2019s friend PERSON supported the above version of events . However , eventually she specified that PERSON had not been strangling the second applicant , but had simply held her and not let her leave .", "CARDINAL . M. \u2019s version of the events was as follows . He was walking in the street with an acquaintance , ORG , a businessman , after the celebration of the professional holiday of police inspectors . They met CARDINAL colleagues of PERSON and stopped to talk with them . CARDINAL women passed by . PERSON thought that one of them was a certain PERSON , who was under administrative supervision and was not supposed to be out of her home so late . He went to ask her what she was doing there . However , having approached her , he realised that he had been mistaken . He recognised the second applicant and apologised for his mistake . The second applicant , who appeared to be heavily drunk , started insulting and pushing him . PERSON submitted that he had not touched her . As regards the possible origin of her injuries , he noted that she had had serious incidents in the past with her husband and that those injuries might have been inflicted by him . As regards the fact that the plastic bag that she had had in her hands had been torn , he explained it by her intense gesticulating .", "CARDINAL . M. \u2019s version was supported by the statements of his friend PERSON and the CARDINAL police officers , who had been there .", "CARDINAL . Having come home , the second applicant called an ambulance . She was diagnosed with several bruises on her neck and situational neurosis . She explained that she had been strangled by a police officer . In the presence of an ambulance paramedic , the second applicant called the police . According to the Government , she did not mention that PERSON was a law - enforcement official . The second applicant contested that submission .", "CARDINAL . In TIME on DATE the second applicant was examined by a neuropathologist who diagnosed her with concussion and bruises on her neck , and prescribed outpatient medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police issued a ruling refusing to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the second applicant \u2019s complaint . It noted that she had complained to the police at CARDINAL a.m. on DATE of having been hit by an acquaintance . As further stated in the ruling , it had been impossible to question her , as she had never been at home when visited by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant complained about the incident to the NORP town prosecutor \u2019s office ( \u201c the NORP prosecutor \u2019s office \u201d ) . She requested that the investigation not be entrusted to the NORP district prosecutor \u2019s office ( \u201c the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office \u201d ) , given that CARDINAL of its officials had allegedly been with PERSON at the time of the events and that PERSON had referred to that fact as a guarantee of his impunity ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The second applicant submitted that there had been no attempts by the authorities to contact them with a view to hearing their version of the events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP prosecutor \u2019s office forwarded her complaint to the PERSON prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant gave a written account of the incident to the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office . On DATE that authority quashed the refusal of DATE . It noted that the investigation had wrongly been entrusted to the NORP police despite the fact that the second applicant \u2019s complaint concerned her alleged ill - treatment by CARDINAL of its officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police officer who had been on duty during the night from DATE was disciplined for not having followed up the second applicant \u2019s call ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office refused to initiate criminal proceedings against ORG under LAW ( exceeding individual power by engaging in violent or degrading treatment of a victim ) , having held that there were no constituent elements of a crime discernible in his actions . The prosecutor noted that the second applicant \u2019s allegation was supported by the statements of her husband and her friend . However , there were also statements of PERSON and the witnesses from his side , who denied any ill - treatment of the second applicant . The prosecutor therefore found her allegation to be unsubstantiated . It was also noted in the ruling that at the time of the events PERSON had been wearing civilian clothes and had not been acting as a law - enforcement official . Lastly , it was observed that the second applicant had ignored numerous summonses for questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office annulled its refusal of DATE as premature . It noted , in particular , that not all the relevant facts had been established . Furthermore , there had been no forensic medical expert examination of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant underwent such an examination , which documented no visible injuries . Having analysed her medical file , the expert concluded that she had sustained a bruise on her neck and a craniocerebral injury which led to concussion . Those injuries , assessed as insignificant , had resulted from \u201c contact with blunt objects \u201d at the time indicated by the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office once again refused to open a criminal case against PERSON for lack of the constituent elements of a crime in his actions . It relied , in particular , on the ORG statements , according to which ORG had not ill - treated the second applicant . Furthermore , the prosecutor noted that PERSON had not acted in his official capacity and that the injuries sustained by the second applicant had been insignificant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a senior official of the same prosecutor \u2019s office annulled the above ruling as premature . He noted , in particular , that an additional forensic medical examination was required with a view to verifying the second applicant \u2019s allegation that she had been hit in the head with a mobile phone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor ordered such an examination of the second applicant with a view to answering the following questions : ( CARDINAL ) how exactly could her injuries have been inflicted ; ( CARDINAL ) whether there were marks on her head possibly resulting from blows with a mobile phone ; ( CARDINAL ) whether she could have sustained the injuries in question in the circumstances as she alleged ; and ( CARDINAL ) when exactly she had sustained the injuries in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a forensic medical expert examination report was issued . It answered the above questions as follows : ( CARDINAL ) the craniocerebral injury and the bruise on the neck had resulted from contact with blunt objects ; ( CARDINAL ) neither the examination of the second applicant nor the evaluation of the medical file had established any injuries to her head ( apparently , implying visible injuries ) ; ( CARDINAL ) the second applicant \u2019s injuries could have been inflicted on her in the circumstances described ; and ( CARDINAL ) according to the medical documents , the second applicant could have sustained the injuries on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office delivered yet another ruling refusing to open a criminal case in respect of the second applicant \u2019s complaints . Having relied on the forensic medical examination reports and the ORG statements , the prosecutor stated that her allegation had not been sufficiently corroborated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE regional prosecutor \u2019s office ( \u201c the regional prosecutor \u2019s office \u201d ) annulled the above ruling as premature and based on an incomplete investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office again refused to institute criminal proceedings against PERSON It was stated in the ruling that the forensic medical expert evaluations of DATE and DATE refuted the second applicant \u2019s allegations . Furthermore , the prosecutor noted that the second applicant had refused to give her account during the additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant challenged the above refusal before ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on CARDINAL occasions ( on DATE and CARDINAL DATE and on DATE ) . Her complaints were forwarded to the regional prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office wrote to her that it agreed with the lower prosecution authority \u2019s decision . As further stated in the letter , it was open for her to challenge that decision before the courts if she so wished .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant underwent knee surgery . From DATE to DATE he underwent a follow - up course of outpatient medical treatment in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ( illegible in the available copy ) the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office sent a summons to the first applicant at his registered residence ( his mother \u2019s home ) , instructing him to come to the prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE . It is not clear whether it was issued in the context of the criminal investigation in respect of the complaints by the first applicant \u2019s wife ( see above ) or whether it was rather related to the subsequent criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office opened a criminal case against the first applicant on suspicion of abuse of power and forgery committed in his capacity as a law - enforcement official in DATE . More specifically , on DATE the local court had informed the prosecutor of some factual inaccuracies in a report on an administrative ( minor ) offence , which had been drawn up by the first applicant . The latter was suspected of having forged that report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office informed the first applicant of the above decision by a letter sent to the address where he was de facto living with his wife ( separately from their parents ) . It was also noted in the letter that he had to come to the prosecutor \u2019s office to receive a copy of the decision and for questioning .", "CARDINAL . Still on DATE , DATE , the prosecutor ordered the NORP police to ensure the first applicant \u2019s presence for investigative measures . On DATE the police informed the investigator that it was impossible to comply with the above order given that the first applicant had been found neither at the address of his usual residence nor at his mother \u2019s flat . When they had also gone to enquire about his whereabouts with his parents - in - law , the third applicant \u201c had attacked them hysterically \u201d , which made the police believe that the first applicant might be hiding there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG ordered the first applicant \u2019s arrest with a view to bringing him before the court to examine the issue of a preventive measure in his regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was declared wanted by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he wrote to the regional prosecutor \u2019s office that , following the incident with his wife , the Kalyninskyy police had been threatening him and his family with his dismissal , criminal prosecution , or even a fatal accident . He therefore sought that the ORG prosecutor withdraw from the case . He also submitted that he was scared even to go to the hospital as some suspicious - looking persons had been loitering near his home . The first applicant indicated as his address that of his mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator visited the first applicant \u2019s mother ( the fourth applicant ) at her home and asked her whether she knew where the first applicant was . She stated that he had been living separately from her for DATE and that she was not aware of his whereabouts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she sent to the investigator the first applicant \u2019s request of DATE to admit her to the proceedings as his representative and to give her a copy of the ruling of DATE initiating the criminal investigation against him . In substantiation of that request , the first applicant stated that he was restricted in his movement following knee surgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief of medicine of ORG informed the investigator , in reply to the latter \u2019s enquiry , that the last time the first applicant had come to the hospital had been DATE and that the hospital administration did not know how he could be reached .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the internal security unit of the NORP police wrote to the prosecutor that it had information that the first applicant had been secretly visiting the flats of his parents and parents - in - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor wrote to the first applicant at his mother \u2019s address , indicating that the latter could not be admitted in the proceedings as his representative at such an early stage . The prosecutor indicated that the first applicant was on the wanted list and that he needed to show up to receive copies of the rulings in respect of the institution of the criminal proceedings against him and for his questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor sent another letter to the first applicant , informing him that another criminal case had been opened against him on that date on suspicion of abuse of power by a law - enforcement official and forgery in office and that he had to come to the prosecutor \u2019s office to get a copy of that decision and for questioning .", "CARDINAL . During the period from DATE to DATE further QUANTITY criminal cases were opened against the first applicant on additional counts of abuse of office , as well as on suspicion of bribe - taking . He was suspected of having committed those offences in order to report better results to his superiors and thus be entitled to additional remuneration and promotions . The first applicant was informed of each such decision by a letter sent to his mother \u2019s address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant complained to the ORG that his numerous requests for the ORG prosecutor to withdraw had been ignored . He further submitted that he required protection measures as \u201c a person who had reported a crime \u201d . Lastly , the first applicant requested that the prosecutor annul the decision on placing him on the wanted list \u201c so that [ he ] could defend himself against the criminal charges and continue [ his ] medical treatment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office wrote to the first applicant that his complaints had been dismissed as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was arrested at the address where he lived with his wife . The investigator relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and substantiated the arrest as follows : the first applicant had been on the wanted list since DATE , had impeded the establishment of the truth and had committed serious criminal offences . It was also noted in the arrest report that the first applicant was suspected of offences under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( abuse of power or office by a law - enforcement official ) , CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( forgery in office ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( bribe - taking ) of LAW . The investigator drew up a report on the explanation to the first applicant of his procedural rights . The first applicant refused to sign it . He also refused to make any submissions as regards the charges against him .", "DATE . On DATE ORG extended the term of the first applicant \u2019s arrest to DATE on the grounds that the case file lacked information about his character . That ruling was not amenable to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the same court ordered the first applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention as a preventive measure , \u201c having regard to the seriousness and circumstances of the crimes committed and the character of [ the first applicant ] \u201d , without further details .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed . He submitted that his remand in custody was not based on sufficient and relevant reasons . He noted that he had been arrested at his home , where he had been living for DATE , and that he had not absconded . He noted that the reasoning in support of his pre - trial detention had been overly formalistic . Thus , although the court had referred to his character , it had failed to specify what exactly in his character had justified his detention as the most appropriate preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashed the ruling of CARDINAL DATE and released the first applicant subject to an undertaking not to leave the town . It found that the first - instance court had not given reasons as to the necessity to choose the strictest preventive measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kalyninskyy Court found the first applicant guilty of fraud , abuse of power in his capacity of a law - enforcement official , forgery causing grave consequences , and bribe - taking , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment with a ban to occupy posts in law - enforcement authorities , and confiscation of his personal property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment in the part concerning the forgery charge and remitted it to the first - instance court for a fresh examination . It upheld the judgment in the remaining part , having slightly reclassified some of the charges and having reduced the term of the first applicant \u2019s imprisonment to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again found the applicant guilty of forgery causing grave consequences and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The final sentence was DATE imprisonment , as the most severe of the applicant \u2019s punishments absorbed the more lenient one . In the absence of any appeals , the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the appellate court \u2019s ruling of DATE in the part concerning the first applicant \u2019s conviction ( the part concerning the remittal of the case to the first - instance court remained in force ) and remitted the case for fresh appellate examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appellate court upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in so far as it concerned the first applicant \u2019s conviction for abuse of power in his capacity as a law - enforcement official and his sentencing to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . As regards the other charges ( with the exception of that dealt with by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE see paragraph DATE above ) , they were slightly reclassified and the first applicant had the penalty in respect of that part removed .", "CARDINAL . The case file does not contain any further information as regards the criminal proceedings against the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator applied to ORG for authorisation to search the first applicant \u2019s registered residence ( the flat of the fourth applicant ) . It was stated in the application that on DATE the first applicant had drawn up a report on an administrative ( minor ) offence in respect of unauthorised street trading by a private individual . As subsequently established , the information in that report had not been accurate , which had led to the institution of criminal proceedings against the first applicant on suspicion of abuse of power and forgery . The investigator considered that \u201c some items and documents relevant for establishing the truth \u201d in the case could be found in the first applicant \u2019s residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in a final ruling , allowed the above application , having reiterated the investigator \u2019s reasoning and description of the search \u2019s scope . It relied on LAW ORG ( follow the references in paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator applied to ORG for authorisation to search the second applicant \u2019s registered residence ( the flat of the third applicant ) . The text of the application was identical to that submitted on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police knocked at the third applicant \u2019s door . She and her husband were at home , but did not let the police in .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant \u2019s account of the events of DATE is as follows . A group of CARDINAL to QUANTITY persons , including police officers and some suspicious - looking persons , came to her flat . They knocked at the entrance door in a violent manner , demanding to be let in . The third applicant \u2019s husband went out and asked them for a search warrant or another document authorising their actions , but no such document was produced . The police threatened the third applicant and her husband that they would break in and that they would find a pretext to criminally prosecute the entire family . They stayed on the stairs and in the yard and shouted for TIME .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG \u2019s version , CARDINAL police officers went to the third applicant \u2019s flat . They informed her about the criminal proceedings against the first applicant and enquired as to his whereabouts . As she and her husband refused to cooperate , the police left .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the investigator \u2019s application of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Its ruling was identical to that delivered on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police carried out a search at the flat of the third applicant . According to her , they broke the entrance door using an electric saw . The third applicant further alleged that the police had not shown a search warrant to her . CARDINAL attesting witnesses were present . According to the third applicant , they were acquaintances of the police officers .", "CARDINAL . As indicated in the search report , it lasted from TIME to CARDINAL p.m. The police seized a number of documents related to the first applicant \u2019s work . Furthermore , they seized a mobile telephone , which did not have a ORG card , together with its box . Lastly , they found and seized a package appearing to contain cannabis . According to the third applicant , it had been planted by the police .", "DATE . On DATE the police conducted a search of the flat of the fourth applicant . They discovered and seized some documents which were deemed to be related to the criminal investigation in respect of the first applicant . According to the first and fourth applicants , those documents had been brought there by the police themselves DATE . The fourth applicant submitted that the officers , whom she knew as colleagues of her son , had explained to her that , following an attack on their police station , they had not had a safe place to store the documents , which had been intended in any event for handing over to the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an expert established that the package discovered in the third applicant \u2019s flat on DATE contained cannabis . On DATE the NORP police refused to institute criminal proceedings in that regard , having held that it had been impossible to establish to whom the cannabis might have belonged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed another application to search the first applicant \u2019s registered residence ( the flat of the fourth applicant ) given that the investigator had information that the first applicant might be hiding there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police conducted a search of the fourth applicant \u2019s flat on the basis of the court ruling of DATE . As indicated in the search report , the police were searching for \u201c items , valuables and documents related to the criminal activity of [ the first applicant ] \u201d . The search did not discover anything of interest for the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The third and fourth applicants requested many times that ORG provide them with copies of the rulings authorising the searches of their flats . The president of the court replied that the searches had been carried out in compliance with the ORG and that sending a copy of the respective court rulings was not provided for by the legislation .", "CARDINAL . The third and fourth applicants also complained many times to the prosecution authorities of the unlawfulness of the searches . They submitted , in particular , that the police had been rude and intrusive , that the attesting witnesses had not been independent , and that it was not clear what the police had actually been looking for .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP prosecutor \u2019s office refused to open a criminal case in respect of the police officers involved in the operation of DATE and the searches of CARDINAL and DATE , with the generally couched reasoning that there had been no violations of law . It appears that the applicants were unaware of that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following complaints by the third and fourth applicants , the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the judge of ORG in respect of the rulings authorising the searches of their flats .", "DATE . On DATE the third applicant got acquainted with the ruling of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It is not known whether , and if so when , the fourth applicant got access to the respective rulings of DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a local heating company initiated civil proceedings against the first and fourth applicants , who had their registered domicile at the same address , for debt recovery . The domestic courts found against the applicants .
