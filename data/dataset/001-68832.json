THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicants are CARDINAL siblings , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and ORG , and their mother PERSON . The latter was born in DATE and the other applicants in DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively . All applicants are NORP nationals and live in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr J.M.M. Verstrepen , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE , PERSON ( the fifth applicant ) married Mr Benamar in GPE , where both of them were living and continued to live after their marriage . The first CARDINAL applicants were born out of this marriage .", "On DATE , PERSON marriage with PERSON was dissolved in GPE . PERSON waived her rights and obligations vis\u00e0 - vis her husband and the CARDINAL children . The court that pronounced the divorce entrusted the care and custody of the CARDINAL children to Mr Benamar .", "On DATE , PERSON remarried in the GPE . Her new husband , PERSON PERSON , is a NORP national living in the GPE and holder of a permanent residence permit . On the basis of this marriage , PERSON was granted a GPE residence permit .", "On DATE , Mr Benamar died in GPE . On DATE , after a NORP court had entrusted her with the care and custody of the CARDINAL children , PERSON travelled to GPE and , on DATE , returned to the GPE with the CARDINAL children .", "On DATE , the CARDINAL children applied for a GPE residence permit for the purpose of stay with their mother .", "In CARDINAL separate decisions taken on DATE , the head of police ( korpschef ) of the Middle and GPE region rejected these requests . The head of police noted at the outset that the CARDINAL children did not hold the required provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) issued by the GPE authorities in GPE . Such a visa is normally a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit which confers more permanent residence rights . The head of police further held that a number of requirements for a residence permit for the purpose of ( extended ) family reunion were not met . On this point , the head of police concluded that it had not been established DATE and DATE there had been close family ties ( gezinsband ) between the children and PERSON , since the children had been living in another family unit , i.e. that of their father , and PERSON had been unable to demonstrate that , during that period , she had financially contributed to the children 's care and upbringing . Furthermore , PERSON did not comply with the requirement of having adequate housing . The head of police further considered that the children 's presence in the GPE did not serve an essential national interest , that there were no grounds for granting their request for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature , and that no obligation for the GPE authorities to allow family reunion on its territory could be derived from LAW .", "On DATE , the CARDINAL children filed an administrative appeal with the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) . On DATE , after the Deputy Minister had decided that they were not allowed to remain in the GPE pending the determination of their appeal , the children requested the President of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE to issue an interim measure to the effect that they would not be expelled pending the proceedings on their appeal .", "On DATE , the President of ORG granted the children 's request for an interim measure . Having noted that DATE had elapsed since the administrative appeal had been filed and that it was still pending , the President considered that the Deputy Minister apparently did not attach great importance to an expulsion at short notice whereas it was plausible that the children had a great interest in being allowed to remain in the GPE pending the determination of their appeal .", "On DATE , the first applicant and PERSON \u2013 who were assisted by their lawyer \u2013 were heard before an official commission ( ambtelijke commissie ) on the appeal filed against the decisions of DATE . In the course of this hearing , PERSON stated inter alia that , after she had moved to the GPE , she had remained in contact with her CARDINAL children in GPE , both through annual visits and through telephone conversations . Her ex - husband had been an alcoholic and had died as a consequence thereof . He and the children had lived in the house of a sister of her ex - husband who had also lived there . Her oldest daughter had cooked and cared for the other CARDINAL children . Her parents , who also lived in the GPE , owned a house in GPE and she had stayed in that house during her visits to GPE . CARDINAL of her CARDINAL siblings were living in the GPE ; CARDINAL sister still lived in GPE but not near the place where her ex - husband had been living . She had also contributed financially and materially to the children 's care and upbringing , by sending them money and clothes via friends and relatives .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister rejected the administrative appeal brought by the CARDINAL children . The Deputy Minister found that the criteria for family reunion had not been met given that the factual close family ties ( feitelijke gezinsband ) between the children and PERSON had to be regarded as having been severed , at least since DATE when PERSON leaving the CARDINAL children with her ex - husband in GPE DATE had moved to the GPE where she had founded a new family unit with PERSON of which the CARDINAL children did not form a part , whereas this situation had been intended as being a permanent arrangement . The Deputy Minister further considered that it had not been established that close family ties had been maintained by ORG after DATE , either through financial support or parental decisions . The Deputy Minister also found that it had not been established that it had been impossible for PERSON to have custody of the children transferred to her sooner and that , for this reason , it had not been possible to seek reunion earlier . As to the children 's argument that , since their arrival in the GPE , they had formed a part of PERSON family unit there , the Deputy Minister held that admission for family reunion was only possible if the actual close family ties between a parent and a child had never been severed . The Deputy Minister therefore concluded that the CARDINAL children were not eligible for a residence permit for family reunion under the domestic immigration rules .", "As to the question whether a refusal to admit the children to the GPE would entail disproportionate hardship , the Deputy Minister noted that the first applicant was born and raised in GPE where she had lived for DATE before coming to the GPE , and considered that she could be expected to fend for herself independently in GPE . The Minister further held that it had not appeared that she had integrated into GPE society and become alienated from NORP society to such an extent that it could not be asked of her to return to GPE , or that prior to her arrival in the GPE she had encountered such problems that it would be unreasonable to expect her to return to GPE . On this point , the Deputy Minister noted that , although her father had died , it had appeared during the hearing before the official commission that the first applicant \u2013 without any help from her father \u2013 already regularly had had to assume the care for herself and her siblings , and found that it had not been established that she would not have , according to local standards , acceptable future prospects in GPE . As regards the other children , the Deputy Minister held that they could return to GPE together with their oldest sister who could \u2013 like she had already done prior to their arrival in the GPE and in so far as necessary DATE provide them with ( a part of ) the necessary care . The Deputy Minister further considered that her brothers PERSON and PERSON DATE given their DATE would be less and less dependent on their oldest sister as regards their actual DATE care and would to an increasing degree be able to fend for themselves independently . In this context , the Deputy Minister further pointed out that financial support for the children 's living expenses could be provided by transferring money from the GPE . Although the children 's situation in GPE would be less favourable than in the GPE , the Deputy Minister did not find this a reason to deviate from the applicable immigration rules .", "In so far as the children relied on LAW , the Deputy Minister held , as regards the first applicant , that she had already come of age when she applied for a residence permit . As her relationship with PERSON was one between adult relatives , and having found no indication that this relationship comprised more than the normal emotional ties that exist between parents and adult children , the Deputy Minister held that their relationship did not constitute family life within the meaning of LAW . On this point , the Deputy Minister did not find it established that the care provided by PERSON to the first applicant had been of such a nature that it could not be regarded as the normal care with which parents should provide their children . The Deputy Minister further considered it of importance that their separation had resulted from PERSON free choice to settle in the GPE , and that another indication for the absence of a special relationship of dependency between them was formed by the fact that PERSON had been living in the GPE since DATE whereas it was not until DATE that she had made demonstrable efforts to be reunited with the first applicant in the GPE . As regards the other CARDINAL children , the Deputy Minister accepted that there was family life within the meaning of Article QUANTITY between them and PERSON , but that the interests of the GPE authorities in maintaining a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the children 's interests in exercising their family life with PERSON in the GPE . On this point , the Deputy Minister considered that a refusal to admit the children to the GPE did not prevent them from exercising their family life with PERSON in the way they had before they came to the GPE and that PERSON had made a conscious decision at the time to leave GPE and to leave her children behind . Consequently , their separation had not been caused by any public authority 's involvement . The Deputy Minister held that in a situation like that of the applicants , where family life had been voluntarily reduced to the present level , it could not be required from the GPE authorities to make provisions allowing to deepen and intensify family life . The Deputy Minister further considered that no objective obstacles had appeared to the family life at issue being exercised outside the GPE .", "On DATE , the CARDINAL children filed an appeal with ORG of The Hague .", "In its ruling of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The Hague rejected the children 's appeal . It did point out that the Deputy Minister had incorrectly found that there was no family life within the meaning of LAW between Mrs Boudhan and the first applicant , but did not conclude that this constituted a ground for declaring the appeal well - founded in view of the reasons stated by the Deputy Minister for holding that DATE had not been violated . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "Until DATE , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by the DATE LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) . Further rules were laid down in LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW ) . On DATE , the DATE LAW was replaced by QUANTITY . On DATE , LAW , the Regulation on Aliens and LAW were replaced by new versions based on LAW .", "As a rule , anyone wishing to apply for a residence permit in the GPE must first apply from his or her country of origin to the GPE Minister of ORG for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) . Only once such a visa has been issued abroad may a residence permit for the GPE be granted . An application for a provisional residence visa is assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit .", "The Government pursue a restrictive immigration policy due to the population and employment situation in the GPE . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of obligations arising from international agreements , or if their presence serves an essential national interest , or on compelling humanitarian grounds .", "The admission policy for family reunion purposes was laid down in LAW . The phrase \u201c actually belonging to the family unit \u201d ( \u201c feitelijk behoren QUANTITY \u201d ) used in GPE law only partly overlaps with the term \u201c family life \u201d in LAW . The former is understood to mean , for instance , that the close family ties ( gezinsband ) between the child and its parents whom it wishes to join in the GPE already existed in another country and have been maintained . For the rest , the question of whether the close family ties should be deemed to have been severed is answered on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each specific case . Factors taken into consideration include the length of time during which parent and child have been separated and the reasons for the separation , the way in which the relationship between parent and child has been developed during the separation , the parent 's involvement in the child 's care and upbringing , custody arrangements , the amount and frequency of the parent 's financial contributions to the child 's care and upbringing , the parent 's intention to send for the child as soon as possible and his / her efforts to do so , and the length of time that the child has lived in a family other than with the parent .", "The burden of proving that the close family ties between parent and child have not been severed rests with the parent residing in the GPE . The longer the parent and child have been separated , the heavier the burden of proof on the person in the GPE becomes . It is then incumbent on the parent to present sound reasons as to why he or she did not seek to bring the child to the GPE sooner .", "it residence in the GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
