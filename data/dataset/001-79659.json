As to the first issue , whether the impugned statements amounted to defamation for the purposes of LAW , ORG observed that it agreed with ORG that , when considering DATE article in isolation and as a whole , the allegations in question must be understood to mean that the Municipality , after having made a specific assessment of the relevant properties , had taken the stance that a breach of the residence requirements had occurred with regard to PERSON property , among others , and that his name had therefore been entered on a list which the LOC had decided to transmit to the LOC Governor for further processing . The report should therefore be perceived by the ordinary reader as an allegation that Mr PERSON had breached the obligation of residence .", "CARDINAL . As to the question whether this amounted to a defamatory accusation , ORG held that a breach of the residence requirements did not constitute a criminal offence but that , in a place like PERSON , many people would regard it as being immoral and an affront to the public interest . The High Court agreed with ORG that the accusations were not of the most defamatory kind but , not least in view of the strong personal angle of the report , ORG found that it was capable of damaging Mr PERSON 's good name and reputation . An examination of whether it was capable of causing a loss of the reputation required for the exercise of his profession was not necessary .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not find that the applicants had adduced sufficient proof of the defamatory accusation under LAW to avoid liability for defamation under LAW . In this connection it observed :", "\u201c It is correct that PERSON name was mentioned on a list drawn up in DATE by the administration of the GPE for its ORG . The heading of the list reads : ' Properties which should be verified in relation to the residence requirements ' . Further , it was noted that the list was not public . Had the NORP Blad limited itself to stating this , it would have made an accusation that was true . ... Mr PERSON 's name was put on the preliminary ' tip - off ' list , based on tip - offs from inhabitants , local politicians and others . ORG has no doubt that a number of local inhabitants could have believed that the residence requirements were breached in so far as ORG 's property was concerned , given the fact that it concerned an DATE residence which had been vacated and used as a holiday home . The mayor of the municipality has explained that he was of the opinion that the permanent residence requirements were breached , as has PERSON , the director of ORG . However , PERSON explained in the proceedings before ORG that , at that time , he had not conducted a further investigation of the property . His view that the property was subject to the permanent residence requirements had been based on his belief that it had been converted from an older residence . He was fully aware that permanent residence requirements did not apply where a person had acquired an open plot of land and then built a house on it . PERSON also explained that , when he had told the journalist PERSON that a list would shortly be submitted to the LOC Governor , he was aware that the list would have to be examined first . According to ORG understanding of PERSON , there had been no further elaboration of the preliminary tip - off list since DATE . ... Since PERSON was well aware of the exception to the residence requirements for new buildings on open plots of land , he would have quickly discovered that no obligation of residence applied here . ... ORG further notes that to date none of the names that were on the provisional tip - off list from DATE have been transmitted to GPE because GPE believed that there was a breach of the residence requirements .", "The allegations made by PERSON on DATE were therefore demonstrably inaccurate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court was divided as to the question whether the accusations were unlawful ( rettstridige ) . A majority of CARDINAL members found that that was the case , whereas a minority of CARDINAL members agreed with ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , a qualified majority of minimum CARDINAL votes was required for finding liability under LAW . Mr PERSON 's claim that he had been the victim of unlawful defamation under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL by the newspaper and its editor - in - chief , respectively , was therefore rejected .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , under LAW , which required only a simple majority , ORG declared the following CARDINAL statements , published respectively on the front page and on page CARDINAL of the CARDINAL DATE issue ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , null and void :", "\u201c Permanent residence requirements : In DATE case scenario [ ORG ] may be forced to sell her property at Hvasser [ an island next to PERSON ] .

The list includes properties whose use is thought not to be in conformity with the permanent residence requirements . \u201d", "\u201c ... PERSON may be forced to sell their properties at PERSON . The reason is that , according to GPE , they do not comply with the permanent residence requirements applicable to their properties . \u201d", "ORG further decided that the applicants were jointly and severally liable , under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , to pay Mr PERSON NOK CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . ORG in addition decided that no costs should be awarded with respect to the proceedings either before ORG or ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG against the procedure followed by ORG ( saksbehandlingen ) , namely the fact that the issue of nullification had been determined by a simple majority , and against its application of the law ( rettsanvendelesen ) . On DATE ORG granted leave to appeal in so far as the latter ground was concerned but refused such leave with respect to the former ground .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeal and ordered them to pay Mr PERSON NOK CARDINAL for his legal costs . When deciding on the question whether to declare parts of the newspaper article null and void , ORG applied LAW of LAW . This limited the scope of ORG review of the facts of the case ( see further on this below ) . As far as the question of non - pecuniary damage was concerned , the appeal only referred to the application of the law . Therefore , even though the Code of Civil Procedure was to be applied in this regard , in accordance with LAW , ORG had to base its examination on the same facts as ORG in this connection too .", "CARDINAL . In his opinion , to which CARDINAL other members subscribed , Mr Justice PERSON held , inter alia :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) I shall first look at how the statements must be understood . It follows from case - law that the interpretation is part of the application of the law .... It is the statements whose nullification is requested which are to be interpreted . The question is how these must be assumed to have been understood by the readers of the newspaper . Taking the wording as our point of departure , we must then look at what perceptions the statements create in the ordinary newspaper reader . In my opinion there is no conflict between the case - law of ORG and that of ORG as regards the subject matter of the interpretation ; see the references to ' the ordinary reader ' in the decisions of ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The statements to be interpreted are included in the newspaper 's first story of DATE . In the usual way the statements must be interpreted in context with the rest of the news report , with its typography and use of pictures . Like ORG , however , I find it clear that the subsequent articles , carried on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , are not of significance for this purpose . I shall return to the significance of the follow - up reportage in another context . Here it is sufficient to show that these are not suitable for shedding light on the meaning of the statements whose nullification is being requested . ... The statements in the story of DATE are more of the nature of a description of a subsequent development , namely that PERSON has been ' cleared ' in the case . I would add \u2013 not that my standpoint depends on it \u2013 that the distance in time to the article to which the nullification claim applies is also materially greater than in PERSON ( ' PERSON ' ) DATE - CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) The unanimous ORG has summarised its interpretation as follows :", "' When one accordingly considers the article of DATE in isolation , ORG agrees with ORG that the statements , seen in isolation and as a whole , must be perceived by the ordinary reader as saying that the Municipality , after considering the relevant properties , has taken the position that there has been a breach of the residence requirements for , inter alia , ORG 's property , and that his name has therefore been written down on a list that the GPE has decided to refer to the LOC Governor for further action . The story must appear to the ordinary newspaper reader as a statement that Mr PERSON has breached the residence requirements . '", "( CARDINAL ) This by and large coincides with my own view . The core of the accusation was that Mr PERSON found himself on a list that GPE had prepared , and which contained the names of persons whom GPE considered to have breached the residence requirements . I do not , however , concur with the majority of ORG that the story ' must appear to the ordinary newspaper reader as a statement that PERSON has breached his residence requirements ' . It is clearly apparent from the article that it is the LOC 's opinion that is being reported , and that the list is to be sent to GPE for decision .", "( CARDINAL ) I agree with ORG that the statements , as interpreted , contain a defamatory accusation ; see LAW . It is the first alternative in that provision that is relevant , and the allegation that GPE considered that the residence requirements had been breached was liable to damage his ' good name and reputation ' . An accusation of a breach of the law of this nature must be regarded as defamatory . It is the public 's moral judgment of the act that is decisive , and it is not a requirement that actual damage be demonstrated or substantiated . ORG found that no evidence of the truth of the accusation was presented , and this conclusion is binding on ORG .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) In the specific weighing of factors in our case , the point of departure must be that PERSON has published a defamatory accusation about factual matters , namely that the LOC had considered Mr PERSON 's property under the rules on residence requirements and was of the opinion that Mr PERSON had breached the residence requirements . In this connection I do not accord any independent weight to the fact that he was not the holder of title to the property . ORG must find that the accusation was untrue \u2013 that applies both to the GPE 's alleged perception that the residence requirements had been breached , and the allegation that Mr PERSON 's name was entered on a list that the GPE , on the basis of such a perception , had prepared of owners of properties in respect of which the residence requirements were supposed to have been breached . As regards the facts , a unanimous ORG has found that this was a provisional ' tip - off list ' based on tips from inhabitants and local politicians in GPE . It had been drawn up by the municipal administration in DATE , and bore the title ' Properties which should be verified in relation to the residence requirements . ( Not public ) ' . ORG also noted that GPE , at the time the newspaper published the article on DATE , had not ' undertaken any further processing of the provisional tip - off list from DATE . ORG is bound by this assessment of the evidence .", "( CARDINAL ) The main rule in both NORP defamation law and LAW is that non - proven defamatory allegations of fact are not protected by freedom of expression . As regards ORG case - law , I refer to the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( no CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and to the judgment of DATE in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; there must be special grounds for departing from this main rule .", "( CARDINAL ) There is also a distinction between transmission of other people 's untrue accusations and the media 's own presentation of non - proven defamatory allegations . Freedom of expression stretches further to cover transmission , depending , inter alia , on who has made the allegation that is transmitted . If it is a report from a public authority , as in the PERSON case , freedom of expression enjoys stronger protection .", "( CARDINAL ) In our case it can not be found that the newspaper has transmitted a defamatory accusation that was made by others . The article gives no source for the accusation , and ORG can not depart from ORG ( the majority 's ) assessment of evidence with regard to the newspaper 's having based itself on an anonymous source in relation to the information that Mr PERSON was on the list that was to be sent to the County Governor and that his property was ' thus to be looked into with regard to a breach of the residence requirements ' . The reliance on anonymous sources otherwise prevents the courts from testing whether the journalist displayed due care by employing that source ; see PERSON , p. CARDINAL , and ORG judgment in PERSON , \u00a7 DATE . Referring to anonymous sources should therefore in this connection be equated with accusations made by the newspaper without giving sources . I will return later to the question of what grounds the newspaper had at the time of publication for the truth of the accusation .", "( CARDINAL ) The decision in Rt-CARDINAL - CARDINAL and the case - law of ORG shows that the specific weighing of factors must take into consideration several criteria . Of these I would emphasise the degree of public interest , the nature of the accusation , including whether the accusation is classified as a ' value judgment ' or a ' factual statement ' , whether it is directed against a public person or a private individual , and the degree of care , including the extent to which the media at the time of publication had factual support for considering the allegation to be true . In general , the protection of the expression will be stronger if it concerns matters of public interest , value judgments , imparting of information , a public person , and if there are strong reasons for holding the allegation to be true . Contrariwise : if the case concerns limited public interest , factual statements , the media 's own presentation , private persons and weak grounds for holding the allegation to be true , the protection of the expression will be weaker .", "( CARDINAL ) That the expression containing the accusation is of public interest is in my view a fundamental criterion for regarding the media 's own presentation of untrue defamatory allegations against private individuals about factual matters as being protected by freedom of expression .", "( CARDINAL ) It is immediately clear that the question of enforcement of the residence requirements for DATE - round residences in a coastal municipality like PERSON is of public interest . For PERSON as the local newspaper in the region , this was naturally a topic for critical coverage . The fact that there existed a list of properties that there was a question of referring to the LOC Governor must also be regarded as being of interest for the residents of the region and the newspaper 's readership . Which properties or owners were on the list , on the other hand , must in my opinion be regarded as of limited public interest . If any of the individuals who were entered on the ' tip - off list ' DATE for example owing to their function , position of trust or participation in the public debate \u2013 had had a special connection to the issue of residence requirements , it might have been different . It may well be the case that the modern news industry makes considerable use of known persons to arouse the interest of the readers . But I agree with ORG that the fact that Mr PERSON was a relatively famous person as the executive ORG does not mean that he can automatically be regarded as a public person in relation to the rules on residence requirements . The majority 's emphasis on his not having involved himself in the public debate on this topic appears very consonant with ORG reasoning in its judgment of DATE in PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , \u00a7 DATE , first sub - paragraph , with its emphasis on ORG participation in public debate ' as the central theme .", "( CARDINAL ) I would then return to the question of the journalist 's due care in the publication , and view this in the context of the use of an anonymous source and of what factual grounds he had at the time of publication for considering the allegation true . I would first remark that there did not exist any written documentation from the municipality 's processing of the matter that could support the allegation , over and above what the unanimous ORG has characterised as ' the provisional tip - off list ' . As mentioned , ORG must in my opinion base its decision on what ORG has found with regard to the use of an anonymous source . I can not therefore see that it can be found that the newspaper had other sources or other grounds for its allegation that Mr PERSON 's name was on a list that the GPE should ' in the near future refer to GPE . This was the basis for the accusation that GPE considered that Mr PERSON had breached the residence requirements . Even if use of anonymous sources is a recognised tool of modern journalism , such use of sources will imply a stricter requirement of due care . Moreover , in such a situation , it must to a considerable degree be the newspaper 's risk that the factual information conveyed may turn out to be untrue .", "( CARDINAL ) It is true that DATE the newspaper carried an interview with the director of ORG , in which it was confirmed that GPE would in the near future be sending a list to GPE . But in my opinion the interview does not allow the conclusion to be drawn that the GPE 's processing was concluded and that a definitive list therefore existed . In this connection I would not lay any particular emphasis on the fact that representatives of GPE DATE before consideration of the tip - off list \u2013 have considered that the residence requirement applied to the PERSON family 's property . Nor did the journalist claim to have based his story on information from these people . Otherwise , in my view , there are generally grounds for emphasising the big difference between being on a so - called tip - off list that has not been considered by the GPE and being on a list that the LOC has decided , after processing and consideration , to refer to GPE , who is the central government 's supervisory and administrative authority .", "( DATE ) When PERSON was contacted by the journalist immediately prior to the newspaper 's running the story on DATE , his reaction was that the whole thing had to rest on a misunderstanding . Even if it is understandable that the newspaper may have wanted a broader statement from PERSON , I can not see that he can be blamed for his behaviour here . Without it having any importance for my view on the question I am discussing here , I would like to mention that it was subsequently discovered that PERSON had obtained legal advice on the residence requirements in connection with his family 's move to GPE in DATE in consequence of his work situation in GPE . As the situation must have appeared to him , when he was contacted by the journalist immediately before the newspaper ran the story on DATE , his reaction was in my opinion understandable . The circumstance that I have mentioned here can not in any event mean that the journalist may be regarded as having acted with due care .", "( CARDINAL ) The articles that PERSON carried on DATE and CARDINAL DATE are of negligible significance for the questions I have now discussed . The stories came a relatively long time after the initial article . And under LAW of LAW , claims for nullification must be rejected when the person making the accusation ' withdraws it before the main hearing in a manner that the court finds satisfactory to the aggrieved person ' . PERSON has not , however , requested the case to be dismissed from the courts , and I have no occasion to enter into any discussion of this question . I would , however , remark that NORP defamation law is based on the notion that a withdrawal of an allegation has significance in relation to the sanctions , and not the assessment of unlawfulness ( rettstridsvurderingen ) .", "( CARDINAL ) As the case now stands , I can not agree with PERSON that the newspaper 's follow - up report means that there is on the whole a balanced presentation suggesting that the statements in the story of DATE can not be deemed unlawful . The story of CARDINAL DATE was in particular angled in such a way as to make it less appropriate as a modification of the original statement 's defamatory character ; see the use of the expression that Mr PERSON ' is escaping ' the residence requirements . In the discussion of CARDINAL DATE , under the headline ' PERSON clarifies ' , there is a more neutral correction , but it is not stated here either that Mr PERSON has not been on any list that has been considered by the GPE .", "( CARDINAL ) By way of conclusion I see good reason to emphasise : as will be apparent from what I have reproduced from the first voting judge in GPE . DATE - CARDINAL , in considering specific statements the press 's role as a central practitioner of freedom of expression must be weighed against the interests of privacy , including the reputation of the individual . When the expression concerns a case of public interest , the role of the press as a ' public watchdog ' means that interference with freedom of expression requires a weighty justification . In our case it is the protection of Mr PERSON 's reputation that calls for the interference . The only way I can see the situation is that PERSON could have highlighted the residence requirements issue critically , as it did in the reportage of DATE , without the strong focus on Mr PERSON personally \u2013 a focus that rested on a deficient factual basis .", "( CARDINAL ) In the light of this I have concluded that the statements of which nullification is requested are not protected by LAW and that the request must be granted . Since the special arguments regarding the compensation claim for non - pecuniary damage have not been maintained , it follows that this part of the judgment is also upheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The dissenting judge , Mr Justice PERSON , stated :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ... I concur that in its news coverage of DATE PERSON published a defamatory statement \u2013 an accusation of a factual character \u2013 for which there was no factual basis . I also agree with the first voting judge that the core of the accusation is that Mr PERSON found himself on a list that GPE had drawn up , which contained the names of individuals whom GPE considered to have breached the residence requirements . This would , however \u2013 assuming it was DATE not have been a final declaration that there had been a breach of the residence requirements . For this reason , among others , I agree with the minority of ORG and ORG that the accusation lies in the lower stratum of what can be covered by LAW . I also have the impression that ORG majority by and large agree with this .", "( CARDINAL ) When an untrue defamatory statement is made , the point of departure is also clear under ORG case - law concerning LAW : the accusation is not protected by freedom of expression . But exceptions to this may be contemplated . If the accusation is to enjoy protection under freedom of expression , it must at the least be demanded that the news coverage in which it is contained is of public interest and additionally that the necessary care was taken by the newspaper . I consider that these criteria were met in this case .", "( CARDINAL ) There can be no doubt that the general subject with which the newspaper was concerned , and with which the news coverage of DATE really dealt , namely compliance with the rules on residence requirements , was and is of great public interest . The question is whether it is in the public interest to publicise a possible breach of the residence requirements on the part of PERSON . I would first mention that in modern journalism it is a common and recognised method of popular education to illustrate general and usually difficult questions by means of the roles and fates of individuals , when they are considered especially relevant . When individuals are unwillingly brought forward , and are subjected to accusations of crime and so forth , a mass medium must have good reasons for this , for example if the person concerned has sought out the light of publicity in this area , or is a prominent person in society who must accept that special demands are made of his integrity and sense of responsibility to society . At the time in question Mr PERSON belonged to the top management of CARDINAL of the country 's biggest industrial conglomerates , and his name was not unfamiliar in the news . In my opinion individuals who have sought prominent positions in society , which require a special degree of trust from the public , must to some extent accept that the media will follow them with the eyes of ORG , not just in their professional activities but also when , in the more private sphere , they challenge laws and other regulations that are particularly meant to safeguard the interests of society . It is therefore possible to conceive of violations of the law by these individuals that in the circumstances will be of public interest , even if the breach carries no criminal responsibility or the penalties are minor . In this case the newspaper thought that PERSON had broken the rules on residence requirements , which in public opinion was and is of major social importance , even if such a contravention is not a criminal offence . I have difficulty seeing that it was not a matter of public interest if such a very prominent person as PERSON had not complied with the residence requirements with regard to his property in LOC .", "( CARDINAL ) The question then becomes whether the newspaper has acted with the requisite care . It must be noted that the journalist used an anonymous source when he wrote that PERSON was on the LOC 's list of those who were considered to have breached the residence requirements . It is undisputed that for a long while PERSON had been working on this topic , and that the journalist \u2013 who lived at DATE had been in contact with several representatives of the Municipality . It must also be noted that the journalist , on application to the GPE , received confirmation that there existed a list that the LOC had drawn up , but the mistake was that this was a list of individuals who , according to external tip - offs , had breached the obligation , and not a list of individuals whom the LOC had already found to have breached it . The newspaper thus confused the tip - off list , which contained Mr PERSON 's name , with the list that the GPE was indeed to refer to the LOC Governor for a decision on whether the residence requirements had been complied with .", "( CARDINAL ) I can not see that the newspaper is much to be blamed for this confusion . The journalist had reason to believe that a municipal assessment had been carried out at that point . In the story of DATE the director of ORG confirmed that technical services would ' in the very near future ' write to the County Governor regarding individuals whom the GPE suspected of breaching the residence requirements . The director also stated : ' We know that the residence requirements are not being complied with for several properties in the LOC ' . And the director did not wish to say ' which properties are on the list we are referring to GPE . This last statement gave the clear impression that the list which GPE had assessed already existed . In addition , prominent representatives of GPE DATE such as the mayor and the director of ORG \u2013 subsequently stated that , at the time when the newspaper had carried the controversial reportage , they had been of the opinion that PERSON was in breach of the residence requirements . This is clearly apparent from ORG judgment , both the minority and majority remarks . PERSON was therefore close to the truth in its story of DATE . I would also mention that , according to the story , the newspaper had approached Mr PERSON for his view of the matter , but he did not want to comment beyond stating that the fact that his name was on the list must have been due to a misunderstanding . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP defamation law , there are CARDINAL kinds of response to unlawful defamation , namely the imposition of a penalty under the provisions in ORG and CARDINAL of LAW , an order under LAW of the LAW declaring the defamatory allegation null and void ( mortifikasjon ) and an order under LAW DATE to pay compensation to the aggrieved party .
