It furthermore found that a number of the statements contained an assessment of the alleged irregularity based solely on ORG \u201c subjective opinions \u201d . As an example of this , the ORG mentioned the statement of CARDINAL observers from ORG no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG and ORG did not explain the reasons for doing so . Moreover , while the ORG noted that positive statements about the conduct of the election had been made even by some observers from opposition parties , the applicants claimed the ORG had simply fabricated the existence of such statements by purported pro - opposition observers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , agreeing with the lower court \u2019s reasoning . It also added that the ORG appeal and ORG judgment had to be assessed in the light of LAW of the PERSON on ORG , which stated that ORG decisions were final and could not be subject to quashing , amendment or official interpretation by any authority or person . In this regard , ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c The results of the [ parliamentary ] elections of DATE were recognised as valid by [ the ORG \u2019s ] election results record of CARDINAL DATE and the candidates elected as members of parliament from all CARDINAL electoral constituencies were determined .", "The aforementioned results record was approved by the ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , and [ on the same date ] the final election results record , together with the [ ConEC ] results records and additional documents , were submitted to ORG for verification and approval of the election results .", "By a decision of the ORG of ORG on the results of the [ parliamentary ] elections of DATE ... , dated DATE , the ORG \u2019s final results record of CARDINAL DATE was deemed compliant with the requirements of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of GPE , and the election results concerning CARDINAL electoral constituencies , including ORG no . CARDINAL , were approved , that decision becoming final at the moment of its delivery .", "It follows from that decision that ORG did not establish any circumstances that may have taken place during the voting or the determination of the election results that could have prevented the establishing of the will of the voters in ORG no . CARDINAL .", "Taking into account the fact that the aforementioned decision [ of ORG ] is final and not subject to quashing , amendment or official interpretation by any authority or person , the court considers that the judgment of the appellate court [ dismissing the ORG complaints ] must be upheld . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
