At the time , the system for transferring agricultural holdings was by a sale of the house and gift of the adjoining land that was farmed by a socialist cooperative . The approval of the cooperative and the agreement of the competent national committee were required before the deed of sale and gift could be executed . Purchasers of land were required to give an undertaking that they would work for the cooperative .", "According to the applicants , PERSON wished to secure his release from his obligation to work for the socialist cooperative and could only do so by transferring the land . It was he who had proposed the arrangement , as he wanted to sort out his domestic affairs . Under the statutory provisions then in force , the applicants were obliged , as a condition for purchasing the house , to give an undertaking to work for the cooperative as a replacement for PERSON They paid him CARDINAL NORP korunas on top of the purchase price of the house , as compensation for the value of the transferred land .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG signed a declaration that he had transferred the land of his own free will .

NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( okresn\u00ed soud ) found in favour of GPE , holding , inter alia :", "\u201c [ The applicants ] have invited the ORG to dismiss PERSON 's actions on the ground that he transferred his land of his own free will to sort out his domestic affairs and that in consideration [ for that transfer ] they had assumed his obligation to work for the agricultural cooperative . ...", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Law no .

It has also been established that [ the applicants ] are currently in possession of the land . Consequently , the ORG ... rescinds the section of the deed of sale and gift executed by the parties on DATE that provides for the transfer of ownership of the land in question without consideration . ... It does not consider that the ' minuted rider to the deed ' dated DATE constitutes a valid rider to the deed of sale and gift . The statement in which [ ORG ] expressly confirmed that he had sold his immovable property voluntarily and at the agreed price has no ... value in law , as it was made before the amendment to the legislation on land law that enabled him to seek restitution was passed . In fact , [ ORG ] denies that he intended to sell the land [ to the applicants ] and the intentions of both parties are set out in the notary 's minutes ... The ORG finds that the [ applicants ' ] argument that a decision in favour of [ GPE ] would entail a violation of LAW is unfounded , as the latter was obliged to transfer ownership of the agricultural land used by the agricultural cooperative without consideration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 ORG ( krajsk\u00fd soud ) upheld ORG judgment rescinding the relevant part of the deed of sale and gift . It found that PERSON had given , and thus de facto transferred without consideration , the agricultural land to the applicants as part of the agreement for the sale of the adjoining house . ORG also noted that the terms \u201c donate \u201d and \u201c transfer without consideration \u201d were identical . At the same time , it dismissed an application by the applicants for leave to appeal on points of law ( dovol\u00e1n\u00ed ) , holding that the request for a ruling on the construction of the words \u201c transfer without consideration \u201d in section CARDINAL ) of LAW did not raise a question of crucial legal importance ( rozhodnut\u00ed po pr\u00e1vn\u00ed str\u00e1nce z\u00e1sadn\u00edho v\u00fdznamu ) .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( PERSON ) refused the applicants leave to appeal on points of law , holding that ORG judgment did not give rise to a question of crucial legal importance . It noted that it had considered the question of the definition of the terms \u201c donations \u201d and \u201c transfers without consideration \u201d in a number of previous decisions in which it had construed the LAW as not requiring duress to have been used if the agricultural land had been transferred without consideration .

The [ ORG ] judgment does not constitute a decision on the final statutory remedy for the protection of rights ... The constitutional appeal could only be brought against the appeal court 's decision , which became enforceable on DATE . Since it was not lodged until DATE , it fails to satisfy the condition set out in section CARDINAL ) of LAW . For this reason , ORG has no alternative but to declare the appeal inadmissible , as it was lodged after the expiry of the statutory time - limit . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It may also provide that certain property may be owned solely by citizens or legal entities domiciled in the NORP and GPE .

In its decision no . I \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , ORG considered , inter alia , the question of the admissibility of a constitutional appeal that had been lodged outside the statutory time - limit in a case in which the appellant was not sure whether he would be granted leave to appeal on points of law . ORG held that when an appellant decides to appeal on points of law against a decision of the appeal court in circumstances in which it is unclear whether leave to appeal will be granted , he must lodge a constitutional appeal at the same time , in order to ensure that it is brought within the statutory time - limit .", "CARDINAL . In its decision no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed an application by CARDINAL members of ORG for an order abrogating section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . In its reasons , it stated that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) allowed private individuals ' land to be expropriated lawfully and restrictions to be imposed on the manner in which they exercised their right of property without payment of compensation , adding that the rule applied not only to rights of property that had been acquired by taking advantage of the socialist system but also to those acquired in good faith . It noted the legitimate aim pursued by LAW and the priority given to restoring land to original owners who had been deprived of it without compensation DATE . In the circumstances , it was both feasible and fair to ask those who had received property without consideration to return it without compensation to the original owner , who had been forced to donate it to them .", "CARDINAL . In its decision no . PERSON of DATE , ORG said that notwithstanding the fact that appeals on points of law had no suspensive effect and did not affect the enforceability of appeal court decisions , the initial target of a constitutional appeal had to be ORG decision . If the constitutional appeal was directed only against the appeal court 's judgment , ORG decision would remain valid , so that the principle of legal certainty would be violated in the event of a conflict .", "CARDINAL . In its decision no . I \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , ORG said that if an appellant was unsure whether an application he had just lodged for leave to appeal on points of law would be granted , then , in order to avoid being out of time with his constitutional appeal , he should lodge it at the same time , without waiting for the decision on the application for leave , since , if leave was refused , the final decision in his case would be the appeal court decision .", "CARDINAL . In its decision no . II \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held that an appellant whose application for leave to appeal on points of law has been dismissed by the appeal court is nevertheless entitled to apply for leave to ORG under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure . Unless he does so , he will not have exhausted the statutory remedies provided to protect his rights .", "CARDINAL . In its decision no . III \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , ORG found , inter alia , that , even though the applicants had been refused leave to appeal on points of law by the appeal court , they were still entitled to seek leave under LAW , as they satisfied the necessary conditions . Since they had not made use of that available remedy , their constitutional appeal could not be declared admissible .", "CARDINAL . In its decision no . IV \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared a constitutional appeal inadmissible for failure to exhaust statutory remedies , on the ground that the appellant had failed to exercise his right to lodge an appeal on points of law under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning in decision no . III \u00daS DATE of DATE , ORG stated , inter alia , that if a party to the proceedings is refused leave by the appeal court to appeal on points of law , he must apply to ORG for leave under LAW , otherwise his constitutional appeal will be inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Decision no . IV \u00daS DATE , which was adopted after the entry into force of an amendment to LAW on DATE extending the right of appeal on points of law , makes it clear that an appellant may only be regarded as having exhausted available statutory remedies once ORG has delivered its decision . Any other solution would give rise to an undesirable situation with the coexistence of CARDINAL sets proceedings . In such cases , time for lodging a constitutional appeal will , therefore , only start to run after ORG decision has been served on the appellant .", "CARDINAL . In its decision no . III \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared a constitutional appeal inadmissible on the ground that if a party 's application to the appeal court for leave to appeal on points of law was dismissed , he would still be regarded as having failed to exhaust statutory remedies unless he applied to ORG for leave , despite the fact that it was his application to the appeal court that had made the application to ORG necessary .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , applications nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG ( PERSON , GPE v. GPE and PERSON v. GPE , respectively ) , which have been lodged with the ORG and communicated to the respondent Government , show that the effectiveness of lodging an appeal on points of law simultaneously with a constitutional appeal may prove to be purely theoretical . In these cases , the applicants lodged both forms of appeal at the same time , but their constitutional appeals were declared inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies , as their appeals to ORG . They subsequently lodged fresh appeals with ORG , once ORG had refused them leave to appeal . However , their constitutional appeals were again declared inadmissible , this time on the ground that they were out of time ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
