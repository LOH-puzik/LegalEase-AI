On DATE the applicant was again remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG examined the criminal charges against the applicant . The applicant pleaded not guilty . The court examined CARDINAL witnesses including PERSON . and NORP , and found the applicant guilty of the murder of QUANTITY persons , sentencing him to DATE imprisonment . In its judgment the court referred to witness statements , forensic reports and extensive material evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his lawyer appealed , alleging that Zh . and NORP had given their statements under pressure from the police and claiming that the investigation had been vitiated by numerous violations of the applicant 's defence rights . They also complained that they had received the expert examination orders belatedly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant requested to be assigned another lawyer to represent him in the appeal proceedings because PERSON was unable to attend the hearing , as she was already engaged in another trial .", "CARDINAL .

The court dismissed the applicant 's appeal , having found no proof that the testimony of Zh . and NORP was false . As regards the alleged breach of his defence rights , the court found this to be unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant filed several supervisory review complaints . In letters of DATE and DATE ORG and ORG informed the applicant that they refused to entertain his complaints .
