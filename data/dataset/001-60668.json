GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-2", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant , a NORP national born in DATE , on charges of receiving stolen goods and theft and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The execution of the sentence was suspended on probation for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant on charges of negligent drunken driving and negligent driving without licence and imposed a fine . Thereupon , ORG decided to prolong by DATE the applicant 's probationary period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant and CARDINAL co - accused with several counts of fraud , committed DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , on DATE the applicant was issued with a penal order ( Strafbefehl ) by ORG in the framework of a summary procedure . He was sentenced to a fine of MONEY ( DEM - approximately CARDINAL Euro ) per day for DATE for an offence of fraud , committed in DATE to the detriment of PERSON Upon the applicant 's objection , lodged with the assistance of Mr GPE , main proceedings were instituted before ORG . On DATE these proceedings and the proceedings concerning the charges of DATE , were joined .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of fraud and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The proceedings concerning the charge of fraud to the detriment of PERSON were provisionally stayed pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW as it appeared unnecessary to sanction the offence in question separately , the applicant having been sentenced to DATE imprisonment in respect of the other fraud offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a penal order against the applicant , convicting him of fraud , committed in DATE . He was sentenced to a fine of DEM DATE for DATE .", "CARDINAL . When the postman found nobody at the applicant 's home , the order was served in accordance with the relevant legal provisions , by way of a notification in his letter - box on DATE to collect the said decision deposited at the local post office in his absence . Since the applicant did not lodge an objection in time , the penal order acquired legal force as the final judgment in the matter on DATE . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant 's request for retrial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant of its intention to revoke the suspension of his sentence of DATE and invited him to comment within DATE after service of the letter . Due to the applicant 's absence from home , the letter was served by way of a notification in his letter - box on DATE to collect the said letter at the local post office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG revoked the suspension of the applicant 's sentence to DATE imprisonment , imposed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons given for its decision , ORG , referring to section CARDINALf ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , found that the applicant had committed criminal offences during the period of probation and had thereby shown that he did not fulfil the expectations upon which the suspension of the sentence was based .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that , subsequent to the said suspension , the applicant had been convicted of further criminal offences and that these convictions had become final . Thus he had been convicted of traffic offences by ORG on DATE and of fraud by ORG on DATE . The court considered that in particular the applicant 's conviction of another offence relating to property had shown that he did not fulfil the expectations upon which the suspension of his sentence was based . Taking into account that the period of suspension had already once been prolonged , other , more lenient measures than revoking the suspension were not possible .", "CARDINAL . Due to the applicant 's absence , the order was also served by way of a notification in his letter - box on DATE to collect the decision of CARDINAL DATE deposited at the local post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , assisted by PERSON , submitted an application for the reinstatement of the proceedings against the decision of DATE and lodged an appeal against the said decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant 's counsel that , considering ORG decision to stay the execution of the sentence ( PERSON ) until DATE , it would await the outcome of the proceedings before ORG regarding his request for reinstatement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to grant the applicant 's request for reinstatement and adjourned the appeal proceedings to await the final outcome of the FAC proceedings relating to his request for reinstatement . ORG considered that the question whether or not the applicant had committed a further offence of fraud was decisive for its decision on revoking his suspension . It noted that this request had been unsuccessful at first instance , but appeal proceedings were pending . ORG dismissed the applicant 's request to await the outcome of the proceedings relating to his request for retrial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that , following deliberations , the case remained adjourned to await the outcome of the FAC proceedings for reinstatement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place before ORG , which heard the statements made by PERSON and the further witness , police officer PERSON , in the presence of the applicant 's counsel . The applicant , waiting outside the court building , did not attend the hearing in order not to be seen in case of a confrontation with PERSON , as suggested by his counsel .", "CARDINAL . Following the hearing , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the decision of DATE on the ground that the reasons given in that decision were correct in their conclusion .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the applicant \u201c had not fulfilled the expectations upon which the suspension of his sentence ... was based , as he committed new offences during the period of suspension \u201d ( \u201c hat die Erwartungen , die der ... PERSON zugrunde lagen , nicht erf\u00fcllt , weil er in der FAC begangen hat \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG noted the applicant 's final conviction by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the penal order issued by ORG on DATE , it considered that the applicant 's pending request for retrial might result in the hearing of numerous witnesses . As the prolonged period of suspension had already expired DATE , ORG found that it could not await the outcome of these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG turned next to the proceedings pending before ORG . It noted that , following the applicant 's successful appeal against the penal order of DATE , ORG had joined these and further criminal proceedings involving the applicant and CARDINAL other accused and relating to several charges of fraud . In the latter proceedings , trial proceedings had not yet been opened on account of difficult investigations . ORG stated that it would not await the outcome of these proceedings either . Rather , it opted for a procedure under section CARDINAL of LAW to examine the question whether or not , in addition to the conviction by ORG of DATE , the applicant 's criminal offence to the detriment of Mr. PERSON could constitute a reason for revoking the suspension of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that , having questioned Mr. PERSON and a further witness , the police officer PERSON , in presence of the applicant 's defence counsel , \u201c it had been able to obtain certainty that the applicant was guilty of fraud to the detriment of witness ... [ H. ] ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) \u201d ( \u201c hat dem NORP ... die PERSON verschafft , dass sich der Beschwerdef\u00fchrer gegen\u00fcber dem Zeugen ... [ H. ] des Betruges schuldig gemacht hat ( \u00a7 CARDINAL StGB ) \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In this respect , ORG took note of both witnesses ' indications as to the circumstances of the offence in question as well as to the criminal information laid by the victim H. and the subsequent investigations . Thus , ORG found that the applicant had offered PERSON a mobile phone and a video camera at a low price . When the transaction was to be carried out some time later at a parking place on the motorway , the applicant had taken PERSON 's money and disappeared without handing over the promised goods . While PERSON had not identified the applicant on police photographs shown to him at the police department DATE after the offence , he did recognise him in a collection of police photographs which had been presented to him by the police officer ORG considered that both witnesses ' statements were true . The court argued that PERSON had openly talked about his bad conscience regarding the low price of the CARDINAL objects and he had also admitted that , because he was ashamed , he had not told the truth as to the circumstances of the applicant 's disappearance on the occasion of his questioning by the police . Moreover , police officer PERSON had remembered many details and had also explained an amendment to the minutes of H. 's questioning .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG indicated that it had inspected the files of the proceedings pending before ORG inasmuch as the collection of police photographs was concerned . ORG noted that , when the scene of identifying the applicant had been re - enacted , the witness PERSON , following an initial hesitation as to a photograph showing another person , had clearly recognised the photograph showing the applicant . In these circumstances , ORG considered not necessary to re - enact the consultation of police photographs , which had been taken place at the police department DATE after the offence .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not take up the suggestion of the applicant 's counsel for an open confrontation between the witness PERSON and several persons , including the applicant . It considered that so much time had elapsed since the offence that the applicant 's appearance could have considerably changed . Furthermore , it had not been sure whether the applicant would have participated in such a confrontation . In this situation , it rather relied on the memory of the witness H.", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the strict conditions were met for considering an offence , prior to final conviction , as a reason for revoking a suspension . In cases as the present one , awaiting the final conviction would , on account of the considerable possibilities of delay , lead to the unbearable result that criminal offenders could commit further offences during the probationary period without any risk of suffering disadvantages .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the applicant 's conviction by ORG and his criminal offence against PERSON had shown that , contrary to the initial prognosis , the applicant was not able to live a law - abiding life . While the conviction by ORG merely disclosed a general lack of reliability and could not , taken alone , justify revoking the suspension , the applicant had proceeded in the case PERSON in a way similar to that followed for the offence underlying his DATE conviction . Accordingly , the suspended prison sentences had had no impact on the applicant . More lenient measures could not therefore be envisaged .", "CARDINAL . The decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant 's constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG at ORG suspended the execution of the sentence pending the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL of the Penal Code govern the suspended execution of sentences . Section CARDINAL concerns the conditions for suspension and reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Upon a sentence of imprisonment of DATE , the court shall suspend the execution of the punishment and grant probation if it can be expected that the sentence will serve the convicted person as a warning and he will commit no further crimes in the future even without the influence exerted by serving the sentence . Particularly to be considered are the personality of the convicted person , his previous history , the circumstances of his offence , his conduct after the offence , his living conditions and the effects which can be expected as a result of the suspension .", "( CARDINAL ) The court may also suspend the execution of a longer term of imprisonment which does not exceed DATE under the provisions of subsection ( CARDINAL ) and grant probation if a comprehensive evaluation of the offence and personality of the convicted person reveals the existence of special circumstances . In making the decision the efforts of the convicted person to make restitution for the harm caused by the offence should particularly be considered . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to section DATE , the competent court determines the period of probation of DATE . It may subsequently be reduced to the minimum or prolonged to the maximum before its expiration . The court may impose conditions on the convicted person ( section PERSON ) , and may issue instructions to the convicted person for the duration of his period of probation ( section DATE ) or place the convicted person under the supervision of a probationary officer ( section ORG ) . According to section DATE , such decisions may be taken or amended at a later stage .", "CARDINAL . As regards the revocation of a suspension , section CARDINALf of the Penal Code provides inter alia that", "\u201c CARDINAL . The court shall revoke the suspension of a sentence if the convicted person commits a criminal offence during the period of probation and , thereby , shows that he did not fulfil the expectations upon which the suspension of the sentence was based", "...", "CARDINAL . NORP The court shall , however , refrain from revocation when it suffices :", "( CARDINAL . ) to impose further conditions or instructions , in particular to place the convicted person under the supervision of a probation officer ; or", "( CARDINAL ) NORP to prolong the period of probation ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the provisional stay of the prosecution in the following terms :", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute", "( CARDINAL ) where the penalty or the corrective or preventive measure to be expected if a conviction is secured is almost negligible in comparison with a penalty or corrective or preventive measure imposed on the defendant - or which he must expect to be imposed - for another offence ... ...", "CARDINAL . Once proceedings have been instituted , the court may provisionally stay them at any stage on an application by the public prosecutor . .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Court decisions other than conviction and sentence may be challenged in proceedings instituted under section CARDINAL of LAW .
