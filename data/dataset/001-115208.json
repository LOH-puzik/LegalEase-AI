The applicants were participants in or were alleged to be organisers of the unauthorised demonstration of CARDINAL DATE , which escalated into violent clashes between the law - enforcement authorities and the demonstrators , as described below .", "CARDINAL . The events of the present case occurred in the aftermath of the presidential elections of DATE . The main opposition candidate , PERSON , the chairman of ORG , lost the elections of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On TIME of DATE a group of opposition supporters gathered in front of ORG headquarters in the centre of GPE , claiming victory for their candidate in the election . Violent altercations between opposition supporters and the security forces took place at this time .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE a number of opposition supporters started gathering near ORG , in the centre of GPE , to protest against the election results . The crowd then started moving towards FAC , the main square in the city . It was reported that on the way some people in the crowd began damaging cars , buildings , benches and other urban constructions . It was also claimed that the organisers of this unauthorised demonstration and certain leaders of the opposition parties were inciting their followers to violence .", "CARDINAL . It has been claimed that some police officers who had been deployed in FAC were attacked by some of the demonstrators . Shortly thereafter large numbers of riot police and military personnel , fully equipped with helmets , shields and truncheons , arrived in the square with the aim of dispersing the demonstration . The situation quickly escalated into public disorder , and violent clashes occurred between the crowd and the police . It was widely reported that the authorities used excessive force indiscriminately against anyone who happened to be in the area in question .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the demonstration was completely dispersed . CARDINAL people were arrested during the events of DATE and in their aftermath .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL people , of the CARDINAL arrested in connection with those events , were eventually prosecuted in connection with those proceedings . The proceedings concerned only the actions of the organisers of the demonstration and those participating in it , and it appears that no criminal or other form of investigation was carried out in connection with the allegations of excessive use of force by the police and military units during the dispersal of the demonstration ( see Muradova v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Almost the whole pre - trial investigation , in respect of all the defendants , was conducted in the context of this single set of criminal proceedings . However , as the investigation drew close to completion , criminal case no . DATE was gradually split into several cases , eventually dividing the accused into CARDINAL separate groups . It appears that the only reason formally given by the prosecution for splitting up the case was the concern that the sheer number of defendants involved ( CARDINAL ) would prolong the proceedings and that it would be impractical to hold a single trial involving so many defendants ( see ORG and Others v. GPE , QUANTITY . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , GPE , ORG and CARDINAL , LAW , CARDINAL DATE ) . Furthermore , it appears that no significant investigative steps were taken after the cases were split ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Each of the CARDINAL defendant groups thus created was tried separately . CARDINAL of those trials concerned the events of DATE : they were all conducted by ORG and were completed in DATE and DATE ( CARDINAL trial concerned the events of DATE , and this trial was conducted by ORG ) .
