NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in PERSON prison , GPE - Palatinate . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , in cooperation with Mr O. Lagodny , a professor at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was arrested in TIME DATE while trespassing on a residential estate in a GPE suburb where he was suspected of having engaged in voyeuristic activities . The arrest occurred within the scope of police surveillance measures carried out following the killing of QUANTITY women , mother and daughter , in TIME CARDINAL DATE in a nearby housing area in GPE . On TIME DATE before the killings a man had been noticed in the garden of the GPE house at TIME while observing the daughter through her bedroom window . There were thus grounds for suspecting that the QUANTITY women had been killed by the said voyeur .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the course of police interrogations carried out during DATE following his arrest , the applicant first confessed having engaged in voyeuristic activities on several occasions in the past , then admitted to having assaulted a girl on CARDINAL occasions in DATE and , finally , he confessed to the killing of the CARDINAL women in TIME CARDINAL DATE . On the occasion of subsequent interrogations and interviews during his pre - trial detention , the applicant - while maintaining his confession that he had engaged in voyeuristic activities in the past - repeatedly withdrew and renewed his confessions regarding the sexual assaults in DATE and the killings in DATE . His description of the order and the way in which the killings had been committed differed from the account given on the occasion of his first confession .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant - now represented by counsel - finally revoked all previous confessions regarding the assault and killings and has protested his innocence ever since .", "CARDINAL . According to the bill of indictment submitted by ORG to ORG on DATE , it was likely that the applicant had first killed the daughter and subsequently the mother in order to cover up the daughter \u2019s murder .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the applicant \u2019s subsequent trial it was established that during the period from DATE to DATE the applicant had been active as a voyeur on numerous occasions . He had approached the homes of several girls or young women in the dark in order to observe them from outside . On most occasions he had further tried to draw his GPE attention to himself , asked them to have sexual intercourse and masturbated in front of their windows . His attempts to enter the women \u2019s homes by force were generally to no avail . However , on CARDINAL occasions in DATE the applicant managed to enter the home of an unsuspecting young woman through an open window and knocked her down when she rejected his sexual advances . As regards the killings of the CARDINAL women in DATE , the court found it established that during the period from DATE to DATE the applicant had repeatedly observed the DATE daughter at TIME through the window of her bedroom in her parent \u2019s house in GPE . In TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant broke into the family \u2019s home with a view to having sexual intercourse with the girl . He first killed the mother who had woken up when he had entered the house with a knife he carried along . He then went to the daughter \u2019s bedroom . When the latter rejected his sexual advances , the applicant - out of anger and sexual frustration - hit and stabbed the girl in the head and throat with his knife so that she bled to death .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( file no . CARDINAL Ks CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG held that the applicant had killed both women out of base motives . ORG based its findings in particular on the applicant \u2019s detailed description of the crime scene in the course of the preliminary proceedings as well as on his account of the events given on the occasion of his first confession of the killings in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the opinions of CARDINAL psychiatric experts , ORG considered that the applicant was suffering from a sexual deviation that had reached addictive dimensions and could considerably restrict his ability to control his acts in a sexual context . However , his sexual deviation did not amount to a mental illness that would exclude his criminal responsibility . In view of the particular gravity of the offences and the applicant \u2019s guilt ORG also saw no reason to mitigate the applicant \u2019s sentence .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , ORG found the applicant guilty on CARDINAL counts of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment in each case in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after hearing the applicant and ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , confirmed on appeal , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a reopening of the proceedings as inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having heard the applicant , the PERSON prison authorities as well as the GPE public prosecution authorities , concluded that in the case at hand the particular gravity of the applicant \u2019s guilt justified the continuation of his detention for more than the minimum period of DATE envisaged for murder . However , ORG specified that such finding did as a rule not exclude the suspension of the remainder of a life sentence at a later stage , for instance after a period of CARDINAL , DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE various psychiatric and psychologist expert opinions were obtained by the PERSON prison authorities on the question whether the applicant could be granted relaxations of his detention ( PERSON ) and whether his future release on probation was conceivable .", "CARDINAL . For instance , a psychiatric expert stated in an opinion rendered on DATE that the applicant \u2019s perversion had developed progressively and had finally escalated in destructive behaviour . The expert further found that the applicant \u2019s insistence on his innocence had meanwhile reached a pathological quality in itself and prevented him from accepting therapeutic help . It was thus impossible from a psychiatric point of view to assess whether the applicant had actually committed the crimes or to give a reliable criminal prognosis for the future . Having regard to , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s unobtrusive behaviour during detention , the expert saw no acute risk of recidivism and proposed to test the applicant \u2019s capacity to cope with life outside prison on the occasion of relaxations of his detention . He nevertheless specified that a theoretical risk that the applicant would commit further crimes could not be excluded .", "CARDINAL . In a statement of CARDINAL DATE the resident psychologist at ORG prison pointed out that the applicant still had problems in establishing interpersonal relations and trivialised his voyeurism . Thus , a potential danger that the applicant \u2019s sexual perversion would resurge in the event of his release on probation could not be excluded .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , in a statement of CARDINAL DATE a GPE psychotherapist who had provided regular outpatient psychological treatment to the applicant since DATE found that , having regard to the therapy carried out so far , there was \u201c no compelling reason to assume \u201d that the applicant had been intellectually capable of organising and committing the crimes . Consequently , it was also not to be expected that he would be capable of committing similar crimes in the future .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted first relaxations of his detention from DATE . However these relaxations were later revoked as a consequence of an expert opinion by a professor of ORG rendered in DATE . This expert stated that as a consequence of inappropriate therapy measures during his detention the applicant had taken to insist on his innocence and had become resistant to any further therapy attempts . The expert was of the opinion that irrespective of the fact that relaxations of the applicant \u2019s detention in the past had not given cause for complaints , there was a high risk that he would reoffend if confronted with conflict situations similar to the one that had been at the origin of the murders . In this expert \u2019s opinion the danger the applicant posed to society was not lower than at the time he had committed the crimes .", "CARDINAL . A further psychiatrist opinion of CARDINAL DATE considered that the applicant had made considerable progress as regards his ability to establish interpersonal relationships and had learned to constructively deal with his sexuality . The expert further pointed out that the applicant had not abused previous relaxations of his detention and had not shown aggressive or sexually deviating behaviour in the course of his meanwhile DATE of detention . He therefore suggested that relaxations of his detention be reinstated with a view to testing whether a conditional suspension of his life sentence could be considered in the future .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , in DATE , the applicant was transferred to open prison facilities , allowed to take up employment outside prison and to make his journeys to and back from work without supervision . He was further granted prison leave that he spent in an apartment rented by him for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . The same psychiatric expert who had rendered the opinion in DATE addressed the possibility of the applicant \u2019s conditional release on probation in a further opinion of CARDINAL DATE commissioned by ORG ( GPE ) . The expert noted that the applicant had made further progress with a view to his social integration and that his conduct during relaxations of his detention had been unobjectionable . He therefore confirmed his previous finding that the applicant \u2019s criminal prognosis was rather positive . He pointed out that , however , the applicant still lacked experience in establishing and maintaining sexual relations . While the risk of recidivism could be further reduced by accompanying therapeutic treatment , it was impossible to assess the likelihood that the applicant would commit further serious crimes if confronted with a situation of conflict in a sexual context .", "CARDINAL . In a statement of CARDINAL DATE the GPE psychologist who had attended to the applicant since DATE ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) expressed the view that as a result of specific therapeutic measures implemented since DATE the applicant had gained in social competence and made progress regarding a possible social integration . He had learned to control his actions and therefore further relaxations of his detention should be considered .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG held that the particular gravity of the applicant \u2019s guilt had been compensated by the execution of his sentence for meanwhile over DATE and thus did no longer require the continued execution of his life sentence . In line with the proposal of the public prosecution authorities , the court , after having heard the applicant on DATE , nevertheless refused the latter \u2019s first request to suspend his detention on probation on the ground that there remained a risk that he would commit similar offences if released .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s related appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . ORG noted that if , as in the case at hand , the offence at issue qualified as murder , the safety interest of the public was of particular importance . A release on probation could not be considered if there remained an even remote risk that the convict would commit further serious crimes if released . While the findings in the numerous psychological and psychiatric expert opinions established over DATE had been to some extent contradictory , they had nevertheless all confirmed that a risk that the applicant would commit further serious crimes threatening the life of others could not be excluded . The court specified that the statement of the applicant \u2019s long - time therapist of CARDINAL DATE ( see \u00a7 DATE above ) which was at variance with the experts\u2019 findings did not lead to a different conclusion since this therapist was lacking the required distance and impartiality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again requested that he be released on probation and submitted that his continued detention for meanwhile DATE violated his human dignity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG commissioned an additional expert opinion on the likelihood that the applicant would commit further serious crimes if released . It was rendered by a deputy medical director ( ORG ) of the GPE psychiatric university clinic on DATE . This expert pointed out that the applicant \u2019s irreproachable behaviour during the relaxations of his detention over DATE constituted a positive criterion for his criminal prognosis . He nevertheless shared the view of previous experts that the applicant \u2019s persevering denial of the crimes prevented him from appreciating and analysing the specific circumstances and motives which had led to the murders . It was thus difficult to assess the remaining risk of recidivism and it could not be excluded that the applicant still posed a threat to society .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , after hearing the said psychiatric expert as well as the applicant and referring to written statements from the GPE public prosecution authorities as well as the PERSON prison authorities , again ordered that the execution of the applicant \u2019s detention be continued . In its decision - making the court took into account that the PERSON prison authorities had given a favourable opinion on the applicant \u2019s possible release on probation in view of the fact that he had never abused relaxations of his detention which had been implemented for meanwhile DATE . ORG , relying in particular on the assessment by the said psychiatric expert , nevertheless held that the applicant \u2019s criminal prognosis was still uncertain . This assessment was further supported by the resident psychologist at ORG prison . In a written statement of CARDINAL DATE he had stated that the applicant \u2019s lack of insight into his deed did not even allow for a positive criminal prognosis in the long term .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed the decision by written submissions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . He maintained , inter alia , that contrary to the ORG \u2019s criminal prognosis , were bound by the statement and assessment of facts as established in ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , endorsing ORG reasoning , dismissed the appeal as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s submissions , it had to be assumed that the offences had been committed as established in the first instance judgment of DATE . This finding was in line with the wording of LAW ( see relevant domestic law below ) stipulating that in their assessment whether a life sentence was to be suspended on probation the courts , shall , inter alia , take into account the circumstances of the convict \u2019s crime . These circumstances of a case could only be established in the proceedings leading to the conviction . It was not the task of the court dealing with issues in relation to the subsequent execution of the convict \u2019s sentence to reassess the facts . The only appropriate remedy for a convict alleging that new evidence had occurred following his conviction would be a request for a reopening of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further noted that it followed from the experts\u2019 opinions that the likelihood that the applicant would commit similar offences if released could not be assessed in a reliable way . Even the opinions established in DATE by the expert who had given a rather positive criminal prognosis for the applicant , based on his unobtrusive conduct during the execution and relaxations of his sentence , had concluded that it was unpredictable how the applicant would react if confronted with a situation of conflict within a sexual context . Subsequent psychological statements and opinions had also come to the conclusion that a risk of his reoffending could not be excluded even if the applicant was to be monitored closely . ORG therefore considered that the applicant was a \u201c ticking bomb \u201d and that the risk that he would commit a serious violent crime was not merely theoretical irrespective of his irreproachable conduct during detention . While taking into account the applicant \u2019s increasing interest to be released in view of his detention for meanwhile DATE , ORG concluded that in view of the gravity of the offences committed , the applicant \u2019s denial of the deeds and the resulting doubts in respect of a positive criminal prognosis , the safety interest of the public still prevailed over the applicant \u2019s interest to be released on probation . The continued execution of his life sentence was thus proportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about a violation of his right to be heard ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) and challenged the presiding judge at ORG for bias . He alleged in particular , that ORG had ignored his argument that the facts as stated in ORG judgment of DATE were not binding on the psychological experts . Furthermore , it had not addressed his concerns whether the indefinite execution of a life sentence was in compliance with the German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) . His applications were rejected by ORG on DATE and DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the decisions of ORG of DATE and ORG dated DATE . On DATE , he extended his constitutional complaint to the decisions of ORG dated DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a leading decision ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) running to some CARDINAL pages , rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint as ill - founded to the extent he had challenged the refusal of the domestic courts to suspend his detention on probation .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the execution of a life sentence beyond the period warranted by the particular gravity of a convict \u2019s guilt on the ground that the latter still presented a threat to society did not as such violate his or her constitutionally guaranteed right to respect of human dignity or right to liberty . However , the protection of human dignity and the principle of the rule of law required that a detained person had a concrete and realistically attainable chance to regain his freedom at some later point in time . Such prospect of release was guaranteed by means of a strict scrutiny by the domestic courts whether an ongoing detention was still proportionate . The longer a detention lasted , the stricter the scrutiny of whether it was still proportionate had to be . A detainee \u2019s ever increasing interest to be released in the course of a lengthy detention on the one hand was restricted by the ORG \u2019s mandate to protect the rights of others and the safety interest of the public on the other . Where criminal offences such as murder were to be expected in the event of a potential recidivism , the safety interest of the public required particular protection . A release on probation could only be envisaged if the remaining risk for the safety interest of the public was justifiable . However , even in the event a convict had committed serious violent or sexual crimes , a release on probation could not be refused by the domestic courts simply on the ground that there existed a mere theoretical risk of recidivism ( which in view of the limited possibilities of any kind of prognosis could in any event never be excluded ) . It rather had to be based on concrete factual circumstances establishing that such risk was unjustifiable having regard to the safety interest of the public .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further pointed out that a convict \u2019s interest in being released also had an impact on the procedural requirements to be observed by the courts when deciding on a possible suspension of a sentence of life imprisonment . In view of the indefinite duration of a life sentence , domestic law provided for a judicial examination of a request for a release on probation which could be lodged by the public prosecution authorities as well as the convict at any point in time . Furthermore , the conditions for a possible release had to be assessed by the authorities at an early stage in order to enable them to take appropriate measures to prepare a convict \u2019s possible release . In this connection relaxations of detention were of particular importance since they offered the judge a broader and sounder basis for an assessment of the detainee \u2019s criminal prognosis with respect to a life in liberty . When assessing the likelihood that a convict would commit further serious crimes if released , the courts were under an obligation to obtain the best possible clarification of the circumstances of a case and had to base their prognosis on a sufficiently substantiated and recent expert opinion . Finally , any court decisions on the continuation of a lengthy detention had to be carefully reasoned and disclose the basis of the judge \u2019s assessment . In the event the continued detention was primarily justified by the safety interest of the public , it had to be considered whether the particular burden of a long - lasting deprivation of liberty could be countered by granting the convict certain privileges in DATE prison routine , thus allowing him to retain some quality of life .", "ORG found that the impugned decisions of ORG and ORG had complied with the aforementioned constitutional requirements . The domestic courts had struck a fair balance between the applicant \u2019s right to be released and the safety interest of the public . ORG , in its appeal decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , had not only taken into consideration the considerable length of the applicant \u2019s detention of meanwhile DATE but also his good conduct . It had further made a thorough assessment of the various expert opinions on the applicant \u2019s criminal prognosis and provided arguments why it shared the evaluation of the external expert opinion of DATE confirming that a risk of recidivism could not be excluded . On the basis of the expert \u2019s assessment ORG had concluded that such risk was not merely theoretical and had demonstrated that under certain conditions the applicant \u2019s ability to control his actions was reduced to an extent that made it possible that he would commit similar serious offences even if he was to be closely monitored following a possible release . ORG , while noting that a more convincing reasoning of the NORP decisions would have been desirable , conceded that the lack of clarification of the specific circumstances leading to the murders resulted from the applicant \u2019s failure to reflect on the crimes . Under these circumstances , ORG assessment that the likelihood of the applicant committing further serious crimes such as murder was of a degree that the safety interest of the public had to prevail over his interest to be released , had nevertheless been reasonable .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG pointed out that in view of the fact that no review of the applicant \u2019s detention had occurred since the impugned decision of DATE , the public prosecution authorities were under an obligation to investigate ex officio why the applicant had not submitted a related request .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG decision of DATE in the proceedings at issue , the PERSON prison authorities ordered in DATE that the applicant \u2019s cell and his apartment outside prison be searched . There had further been evidence that in DATE and DATE the applicant had extended his journeys to and back from work on several occasions . On the occasion of the search of his apartment the PERSON prison authorities seized , inter alia , binoculars , numerous magazines , photographs and video cassettes of a pornographic nature , ropes and adhesive tapes , as well as women \u2019s underwear .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the ORG prison authorities ordered that all relaxations of the applicant \u2019s detention be removed on the ground that the outcome of the search had shown that there was a risk that he would abuse releases from prison in order to commit further serious crimes .", "CARDINAL . The resident psychologist at ORG prison , in a statement of CARDINAL July CARDINAL , pointed out that the applicant had stood the test of previous relaxations of detention and that the removal of his privileges implied the loss of his apartment , employment , personal environment outside prison and of all existing social perspectives . However , while the fact that the applicant had abused his journeys to work and the materials found in his flat did not constitute a clear indication for an acute risk of recidivism , the recent developments had made a reliable positive prognosis for the applicant even more difficult .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to have the relaxations of his detention reinstated . The ORG found that the prison authorities\u2019 decision to remove the applicant \u2019s privileges had been justified for the protection of the safety interest of the public . Considering the expert opinions rendered in the course of the applicant \u2019s lengthy detention and taking into account that a significant amount of pornographic material had been seized in the applicant \u2019s flat , the court was of the opinion that there remained a considerable risk that the applicant may reoffend .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision was rejected by ORG on DATE as inadmissible . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint . No further information was submitted to the ORG in relation to the proceedings before ORG in this respect .", "CARDINAL . A subsequent request for reinstatement of relaxations of the applicant \u2019s detention of CARDINAL DATE was rejected by the PERSON prison authorities on DATE . The prison authorities conceded that the applicant \u2019s conduct since the removal of previous relaxations of his detention in DATE had been irreproachable . He had worked in the prison \u2019s locksmith \u2019s shop and maintained extensive contacts with the outside world like , inter alia , with his former employer and colleagues as well as his former therapist . The fact that he had also stood the test of DATE of relaxations of his detention DATE , the long duration of his imprisonment as well as his advanced age also were arguments in favour of granting him the right to unsupervised releases from prison . However , the applicant \u2019s unaltered denial of his deeds and the fact that he trivialised his sexual deviation prevented any perspective of therapeutic progress . In this context the prison authorities also referred to an expert opinion obtained on CARDINAL DATE stating that in view of the high remaining risk of recidivism relaxations of the applicant \u2019s detention were only justifiable if combined with continuous and close monitoring . Accordingly , the prison authorities concluded that the protection of the rights at stake outweighed the applicant \u2019s interest in social reintegration .", "Ever since the applicant was only granted occasional supervised releases from prison .", "CARDINAL . By written submissions of CARDINAL DATE the applicant again requested that the remainder of his life sentence be suspended on probation and asked ORG to obtain an expert opinion on the likelihood that he would commit further serious offences if released . In a statement of CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON prison authorities opposed the applicant \u2019s release on probation since he still did not show any insight into the crimes .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG commissioned the expert opinion and appointed an expert proposed by the applicant . The expert opinion was rendered on DATE . The expert pointed out that leading forensic psychiatrists had established that the risk of recidivism following release did not depend on the offender \u2019s insight into the offence committed . The expert therefore concluded that the fact that the applicant insisted on his innocence could not have a negative impact on his legal prognosis . However , there was nothing to establish that the applicant \u2019s character had matured since he had committed the crimes or that any therapeutic progress had been made . It therefore remained impossible to assess the potential risk of recidivism , in particular in the long term , and it was unlikely that future expert opinions would come to a different assessment . The expert held that relaxations of the applicant \u2019s detention , such as unsupervised releases from prison could be reinstated with a view to preparing the applicant \u2019s placement in supervised accommodation ( PERSON ) . Even if integrated in such supervised accommodation it would be necessary to closely monitor the applicant and provide counselling as regards his sexual behaviour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after hearing the applicant as well as the expert and having regard to the prison authorities\u2019 statement of DATE , again rejected the applicant \u2019s request that his life sentence be suspended on probation and held that a further similar request would be inadmissible if made within DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG , referring to the principles set out in ORG decision of DATE with respect to the proportionality of the continued execution of a life sentence , concluded that the applicant \u2019s continued detention was still justified . In its assessment ORG referred in detail to the various expert opinions rendered over DATE , in particular the expert opinion of DATE . While taking into account the significant duration of the applicant \u2019s detention for meanwhile DATE and his good conduct on the one hand , the court also considered the particular brutality characterising the crimes and the fact that the applicant did not show any insight into the deeds and his sexual deviation . The court nevertheless pointed out that the principle of proportionality required granting the applicant an opportunity to show that he was able to stand the test of relaxations of his detention and to improve his criminal prognosis . It therefore supported the expert \u2019s proposal that closely monitored relaxations of the applicant \u2019s detention be granted and held that prior to a possible placement of the applicant in supervised accommodation he would have to prove during DATE that he was capable of dealing with situations of conflict in a sexual context outside prison with a view to preparing a possible release on probation .", "CARDINAL . It appears that since DATE the applicant has been granted the right to unsupervised releases from prison DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Pursuant to LAW ) , the intentional killing of a person is to be classified as murder if certain aggravating elements are present . A murderer under this provision is any person who kills another person for pleasure , for sexual gratification , out of greed or otherwise base motives , by stealth or cruelly or by means that pose a danger to the public or in order to facilitate or to cover up another offence .", "CARDINAL . Murder is punishable by life imprisonment . A declaration by the sentencing court that the defendant \u2019s guilt is of a particular gravity may , inter alia , have a bearing on a subsequent decision regarding suspension of the latter part of the defendant \u2019s prison sentence on probation .", "CARDINAL .
