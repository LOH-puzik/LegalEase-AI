The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He is an advocate who has been practising for DATE . He was formerly a lawyer at ORG and a member of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was defending a person accused of murder before ORG . He alleged that , while he was conducting the cross - examination of a prosecution witness , a police constable , the court interrupted him after he had put a question to the witness . He claimed that he had felt offended and had sought permission to withdraw from the case . In their written observations , the ORG stated that the court had attempted to make a routine intervention with a simple and polite remark regarding the manner in which the applicant was cross - examining the witness . The applicant had immediately interrupted , without allowing the court to finish its remark and refusing to proceed with his cross - examination .", "CARDINAL . The verbatim record of the proceedings reports the following exchange ( translation ) :", "\u201c Court : We consider that your cross - examination goes into detail beyond the extent to which it should go at this stage of the main trial regarding questions ...", "Applicant : I will stop my cross - examination ...", "Court : Mr Kyprianou ...", "Applicant : Since the ORG considers that I am not doing my job properly in defending this man , I ask for your leave to withdraw from this case .", "Court : Whether an advocate is to be granted leave to withdraw or not is a matter within the discretionary power of the court and , in the light of what we have heard , no such leave is granted . We rely on GPE and Others v. the Republic and we do not grant leave .", "Applicant : Since you are preventing me from continuing my cross - examination on significant points of the case , then my role here does not serve any purpose .", "Court : We consider your persistence ...", "Applicant : And I am sorry that when I was cross - examining the members of the ORG were talking to each other , passing ravasakia among themselves , which is not compatible with allowing me to continue the cross - examination with the required vigour , if it is under the secret scrutiny of the ORG .", "Court : We consider that what has just been said by PERSON , and in particular the manner in which he addresses the ORG , constitutes a contempt of court and PERSON GPE has CARDINAL choices : either to maintain what he said and to give reasons why no sentence should be imposed on him , or to decide whether he should retract . We give him this opportunity exceptionally . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of ORG PERSON applies to its full extent .", "Applicant : You can try me .", "Court : Would you like to say anything ?", "Applicant : I saw with my own eyes the small pieces of paper going from one judge to another when I was cross - examining , in a way that is not very flattering to the defence . How can I find the stamina to defend a man who is accused of murder ?", "Court ( Mr PERSON ) : It so happens that the piece of paper to which Mr PERSON refers is still in the hands of brother Judge PERSON and PERSON may inspect it .", "Court ( PERSON ) : The exchange of written views between the members of the bench as to the manner in which Mr PERSON is conducting the case does not give him any rights , and I consider Mr GPE 's behaviour utterly unacceptable .", "Court ( Mr PERSON ) : We shall have a break in order to consider the matter . The defendant [ in the main trial ] should in the meantime remain in custody .", "...", "Court : We considered the matter during the adjournment and continue to believe that what Mr PERSON said , the content , the manner and the tone of his voice , constitute a contempt of court as provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ... that is showing disrespect to the court by way of words and conduct . We already asked PERSON before the break if he had anything to add before we pass sentence on him . If he has something to add , let us hear him . Otherwise , the ORG should proceed .", "Applicant : Mr President , during the break , I certainly wondered what the offence was which I had committed . The events took place in a very tense atmosphere . I am defending a very serious case ; I felt that I was interrupted in my cross - examination and said what I said . I have been a lawyer for DATE , my record is unblemished and it is the first time I have faced such an accusation . That is all I have to say .", "Court : We shall adjourn for TIME and shall then proceed with sentencing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After a short break ORG , by a majority , sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment . The court referred to the above exchange between the applicant and its members and held as follows :", "\u201c ... It is not easy , through words , to convey the atmosphere which Mr PERSON created since , quite apart from the unacceptable content of his statements , the tone of his voice as well as his demeanour and gestures to the ORG , not only gave an unacceptable impression of any civilised place , and a courtroom in particular , but were apparently aimed at creating a climate of intimidation and terror within the ORG . We are not exaggerating at all in saying that PERSON was shouting at and gesturing to the ORG .", "It was pointed out to him that his statements and his behaviour amounted to contempt of court and he was given the opportunity to speak . And while there was a reasonable expectation that Mr Kyprianou would calm down and that he would apologise , PERSON , in the same tone and with the same intensity already referred to , shouted , ' You can try me ' .", "Later , after a long break , PERSON was given a second chance to address the ORG , in the hope that he would apologise and mitigate the damage caused by his behaviour . Unfortunately , at this stage Mr GPE still showed no signs of regret or , at least , of comprehension of the unacceptable situation he had created . On the contrary , he stated that during the break he wondered what his crime had been , merely attributing his behaviour to the ' very tense atmosphere ' . However , he was solely responsible for the creation of that atmosphere and , therefore , he can not use it as an excuse .", "Mr PERSON did not hesitate to suggest that the exchange of views between the members of the bench amounted to an exchange of ' ravasakia ' , that is , ' love letters ' ( See Dictionary of Modern Greek \u2013 ' NORP ravasaki ( NORP ravas ) , love letter , written love note ' ) . And he accused the ORG , which was trying to regulate the course of the proceedings , as it had the right and the duty to do , of restricting him and of doing justice in secret .", "We can not conceive of another occasion of such a manifest and unacceptable contempt of court by any person , let alone an advocate .", "The judges as persons , whom PERSON has deeply insulted , are the least of our concern . What really concerns us is the authority and integrity of justice . If the ORG 's reaction is not immediate and drastic , we feel that justice will have suffered a disastrous blow . An inadequate reaction on the part of the lawful and civilised order , as expressed by the courts , would mean accepting that the authority of the courts be demeaned .", "It is with great sadness that we conclude that the only adequate response , in the circumstances , is the imposition of a sentence of a deterrent nature , which can only be imprisonment .", "We are well aware of the repercussions of this decision since the person concerned is an advocate of long standing , but it is PERSON himself who , through his conduct , has brought matters to this end .", "In the light of the above we impose a sentence of imprisonment of DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The President of ORG , however , considered that the imposition of a fine amounting to QUANTITY ( MONEY ) , that is , the maximum penal sum provided by LAW ) of ORG Law CARDINAL ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , would have been the appropriate sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his prison sentence immediately . He was in fact released before completing the full term , in accordance with section CARDINAL of the Prison Law ( Law no . DATE see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , which was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal , the applicant relied on a total of CARDINAL grounds challenging the procedure followed by ORG , its decision and the sentence imposed on him . The eighth ground of his appeal read as follows :", "\u201c According to established precedent , the imposition of a sentence on an advocate is practised with restraint and in serious cases , and never for the suppression of methods of advocacy that are simply offensive given that the advocate has sufficient freedom in the handling of his client 's case . The conduct of the [ applicant ] counsel could not be described either as aggressive or as contemptuous of the ORG under all the circumstances even though it constituted expression of the feelings of counsel under the pressure of cross - examination of witnesses in a murder case and the refusal of the ORG after an intervention at the stage of cross - examination to allow counsel to withdraw from the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Attorney - General was invited by ORG to take part in the proceedings as amicus curiae .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its decision dismissing the applicant 's appeal , ORG stated that the relevant constitutional provisions of NORP law on contempt of court reflected the principles of LANGUAGE law . It relied on LAW , which enables the enactment of legislation giving jurisdiction to any court to order the imprisonment for DATE of any person who does not comply with a judgment or order of that court , and to punish contempt of court . It held that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG was lawfully authorised by Article CARDINAL . Finally , it concluded that it was the applicant who had created a tense atmosphere by his disdainful attitude and by undermining the court 's role .", "CARDINAL . ORG held , inter alia :", "\u201c We think that there was nothing wrong in the determination of the acts of contempt . The ORG gave Mr PERSON the chance to reply , predetermining indirectly its intention not to continue with imposing a sentence , should Mr GPE dissociate himself from what he had said and did so with an expression of sincere apology . There was no apology .", "...", "It is our finding that PERSON , by words and conduct , showed disrespect to the ORG , by committing the offence of contempt of court referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON .", "...", "It is not fortuitous that the successive objectives of the constitutional legislator , which are embodied in LAW CARDINAL of the LAW , exist side by side . The power to sanction contempt of court is aimed at the protection of judicial institutions , which is essential in order to safeguard a fair trial . The identification of the judge with a prosecutor made by the applicant 's lawyer overlooks the court 's role and the purpose for which it is granted authority . Its authority is interwoven with the prerequisites for securing its judicial function . The role of the judge is nothing more than that of the defender of judicial proceedings and of the court 's authority , the very existence of which are necessary to secure a fair trial . A lawyer , a servant of justice , is not a party to the case . By abusing the right to be heard and being in contempt of court , a lawyer intervenes in the proceedings , as any third party , and interferes with the course and thereby harms justice . The judicial sanctioning of contempt , where necessary , is a judicial duty exercised for the purpose of securing the right to a fair trial . The impersonal and objectively defined issue is associated with the facts of the case ; any indifference of the court in the face of reproach regarding its function would leave it exposed to the charge that it does not conduct a fair trial . The fairness of the judges is the quintessence of the administration of justice .", "...", "In this case , PERSON tried to prevail over the court and direct the course of the trial . If the court remained indifferent before such a scene , this would constitute a betrayal of the performance of its duty . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c We find that PERSON , by words and conduct , showed disrespect to the court and committed the offence of contempt in the face of the ORG contrary to section CARDINAL ) of the PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In relation to the sentence imposed on the applicant , ORG stated , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c The exercise of the power of the court to impose sentence on persons who act in contempt of court is the ultimate measure , but it is indispensable whenever the dignity of the court is offended and the fulfilment of its mission impeded . Punishment is not a court 's choice . It becomes its duty only when justice demands it . It is indicative of the rarity of a lawyer 's conviction for contempt of court that this is the first time , since the establishment of the Republic , as far as we are able to ascertain , that a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed on a lawyer for contempt of court . This attitude is not unrelated to the awareness of the lawyer 's mission . It is not possible , however , to allow the legal profession to act contrary to the lawyer 's function . The lawyer who repudiates his role as a servant of justice also repudiates the protection that is given to him for putting his client 's rights forward without fear or distraction . In setting himself against the court for his own purposes , he acts contrary to his vocation and shares the same fate as everyone else who acts in contempt of court .", "It is sad that PERSON did not withdraw what he said and did in ORG . He did not apologise , even before us .", "...", "It was up to ORG to deal with the contempt and to decide the means for the treatment and punishment of the person in contempt . No reason has been shown which justifies our intervention with regard to the sentence imposed .", "We feel sad because a lawyer like PERSON , with DATE of service in the profession , was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for contempt of court . But we are even sadder because a lawyer with so many years in service struck at ORG . We are relieved this is the first time that ORG has suffered in this way . We hope that this will also be the last time . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW provide as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

CARDINAL applies in magistrates ' courts and the other in ORG and county courts ( practice note issued by the Lord Chief Justice in DATE and practice direction issued by the Lord Chief Justice , supplemental to Order no . CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG and Order no . CARDINAL of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the latter , for example , where the committal application relates to contempt in the face of the court it would normally be appropriate to defer consideration of the behaviour to allow the respondent a period of reflection . Furthermore , the judge should , inter alia : inform the respondent in detail , and preferably in writing , of the actions and behaviour of the respondent which have given rise to the committal application ; notify the respondent of the possible penalties he faces ; allow the respondent an opportunity to apologise to the court and provide explanations for his actions and behaviour ; and allow for arrangements for legal representation . In addition , if there is a risk of the appearance of bias , the presiding judge should ask another judge to hear the committal application ( sections CARDINAL of the practice direction ) .", "CARDINAL . Overall , judges have the power to deal with and punish contempt committed before them , although the courts have recognised that this summary procedure should be used exceptionally and when categorically necessary in the interests of justice . Thus , while accepting that the procedure must retain a summary nature in order for it to be effective , the courts have also sought to ensure that the procedure is fair and consistent with the provisions of LAW . ORG , through its judgments , has given courts guidance as to the safeguards they need to adopt in order to ensure that the summary process is fair for the alleged contemner . These include , inter alia , allowing a short period of reflection , the possibility of an adjournment , arrangements for legal representation , and giving an opportunity to apologise ( see PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ; NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] Criminal Law Reports CARDINAL ; and PERSON DATE ] CARDINAL All England Reports CARDINAL ) . It appears from the case - law that the courts have acknowledged the importance of avoiding the danger of a real possibility of bias , the applicable test being that of \u201c apparent bias \u201d , namely , whether the circumstances would lead a fair - minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility that the court was biased ( see ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Reports CARDINAL , and PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Appeal Court CARDINAL ) . ORG recently stated in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL Criminal Appeal Reports CARDINAL ) that the common - law requirements of natural justice in dealing with criminal contempt did not fall short of the Convention requirements .", "CARDINAL . The offence of contempt of court in GPE is a sui generis offence . With limited exceptions , the law on contempt remains part of the common law . Contempt committed in facie curiae is normally dealt with summarily by the presiding judge . Where it also amounts to a criminal offence , it may be prosecuted on indictment or on summary complaint .", "CARDINAL . While the procedure remains in essence a summary one , in practice measures have been put in place in order to ensure fairness . In particular , judges follow a memorandum issued on DATE by the Lord Justice - General that provides guidelines concerning the procedure to be adopted when judges are considering whether the conduct of any party during a trial constitutes a contempt of court . For instance , the act of contempt should be dealt with expeditiously but most importantly fairly and objectively ; the alleged contemner must be given the opportunity to obtain legal advice and representation , to apologise for his conduct and make a statement in mitigation . Furthermore , although the normal rule is that the presiding judge will deal personally with the contempt , it is recognised that , exceptionally , another judge may need to deal with the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law , contempt of court is an offence sui generis within the inherent jurisdiction of the court . Contempt in facie curiae comes within the ambit of criminal contempt and is tried summarily by both superior and inferior courts .", "CARDINAL . The NORP courts have consistently observed that contempt of court is not an offence against the personal dignity of judges but rather it is the name given to the kind of wrongful conduct which consists of interference with the administration of justice . The power to adjudicate and punish such conduct is considered an essential adjunct of the rule of law and an inherent aspect of the authority of judges to control the proceedings before them .", "CARDINAL . For the purposes of safeguarding the rights of the alleged contemner and ensuring fairness , certain procedural guarantees are afforded in the case of contempt in the face of the court , including the requirement that judges should only determine such proceedings arising out of events in their court where it is necessary to do so .", "CARDINAL . In NORP law , contempt of court is regulated by legislation in Title XVII of the Second Book of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure entitled \u201c Of the Respect Due to the Court \u201d . These rules also apply to courts of criminal jurisdiction , by virtue of Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to the long - established practice of NORP courts , contempt committed in the face of the court is punishable by the judge or magistrate presiding over the proceedings in the course of which the contempt is committed . Contempt may take the form of disturbance in the courtroom by way , for example , of exclamations of approval or disapproval , improper behaviour such as indecent words or gestures or insulting remarks ( Article CARDINAL ) or the use of insulting or offensive expressions in written pleadings or during the hearing ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , the following four types of sanction are available in respect of contempt committed in facie curiae : reprimand , expulsion from the court , a fine in terms of LAW and , lastly , arrest for a period not exceeding TIME in a place within the court building .", "CARDINAL . The only possible exception to this summary procedure is where contempt constitutes an offence under LAW ( The ORG v. PERSON , DATE ) . In such circumstances , it is prosecuted as a criminal offence . The presiding judge or magistrate can order the arrest of the offender , draw up a proc\u00e8s - verbal of the fact and remit the party arrested to the magistrates ' court ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , special provision is made for acts of contempt committed by lawyers . The normal sanctions are not applied but , in serious cases , the judge or magistrate may \u201c forthwith \u201d suspend the lawyer from practising for a period not exceeding DATE ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

In its Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL , ORG recommends the governments of member States to take or reinforce , as the case may be , all measures they consider necessary with a view to implementing the freedom of exercise of the profession of lawyer . For instance , \u201c lawyers should not suffer or be threatened with any sanctions or pressure when acting in accordance with their professional standards \u201d . Lawyers should , however , \u201c respect the judiciary and carry out their duties towards the court in a manner consistent with domestic legal and other rules and professional standards \u201d ( Principles I \u00a7 CARDINAL and III \u00a7 CARDINAL ; see ORG v.
