The applicants , CARDINAL NORP military pensioners whose names along with other relevant information are listed below ( GPE ) , live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the same time as the conclusion of a treaty on the withdrawal of NORP troops from NORP territory , GPE and GPE signed an agreement concerning the provision of social security guarantees to the retired military personnel of the armed forces of GPE on the territory of GPE ( \u201c the Agreement \u201d ) . The Agreement provided that retired military personnel , that is \u2212 persons discharged from army service and receiving pensions , could apply for residence permits in GPE . GPE undertook the securing of the payment of pensions to the persons concerned according to NORP legislation . Furthermore , it was stipulated that the retired military personnel could also apply for an NORP pension , in which case the payment of their NORP pension would be suspended while they were receiving an NORP pension , and vice versa .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the NORP military pension was , in most cases , considerably higher than the NORP old - age pension . Then , after the change in the economic situation and amendment of the pension law , the NORP military retirees faced the situation where they could choose to receive either a NORP military pension ( smaller than the average old - age pension in GPE ) or an NORP old - age pension for DATE of service . In the latter case , DATE of pensionable employment in the civil sphere \u2013 and not the DATE of service in the NORP ( NORP ) armed forces \u2013 were taken into account . According to the applicants , in both cases the sums were rather small and not enough for survival in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE many military retirees , including the applicants , who had worked in GPE in the civil sphere and fulfilled the requirements ( in particular , DATE of pensionable employment in GPE ) for receiving an NORP old - age pension , applied for and were granted , such a pension for life . However , DATE , after a regular exchange of information between the NORP social insurance authorities and ORG , the NORP authorities realised that ORG was continuing to pay the persons concerned NORP military pensions . The NORP authorities then suspended the payment of the NORP pension to the persons concerned and requested that they provide confirmation of the suspension of payment of the NORP military pension if they wished that the payment of the NORP pension be resumed .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , who referred to information published in the LANGUAGE - speaking press , the average military pension paid by GPE in DATE was , depending on the person 's military rank , CARDINAL , CARDINAL kroons ( EEK ) DATE ( corresponding to CARDINAL , CARDINAL or CARDINAL ( ORG ) , respectively ) . At the same time , the average old - age pension in GPE was EEK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . Although the pensions paid by GPE had increased since DATE , the NORP military pension was higher than the average NORP old - age pension and definitely higher than the minimum pension established in GPE ( EEK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in DATE ) which they had been guaranteed under LAW .", "According to the applicants , who relied on the information from ORG in GPE , the average pension of a NORP military pensioner in GPE in DATE was EEK CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) \u2212 which was much less than the average NORP pension at the same time .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the decisions of the NORP social security authorities to suspend the payment of the NORP old - age pension ( in the case of Mr PERSON DATE invalidity pension ) . Arguing that they had been discriminated against and that their property rights had been violated , they lodged complaints with the competent administrative courts against the individual decisions of the NORP social security authorities . They requested that the courts order the social security authorities to resume payment of the pension . Their complaints were dismissed in separate administrative court proceedings by the administrative courts and courts of appeal . In the case of all of the applicants , with the exception of PERSON V. PERSON , ORG dismissed the appeals as manifestly illfounded . Mr PERSON appeal was refused by ORG because of his failure to pay the court fee of EEK CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . ORG examined his request for exemption and rejected it by a reasoned decision .", "CARDINAL . The reasoning underlying the individual decisions of the social security authorities as well as the complaints and judgments in respect of each of the applicants were similar and can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The courts found that the clear and unequivocal wording of LAW provided that CARDINAL of the States ( not both GPE simultaneously ) , should pay a pension to the military retirees . Simultaneous payment of the NORP military pension and the NORP old - age pension was excluded because ORG PERSON pensionikindlustuse seadus ) provided that if an international agreement entered into by GPE contained provisions which differed from the provisions of this LAW for the grant or payment of pensions , the international agreement applied ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . By way of comparison , the courts noted that ORG generally provided that persons who had the right to receive several state pensions were granted CARDINAL state pension of their choice . The same applied to members of ORG even if they qualified for an old - age pension and defence forces pension simultaneously ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( ORG seadus ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The courts did not exclude the possibility that there were people living in GPE who were receiving military pensions from a foreign country and , at the same time , a state pension from GPE . Nevertheless , they found that the NORP military retirees had not been discriminated against , as their situation was not comparable to that of persons who had served in the armies of GPE which were members of the same international organisations as GPE , such as ORG or ORG . The courts pointed out that the relationship of GPE with those countries had been established on a different basis .", "CARDINAL . The courts dismissed the argument concerning an alleged violation of the applicants ' legitimate expectation , noting that they could have no legitimate expectation of receiving CARDINAL pensions simultaneously , as the Agreement provided that a person could not receive CARDINAL pensions at the same time .", "CARDINAL . The courts also rejected the applicants ' allegation that their property rights had been violated , finding that , as they were continuing to receive their NORP military pension , the applicants did not meet the conditions required for receiving the NORP pension and that therefore they had no property rights within the meaning of LAW . The courts emphasised in this context that the applicants had the right to opt for an NORP pension instead of the NORP one at any moment they wished .", "CARDINAL . The courts found that the essence of the applicants ' pension rights had not been undermined , as they had been guaranteed an income sufficient for subsistence . They noted that , according to LAW , the applicants received a pension at least equal in value to the amount of the minimum pension in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the courts noted that the GPE which were parties to the ORG could amend LAW so that each of them undertook to pay pensions according to DATE of work in the respective country . However , this was a matter of political will ; the actual Agreement did not foresee such a possibility and there were no grounds for not applying the Agreement .", "CARDINAL .

Military pensioners , subject to the Agreement , do not fall under the general pension agreement .", "CARDINAL . The Government informed the ORG that GPE and GPE were holding negotiations to sign a new general pension agreement instead of the current one which was due to expire in DATE . According to its draft , each country would pay pension for DATE of pensionable employment accumulated on its territory . That principle would also apply to the military pensioners instead of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL ) ORG of ORG dealt with a case similar to that of the applicants . ORG quashed the lower court 's judgment on procedural grounds and therefore did not rule on the merits of the case . Nevertheless , it pronounced its opinion on some aspects of the matter .", "ORG considered that the so - called military pension paid under the Agreement was not a state pension and that therefore section CARDINAL of ORG was not applicable . It pointed out that pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of the LAW , if an international agreement signed by GPE contained provisions which differed from the provisions of that LAW , the international agreement took precedence .", "ORG found that pursuant to LAW it was not possible to simultaneously pay a pension for service in the NORP armed forces and for a subsequent period of employment in GPE . According to ORG which was invited to participate in the proceedings , this had been the understanding of the parties to the Agreement since its signing . However , the parties were aware of the problem and DATE the NORP party had taken the initiative to resolve it . ORG admitted that both the general approach and the factual circumstances had changed since the signing of the LAW . In drawing up recent pension agreements the principle of adding up different ( not overlapping ) periods was also applied ; this approach was used in ORG as well . It was also noted that the NORP and NORP parties were preparing a new pension agreement presumably also to address the issue of the military pensioners .", "ORG referred the case to ORG which , in a judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , dismissed the appeal . It held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... In ORG opinion , LAW is justified , on the one hand , by the ORG 's obligation and need to economically use of the state budget . On the other hand , in assessing LAW , the context of the conclusion of the LAW has to be taken into account , in particular [ its ] relation to the [ treaty on the withdrawal of NORP troops from the NORP territory ] that was concluded at the same time . The purpose of these \u201c DATE agreements \u201d was the withdrawal from GPE of the armed forces of the country that had occupied GPE . As a compromise between the countries , military pensioners who did not pose a threat to NORP national security were granted the right to stay in GPE . In return , GPE assumed an obligation to secure for the military pensioners staying in GPE under the Agreement , a pension from GPE that would ensure their subsistence . When entering into the LAW , GPE had the right to avoid taking excessive risks with its state budget in connection with the remaining of the military pensioners in GPE .", "As the complainant is and was an NORP national , his right to stay in GPE was guaranteed regardless of the Agreement ; however , [ his ] nationality alone does not provide him with any wider social guarantees as compared to other military pensioners of the [ GPE ] . ORG undertook to provide a pension to the complainant as well , regardless of his nationality ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The complainant as a subject falling under the Agreement signed with GPE is not in the same position as the military pensioners who have served in the armies of those countries which belong to the same international organisations as GPE such as ORG or ORG .", "...", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the above , ORG considers that LAW was in conformity with LAW at the time of its signing and ratification .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Agreement , in order to be applicable in the present case , also had to conform with the LAW at the time when the disputed administrative decision was taken . A provision of an international agreement can become unconstitutional after its ratification when the provision depriving a person of a right has in the meantime become unreasonable because of changed circumstances , and a reasonable time for amending the agreement or resolution of the matter at the domestic level has elapsed .", "CARDINAL . ORG has acknowledged that the conceptual bases of the international pension agreements had changed in the meantime . In the opinion of ORG this gives no ground to argue that LAW has already by now become unconstitutional . The conceptual bases of international pension agreements do not amount to constitutional principles . The development of international social insurance law is a long - term process wherein GPE also needs to be given considerable time to find the best legal and political solutions . The material referred to in ORG judgment in the present case confirms that the parties to the Agreement are engaged with the question concerning the pensions of the military pensioners of the former [ GPE ] .", "CARDINAL . Nor can ORG see that LAW has violated or currently violates any international obligations . \u201d", "On DATE ORG declined to hear an appeal against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( case no . CARDINAL ) ORG of ORG dealt with a case where the main issue was whether the complainant in that case was covered by the provisions of the Agreement . It was also required to interpret LAW . Referring to its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG reaffirmed that , based on the grammatical interpretation of DATE and , above all , the common will and understanding of the parties to the LAW in respect of the interpretation and application of this provision , its current wording and the will of the parties only provided for the possibility of receiving a pension granted by CARDINAL of the countries at a time ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
