NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , alias PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently serving a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for premeditated murder in LOC . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Attorney - General of GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The background facts of the case are set out in ORG judgment of DATE concerning the applicant \u2019s first application before the Court ( NORP v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ... ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with the ORG ( application no . CARDINAL ) against GPE under LAW of the LAW . The applicant alleged that ORG , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention had been violated as a result of his life sentence and continuing detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG held that there had been a violation of LAW with regard to the quality of the law applicable at the time the applicant had committed the offence ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . At the same time , however , it concluded that there had been no violation of DATE in so far as the applicant complained about the retrospective imposition of a heavier penalty with regard to his sentence and the changes in the prison law exempting life prisoners from the possibility of remission of their sentence ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s other complaints under LAW and LAW , the Grand Chamber found that there had been no violation .", "CARDINAL . With regard to LAW , ORG held , inter alia , that although the prospect of release for prisoners serving life sentences in GPE was limited , any adjustment of a life sentence being only within the President \u2019s discretion subject to the agreement of the Attorney - General , it could not be said that life sentences in GPE were irreducible with no possibility of release ; on the contrary , it was clear that in GPE such sentences were both de jure and de facto reducible . This was so in spite of the shortcomings in the procedure . ORG considered therefore that the applicant could not claim that he had been deprived of any prospect of release or that his continued detention as such , even though long , constituted inhuman or degrading treatment ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to LAW , the Grand Chamber held that the continuing detention of the applicant after DATE was justified under LAW a ) of the LAW and that therefore there had been no violation of LAW . In this connection it held that the applicant had been sentenced to life imprisonment for the remainder of his life as provided by LAW and not for DATE and that the fact that he had subsequently been given a notice by the prison authorities , on the basis of FAC in force at the time , setting a conditional release date could not , and did not , affect the sentence of life imprisonment passed by ORG or render his detention beyond the above date unlawful ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW fell outside the scope of its examination as it had been raised for the first time in his memorial to FAC and was not covered by the ORG \u2019s decision on admissibility of DATE ) ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the application of LAW , ORG considered that a finding of a violation of LAW constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction in respect of any non - pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . However , it ordered GPE to pay the sum of MONEY in respect of costs and expenses ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded its supervision of the execution of the Grand Chamber \u2019s judgment at its CARDINAL meeting ( DH ) held from DATE , at which it adopted a decision instructing the ORG to prepare a draft final resolution . The text of the ORG \u2019s public notes reads as follows :", "\u201c This case concerns the infringement of the principle \u2018 no punishment without a law\u2019 on account of the quality of the law applicable at the material time ( DATE ) , which did not enable the applicant to discern precisely the scope of the penalty of life imprisonment and the manner of its execution ( violation Art . CARDINAL ) . ORG observed that the legal basis for the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence was the criminal law applicable at the material time and his sentence , that was mandatory life imprisonment , corresponded to that prescribed under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW for the offence of premeditated murder . However , according to ORG , at the time the applicant committed the offence , it was equally clear that both the executive and the administrative authorities , including the prison service , understood FAC as imposing a maximum period of DATE to be served by any person who had been sentenced to life imprisonment . In DATE , in the PERSON case , ORG interpreted life imprisonment as meaning \u2018 imprisonment for life\u2019 , and , in DATE , ORG , when passing sentence on the applicant , relied on the findings of ORG . The ORG therefore concluded that , at the time the applicant committed the offence , NORP law taken as a whole was not formulated with sufficient precision as to enable the applicant to discern , even with appropriate advice , to a degree that was reasonable in the circumstances , the scope of the penalty of life imprisonment and the manner of its execution . On the contrary , the ORG did not accept the applicant \u2019s argument that a heavier penalty was retroactively imposed on him since it could not be said that at the material time the penalty of a life sentence could clearly be taken to have amounted to DATE imprisonment .", "Individual measures : ORG held that the finding of a violation constituted in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the non - pecuniary damages sustained by the applicant . It also found a non - violation of DATE as regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that the amendment of the prison regulations subsequent to his being sentenced made it impossible for him to expect a remission of sentence . The violation found in this case consists only in the fact that the law applicable at the time the applicant committed the offence did not enable him to discern precisely the scope of the penalty of life imprisonment and the manner of its execution . When ORG sentenced the applicant , it was already clear that life imprisonment had become imprisonment for the rest of one \u2019s biological life .", "General measures : Following ORG judgment in the case of PERSON against GPE ( judgment of DATE , ( CARDINAL A.A.D. CARDINAL ) , which declared the Prison ( General ) Regulations of DATE , as amended in DATE , unconstitutional , these Regulations were repealed in DATE . According to the new regulations the imposition of mandatory imprisonment has become imprisonment for the rest of one \u2019s biological life , thereby excluding any possibility of remission for life prisoners .", "\u2022 Legislative change : Following the judgment , the PERSON establishing a parole board was finalised ( details of the bill are mentioned at paragraph CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) . The PERSON has received governmental approval and is currently being examined in detailed by ORG . As the violation relates to historical provisions , the bill is not a key aspect of the general measures . However , its goal is to improve the rights of life prisoners . The bill will fix a minimum period to be served before life prisoners can become eligible for parole and establish an independent parole board .", "ORG and dissemination : Under cover of a letter from ORG summarising the judgment and its reasoning , copies of the judgment were sent to ORG , the Presidents of ORG and ORG Human Rights Parliamentary Committees . It has also been published on ORG website ... and widely publicised and discussed in the media . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The adoption of a final resolution by ORG is still pending .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the present case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant applied , via ORG , to the President of the Republic for pardon or conditional release .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the Attorney - General refused his request . In particular , he informed the applicant that following an examination of his application , a recommendation to the President to suspend his sentence under LAW ) of the LAW was not justified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a new habeas corpus application ( no . CARDINAL ) before ORG ( first - instance jurisdiction ) .", "CARDINAL . He complained under LAW and Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . The applicant claimed , inter alia , the following :", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on DATE ( no . GPE ) with ORG ( appeal jurisdiction ) . The applicant challenged the findings of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . His appeal was dismissed on DATE . ORG in its judgment relied on the findings of ORG .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , ORG observed that ORG in its judgment , when examining LAW , had not doubted the general adequacy of the NORP system , even if the prospect of release was limited . ORG relied on paragraph ORG of ORG judgment :", "\u201c In his submissions , the applicant has placed great emphasis on the lack of a parole board system in GPE . However , the ORG reiterates that matters relating to early release policies including the manner of their implementation fall within the power member GPE have in the sphere of criminal justice and penal policy ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . In this connection , the ORG observes that at the present time there is not yet a clear and commonly accepted standard amongst the member ORG concerning life sentences and , in particular , their review and method of adjustment . Moreover , no clear tendency can be ascertained with regard to the system and procedures implemented in respect of early release . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG observed ( apparently in the context of its examination of LAW ) that ORG judgment did not impose an immediate obligation on the Republic to establish a parole board . In any event , however , ORG considered that the Government should not delay in establishing such a board .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice concerning life sentences and the release of prisoners is set out in the Grand Chamber \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , however , FAC of DATE ( Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL as amended \u2013 ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) was amended by Amending PERSON , which entered into force on DATE . This PERSON introduced significant amendments to LAW , in particular to section DATE , by providing for the establishment of ORG , an independent board for the release of prisoners on licence ( section CARDINAL ) . Section CARDINAL includes detailed provisions concerning ORG , the procedures to be followed , and the release of prisoners on licence .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides for the establishment of ORG , whose competence is to examine and determine , in accordance with the procedures set out in the PERSON , ORG applications for conditional release on licence so that they can continue to serve the remaining part of their sentence outside prison . On DATE the CARDINAL - member board was appointed by ORG . On DATE the ORG \u2019s members gave the oath required before the President of the Republic that they would faithfully exercise their duties ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) . ORG started operating at DATE .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL A ( CARDINAL ) , a prisoner who has been sentenced to life imprisonment and has served DATE of the sentence can apply to ORG for conditional release . LAW ) provides as follows :", "\u201c A prisoner who has served CARDINAL of a sentence of imprisonment which exceeds DATE , or who was sentenced to life imprisonment and has served DATE of the sentence , is entitled to submit directly to ORG a written request for conditional release on parole in order to continue to serve the remaining part of the sentence outside prison . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL B ( CARDINAL ) provides that a request for release on parole as provided in LAW CARDINAL A can also be submitted by the following :", "\u201c ( a ) a prisoner who has served CARDINAL of sentences of life imprisonment which run consecutively ;", "( b ) a prisoner who has served CARDINAL of the total duration of sentences which run consecutively , other than those mentioned in point ( a ) above , or who , where the longest of his sentences which run consecutively is a sentence of life imprisonment , has served DATE of imprisonment ;", "( c ) a prisoner who has served CARDINAL of his sentences of imprisonment which run concurrently or who has served CARDINAL of the longest in duration of his sentences which run only partially concurrently so that the sentence longest in duration exceeds the other sentence or sentences , or who , where the longest sentence is CARDINAL of life imprisonment , has served DATE of it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL A ( CARDINAL ) provides that ORG decides on the conditions and restrictions which , in the circumstances , it considers appropriate to set for the release on licence of the prisoner in question in order to reduce the risk of recidivism . The conditions or restrictions can subsequently be modified , annulled or supplemented with additional ones ( section CARDINAL E ( CARDINAL ) ) . The applicant has the right to be heard before additional or stricter conditions are set ( section CARDINAL E ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . When deciding on a prisoner \u2019s application for release on licence and on the conditions and limitations to be set for such release , ORG will examine and weigh up a number of factors . These are set out in section CARDINAL H ( CARDINAL ) as being \u201c ( a ) the degree of dangerousness of the prisoner and the possibility of recidivism ; ( b ) the protection of society by preventing possible offences such as those for which the prisoner is serving his or her sentence ; and ( c ) any personal , family or other circumstances which may justify the prisoner \u2019s conditional release on licence , without , however , jeopardising the safety of society \u201d . This section provides that the second factor is particularly significant concerning applications by prisoners who are serving a sentence of life imprisonment or long - term sentences for violent offences . Further , ORG , in reaching its decision in a particular case , will take into account a number of factors , including the type of offence or offences of which the prisoner was convicted , written comments made by the court in imposing the sentence , the prisoner \u2019s criminal record , the prisoner \u2019s intentions and plans for his or her successful and law - abiding integration into society , the prisoner \u2019s conduct in prison , the report of the prison forensic psychiatrist and the prisoner \u2019s degree of dangerousness ( see section CARDINAL H ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL I ( CARDINAL ) provides , inter alia , for an interview of the prisoner by ORG . At the interview , the prisoner has the right to be legally represented and to call witnesses and experts ( section CARDINAL I ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) ( i ) ) . ORG has the obligation to hear the prisoner as well as his or her witnesses , experts and lawyers , to accept and examine any written information material and evidence which the prisoner submits , to allow the prisoner or his or her representative to examine or inspect , prior to the oral interview , any written information material which ORG has obtained in relation to the application for release on licence , and to put such material at the prisoner \u2019s disposal during the interview . A record is kept of the interview ( section CARDINAL ( I ) ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL .
