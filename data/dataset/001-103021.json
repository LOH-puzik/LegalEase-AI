De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He married ORG in DATE . On DATE PERSON , the couple 's daughter , was born . DATE the couple split up .", "On DATE ORG pronounced their divorce . The court awarded custody of the couple 's child to both parents and ordered that her place of residence should be with her mother .", "CARDINAL . DATE several sets of proceedings were conducted concerning the enforcement of the access arrangements provided in the divorce judgment . Ultimately , on DATE the parties reached an agreement validated by the court as to the manner of implementing the custody arrangements . The applicant was allowed to see PERSON once a month on DATE for TIME , from TIME", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the GPE - ORG and , upon appeal , ORG , conducted successive sets of enforcement proceedings in respect of the DATE agreement . In particular , it examined the applicant 's successive applications for a fine to be imposed on the mother and/or to have time - limits fixed within which she should comply with the access arrangements and allow the applicant to see PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG for a fine to be imposed on PERSON 's mother . He submitted that she had consistently failed to comply with the conditions of the agreement concluded in DATE . On DATE the mother was summoned by the court and ordered to allow the applicant access to their child within DATE . Upon her appeal , on DATE ORG quashed that decision on formal grounds and remitted the case . On DATE the GPE - ORG set a DATE time - limit within which the mother was to comply with the conditions of the access agreement .", "CARDINAL . In letters to the Warszawa ORG of DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE , ORG requested the court to order the applicant to attend the meetings with the child without male friends , to dress appropriately for the occasion , to arrive on time and not to tease the child . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE she informed the court that the applicant had failed to attend meetings planned for DATE , DATE and DATE , without having informed her that he would not come . She further stated that despite this the child would be ready to meet her father under the conditions specified in the agreement . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE she informed the court that out of CARDINAL DATE meetings planned since the agreement had been concluded the applicant had failed to attend DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG appointed a custody officer to supervise the execution of the access agreement . She periodically submitted reports to the court , dated , inter alia , DATE , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the first - instance court , following the applicant 's complaint , again set a DATE timelimit for the mother to comply with the access arrangements and imposed a fine on her in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant renewed his applications . The court dismissed them on DATE . It observed that there were no grounds for imposing a fine , as the mother had not taken any steps to make it impossible for the father to see the child . It was the child herself who was hostile to her father .", "The applicant appealed , complaining that the court lacked impartiality and that it had wrongly assessed the evidence before it . ORG dismissed his appeal on DATE . It found that the parties had been in a bitter conflict ; that the child had a negative attitude towards her father ; that the mother had not done anything to prevent the girl from having contact with her father ; that it was not in the child 's best interest to force her to have frequent contact with him ; and that the lower court had made correct findings of fact .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant submitted a new application for a fine to be imposed on the mother . On DATE the court dismissed it , essentially reiterating the reasoning adopted in its decision of DATE and referring to similar findings of fact . It observed that the mother and father were in a conflict so bitter that they had become unable to see how much their conflict affected the child . They both blamed the other party for all the problems arising in connection with the exercise of custody and access rights , failing to see their own shortcomings and being unable to reach any compromise . The child had become an instrument in the fight between the parties . The child 's hostility to her father and , in particular , the fact that the mother had not sought to influence her attitude , was alarming . The parents had told the court that they needed therapy , but had failed to do anything about it . The father had repeatedly asked for the mother to be punished by a fine but he had not challenged the assertion that it was the child herself who did not want to see him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that the first - instance court had been very superficial in the examination of the evidence .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against that decision . It observed that forcing the child to see his father would not by itself restore the emotional ties between the girl and her father , and that these ties had become seriously weakened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a new application to make the mother comply with the access arrangements . In the proceedings instituted by this application the court ordered that another opinion should be prepared by psychologists to assess both the feasibility of the applicant 's contact with PERSON and the psychological state of the persons concerned .", "In that opinion , dated DATE , the experts stated that the child had declared that she had agreed to talk to the experts only at her mother 's request . She had stressed that she had not changed and would not change her attitude towards her father . She could not understand why the applicant wanted to pursue contact , given that he had filed an application for denial of paternity ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . She was convinced that he was motivated by his wish to annoy and cause stress to herself and her mother . She had complained about his visits to her school and the fact that he had told her teachers and her friends that she was a \u201c bad daughter \u201d . PERSON had called the applicant a \u201c sadist \u201d . She had objected to his criticising her mother , to whom she was very strongly attached . PERSON had strongly denied that her mother had ever forbidden her to see the applicant .", "In their conclusion the experts reiterated the conclusion of their DATE report and noted that the therapy , which both the parents and the daughter had undergone separately , had not produced positive results .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court again set a DATE time - limit for the mother , on pain of a fine of ORG CARDINAL . The court summarised the enforcement proceedings and the decisions given in them . It noted that the applicant had not behaved badly towards the child and that he had reported regularly for the meetings . His behaviour towards the child might have been awkward but this was due essentially to the fact that he did not actually know the girl as he had had very little opportunity to get to know her . The court referred to an expert opinion prepared for the purposes of the proceedings and concerning the child 's psychological situation . PERSON was very hostile towards her father , despite the fact that she had had no personal experience with him capable of justifying her hostility . The mother had failed to take any steps to persuade the child to have contact with her father or to alter the negative image which the child had formed of him . The court found PERSON 's attitude alarming . It further noted that had the mother been dissatisfied with the scope or character of the applicant 's access rights , it had been open to her to challenge them in separate proceedings . The present case was concerned only with the enforcement of the existing access rights as defined by the DATE agreement and it was obvious that the mother was not complying with them .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed . In her appeal ORG stressed that she had never taken any steps to prevent her daughter from meeting the applicant . It was the child who had steadfastly refused to see her father , which left the mother helpless . In his appeal , the applicant insisted that the mother should be obliged to pay the fine after the expiry of the timelimit , as provided for by LAW .", "The appeals were dismissed on DATE . ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal , in which he sought that a fine be imposed on the mother , noting that a fine could only be imposed if she had failed to honour her obligation within the time - limit set by the court . It further observed that it was actually the child , not the mother , who had refused contact , while it was the mother who was the debtor within the meaning of LAW .", "It also dismissed the mother 's appeal , observing that the child had , beyond any doubt , been drawn into the conflict between the parties . The image she had of her father had been shaped by her mother , particularly as the child had not had any contact with her father for DATE , despite the fact that he had always been ready to see her and continued to come to the meetings fixed for that purpose . It was the mother who was responsible for the child 's attitude , which was full of hatred and hostility towards her father . The court found the mother 's attitude inappropriate . It further noted that the applicant and the mother and child had undergone therapy , but separately . However , as the child had refused to talk about her father , the issue of contact with him had not been addressed in her therapy . There were no grounds for believing that contact with her father would harm the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE - Mokot\u00f3w ORG examined a complaint by the applicant , submitted on DATE , that the access rights had not been properly implemented , despite the expiry of the time - limit set for that purpose in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The court noted that the time - limit for ensuring compliance had expired and that since that date the applicant had not seen the child as she steadfastly refused to meet him . The court imposed a fine of ORG CARDINAL on the mother . It further set a timelimit of thirty days for her to comply with the access arrangements .", "CARDINAL . E.K. appealed . On DATE ORG allowed her appeal and remitted the case . It observed that while it was true that the contact arrangements had not been respected , this was not because of the mother 's failure to comply with them , but because of the girl 's attitude . It further noted that she was DATE and her views and feelings had to be taken into account by the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Warszawa - Mokot\u00f3w District Court dismissed the applicant 's application for a fine to be imposed on PERSON The court heard PERSON in the absence of the parties and referred to her statements in its decision . She stated that it was she who had not complied with the access agreement . She told the court that the applicant had never been around when she needed him , he had never listened to her and had only wanted to hurt and annoy her mother . She stated that she would not see her father .", "The court emphasised that the father had a right to contact his daughter and the parties themselves had had regard to this right when concluding the DATE agreement . However , while the situation obtaining at that time had probably offered prospects of contact , the court was obliged to take into consideration the current situation . PERSON was now DATE and her opinion had to be taken into account . Lack of regular and peaceful contact for DATE had resulted on her part in a lack of any emotional ties with her father . It could not be overlooked that the applicant did not want to listen to her views or to respect them . Even before the proceedings before the court he was dismissive of her views and expressed the opinion that they had been dictated by her mother .", "The court concluded that it could not be said that the mother was to blame for making contact impossible . There were no grounds for imposing a fine on her .", "The applicant appealed , requesting that the decision be quashed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal , finding that there were no grounds on which to impose a fine on the mother , given that the child was old enough to express her own views and feelings on the question of contact , which she obviously did not want to maintain . The mother could not be said to bear responsibility for the non - enforcement of the access arrangements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again requested that a fine be imposed on ORG for failure to respect the access arrangements .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , he had no further contact with the girl , even sporadically .", "CARDINAL . In reports submitted to the court on DATE and CARDINAL DATE the custody officer summarised her conversations with ORG and PERSON She stated that PERSON was very mature for her age and very articulate . She did not understand how her father could say that he loved her and behave towards her in the way he did . He did not take her views into account , criticised her mother and her family , and had told many persons in PERSON 's environment that her mother was incapable of taking proper care of her . During the contact visits , he had complained about her mother . She did not want to be exposed to this . She requested recognition and understanding of her feelings and views . She stated that she was almost an adult and able to make a sensible judgment for herself . The contact with her father had been a source of stress , anxiety and shame for her .", "CARDINAL . On a subsequent unspecified date the Warszawa - Mokot\u00f3w District Court ordered the applicant to submit the original of the access agreement of DATE . The applicant complied on DATE .", "His application of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court had regard to all the material gathered in the file on the enforcement proceedings . It took into account ORG 's persistent refusal to see the applicant and the fact that she had repeatedly said that she disliked or even hated him . It noted that there was no evidence that ORG had prevented her daughter from seeing her father . It observed that the applicant 's conduct towards PERSON could not have contributed to building good relations between them as he had tried on various occasions to see her unexpectedly at school or in other places or circumstances , which had only heightened the child 's dislike and fear of him . It also noted that PERSON was DATE and her views had to be taken into consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court discontinued the proceedings concerning the enforcement of the DATE agreement on the ground that PERSON was now DATE and thus the proceedings had become devoid of purpose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court extended the applicant 's access rights specified in the DATE agreement and ordered that his meetings with PERSON be supervised by child contact supervisors . This decision was later amended by ORG on DATE . That court held that the temporal scope of the applicant 's contact visits with PERSON should remain as determined in the original agreement but upheld the proviso that they should be supervised by child contact supervisors .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant again requested ORG to change the access arrangements specified in the DATE agreement and to extend his visiting rights in respect of the child . Simultaneously , the mother requested the court to limit the applicant 's access rights to a minimum . These CARDINAL applications were subsequently joined and examined in the same set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's daughter was examined by experts in the course of these proceedings . The objective of the expert opinion , submitted to ORG , was to examine the nature of the relationship between the applicant and his daughter and to assess the value of contact visits for the child 's development and well - being .", "The experts observed that PERSON had a highly negative opinion of her father . She refused to use his surname as her own name . She was of the view that he had failed to show a proper interest in her and that in fact he despised her and all his actions were aimed at annoying her and her mother . The experts concluded that because of that negative attitude relations between the applicant and his daughter were strained to such an extent that any meaningful contact was impossible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court deprived the applicant of his access rights . The judgment was amended on DATE by ORG and the mother 's application to restrict the applicant 's access rights was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant submitted to the same court an application to have the mother 's custody rights restricted . In DATE ORG submitted an application to have the applicant divested of his rights .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE - Mokot\u00f3w ORG dismissed the applicant 's request , ordered him to undergo therapy and imposed an identical obligation on PERSON and PERSON The court observed that , as the conflict between the parties had made it impossible for them to show a modicum of co - operation in the child 's interest , therapy offered a chance for their relationship to improve . The court found that the conflict between the parents had caused the child to suffer from very serious psychological disturbances .", "CARDINAL . In a new set of proceedings instituted by the applicant by which he requested that ORG be divested of her parental rights , the court questioned experts at a hearing held on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the request submitted by the applicant , expressing the view that the applicant was essentially motivated by his wish to harass his former wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the DATE - Mokot\u00f3w ORG to divest the applicant of his parental rights . The applicant lodged an identical application with the same court . The cases were subsequently joined at a hearing held on DATE . A hearing scheduled for DATE was adjourned as a refusal to allow the request to disqualify the judge , submitted by the mother , issued on DATE , had not become final . Subsequent hearings scheduled for CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE were adjourned as the parties failed to attend them . On CARDINAL DATE a witness failed to comply with the summons and the hearing was adjourned . The next hearing was scheduled for CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the applicant submitted a motion for a lay judge to be disqualified . On CARDINAL DATE the court decided that the mother and child should be examined by the experts . The mother and PERSON were accordingly summoned to report to ORG on DATE but failed to comply with the summonses on DATE . The court scheduled the hearing for DATE . The interview in the ORG was rescheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court discontinued the proceedings as PERSON had turned DATE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested ORG to bring , on his behalf , proceedings for denial of his paternity in respect of PERSON The child 's mother was heard by the prosecutor on CARDINAL October CARDINAL . She gave her consent to DNA tests being carried out . The prosecutor informed the applicant thereof and stated that he would bring proceedings before the court only if the results of the tests showed that the applicant was not the father . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant refused to undergo a DNA test and requested the prosecutor to lodge the case with the court . He submitted that the court should order the mother and child to undergo a test .", "CARDINAL . The prosecuting authorities brought no proceedings , finding , in the light of the parties ' submissions , that there were no justified grounds on which to challenge the applicant 's paternity .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant filed a complaint under LAW June CARDINAL on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time ( LOC o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w post\u0119powaniu s\u0105dowym bez nieuzasadnionej zw\u0142oki \u2013 \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) about a breach of his right to have his case heard within a reasonable time in the enforcement proceedings instituted by his application of DATE and terminated by the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his complaint . It observed that the applicant complained essentially about the second - instance court 's quashing , on substantive law grounds , the decisions given by the first - instance court , which , in his view , had unduly prolonged the proceedings . The court noted that the length complaint could not go to the merits of the decisions and that there had been no periods of inactivity in the proceedings . Having examined the conduct of ORG since the entry into force of LAW on DATE , ORG found that the proceedings had been conducted with due diligence and within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings instituted by the applicant 's complaint about the unreasonable length of the proceedings , summarised in paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above . The court found that , given that the impugned proceedings had been discontinued on DATE , a ruling on their length had become redundant .", "CARDINAL .
