ORG Mr. PERSON , a NORP citizen born in GPE in DATE , was permanently resident in GPE at the time when he applied to the Commission .", "His daughter PERSON , who was born in GPE on DATE , has GPE nationality . She is represented by her guardian , viz . her mother , Mrs. PERSON , who is likewise a GPE national .", "CARDINAL . ORG After marrying Mrs. PERSON on DATE , Mr. PERSON sought permission to stay in the GPE where he had been for some time already . ORG granted him permission on DATE \" for the sole purpose of enabling him to live with his NORP wife \" , and then renewed it until DATE .", "From DATE Mr. PERSON worked for a self - service shop . On DATE , a work permit was issued to him under PERSON ) Act DATE ( replaced since DATE by ORG ) . This permit was renewed on DATE . From DATE to DATE Mr. PERSON was employed by a cleaning firm .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , his wife sued for divorce . ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) granted the divorce on DATE on the ground of the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage , which was dissolved by registration of the decision in ORG of GPE on DATE . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG appointed Mrs. PERSON guardian of her daughter , PERSON , who had been born in the meantime , and appointed the girl \u2019s father as an auxiliary guardian ( toeziende voogd ) . On DATE , it ordered the latter to pay ORG MONEY DATE as a contribution to the cost of maintaining and educating his daughter .", "When PERSON was born , her father and Mrs. PERSON agreed to ensure that the child had frequent , regular contacts with her father . On DATE , they had a notary legalise an agreement between them as to arrangements for these contacts and certify that over DATE Mr. PERSON had seen his daughter CARDINAL times a week for TIME each time .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON made an application for renewal of his residence permit . The head of the GPE police refused the application on DATE , stating that it would be contrary to the public interest to renew the permit , regard being had to the fact that Mr. PERSON had been allowed to remain in the GPE for the sole purpose of living with his NORP wife , which condition was no longer fulfilled on account of the divorce .", "By letter of DATE , Mr. PERSON asked the Minister of Justice to review this decision . He pointed out among other things that he needed an \" independent \" residence permit in order to fulfil his moral and legal obligations as a father . He said he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he was in a position to bear part of the costs of PERSON \u2019s upbringing and education .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Minister did not reply within the statutory period of DATE , which under GPE law constituted an implied rejection of the request .", "Mr. PERSON consequently appealed , on DATE , to ORG ( Afdeling Rechtspraak ) of the Raad van State . He stated that he could not see how the grant to him of a residence permit could be prejudicial to the national interest , particularly since he was under various legal obligations as a father and he had been able to support himself since DATE by working . At the hearing on DATE , he claimed that the impugned decision infringed LAW ( article LAW on the ground that it prevented him from remaining in contact with his daughter whom he saw regularly CARDINAL times a week .", "The PERSON dismissed his appeal on CARDINAL DATE . It recalled in the first place that , under section CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet - \" LAW \" ) , renewal of a residence permit could be refused in the public interest . As the Minister of State for ORG had pointed out , Mr. PERSON no longer satisfied the condition upon which the grant of his residence permit depended ; consequently , the refusal appealed against could be justified under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . As for Mr. PERSON \u2019s obligations to his daughter , the PERSON held that the fulfilment thereof did not serve any vital national interest and that those obligations subsisted independently of his place of residence . It added that CARDINAL meetings DATE were not sufficient to constitute family life within the meaning of LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW and that the impugned decision would , moreover , not necessarily entail a break in relations between the child and her father , as the latter could remain in contact with his daughter by agreement with his ex - wife .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON was dismissed by his employer with effect from DATE . He was , furthermore , arrested on DATE for the purpose of his deportation . He made an urgent application ( kort geding ) to the presiding judge of ORG , but withdrew it shortly after the execution of the impugned deportation order on DATE ; on DATE , the presiding judge accordingly held that there was no ground on which to give a decision .", "In DATE , PERSON and her mother spent DATE with Mr. PERSON and his family in GPE . On DATE , Mr. PERSON applied to ORG in GPE for a DATE residence permit . After an initial refusal he obtained a visa valid for DATE , for the purpose of enabling him to exercise his rights of access . Accordingly , he went to the GPE on DATE where he requested an extension of his visa until the following DATE . His request having been turned down on DATE , he lodged an appeal with the PERSON , accompanied by an urgent application . Hearing the latter application , the President of ORG decided , on DATE , that the applicant should be treated - subject to a condition which is not relevant to this judgment - as if he had been granted a visa valid until DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON remarried Mrs. PERSON in GPE . On DATE , ORG granted him permission ( which he had sought on DATE ) to reside in the GPE \" for the purpose of living with his NORP wife and working during that time \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG The GPE authorities pursue a restrictive immigration policy . The authorities , however , permit exceptions prompted , inter alia , by the wish to honour the obligations flowing from the LAW , by the country \u2019s economic well - being and by humanitarian considerations , including the reuniting of families .", "The entry requirements and the grounds on which aliens may be expelled are laid down primarily in the DATE Act and its implementing regulations . In addition to these legal provisions , there is the \" Circular on Aliens \" ( PERSON ) , which is a body of directives drawn up and published by ORG .", "The right to stay is therefore governed in principle by sections CARDINAL of the LAW . A prolonged stay requires the authorisation of the Minister of ORG or a body acting under his control . A refusal to grant an authorisation must be accompanied by a statement of the reasons on which it is based . An appeal lies to the Minister of ORG and then , if need be , to the PERSON . An application is usually granted - normally for one year - only if the individual \u2019s presence serves an essential national interest or if there are compelling humanitarian grounds .", "Foreigners married to a GPE national fall into the latter category ; they may obtain a residence permit \" in order to live with their spouse \" in the GPE and , if appropriate , \" in order to work there during that time \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG This policy , however , has changed over DATE . Foreigners coming to live with their husbands or their wives were initially granted resident status and a conditional residence permit . That status was forfeited if the marriage in respect of which it was granted was dissolved , in which case the foreigner had to leave the country .", "In order to enhance the position of foreigners lawfully established in the GPE , the Minister of ORG for ORG felt it necessary to soften the line followed in this respect . Under the terms of the \" Vreemdelingencirculaire \" ( LAW , paragraph CARDINAL ) , foreigners who had been married for DATE and had lived with their spouses in the GPE for DATE prior to the dissolution of their marriage were enabled to apply for an \" independent \" residence permit ; the underlying idea was that after that length of time they would have forged sufficient links with the country for it to be unnecessary to make their status subject to conditions .", "It was subsequently thought advisable to make further changes in the regulations in favour of this category of foreigner . The requirement of CARDINAL years\u2019 marriage was retained but the requisite period of residence was reduced to DATE . The purpose of this relaxation was to improve the often precarious position of divorced women , particularly those of LOC origin ; it was felt that they ought to be permitted to stay in the GPE with a status independent of that of their former husbands .", "This policy was later refined still further , when it was decided that even where the aforementioned conditions were not met , overriding humanitarian considerations might justify the grant to a foreigner of authorisation to remain on GPE territory on an independent residence permit , for example if he had close links with the GPE or with a person resident there . According to the Government , this was an exceptional measure that was rarely applied .", "CARDINAL . ORG As far as the GPE case - law on aliens is concerned , a distinction must be drawn between the courts hearing urgent applications - the civil courts up to and including ORG at last instance - and the court conducting a full examination of the merits of the case , namely ORG of the Raad van State .", "While ORG in its decisions in other fields , such as the right of access , had already favoured a fairly broad conception of \" family life \" ( see in particular the leading case decided on CARDINAL DATE , in PERSON , DATE , no . CARDINAL ) , ORG of the Raad van State had tended to take a narrower view . Its decision in the instant case is fully in line with that tradition . Several of its most recent decisions , however , suggest that it is going to adopt the principle laid down in a ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE concerning aliens , from which it emerges that cohabitation is not a sine qua non of \" family life \" for the purposes of LAW article CARDINAL) of ORG ( Nederlandse Jurisprudentie , DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "ORG recently had before it a case similar to the present one . A court of appeal , hearing an urgent application , had held that where a foreigner threatened with expulsion pleads the right to respect for his own and his child \u2019s family life , the onus is on him to show that the minor \u2019s interest is sufficiently important to outweigh the ORG \u2019s interest . On appeal , ORG quashed the decision on DATE ( PERSON , DATE , no . CARDINAL ) . It fell to be decided whether \" family life \" existed between the alien and his child , and ORG began by emphasising that the child was a legitimate one . It went on :", "\" For the duration of the marriage , there existed between PERSON and his son a relationship that amounted to family life within the meaning of LAW article CARDINAL) of the ... Convention .... Neither the cessation of cohabitation nor the divorce ended that relationship . It must also be noted that , as PERSON claimed and as ORG apparently regarded as having been established , PERSON and his son remained in close touch after the cessation of cohabitation . \"", "The decision was quashed on the ground , inter alia , that the appeal court had lost sight of the fact that :", "\" if , in such a case , the expulsion of a foreigner must be regarded as an interference with his right to respect for family life within the meaning of LAW article CARDINAL) ... , the sole means of determining whether that interference is justified or may be justified is to weigh , in the light of the facts of the case and the policy directives ( beleidsregels ) in force , the seriousness of the interference with the right of the foreigner concerned and his minor child to respect for their family life against the interests served by those policy directives , and in so doing one may , in order to assess the seriousness of the interference , have regard notably to the length of time during which those concerned have lived together , to the nature and degree of intensity of the contacts maintained after cohabitation came to an end and to whether it is the parent or the child who is threatened with expulsion \" ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
