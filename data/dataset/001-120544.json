On CARDINAL DATE the applicants made an application for judicial review in which they alleged that the ORG had wrongly established the facts ; in particular , they argued that by signing a contract which included the general terms and conditions of purchase , the customers had waived their statutory right to the payment of interest . The applicants contended that the ORG should have checked with each individual customer whether they had waived the right to the payment of such interest before imposing the fines . Consequently , they alleged that the relevant law had been wrongly applied and requested that ordinary court proceedings be opened .", "CARDINAL .
