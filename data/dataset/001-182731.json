The trial court CARDINAL above , and referred to the texts mentioned in the expert report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It considered that the impugned texts had had a clear extremist leaning and incited actions prohibited by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In particular , in those texts the applicant had called for extremist acts , such as a forcible overthrow of the constitutional order and the President of GPE ; had called for a breach of the territorial integrity of GPE ; had justified and glorified terrorist acts ; had called for violence against the NORP people and abased their dignity ; and had incited religious discord by arguing that the NORP faith had been inferior and by insulting its followers .

More specifically , ORG observed that in various issues of his newsletter the applicant had represented the conflict in GPE as a war between two States \u2013 GPE and GPE ; had approved of terrorist attacks carried out in GPE , and of the actions of criminals and terrorists aimed at the extermination of the NORP people as a nation . In this respect , ORG referred to the applicant \u2019s relevant texts in issue no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and in issue no .

The trial court went on to note that the applicant had qualified GPE \u2019s actions in GPE as aggression and had considered ORG to be an occupying force . Accordingly , he \u201c [ had ] negatively assessed GPE \u2019s actions and those of GPE \u2019s armed forces ; similarly negatively [ the applicant had ] assessed GPE as a ORG , ORG as a part of the machinery of the ORG and GPE \u2019s servicemen as a social group \u201d .

ORG further referred to the texts in CARDINAL issues of the applicant \u2019s newsletter published in the column entitled \u201c Good news \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It pointed out that the applicant had represented bad events in a positive way , that is to say as actions approved by the authors and by the applicant himself and as an example to be followed . The court pointed out that another example to be followed , according to the applicant , had been actions of NORP women putting on \u201c shaheed belts \u201d ; in the latter respect , the court quoted a relevant extract from the article \u201c \u2018 NORP syndrome\u2019 inside out \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to observe that \u201c in all issues of his newsletter ...

In this respect , the trial court referred to the applicant \u2019s \u201c editorial note \u201d published in issue no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , observing that in that publication the applicant had \u201c demonstrated a negative attitude towards the existing political system and GPE as a ORG \u201d . The trial court pointed out that \u201c the stance taken by [ the applicant ] concerning the liquidation of the existing ORG regime ( \u201c PERSON \u2019s regime \u201d ) presuppose[ed ] not only actions in conformity with the constitution but also the possibility of deviating from it ( \u201c to overthrow the regime , without really caring about the LAW \u201d ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that in the article \u201c Retribution-CARDINAL \u201d the applicant had referred to \u201c the following acts aimed against the ORG and the existing political regime in GPE : organisation of meetings concerning events in GPE , participation in those meetings , writing inscriptions on the walls of buildings , fences and bus stops \u201d with the contents reflected in the relevant extracts of that article ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

The trial court went on to note that in the article \u201c NORP [ believers ] went completely nuts \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the applicant had made use of a heading carrying a negative and emotional assessment of the followers of the NORP denomination ( \u201c went nuts \u201d ) . However , in the court \u2019s words , \u201c the content of the article [ did ] not correspond to its title , because it concern[ed ] an isolated case ( a statement that \u201c PERSON was crucified not by NORP but by NORP \u201d , contained in a booklet called \u201c Foundations of the NORP Faith \u201d ) ; this isolated case [ was ] generalised from and represented as a typical situation of NORP believers by virtue of using the impugned heading \u201d . In the same vein , ORG pointed out that in issue no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) the applicant had reproduced information concerning certain NORP nationals held in slavery by certain NORP citizens ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court noted that the applicant had entitled that article \u201c NORP have slaves and dare squawk something about NORP \u201d and had represented an isolated fact to the readers as typical and characteristic of all NORP , whereby he had \u201c made a negative and emotional assessment ( \u2018 to squawk\u2019 ) in respect of NORP citizens as a nation \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

According to the trial court , statements regarding the inferiority of the NORP faith had been made by the applicant in an attempt to stir up interethnic and racial conflicts in society so as to cause indignation in society and eventually to call for a change of the existing political regime . The court did not specify which particular articles in the above - mentioned issues contained those characteristics and assessments .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court referred to the fact that \u201c at an unauthorised meeting on DATE the applicant [ had ] called on individuals to support his movement by openly displaying banners with slogans condemning the regime \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and during the meeting of DATE , \u201c to continue to commit crimes aimed at incitement to hatred and enmity among the population , abasement of dignity of an individual or group of individuals on the grounds of gender , nationality , language , origin or religious beliefs and membership of a social group , the applicant , personally and with a participation of an unidetified person , had distributed issues ORG .

ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that in the relevant articles he had made no appeals to extremist activities , and , in particular , that he had not called for the overthrow of the constitutional order nor stirred up inter - ethnic discord ; and that he supported the constitutional order , LAW and the NORP people \u2019s right to self - determination and had merely availed himself of the right to freedom of expression . The trial court noted , with reference to the expert report of DATE , that the language used by the applicant in the impugned texts enabled the court to conclude that the applicant \u2019s actions had constituted criminal offences and that he had clearly abused his right to freedom of expression secured by LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG furthermore dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that he had been the author of only some of the articles held against him whereas the others had been written by other individuals . The court observed in this connection that the applicant had been the editor - in - chief of the newsletter and , in this capacity , had had the power to shape its editorial direction and he had been responsible for its content .", "CARDINAL . As regards the punishment to be imposed on the applicant , ORG had regard to the state of his health and the fact that he had no criminal record , had positive references and had a dependant mother .

The applicant appealed , referring , among other things , to LAW and stating that as the editor - in - chief of the impugned newsletter he had expressed in it his personal views concerning political events in GPE and his attitude , as a citizen of that country , to the war in GPE . He had not made any appeals for extremist activities and had not declared the superiority of any one religion over another . Nor had he called for the overthrow of the constitutional order , but he had expressed the view that the Government should be changed . The applicant further pointed out that the number of copies of the newsletter in question had been so miniscule that the statements published therein had presented no public danger . He also argued that the measure of punishment imposed on him was excessively severe , given , in particular , the fact that he had no criminal record and had positive references from the place where he lived .", "CARDINAL .
