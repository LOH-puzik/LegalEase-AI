The applicant \u2019s detention on remand", "On DATE the applicant was arrested . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG detained him on remand on charges of armed robbery committed on DATE against a post office in Gda\u0144sk . The prosecutor referred to a danger of absconding and to the serious character of the offence concerned . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision .", "On DATE , CARDINAL and DATE the prosecutor refused to release the applicant .", "From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicant served a prison sentence imposed by a judgment of ORG of DATE , pursuant to which a fine had been imposed on him with CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default .", "On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , referring in particular to new evidence gathered in the case since the beginning of the investigations which made the charges against the applicant and other accused plausible . The court further stressed that the suspects had probably been acting in an organised group , acting in a violent manner bordering on terrorism , and had unlawfully possessed weapons . The court further noted that various indications of criminal connections between the accused and other persons needed clarification .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against a refusal of DATE to release him , considering in particular that the testimony of witnesses pointed to the applicant \u2019s guilt . On DATE the ORG prolonged detention on remand until DATE .", "On DATE the ORG again refused to release the applicant . On DATE ORG upheld this decision . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was prolonged until DATE .", "On DATE the ORG refused to release the applicant , referring to evidence gathered in the investigations , which supported suspicion against the applicant and to the danger of absconding .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against a decision prolonging his detention until DATE .", "On DATE and on CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld this decision , finding in particular that the evidence gathered so far in the investigations strongly supported the suspicion against the applicant .", "On DATE the ORG refused to release the applicant .", "On DATE the ORG refused to release the applicant . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE , considering in particular that the applicant \u2019s allegations that the evidence against him had been fabricated , should be seen in the light of the fact that it was ultimately for the court to assess evidence in criminal cases . The applicant \u2019s health had also been examined and it did not amount to an impediment to the applicant \u2019s continued detention .", "On DATE the ORG lodged a bill of indictment , including CARDINAL further charges of armed robbery with the ORG to which the case had in the meantime been transferred .", "On DATE the ORG refused to release the applicant , and on DATE ORG upheld this decision , considering that the arguments advanced by the applicant in his appeal were essentially the same which he had put forward before in the proceedings concerning his detention . The court noted that certain evidence had still to be taken , in particular as certain witnesses had failed to attend the hearings in order to be questioned . The court further noted that the facts which sufficed for a continuation of detention on remand were not of the same level of probability as those which could ultimately lead to a conviction . In the applicant \u2019s case there was enough evidence against him to justify his continued detention . The applicant \u2019s health had repeatedly been taken into consideration by the courts and assessed under LAW .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for release . The court recalled that the applicant \u2019s request for release had been examined by competent courts on numerous occasions , for DATE . No changes had occurred since that time such as to justify the release , in particular as several witnesses from PERSON had failed to comply with the court \u2019s summonses . Moreover , the lawyer of another accused , PERSON , had fallen ill , and PERSON had not consented to his being temporarily replaced by another lawyer . Thus , it was necessary to maintain the detention in order to ensure the proper course of the proceedings . Since the last judicial decision by which the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention had been reviewed , he had twice been examined by an orthopaedist . The medical opinion of DATE indicated that the applicant \u2019s pains had become less severe , that no muscular atrophy had been established and that he had a wider range of movement in his right arm than he had had before , thus , there were no grounds to release the applicant .", "On an unspecified later date the applicant complained to the President of the Bielsko - Bia\u0142a Regional Court that his detention was unlawful . In reply , he was informed by a letter of CARDINAL DATE that pursuant to the provisions of LAW , detention on remand of persons arrested before DATE , whose length of detention had exceeded time - limits fixed by LAW , could be maintained until DATE . In cases in which a request for prolongation of detention had been submitted by a competent court to ORG , detention was to be maintained until this request be examined by that court . Therefore there was nothing , showing that the applicant \u2019s detention was , or had become , unlawful .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain the request of the ORG for prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention , considering that this request should have been given by way of an interlocutory decision and not by a court \u2019s administrative order . On DATE the ORG requested again that the applicant\u2019 detention be prolonged .", "On DATE ORG , at the motion of the ORG , prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court considered that the applicant had been arrested on CARDINAL DATE and noted that from DATE to CARDINAL DATE he had been serving a prison sentence . Likewise , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE he had been serving another sentence . Consequently , he had been detained on remand for DATE , DATE and DATE , which exceeded time - limits fixed by LAW . The ORG further considered that the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention had been repeatedly examined by the courts . In the light of the evidence gathered in the case , their arguments in support of the applicant \u2019s detention appeared correct and should be accepted as well - founded . The proceedings against the applicant could not have been terminated on the grounds which could not be effectively counteracted by ORG , such as the fact that the applicant and other accused had submitted various requests for evidence to be taken , and that already when the proceedings were well advanced , for instance during the hearings held on DATE and CARDINAL and DATE . The ORG further had regard to the fact that certain witnesses failed to comply with the court summonses . Therefore the grounds on which detention could be prolonged beyond periods fixed by LAW , listed in LAW were obtained in the case and necessitated the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of armed robbery and sentenced him to DATE of imprisonment and a fine with DATE of imprisonment in default .", "On DATE ORG amended this judgment in part , in that it acquitted the applicant of CARDINAL count of robbery , reduced his sentence to DATE of imprisonment and upheld the judgment in its remainder .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with ORG against the judgment of DATE .", "On an unspecified later date the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s medical treatment", "In DATE the applicant , at the prosecutor \u2019s request , was examined in the forensic medicine ward of ORG in LOC . It was established that he could remain in detention if appropriate medical care was given to him .", "On DATE the applicant was examined by a court medical expert .", "On DATE ORG refused to institute investigations concerning the alleged offence of refusal of medical care to the applicant , finding that , in fact , the applicant had been receiving appropriate care .", "On DATE the applicant was examined by a medical panel which did not find any counter - indications for his continued detention .", "On an unspecified DATE before DATE the applicant had been examined and consulted by specialists in FAC .", "By a letter of DATE the ORG Regional Court- ORG reminded the applicant that he had been examined by a court expert and that he had also been repeatedly examined by physicians of Wadowice prison . It had been demonstrated that his detention did not fall within the ambit of circumstances referred to in LAW .", "On DATE the applicant was examined by a medical panel , composed of , inter alia , an orthopaedist and a surgeon , found that he could be maintained in custody .", "On DATE the ORG ordered that the applicant should be examined by a physician , having a status of a court expert , and that a relevant expert opinion be prepared as to whether his continued detention on remand was compatible with his health .", "In a report of CARDINAL DATE the forensic medicine ward of ORG in ORG stated that the applicant , on numerous occasions , had been examined by physicians at the prison , that numerous medical analyses and additional examinations had been made , which , in essence , had shown that the applicant had not had any particular pathological symptoms . His complaints related in particular to frequent headaches and vertigos . The physicians had diagnosed him as suffering from discopathy . In conclusion , the applicant who also suffered from certain sequelae of a trauma to his right shoulder could remain in detention .", "On an unspecified date before DATE the applicant was examined by a neurologist and had had an electroencephalography , which had not showed any pathological changes .", "", "By letters of CARDINAL DATE and DATE the applicant was informed by ORG that his complaints had been examined and that no lack of diligence had been established on the part of the prison medical services .", "On an unspecified date the Bielsko - Bia\u0142a Regional Court , having found that the applicant \u2019s health was not such as to justify a conclusion that his continued detention was incompatible with the requirements of LAW , prolonged his detention until DATE .", "", "By an opinion of DATE the same court expert , who had already examined the applicant in DATE and in DATE , stated that the applicant suffered from sequelae of trauma to his right shoulder , significant obesity , hypertension and heart condition . This syndrom in itself did not amount to a categorical counter - indication for the applicant \u2019s continued detention . However , the persistent pains in his shoulder necessitated that the rehabilitation be undertaken as soon as possible under the supervision of an experienced orthopaedist , either in a civil or in a prison hospital .", "On DATE a physician of the Bielsko - Bia\u0142a District Detention Centre issued a medical certificate to the effect that the applicant was suffering from hypertension , and from sequelae of a trauma to his right shoulder , from discopathy and psoriasis . He was not rehabilitated , despite the orthopaedist \u2019s recommendation , as there was no such possibility in the conditions of the detention centre . He was also taking significant amounts of various medicines , which had not brought about any significant amelioration of his state .", "On DATE the applicant was admitted to the prison hospital of Bytom prison , but he refused to give his consent for staying there .", "On DATE the ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings against persons responsible for the alleged offence of the applicant \u2019s unlawful deprivation of liberty in conditions which entailed danger to his health , finding that the applicant had been kept in detention on the basis of valid decisions of competent authorities , and that the lawfulness and justified character of his detention had repeatedly been examined in the context of various appeals filed by the applicant , also as to its alleged incompatibility with his health . The prosecutor concluded that no criminal offence had been committed .", "On an unspecified date before DATE the applicant was put in the hospital of the ORG prison . A medical opinion of DATE stated that the applicant had complained about pains and limited movement of his right arm , caused by an accident , certain pains in his spine , headaches and lack of appetite . The applicant \u2019s condition necessitated a permanent pharmaceutical treatment of his hypertension and periodical treatment of his spine problems . Also , a treatment to bring his right shoulder to full efficiency was indicated . Apparently , the applicant \u2019s actual pains were less severe than he had reported . Likewise , the range of movement of his right shoulder seemed to be wider than complained of . The physician concluded that the applicant could be maintained in detention and that the necessary treatment could be provided by the prison medical services .", "", "On DATE the ORG upheld this decision of CARDINAL DATE finding , first , that there were no grounds on which to believe that the applicant \u2019s detention could be unlawful . It had repeatedly been reviewed by competent authorities who had found that the allegations of unlawfulness were ill - founded . It was emphasised that the applicant had very often been examined by prison physicians and that he had access to appropriate medical care , available in conditions of detention . The only limitation to this access concerned the rehabilitation treatment , but this was due simply to the fact that the detention centre was not in a position to ensure this kind of medical care to detained persons . This circumstance alone could not serve as a basis for the applicant \u2019s release as it had been established by way of expert medical opinions that his ailments were not severe enough to fall within the scope of LAW . In conclusion , the applicant \u2019s allegations that his detention could amount to a criminal offence were entirely implausible and should be regarded as attempts to put pressure on the justice administration organs .", "On DATE a medical expert opinion was submitted to the ORG . The expert had examined the applicant and analysed the entries in his voluminous medical records . He stated that the applicant suffered significant obesity , had sustained a trauma of his right shoulder with a persistent pain syndrome , had a light hypertension and very light decrease of audition , caused by slight damage of a hearing nerve . It transpired from the entries in the applicant \u2019s records that he had very often requested medical advice and had been taking great quantities of painkillers and anti - inflammatory medicines . In conclusion , the applicant \u2019s ailments were not of such severity as to prevent him either from being detained on remand , or from serving a prison sentence . It was true that the rehabilitation treatment could not be provided in prison , and that , if postponed for a long time , this could lead to a gradual deterioration in the state in the applicant \u2019s arm .", "B.

Further , detention could be imposed if there were serious grounds for believing that there was a risk of collusion or that an accused would otherwise jeopardise criminal proceedings .
