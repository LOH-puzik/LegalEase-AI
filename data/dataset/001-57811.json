On CARDINAL and DATE officers from the GPE customs , accompanied by a senior police officer ( officier de police judiciaire ) , made CARDINAL searches of LOC in GPE which housed the head offices of the companies managed by PERSON and which served as the GPE consulate . The applicants - who in GPE lived at FAC ( Labarde , Gironde ) - used to receive there all private mail that was not sent direct to GPE . The searches took place from TIME to TIME on DATE and from TIME to TIME on DATE , the applicant and his secretary being present on both occasions .", "The officers seized CARDINAL documents . They placed them unsorted in CARDINAL cardboard boxes which they sealed and took away to the ORG regional head office .", "Work on removing the seals and classifying the documents began on DATE , in the presence of a senior police officer and PERSON . The latter asked for and obtained a photocopy of documents that he said he needed urgently for his work .", "After being suspended at the applicant \u2019s request , the work resumed on DATE in the presence of CARDINAL senior police officers ; PERSON lawyer had indicated by telephone that his client refused to attend .", "In all , the customs registered CARDINAL documents . They considered the remainder to be of no relevance to their inquiries and returned them in CARDINAL sealed boxes .", "CARDINAL . The searches and seizures in issue were based on ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) and were part of an investigation to determine whether the applicants were to be regarded as being resident in GPE and whether they had contravened the legislation on financial dealings with foreign countries .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the judge made orders to this effect .", "The trial was due to begin on DATE but was postponed to CARDINAL DATE at PERSON and PERSON request . In a judgment of DATE ORG ruled that the public prosecution and the proceedings for imposition of customs penalties in respect of PERSON and PERSON were barred as a result of changes in the criminal law .

On DATE the court declined jurisdiction in favour of the GPE tribunal de grande instance .", "CARDINAL .

The customs\u2019 action was taken in that context .", "The provisions of LAW on house searches relate to operations referred to in that code and do not apply to searches made under LAW , which continue to be governed by the special legislation on the matter . LAW of DATE , which requires the intervention of the judicial authorities in respect of house searches during the investigation and establishment of offences against tax and business regulations , moreover provides in LAW that \u2018 house searches made pursuant to the LAW shall continue to be governed by existing legislation\u2019 .", "ORG decision on which the plaintiffs relied is likewise irrelevant to that legislation .", "The ordinary courts consequently have no jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of the seizures made at the home of PERSON and PERSON . The ORG must decline jurisdiction . \"", "CARDINAL . The PERSON appealed , seeking a declaration that the seizures on CARDINAL and DATE were null and void and an order for return of the documents held by the customs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the following terms :", "\" The seizures in issue were not challenged on the ground of any formal defect .", "The courts below correctly held that the powers conferred on customs officers by Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Customs Code , special provisions which are not overridden by the more general ones of LAW of DATE , cover the seizure of documents likely to constitute the subject - matter or evidence of offences against the regulations governing financial dealings with foreign countries .", "To this extent the principles relating to the protection of private life , the home and correspondence can not be an obstacle to applying these provisions .", "However , although coming within the ambit of the aforementioned ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , the unlawful seizure or retention of purely private documents that were manifestly irrelevant to the financial or business transactions which prompted the authorities\u2019 intervention could amount to a flagrantly unlawful act , since such an infringement of civil liberties would then be wholly severable from the authorities\u2019 powers .", "In the instant case it appears from the search and seizure reports which have been put in evidence that on CARDINAL and DATE the authors of them placed a very large number of documents under seal in the offices of PERSON and in his presence , and that he , while protesting against the principle of the seizure , made no objection based on the nature of any given document . On DATE the seals were removed and all the documents were classified , and PERSON and his secretary availed themselves of the opportunity they were afforded to take a photocopy of those documents \u2018 which they needed for their work in the coming days\u2019 . Once again , PERSON made no reference to the presence of purely private papers or letters among his business papers .", "On DATE the same customs officers proceeded to go through the documents in detail and seized them . PERSON had been summoned to attend but made it known that he refused to do so . Notwithstanding his absence , numerous documents were exempted from seizure \u2018 as being of no relevance to their ORG and were placed in CARDINAL sealed cardboard boxes and returned to Mr GPE DATE .", "In these circumstances it appears that the officials took the most meticulous precautions in order not to exceed their powers under the law and that if it is subsequently shown that they have inadvertently kept purely private papers unconnected with their investigation - papers of which the CARDINAL appellants have never given any particulars - , Mr PERSON must be held largely responsible , and at all events it could only have occurred as a result of an involuntary mistake and not of a manifest , deliberate violation of a personal freedom . \"", "CARDINAL . An appeal on points of law by the applicants was dismissed by ORG of ORG on DATE . Its judgment read as follows :", "\" As to the first ground :", "ORG is criticised for having ruled as it did , in that , according to the applicants , in confining itself to noting that the seizure in dispute was made as part of an investigation into the status as a NORP resident of PERSON , the GPE consul in GPE , without even determining whether the purpose of the operation was to seize documents likely to constitute the subject - matter or evidence of an offence against the regulations governing financial dealings with foreign countries , ORG infringed Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Customs Code .", "It appears from ORG own reasons and those it adopted , however , that the disputed seizures were made during an investigation to ascertain whether PERSON had , as a NORP resident , committed offences against the legislation governing financial dealings with foreign countries . The ground has not been made out .", "As to the second ground :", "ORG is further criticised for having ruled as it did , in that , according to the applicants , it could not , without infringing LAW , omit to answer the submission in which Mr and PERSON argued that , independently of the existence of any flagrantly unlawful act which might have been committed against them , LAW entrusted the judiciary with the protection of every aspect of the liberty of the individual , and in particular the inviolability of the home .", "In its judgment , however , ORG held that , although coming within the ambit of the aforementioned ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , the unlawful seizure or retention of purely private papers that were manifestly irrelevant to the transactions which had prompted the authorities\u2019 intervention could amount to a flagrantly unlawful act , since such an infringement of civil liberties would then be severable from the authorities\u2019 powers . ORG also noted that the customs officials took the most meticulous precautions in order not to exceed their powers and that there was no manifest , deliberate violation of a personal freedom . In so holding , ORG answered the submissions made , and it follows that the ground is not made out .", "As to the third ground :", "Lastly , ORG is criticised for having ruled as it did , in that , according to the applicants , by raising of its own motion the points of pure fact that the customs officers classified the CARDINAL documents seized and then went through them , which allegedly led to some of them being returned to PERSON on account of their irrelevance to the investigation , ORG exceeded its powers and violated Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE simultaneously of LAW .", "ORG , however , held that the facts it noted appeared from the search and seizure reports put in evidence , which have been produced .
