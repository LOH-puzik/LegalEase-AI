NORP The applicant , Mladost PERSON a.d . ( hereafter \u201c the applicant company \u201d ) , is a commercial ( joint stock ) company incorporated under NORP law , with its seat in GPE . It was represented before the ORG by PERSON , an advocate practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .

The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The legal system of the former GPE ( SFRY ) distinguished CARDINAL types of ownership : private ownership ( privatno vlasni\u0161tvo ) and social ownership ( dru\u0161tveno vlasni\u0161tvo ) . While owners of property in private ownership were private individuals ( natural persons ) and some private legal entities called \u201c civil legal entities \u201d ( gra\u0111anske pravne osobe ) such as foundations , associations and religious communities , the owner of property in social ownership was not defined . Nevertheless , the federal ORG , the constituent Republics , municipalities being local government units and other various legal entities called \u201c social legal entities \u201d ( dru\u0161tvene pravne osobe ) , among which the most important ones were companies , known at the time as \u201c organisations of associated labour \u201d ( organizacije udru\u017eenog rada ) and later on as \u201c socially owned companies \u201d ( dru\u0161tvena poduze\u0107a ) , were during the socialist period given certain quasi - ownership rights over property in social ownership , such as the right to use it ( pravo DATE ) , the right to administer it ( pravo upravljanja ) or the right to dispose of it ( pravo raspolaganja ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company was established in DATE in GPE as an \u201c organisation of associated labour \u201d . On DATE it transformed itself under NORP law into a commercial ( joint stock ) company whose shareholders were all private individuals .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company claimed that during the socialist period it had held a quasi - ownership right over CARDINAL plots of land in social ownership ( dru\u0161tveno vlasni\u0161tvo ) located in GPE ) , namely the right of use ( pravo kori\u0161tenja ) of that land . At the time , the plots in question had formed the \u201c GPE \u201d Children and ORG operated by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE declared independence and severed all ties with ORG ( hereafter \u201c the SFRY \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . By a number of decrees adopted in the period DATE and CARDINAL DATE the Government of GPE prohibited companies or other legal entities with their seat in other GPE of the former SFRY from undertaking any transactions involving assets ( including immovable property ) located in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By Government of GPE decree of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , all such assets of legal entities with their seats in GPE or GPE were transferred to the State ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Relying on subsequent legislation that entered into force on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE recorded in the land register the ORG as the owner of the plots of land at issue .", "CARDINAL . With the entry into force on DATE of LAW , holders of existing quasi - ownership rights over socially - owned property ( the rights to administer , use and dispose of it ) ex lege became its owners ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . This did not apply to such rights which had been extinguished before that date , primarily by virtue of earlier legislative acts whereby social ownership of certain types of property ( such as flats , agricultural land and sports facilities ) was transformed into private ownership .", "CARDINAL . By a gift contract of DATE the ORG transferred ownership of the land in question to the GPE elementary school ( hereafter \u201c the elementary school \u201d ) . On the basis of that contract , on DATE the ORG registered the school as the owner of the land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Agreement on Succession Issues between the successor GPE to the SFRY ( hereafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) entered into force ( see paragraph CARDINAL below , and , for further details , PERSON and Others v. GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and the former GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) . PERSON to the ORG deals with private property and acquired rights . LAW provides that successor GPE will recognise , protect and restore the rights to immovable property located on their territory to which citizens or other legal entities of the SFRY were entitled on DATE , and that anyone who is unable to enjoy such rights will be entitled to compensation . It also provides that any purported transfer of rights to immovable property made after DATE will be deemed null and void ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . Following an application by the relevant land - survey ( geodetic ) authorities of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , joined the CARDINAL plots of land in question to form a single cadastral plot and recorded the change in the land register .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant company brought a civil action against the ORG and the elementary school ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) in ORG , seeking restitution of the land in question . In particular , since all existing rights of use had been abolished and transformed into rights of ownership ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant company sought to be declared the owner of the land . In the alternative , the company sought MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation . It relied on LAW to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s action . It found that during the socialist period the applicant company had held the right of use only in respect of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL plots of land which at the time had formed the \u201c GPE \u201d Children and FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . During the socialist period the right of use in respect of the remaining plots had belonged to GPE ( CARDINAL plots ) and to ORG ( CARDINAL plot ) . When the company had instituted civil proceedings in DATE , that plot had no longer existed as it had been joined to the remaining CARDINAL plots to form a single cadastral plot ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This meant that the applicant company \u2019s action had to be dismissed because it had been brought in respect of an inexistent item of property .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed , arguing that during the socialist period GPE and ORG had transferred to it the right of use in respect of the CARDINAL plots of land . It provided some documentary evidence to that effect . In any event , it was evident that the applicant company had operated and used the resort in DATE for DATE and thereby , under the legislation in force at the time , had acquired the right of use in respect of those CARDINAL plots by the operation of law . As regards the remaining plot in respect of which ORG had acknowledged that it had had the right of use , the applicant company argued that its civil action should not have been dismissed just because that plot had been joined with the remaining CARDINAL to form a single plot of land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u PERSON ) dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal and upheld the firstinstance judgment . It held that the applicant company had not provided sufficient evidence to overturn ORG finding that the company had not held the right of use in respect of the CARDINAL plots of land . ORG , however , agreed with the applicant company \u2019s argument that its civil action regarding the remaining plot of land should not have been dismissed on the grounds stated by ORG . Nonetheless , the applicant company \u2019s action had to be dismissed because the ORG had lawfully become the owner of that plot on the basis of the decree of CARDINAL DATE and the legislation of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . The applicant company \u2019s right of use had thereby been extinguished and thus could not have been transformed into a right of ownership on the basis of the transitional provisions of the DATE LAW , which had entered into force on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . Lastly , the applicant company could not have relied on Annex G of LAW either , because that agreement was not directly applicable .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed a subsequent appeal on points of law ( revizija ) lodged by the applicant company . The relevant part of that judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW the owner of a socially - owned immovable property is the [ legal entity ] recorded in the land register as the holder of the right to administer , use or dispose of that immovable property .", "However , this statutory presumption does not operate in favour of the plaintiff .", "The plaintiff \u2019s right of use ... could not have been transformed into a right of ownership with the entry into force of LAW ( DATE ) because the plaintiff had already lost the right of use before that , on the basis of section CARDINAL ) of the [ Government ] Decree [ of CARDINAL DATE ] .", "...", "In the light of the foregoing , the right of use ... was extinguished and was transformed into a right of ownership of the first defendant [ i.e. the ORG ] before the entry into force of LAW .", "Lastly , as regards the application of ORG to LAW , on which the plaintiff relies , its provisions do not entitle the plaintiff to seek from the [ first ] defendant recognition of its [ i.e the plaintiff \u2019s ] right of ownership , ... deletion of the [ second ] defendant \u2019s right of ownership or [ to make ] further claims under the law of obligations [ i.e. to seek compensation ] .", "...", "The plaintiff did not acquire the right of ownership on the basis of LAW itself because that right still needs to be recognised .
