In view of the strong public interest at stake , the court , when examining the grounds of an application being heard under the special procedure , as in the present case , may and indeed must take into consideration , of its own motion , matters over and above the evidence submitted to the court by the parties \u2013 in particular , real events and situations reported in publications ( books , magazines , newspapers , etc . ) accessible to any interested person DATE and this notwithstanding the ordinary rules on the burden of proof . On the basis of the well - known facts set out below , whose validity the ORG does not doubt , the ORG accepts the following in relation to the case . ORG ( classical ) GPE is delimited to the south by LOC and the GPE , PERSON and PERSON mountains ; to the north by LOC , the Prespa lakes , and FAC ( Rila Planina ) and LOC ; to the east by the river GPE ; and to the west by ORG and the LOC range ( see : PERSON , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , PERSON , p. II ; PERSON , GPE tou GPE , p. CARDINAL ) . Its inhabitants ( the NORP ) were one of the most ancient NORP tribes , closely related to the NORP , who were also of NORP origin , and especially to the NORP . Their language was one of the oldest NORP dialects , akin to NORP and PERSON and also to the NORP dialect . Their religion was that common to the NORP and their myths and traditions were similar to those elsewhere in the NORP world ( see PERSON , ORG , trans . PERSON as ORG , GPE , LAW , p. CARDINAL , and LAW , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , ORG tou Politismou , ed . ORG , DATE , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , NORP ORG , trans . PERSON , GPE , DATE , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , op . cit . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , I taftotita ton Makedonon , communication to ORG on DATE ; PERSON , correction of the draft article on GPE for the new NORP encyclopedia NORP People , speech to the special meeting of ORG DATE ; PERSON , The Language and the NORP Origin of the ORG NORP , LOC , DATE ) . The NORP kings PERSON and PERSON acted not just as NORP but as pan - GPE , in the sense that they incarnated the old idea of the creation of a unified NORP State by bringing together the smaller NORP territories ; they were bearers , and the latter was a disseminator , not of an incomplete NORP civilisation but of NORP civilisation ( see PERSON , ORG , trans . with commentary etc . by PERSON , DATE , pp . CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL and CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , PERSON , vol . D , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . And in DATE , especially after the appearance in the LOC of the LOC and NORP ( MONEY . DATE ) , the NORP region as defined above was a stronghold and bastion of NORP just as it had been in ancient times . PERSON describes GPE as a \u2018 shield\u2019 and praises the NORP because they fought the barbarians ( non - NORP ) to ensure the safety of the ( other ) NORP ( Polybius , GPE , GPE edition , DATE , vol . CARDINAL , book CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . For the NORP period the same is affirmed by the NORP historian PERSON in his classic work PERSON orientale , GPE , DATE , pp . CARDINAL . In addition , a guide to LOC written by NORP historians and archaeologists during the last world war states that \u2018 the waves of migrating peoples which frequently swamped the NORP peninsula broke on this most powerful bastion of GPE ( see PERSON , op . cit . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . Nowhere in either the recent or the distant past are GPE and the NORP mentioned in any official document as a specific ethnic group . LAW , and LAW which it replaced , make no reference to such a notion . In the official NORP census of DATE there is mention of NORP and NORP , or inhabitants whose identity was partly NORP , in the vilayets of LOC and ORG , where there were NORP ethnic majorities ; but no mention of NORP , since nobody declared such descent ( A. PERSON , op . cit . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , PERSON tou PERSON , vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , which includes a reproduction of the census tables ) . In his work Voyage dans la Mac\u00e9doine ( GPE , DATE ) PERSON , the French Consul in GPE , says that the NORP ( as all speakers of NORP were then called ) never penetrated the forests beyond NORP , where the population remained NORP ( see vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , and vol . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . With reference to the same area , the NORP geographer PERSON NORP LOC observes that in their language , traditions , cultural affinities , ethnic preferences and religion , its inhabitants are as legitimately and authentically NORP as their brothers further to the south ( PERSON Landschafts- und GPE , GPE , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . He reiterates the words of ORG , GPE representative at the Congress of Berlin , on DATE , when he said that \u2018 GPE and NORP are just as NORP as GPE ( PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) . The fact that a small part of this region \u2019s population also speaks a language which is basically a form of NORP with admixtures of NORP , NORP , ORG and NORP words , does not prove that this minority is of NORP or NORP origin ; in isolation this criterion is of no value whatsoever , as is borne out by the experience in the recent past of the forced migration from LOC Minor to GPE of populations which were indisputably NORP but totally ignorant of the NORP language . It is indicative that among the fighters of the NORP campaign ( CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) there were men who spoke the NORP - Slav dialect but who had a purely NORP national consciousness ; for example ORG , ORG , PERSON , PERSON and others . In his Short History of the NORP , NORP and ORG ( GPE DATE ) , the NORP historian PERSON wrote of these non - NORP - speaking NORP that they had an implacable hatred of and scorn for all NORP and NORP ( see PERSON , op . cit . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . After the Balkan Wars of CARDINAL , PERCENT of the region corresponding to ancient GPE was under NORP domination , PERCENT under NORP domination , and PERCENT under NORP domination ( see PERSON , p. CARDINAL , which includes a map ) . In this way a territorial status came into being . There were exchanges of population , either voluntary or following bilateral agreements such as the PERSON - Molov agreement between GPE and GPE in DATE ; and NORP from GPE populated the NORP part of GPE , so that only NORP remained in this part of GPE , even if some of them were bilingual . LOC thus became a completely homogeneous part of NORP territory ( see PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ; and PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL , who refers to the work of ORG , PERSON ) . This was especially true in the period immediately following the Second World War ( ORG ) , when almost all the bilingual inhabitants of this region who did not have a NORP national consciousness emigrated to neighbouring countries ( see PERSON , Nationalism and Communism in GPE , GPE , DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . There they experienced a mutation of their partly NORP or partly NORP nationality into a \u2018 ORG , i.e. a NORP - NORP , nationality ( see PERSON in GPE DATE , GPE , DATE , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , GPE , PERSON , PERSON , DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . This situation was preceded by a number of violent incidents , such as the ORG revolt , in which the NORP claim to have revolted against the NORP on DATE at FAC , a town near GPE whose ethnic composition was overwhelmingly NORP . In fact they turned against the town \u2019s NORP inhabitants , whom they tried to wipe out with the cooperation of the NORP and without causing the rest of the population any significant harm ( see PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , The NORP Struggle in GPE CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , ORG , DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , ORG - Ainianos , PERSON and ORG , O PERSON , GPE , DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , op . cit . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . Until DATE \u2018 Macedonia\u2019 as a NORP State and \u2018 the NORP nation\u2019 as a specific nation were unheard of . The part of GPE which fell under NORP domination , like that which fell to GPE , is a narrow strip of land along the NORP border and represents only a small part of GPE . PERSON , which DATE is the capital of the misleadingly named GPE of ORG , is far away from GPE . The S.R.M. was founded under the NORP occupation ( see PERSON , ORG in GPE CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , GPE , DATE ) . Its foundation was part of a deliberate strategy according to which , when the regions of GPE and LOC ( which belonged to ancient Dardania , a non - NORP country ) were ceded , a NORP population could be said to exist in the sparsely populated part of GPE that lay beyond the NORP borders and contained NORP , NORP , ORG , NORP with a partly NORP identity , and NORP ; a NORP - speaking population with a specific dialect and an unstable national consciousness ( see PERSON , op . cit . , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ; PERSON , ORG of GPE and its NORP , GPE , DATE , with relevant bibliography ) . The long - term purpose of founding the ORG was to re - establish a NORP State with access to the LOC . CARDINAL of the means to this end is to enlist in various ways bilingual NORP from LOC . Setting up an association called \u2018 Home of NORP Civilisation\u2019 at GPE is part of this effort and applies a directive issued by NORP organisations abroad . The aim is to create a NORP Question with international ramifications ( see statements by NORP politicians to the ORG newspaper , CARDINAL DATE and to ORG magazine , CARDINAL DATE ) . The parties applying for recognition of the above association are the enablers in this operation . Among them are PERSON and PERSON , who appeared at an international conference to dispute the NORP identity of ( NORP ) GPE , the former in particular by distinguishing between NORP and NORP ( see the ORG newspaper of CARDINAL DATE , which includes photographs of the above persons among QUANTITY members of the \u2018 ORG delegation at the ORG in GPE ; and the PERSON newspaper of CARDINAL DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . This , in combination with the name of the proposed association and with the whole content of its memorandum of association , renders at least dubious the association \u2019s aims , which according to the founder PERSON seemingly lawful statement in clause CARDINAL of the memorandum of association , consist in the cultural , intellectual and artistic advancement of its members , cultural decentralisation , etc . This assessment is supported by the content of clause CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the same memorandum of association , which states that all youths in the PERSON area will be enrolled in the proposed association \u2019s youth section . It is clear from this that there is a danger that the immaturity of young people will be exploited and that youths will be trapped by suitable propaganda in an ethnologically non - existent and historically evacuated NORP minority . Clause CARDINAL of the same memorandum of association lays down the condition that enrolment in the association is subject to written acceptance of the association \u2019s principles . Nowhere in the association \u2019s memorandum of association , however , are these principles defined . Thus the memorandum of association does not provide a clear idea of who will enrol , since a clear definition of the principles governing the proposed association is deliberately omitted . Lastly , the very name of the association may be a source of confusion , because at first sight it creates the impression that it refers to GPE \u2019s NORP civilisation , whereas in reality it envisages a specifically NORP civilisation which does not exist in the region in question . Altogether , this ORG has good reasons in the light of the foregoing to believe that the purpose of using the term \u2018 ORG is to dispute the NORP identity of GPE and its inhabitants by indirect and therefore underhand means , and discerns an intention on the part of the founders to undermine GPE \u2019s territorial integrity . The impugned refusal of the application in question was therefore justified , notwithstanding that it was based on shorter and partly different reasoning ; and the arguments to the contrary put forward in the present appeal must fail .", "\u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed on points of law to ORG , relying , in particular , on ORG , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of LAW and the corresponding provisions of the Convention . They maintained that , contrary to law , ORG had ( a ) not confined itself to reviewing the lawfulness of the establishment of their association DATE namely whether the requirements of ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW had been satisfied DATE but had reviewed its desirability , relying on the presumed intentions of the founder members , which ( assuming them to have any reality ) could not , however , be the subject of judicial review at the stage of granting the association legal recognition ; ( b ) taken into consideration information ( in particular , irresponsible and unfounded press articles concerning some of the founder members ) that had not been produced by the parties ; ( c ) accepted as true certain matters that were of decisive importance for the outcome of the proceedings without ordering evidence to be taken to establish whether they were in fact true ; ( d ) distorted the content of the association \u2019s memorandum of association ; and ( e ) not given sufficient reasons in its judgment .", "In a pleading filed on DATE the applicants essentially reiterated the complaints they had set out in their appeal on points of law and stated that the refusal to authorise the founding of their association was based on assessments and assumptions as to their personalities and ideological and historical convictions which in turn rested not on the association \u2019s memorandum of association but on suspect anonymous publications .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . It considered that the grounds of appeal were vague and unfounded .

As to the \u201c matters that were of decisive importance for the outcome of the proceedings \u201d , the parties had not specified the matters in question in their appeal .

ORG also held that sufficient reasons had been given in ORG judgment . It further noted that the assertion that ORG , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW , together with LAW , had been infringed referred not to ORG judgment but to the judgment of ORG ; even supposing that the applicants had put forward a ground of appeal based on LAW , it would have had to be dismissed as vague since they had not stated in what way ORG had made a mistake in interpreting or applying those provisions .", "CARDINAL .
