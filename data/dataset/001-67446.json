{"ITEMID": "001-67446", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "ZANDER v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a GPE national , born in DATE and living in the GPE . He was initially represented before ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE . PERSON has now been replaced by ORG QUANTITY Rouwelaar , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant had a relationship with a woman , PERSON , out of which a child , PERSON , was born on DATE . The applicant recognised PERSON as his child . By a decision dated DATE ORG judge ( PERSON ) vested parental authority jointly in the applicant and PERSON", "After the relationship between the applicant and PERSON had ended in DATE , the latter applied to ORG for the guardianship ( voogdij ) over PERSON . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG appointed PERSON as PERSON 's guardian ( voogd ) and the applicant as her subsidiary guardian ( toeziend voogd ) . PERSON was to remain with PERSON The applicant was granted an access arrangement ( omgangsregeling ) under which PERSON would stay with him for DATE each fortnight and for periods of DATE during DATE .", "On DATE PERSON applied to ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of PERSON for a change in the access arrangement . The applicant submitted a written statement of defence suggesting changes of his own . On DATE , ORG agreed to change the access arrangement in accordance with the wishes of PERSON The changes involved , essentially , that PERSON would be handed to the applicant at times which would preclude the applicant from picking up or dropping PERSON at school , as \u201c communication at school \u201d had apparently led to conflicts between the applicant and PERSON", "It appears that on DATE , when PERSON came to pick up PERSON at the applicant 's home , an incident took place between the applicant and PERSON which gave rise to separate criminal complaints filed by both of them . According to a statement made by PERSON to the police this incident was caused by disagreement about her decision to send PERSON to a different school . Thereafter PERSON refused the applicant all access to PERSON .", "On DATE - shortly before the hearing in summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) aimed at securing PERSON cooperation with the access arrangement ( see below ) - PERSON applied to ORG for the access arrangement between the applicant and PERSON to be terminated altogether . The applicant lodged a written statement objecting to this suggestion , asking for the access arrangement to be altered instead . ORG decided to order ORG ( PERSON ) to report to it on the feasibility of continuing the access arrangement .", "ORG held a hearing on DATE . The applicant complained that ORG was taking too long to finish its report He asked for the ORG 's terms of reference to be changed and for access to be resumed in the meantime . ORG decided not to alter the ORG 's terms of reference and deferred its decision until the report was ready .", "ORG submitted a report dated DATE by a psychologist , who - at the request of ORG - had examined PERSON and who had found that PERSON had suffered by the lack of understanding between her parents . Resumption of access by the applicant would be too threatening for PERSON and ought therefore not to be considered at this stage . Psychological support was needed to help PERSON overcome the psychological problems caused by the conflicts that she had witnessed . Both PERSON and the applicant , with whom the psychologist had had conversations both prior to and after PERSON 's examination , had been given the opportunity to make comments on this report . These comments were annexed to the report .", "In a second report dated CARDINAL DATE by ORG , which had been drafted on the basis of conversations held with PERSON and the applicant and the psychologist 's report of DATE , it was noted that PERSON had better ties with PERSON than with the applicant and felt threatened in her contacts with the applicant . It was recommended that access should not be resumed until such time as PERSON herself was ready for it , that PERSON should receive psychological support and that the applicant should seek psychological treatment . Both PERSON and the applicant were given the possibility to make written comments on the report . Only PERSON availed herself of this opportunity . Her comments were appended to the report . The applicant 's lawyer merely stated that the applicant considered that the contents of the report were not at all correct , but that he did not wish to avail himself of the possibility to submit comments .", "On DATE ORG gave a decision terminating the access arrangement altogether . Insofar as relevant , ORG held :", "\u201c ORG accepts the advice of the expert and ORG and will decide accordingly .", "Since we are faced with the case of a girl who is just over DATE who does not yet have a strong personality , this will have to be taken into consideration .", "If access by the father were to be resumed at this point , that would be too much of an imposition on the child , given the apprehensive reactions observed in GPE , who moreover is emotionally blocked and has found a safe haven with her mother ; access < by the father > would seriously harm her development .", "The father 's request will be rejected on the above - mentioned grounds and the mother 's request will be granted .", "The father must allow PERSON some time .", "ORG draws the mother 's attention to her responsibility as the caring parent and charges her to take all measures necessary to get her daughter out of the present blockage . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) against the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG endorsed the refusal of ORG to order an access arrangement . ORG considered that it was generally in the child 's interests for it to have contacts with the non - custodial parent , and that the non - custodial parent was in principle entitled to such access . However , basing itself on the psychologist 's report , ORG found it necessary for PERSON to grow up in a safe family environment , from which the applicant was to be excluded so as to allow PERSON to develop a normal bond with PERSON , who was to help PERSON overcome her negative emotional reactions to the applicant , for which PERSON needed to seek psychological counselling . It would then be possible in DATE time for contact between the applicant and PERSON to be resumed . In the meanwhile PERSON was to provide the applicant twice a year with information on PERSON 's development , including recent photographs and school reports . It held , amongst other things , that although there was nothing in the relationship between PERSON and the applicant to impede contact between them , it would not be in PERSON 's interests to order a compulsory access arrangement in view of the serious lack of understanding between PERSON and the applicant as well as PERSON 's own psychological state .", "On DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) . He argued that ORG ought to have ordered an access arrangement , leaving it to PERSON 's parents to see to it that she did not suffer any harm or , in the alternative , ORG ought to have examined the question of whether the facility with which access arrangements could be terminated was not partly the cause of the problems , and whether continuing the access arrangement rather than terminating it would not have been more conducive to reducing tensions between the parents . He further argued that ORG decision was insufficiently reasoned , given that ORG had found that there was nothing to impede contact between the applicant and PERSON per se and so it was not clear how compelling PERSON to allow such contact could harm PERSON 's interests .", "ORG handed down its decision on DATE dismissing the applicant 's appeal . As to the applicant 's first complaint it held that ORG had been entitled to decide , on the basis of the information available to it ( including the psychologist 's report ) , that to impose an access arrangement would be contrary to PERSON 's weighty interests . As regards the applicant 's second complaint , ORG held that ORG had merely stated that an access arrangement imposed by court order would be detrimental to PERSON 's interests .", "Following the incident of CARDINAL DATE the applicant tried , initially through social workers and later through his lawyer , to get PERSON to recommence implementing the access arrangement as determined on DATE . These attempts did not meet with success .", "On DATE the applicant summoned PERSON to appear before the President of ORG of Zutphen in summary injunction proceedings . The applicant sought an order against PERSON to co - operate in the implementation of the access arrangement or forfeit a sum of money each time that she failed to do so .", "Following a hearing held on DATE , the President of ORG gave judgment on DATE declining to give the order sought by the applicant . He held :", "\u201c Parties are making mutual reproaches which , in the absence of a sound substantiation , can not be adequately examined in the present proceedings as to their degree of foundedness . The proceedings on the merits already pending ... are more suitable for a thorough examination , the more so since in those proceedings use can be made of the assistance of ORG of Zutphen . Also taking into consideration that the < applicant > has not had access to PERSON for DATE , it can not be considered for the time being as being in PERSON 's interests - which takes a central place in this matter - that in anticipation of the outcome of the proceedings on the merits the present access arrangement will be restarted , as this would result in a change of a stable situation which , having regard to PERSON 's tender age , does not appear to be opportune . \u201d", "The President of ORG did , however , not award costs against the applicant but ordered both parties to bear their own costs .", "The applicant filed an appeal with ORG . He argued that the President ought to have ordered the resumption of the access arrangement , because that would have made it clear in what way contact between him and PERSON should be resumed and would thus have yielded information which would have benefited the decision of ORG on whether or not to terminate the access arrangement altogether . He further argued , inter alia , that his intention was to give practical effect to a right that had been determined by a decision of a court that had obtained the force of res iudicata .", "Following a hearing held on DATE , ORG gave judgment on DATE , i.e. the same day on which it handed down its decision on the access arrangement ( see above ) . It held that , as it had endorsed the termination of the access arrangement , the applicant 's claim had lost its basis and that therefore the judgment of the President of ORG had to be confirmed . The applicant as the losing party was ordered to pay a sum of money towards PERSON legal costs .", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG on DATE . He argued that , although the ground for his claim had disappeared due to the decision of ORG terminating the access arrangement , ORG ought nevertheless to have ruled in principle on the claim 's foundedness , since the question whether or not he was in fact the losing party depended on it , and the decision on costs in turn depended on that .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG held that ORG had erred in law by deciding without a further examination that the applicant was the losing party . ORG ought instead to have addressed the question of whether or not the President of ORG had rightly dismissed the applicant 's claim and to have based its decision on costs on the outcome of that examination . ORG did not , however , refer the case back for a rehearing on appeal , holding instead that irrespective of the outcome of such a rehearing each party should bear its own costs . In so doing it applied by analogy the rule that such a decision was possible in litigation between married parents .", "At the relevant time , access rights were regulated in ORG CARDINAL:CARDINALa and CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) . These provisions were subsumed in Article CARDINAL et seq . of LAW by LAW DATE , which entered into force on DATE .", "Article CARDINAL:CARDINALa of LAW , as in force at the material time , provided as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The child and the parent who has not been appointed as guardian are entitled to have access to each other ( omgang met CARDINAL ) . Access between the parent and the child can take place from the time at which the other parent 's guardianship has begun .", "CARDINAL . ORG shall , at the time of the divorce or at DATE , at the request of both parents or of CARDINAL of them , establish an arrangement for the implementation of the right to access , for a definite period or not as the case may be , or shall deny , for a definite period or not as the case may be , the right to access .", "CARDINAL . ORG shall only deny the right to access if :", "a. access would seriously impair the mental or physical development of the child ; or", "b. the parent must be deemed to be obviously unfit for , or obviously incapable of , access ; or", "c. access would for another reason be contrary to weighty interests ( zwaarwegende belangen ) of the child ; or", "d. the child , being DATE , when being heard has made serious objections to allowing his parent access . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code , as in force at the material time and insofar as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c At the request of CARDINAL or both of the parents , ORG may amend decisions given pursuant to ORG and ORG or change an access arrangement concluded by mutual agreement between the parents on the grounds that the circumstances have changed or that the decision was based on inaccurate or incomplete information . \u201d", "Although the provisions governing access as in force at the relevant time only related to access following divorce , the right of access of parents who had never been married to each other was in fact recognised in domestic case - law under LAW ( cf . PERSON , DATE , PERSON , nr . CARDINAL ; and PERSON , DATE , PERSON , nr . CARDINAL ) .", "Where an access arrangement is not complied with , the parent concerned may request the competent court to issue a measure aimed at enforcing compliance . Courts can not act at their own initiative in this field . Judicial measures aimed at enforcing compliance can take the form of , inter alia , assistance by the police , civil imprisonment , suspension of maintenance payments or placement under supervision ( ondertoezichtstelling ) .", "In civil cases where urgency is required , summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) before the President of ORG may be taken in order to obtain an immediate or interim measure . Such proceedings may be taken where the parties can not wait for a decision in the proceedings on the merits ( bodemprocedure ) . Summary injunction proceedings are governed by Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ) . They are concluded speedily and focus on oral submissions at the hearing . As these proceedings are characterised by speed , issues raised are only examined summarily . Decisions taken in summary injunction proceedings are usually handed down within DATE after the hearing and are immediately enforceable ( bij voorraad uitvoerbaar ) . They may however not be detrimental to the outcome of the proceedings on the merits ( \u201c beslissingen bij voorraad QUANTITY nadeel toe aan de zaak ten principale \u201d ) . The court determining the merits of the case is not bound by the decision handed down by the President of ORG in summary injunction proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
