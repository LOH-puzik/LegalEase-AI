The ORG had used ORG to support its policing and military capabilities in GPE , targeted at stripping the legitimate Government of GPE of its powers . The ORG and ORG , being aware that their ideas were supported by only a small minority of the NORP population , had made attempts violently to overthrow the democratic regime .
