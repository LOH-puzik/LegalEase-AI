He noted that ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention recognised that a balance had to be struck between the interests of the individual , in this case , the interests of the gypsy community and the interests of society generally , but found no reason on that basis to interfere on public law grounds with the assessment reached by the ORG and Secretary of ORG in light of the advice from the Chief Constable .
