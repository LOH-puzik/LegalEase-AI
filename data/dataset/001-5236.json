IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP citizen , born in DATE living in GPE . He is represented before ORG , Solicitors , GPE .", "A.", "\u201c In or TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant was arrested in a cubicle in the public toilet of < a hotel>. The door had been forced open . The prosecution alleges that on the floor between the legs of the accused was a bag marked \u201c ORG at FAC \u201d . Inside the bag was a quantity of notes which appeared to be GPE dollars . The prosecution intends to call evidence from a member of ORG that the dollars are forged .", "The applicant was conveyed to < a police > station where he was detained under LAW DATE . The applicant was taken to an interview room by < CARDINAL detectives>. In the course of the interview < Detective R > alleges that he explained sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW DATE to the applicant . The applicant gave his name and address in response to questions and in CARDINAL instance replied < with the name of his girlfriend>.", "At CARDINAL.CARDINALpm the applicant was again taken to the interview room . Present were < CARDINAL detectives>. Detective R alleges that he produced a copy of < a police manual > and read sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE to the applicant and that he explained the meaning of the sections in ordinary language . He also made certain statements to the accused as to the meaning in law in regard to the sections . The applicant declined to reply to questions put to him during the interrogation . \u201d", "The applicant does not dispute in his application to the ORG that when he was arrested by the detectives , he was in a cubicle in the toilets of the hotel with the plastic carrier above - described bag between his legs . He does not dispute that , when he was asked what was inside the bag , he replied \u201c What bag ? \u201d or that the plastic bag contained forged dollars . He accepts that he was cautioned on arrest as follows :", "\u201c You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but anything you do say will be taken down in writing and may be given in evidence . \u201d", "He also accepts that he responded a second time \u201c What bag ? \u201d when asked about the bag . He also accepts that after TIME in the police station he was brought to an interview room and again cautioned in the above terms and that when he was again asked about the bag he replied giving his name and address only . The applicant does not dispute that he was interviewed a second time , given a copy of the police manual , that the detective in question read sections DATE to him and explained the meaning of those sections in ordinary language . He confirms that he did not proffer any explanation to the detectives .", "When the period of the applicant \u2019s detention expired the applicant was arrested for an offence under section CARDINAL of the Forgery Act DATE and he was brought before ORG where evidence was given of arrest , charge and caution . He pleaded not guilty and he was remanded on bail from time to time until he was returned for trial to ORG . His trial was subsequently adjourned pending his constitutional challenge to sections DATE of LAW DATE .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG quoted , with approval , the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL IR CARDINAL ) and considered that the constitutional right to remain silent could be diluted in certain circumstances . The constitutional validity of any such reduction in protection would depend on whether it was considered proportionate given the competing public and individual interests involved . Applying that test , ORG found that the sections were not an excessive intrusion on the rights of an accused and were therefore not unconstitutional .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . That court considered that the above - cited case of PERSON v. GPE did not automatically dispose of the issues in the case . Having analysed the provisions of section CARDINAL ( which operated in the same manner as section DATE ) , ORG pointed out that the courts were not obliged to draw negative inference but could draw such inferences as appeared proper . It was a matter for the court , or the jury subject to the court \u2019s directions , to decide whether any such inferences would be drawn . In so deciding , the court was obliged to act in accordance with the principles of constitutional justice and was under a constitutional obligation to ensure that no improper or unfair inferences were drawn or permitted to be drawn from such failure or refusal .", "Moreover , it was clear from the provisions of the section CARDINAL that it did not interfere in any way with the accused person \u2019s right to be presumed innocent or with the obligation on the prosecution to establish guilt beyond all reasonable doubt . The burden of proof on the prosecution in a criminal charge was not in any way affected by the provisions of the relevant sections , which merely provided a factor which might be adduced as evidence in the course of the trial . Furthermore , if such inferences were properly drawn , they amounted to evidence only and were not taken as proof . A person could not be convicted solely on the basis of such inferences , the inferences being corroborative of other evidence in relation to which the failure or refusal is material .", "As regards the right to remain silent , in particular , ORG noted that the ORG was constitutionally obliged to protect its citizens from attacks on their person or property but was obliged to have due regard for the constitutional rights of accused persons . The question was whether the restrictions which the relevant sections placed on the right to silence were any greater than was necessary to enable the ORG to fulfil its constitutional obligations , the court noting that the \u201c principle of proportionality \u201d was a well established tenet of NORP law . The court considered that sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act sought to achieve that balance . It was not the court \u2019s role to decide whether a perfect balance had been reached but merely to decide whether the legislature had acted within the range of what was permissible . The court found that the legislature had done so , considering CARDINAL factors limiting sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL important ; an inference could not form the basis of a conviction in the absence of other evidence and an adverse inference could only be drawn where the court deemed if proper to do so . An example of where it would be improper would be where the prejudicial effect of an inference would wholly outweigh its probative value as evidence .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s case came on for trial in ORG . The applicant pleaded guilty and he was given a DATE suspended sentence on condition that he enter a bond of good behaviour for DATE . The applicant entered the bond .", "B.
