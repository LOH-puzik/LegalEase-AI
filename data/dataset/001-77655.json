MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "P1-1 applicable;Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction partially reserved", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed to be the owner of CARDINAL tenements in GPE . Before the ORG he produced a statement made on DATE by a notary public , which reads as follows :", "\u201c I the undersigned Dr. PERSON , ORG , do hereby certify that in virtue of a secret will made on DATE , by PERSON , and published by me on DATE , Major PERSON [ the applicant ] was nominated and appointed by his father , the late Mr PERSON as his sole universal heir and Testamentary Executor of his estate to whom he bequeathed CARDINAL undivided parts of tenements situated at numbers CARDINAL NORP Street , GPE , - of which QUANTITY had been inherited by his wife from her late brother Sir PERSON and the further DATE purchased by him from her brother 's family in DATE all of which were owned in common with the remaining QUANTITY and equal parts owned by CARDINAL further members of the PERSON family residing somewhere in LOC , the administration of which had been passed on to him by their eldest brother Captain PERSON who had been their family administrator until he emigrated from GPE on DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the CARDINAL tenements were requisitioned for the purpose of providing housing for homeless people . The requisition order was served on the applicant 's ancestor , Mr PERSON . Further correspondence about the LOC was addressed to Mr PERSON , as trustee of the estate of the late Sir PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judicial letter was sent to Mr PERSON \u201c as owner \u201d of the LOC , demanding recognition of the tenants . He replied that he was only the trustee of the estate and could not therefore recognise the tenants . This position was confirmed in a court application of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The top floor of CARDINAL of the tenements was allocated to PERSON and his family , while family PERSON had been allotted the ground floor . The requisition of this tenement , composed of CARDINAL floors , was contested on the ground that the ground floor provided the only access to a field , which belonged to the same owner and which had not been requisitioned . After these tenants had been recognised , on DATE the LOC were derequisitioned .", "CARDINAL . The LOC were again requisitioned on DATE from Mr PERSON . They were derequisitioned on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a fresh requisition order concerning the same tenement was issued to Mr. PERSON . The authorities instructed that family P. be allotted both floors . The housekeeper , who was in correspondence about the matter with the applicant ( Mr PERSON ) , handed over all the keys of the tenement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote to ORG asking for reconsideration of the order of DATE . He reiterated the argument concerning access to the field . The ORG acknowledged receipt of this letter but did not reply to it . On an unspecified date in DATE , an amended requisition order , including the field adjacent to the applicant 's tenement , was issued .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant alleged that he had sought the assistance of ORG and of the Attorney General in order to restore the situation and that on further meetings with the authorities he had been made to believe that the situation would be remedied . However , this had not been the case and he did not obtain any satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) against ORG . He alleged that the requisition order of DATE had been issued as a result of an abuse of power and was therefore null and void . He also claimed an infringement of his right to the enjoyment of his property as guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL by reason that the requisition order had not been made in accordance with the public interest and that he had not received adequate and appropriate compensation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's claim . It declared that the tenement should be considered ' quid unum ' and therefore as a single entity , including the field . It also found that the applicant 's submission that the requisition order had been made in excess of power was unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the existence of a public interest should be assessed in the light of the particular features of each individual case . In the applicant 's case , the requisition was aimed at ensuring a fair distribution of homes . The benefit enjoyed by the son of PERSON and his family , who were still using the tenement as a place of habitation , was far superior to that of the applicant . In fact , the latter made sporadic use of the garden or field , which , according to certain witnesses , was used as a rubbish dump .", "CARDINAL . ORG furthermore observed that the applicant had brought his complaints DATE after the issuing of the requisition order and that during this period he had apparently accepted the rent that he was being paid . This rent had been established by ORG and had the applicant wanted to review the amount of the rent he could have applied to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that it had no jurisdiction to deal with the alleged violation of LAW No . CARDINAL since the requisition order had been issued in DATE . According to LAW , the ORG could not be applied retroactively and thus only breaches which occurred after DATE fell within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . He observed that had the tenement been a single entity , this should have been the case from the original requisition order made in DATE . However , the field only became accessory to the tenement according to the DATE requisition order . The applicant moreover claimed that the tenant was making use of the land to further his gardening hobby , which could not be considered an essential part of his accommodation needs . The applicant recalled that he had been deprived of his property for DATE and complained about the amount of rent ( CARDINAL NORP Liras ( ORG ) per DATE MONEY ( ORG ) ) , which he considered to be ridiculous in comparison with the market value of the property .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . It held that the applicant 's tenement should be considered CARDINAL whole property , especially since the only access to the field was through the ground floor . Furthermore , the applicant had never made any serious attempt to question this and had kept unreservedly receiving the rent due . In any case , if he had not been satisfied with the amount of the rent , the applicant should have applied to ORG , thus using the ordinary remedy available in such circumstances .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that the applicant 's claim regarding a violation of his right to the enjoyment of property was inadmissible ratione temporis as the requisition order had been issued and executed before DATE . However , since the complaint concerning the absence of adequate compensation referred to a continuing situation , ORG went on to consider its merits .", "CARDINAL . It recalled that the applicant had always accepted rent from the tenants , which meant that there was a regular lease between the CARDINAL . ORG held that the Government enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in assessing what was in the public interest and which measures were proportionate to the aims sought to be achieved . It quoted PERSON and PERSON book Theory and Practice of the European Convention stating that social and economic policy in the field of housing constituted an aim in the general interest .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the requisition and the amount of rent were in accordance with the GPE case - law . ORG referred , on these points , to the cases of ORG and Others v. PERSON ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , GPE and PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , The Holy Monasteries v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . TIME ) and PERSON and Others v. GPE ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the Housing Act requisition means :", "\u201c to take possession of a building or require the building to be placed at the disposal of the requisitioning authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the ORG Secretary could issue a requisition order if he was satisfied that such a step was necessary in the public interest for providing living accommodation to certain persons or for ensuring a fair distribution of living accommodation . As in force at the time of the requisition of the applicant 's tenement , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c The Secretary , if it appears to him to be necessary or expedient to do so in the public interest or for providing living accommodation to persons or for ensuring a fair distribution of living accommodation , may requisition any building , and may give such directions as appears to him to be necessary or expedient in order that the requisition may be put into effect or complied with . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After DATE the authority to issue requisition orders was given to ORG .", "CARDINAL . A requisition order imposes on the owner of the requisitioned LOC a landlord - tenant relationship . According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , ORG may require the owner to recognise the person accommodated in his property as his tenant or sub - tenant .", "CARDINAL . The owner of the LOC may seek authorisation for non - compliance with this request in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , which , in so far as relevant , provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Within DATE of service on him of a judicial letter under the last preceding sub - section , the requisitionee , by application to FAC in contestation of the Director , may pray for an authorisation of non - compliance with that request ...", "( CARDINAL ) The court shall not grant the authorisation of non - compliance mentioned in DATE sub - section unless the applicant shows to the satisfaction of the court that serious hardship would be caused to him by complying with that request :", "Provided that the assertion that the requisitionee wishes to take possession of the building for his own use or for the use of any member of his family shall not be considered of itself as a hardship for the purposes of this sub - article . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , the owner of the LOC has a right to compensation , which is calculated and payable pursuant to the criteria established in LAW , which , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Subject as hereinafter provided , the compensation payable in respect of the requisition of a building shall be the aggregate of the following sums , that is to say-", "( a ) a sum equal to the rent which might reasonably be expected to be payable by a tenant in occupation of the building during the period for which possession of the building is retained by virtue of the provisions of this LAW , under a letting granted immediately before the beginning of that period :", "Provided that where the building is used by the Director or by a person accommodated therein after its requisition as a dwelling house within the meaning of LAW , the rent shall not exceed the fair rent as defined in LAW ;", "( b ) a sum equal to the cost of making good any damage to the building which may have occurred during the period in which possession thereof under requisition was retained ( except in so far as the damage has been made good during that period by the occupant of the requisitioned LOC or by a person acting on behalf of ORG ) , no account being taken of damage which , under the provisions of this LAW , is the responsibility of the requisitionee ;", "( c ) a sum equal to the amount of expenses reasonably incurred , otherwise than on behalf of the Director , for the purpose of compliance with any directions given by or on behalf of the Director in connection with the taking of possession of the building . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
