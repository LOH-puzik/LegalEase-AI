On DATE , after his wife had left GPE with their daughter without obtaining the applicant \u2019s consent and had set up her residence in GPE , he brought a petition for divorce in ORG ( GPE ) . He also introduced court proceedings in GPE requesting the return of his daughter under the DATE Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife brought a petition for divorce in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed a default decree of divorce issued in DATE , noting that PERSON had failed to comply with the requirements for setting aside the default . Further , it awarded the applicant sole custody over the couple \u2019s daughter and ordered that she should reside with him in case of her return .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request for recognition of the divorce decree with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant this request . Referring to LAW of the Fourth Implementing Regulation to LAW ( CARDINAL . PERSON ORG ) , it considered that a recognition of the divorce decree would be contrary to NORP ordre public as the applicant \u2019s wife , being the defendant in the proceedings before ORG , had not been heard as she was considered to be in default , despite the fact that the applicant \u2019s petition for divorce had not been duly served on her .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG received the observations of ORG and , on DATE , it received the observations of PERSON as a third party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG referred the case to ORG requesting it to review the constitutionality of LAW of the Fourth Implementing Regulation to LAW .", "CARDINAL . It argued that LAW which has constitutional rank in NORP law , applied to the proceedings concerning the recognition of foreign divorce decrees as their outcome had a direct effect on the civil law relationship of the persons concerned . However , it was incompatible with that LAW that ORG , an administrative authority , decided upon the request for recognition . The subsequent control by ORG was not sufficient where the subject matter , such as family law relations , fell within the very core of the notion of \u201c civil rights \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE it supplemented its requests in the CARDINAL other cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave its judgment , finding that LAW of the Fourth Implementing Regulation to LAW was in conformity with the constitution .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted firstly that the proceedings at issue were concerned with the questions whether recognition was compatible with NORP ordre public . Thus , the recognition of foreign divorce decrees was closely linked to the question whether they could be enforced in GPE . Referring to a number of decisions , in which ORG had found that Article CARDINAL did not apply to enforcement proceedings , ORG expressed doubts as to the applicability of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Even assuming that LAW applied , referring to the ORG \u2019s PERSON v. GPE judgment ( of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) , ORG held that ORG scope of review was sufficient , since proceedings concerning the recognition of foreign divorce decrees involved mainly questions of law . Where an assessment of facts was required , as for instance where the question arose whether an action had been duly served , ORG was empowered to review whether the administrative authority \u2019s assessment was correctly based on the contents of the file .", "CARDINAL .
