Relying on the Sixth Directive , the applicant company sought reimbursement of the VAT it had paid for the period from DATE , which it considered had not been due as the Ninth Directive had no retroactive effect . It also brought an action in damages against the ORG for failing to bring NORP law into line with the Sixth Directive within the prescribed period , thereby causing it to sustain damage equal to the amount of the VAT paid . It claimed reimbursement of the VAT paid or , failing that , the amount attributable to the period from DATE to the date the Sixth Directive had come into force .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed its claims in a judgment of DATE . It held , inter alia , that it was clear from LAW that while directives placed an obligation on GPE to achieve a particular result , the choice of the appropriate means of implementing a directive in domestic law lay within the sole discretion of the national authorities , such that individuals and private bodies could not rely directly on a directive to defeat a provision of domestic law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a claim by another firm of insurance brokers , ORG , for the reimbursement of ORG paid on its transactions in DATE was dismissed by ORG for the same reasons .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d'Etat dismissed an appeal by the applicant company . It held that individuals and private bodies were not entitled to rely on the provisions of a NORP directive that had yet to be transposed into domestic law and declared the action in damages inadmissible , as the applicant company had omitted to apply in the first instance to the tax authorities . The main points in its judgment were as follows .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first head of claim :", "\u201c LAW DATE makes it clear that , while ORG directives are binding upon each member ORG ' as to the result to be achieved ' and while in order to achieve the prescribed results the national authorities are required to adapt the legislation of the member GPE to comply with the directives addressed to them , it is solely for those authorities to decide how to give effect to the directives in domestic law . Thus , regardless of any instructions they may contain for the member GPE , directives can not be pleaded in aid of tax appeals by nationals of those GPE . It is common ground that appropriate measures to implement the aforementioned Sixth Directive in domestic law had yet to be taken at the time of the relevant reference period for taxation purposes . In these circumstances , the said Directive , which , contrary to what was submitted by the appellant company , does not constitute a regulation within the meaning of the aforementioned LAW , has in any event no bearing on the application of the preceding statutory provisions , in particular , LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the second head of claim :", "\u201c ORG did not rule on the claim made in the alternative during the course of the proceedings by the company for compensation in the sum of ORG CARDINAL . That part of the impugned judgment is therefore defective procedurally and must be quashed .", "In the present circumstances , an immediate examination and determination of the claim which the court below omitted to decide is called for .", "By virtue of the provisions of Article PERSON of ORG and LAW CARDINAL DATE , proceedings may only be brought in the administrative courts by way of an appeal against a decision . PERSON has not produced any decision that shows that the administrative authority refused to pay it the claimed compensation of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ; it has not even produced a request to the authority for that amount . Accordingly , in the absence of a prior decision , its claim to compensation is inadmissible ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As the second claim had been dismissed on procedural grounds owing to the applicant company 's failure to apply in the first instance to the tax authorities , the applicant company made a further claim for reparation , this time after following the prescribed procedure . To that end , it had sent the Minister of the ORG a claim for reparation comprising CARDINAL limbs on DATE . In the first , it alleged that the ORG was at fault for failing to transpose the Sixth Directive into domestic law within the prescribed period and for continuing to apply a provision of NORP law that no longer complied with Community law . In the second , it argued that the ORG was strictly liable for failing to maintain an equal distribution of public burdens following the issue of the circular of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The claim was rejected by the Minister . An appeal by the applicant company to ORG was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG , sitting as a full court , quashed part of the judgment of ORG . It held that the ORG had been at fault and ordered it to pay the applicant company compensation for its loss in the sum of ORG CARDINAL , being the amount of NORP overpaid , together with compound statutory interest .", "CARDINAL . The main points made by ORG in its judgment were as follows :", "\u201c The principle of ORG liability :", "Under the provisions of the LAW establishing ORG , and in particular LAW thereof , ORG is required to take all appropriate measures to ensure fulfilment of its obligations under LAW . These include an obligation to nullify all the illegal consequences of a violation of Community law either directly or , in default , by providing effective reparation for the resulting damage . It follows that the fact that a taxpayer which alleges that it has been taxed on the basis of a statutory provision that is incompatible with the objectives of a Community directive has first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court , which refused to accept that such incompatibility could serve as a cause of action , can not by itself render inadmissible a claim made by the taxpayer on the basis of the obligations arising under LAW for reparation for the damage it has sustained as a result of a failure to transpose the objectives of the directive into domestic law .", "By Article CARDINAL - a of the Sixth Directive of the Council of the European Economic Communities dated CARDINAL DATE the legislation of member GPE was required from DATE to exempt from value - added tax insurance and reinsurance transactions , including related services performed by insurance brokers and insurance agents . Although the Ninth Directive of DATE , which was notified to ORG on DATE , granted GPE an extension of time \u2013 until DATE in which to transpose the provisions of the Sixth Directive , it is construed by ORG of ORG as having no retroactive effect . Thus , the provisions of LAW as worded prior to DATE requiring payment of value - added tax on insurance broking activities of the type carried on by the PERSON company were for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE incompatible with the objectives set by the Sixth Directive . Accordingly , contrary to ORG decision , the applicant company 's claim that the ORG is liable for the situation that has thus arisen and should be ordered to make good the loss it has sustained as a result of the illegal situation brought about by its being required to pay value - added tax for the above - mentioned period is well - founded .", "Damage :", "In view of the fact that insurance brokers are remunerated on the basis of a percentage calculated by the insurers of the premiums paid by the latter 's customers , the value - added tax paid by the Jacques Dangeville company was not passed on to their customers or invoiced . Thus , the damage for which the company is entitled to claim reparation is equal to the amount of the value - added tax it paid for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and comes to ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The tax authorities appealed to the ORG d'Etat .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its pleading lodged on CARDINAL DATE the applicant company set out the following ground of defence :", "\u201c ... in the instant case the rule that taxpayers should bear the tax burden equally has been contravened by the introduction of measures treating people in the same position differently , since a circular dated DATE purported to rule that insurance brokers who had not paid ORG on their transactions DATE and DATE and had received supplementary tax assessments as a result would no longer be required to pay the sums they continued to owe on that account at the date the circular was published .", "This is a particularly clear breach of the rule that public liabilities must be borne equally . It is also unjust , as it resulted in discrimination between persons liable to ORG , with those who have paid the tax being adversely affected and those who refrained from doing so deriving a benefit . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG d'Etat , sitting as a full court , quashed that judgment and dismissed all the applicant company 's claims . It held that the applicant company was not entitled to seek through an action in damages a remedy it had been refused in tax proceedings in a decision that gave rise to an estoppel by record , namely the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The essence of the ORG d'Etat 's decision was as follows :", "\u201c The documents in the file submitted to ORG show that by a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG d'Etat , acting in its judicial capacity , dismissed a claim by PERSON seeking reimbursement of value - added tax it had paid for the period from DATE to DATE , inter alia , on the ground that its liability to that tax had arisen from the application of statutory provisions that were incompatible with the objectives of the Sixth Directive of the Council of the European Communities of DATE . The claim by ORG which ORG examined in the impugned judgment was for payment of ' compensation ' in an amount equal to the amount of value - added tax that had thus been paid , by way of reparation for the ' damage ' which that tax liability had caused the company to sustain , on the ground that that damage was attributable to ORG delay in transposing the objectives of the Directive into domestic law . It follows that , as submitted by the Minister of the ORG , ORG erred in law in holding that the fact that the company ' [ had ] first referred the issue of taxation to the tax court ' did not render inadmissible a claim for reparation in which the only alleged damage was the damage resulting from the payment of the tax . The Minister of the ORG 's application to have the impugned judgment overturned is accordingly founded to the extent that ORG upheld in part the claims made by PERSON in its submissions ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG d'Etat delivered judgment on an appeal lodged on CARDINAL DATE by ORG against ORG judgment of DATE . The ORG d'Etat did not follow the line it had taken in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the applicant company 's case , but instead declared ORG 's appeal on points of law admissible , holding that the company was entitled to rely on the provisions of the Sixth Directive and should be granted a release from the contested tax liability \u2013 for which there was no statutory basis as the statutory provisions conflicted with the objectives of the Directive \u2013 for the sums erroneously paid for the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government Commissioner lodged submissions that were common to the applicant company 's and ORG 's cases . He pointed out that the factual and legal issues in each were identical , saying :", "\u201c ... [ the file in the case of ORG ] raises the same issue of law as that decided by this court on DATE on the appeal of the PERSON company . The period concerned is the same and the applicable instruments identical . The appellant company , which runs the Revert et ORG firm , has an activity as insurance brokers which is indistinguishable from that of the GPE company ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He added :", "\u201c ... I invite you to quash the judgment of ORG which upheld the GPE company 's claims for compensation . It has been that company 's misfortune to have its tax claim decided too early . I am conscious that the resulting outcome in its case may appear unjust . I am , however , mindful that upholding the judgment in its favour would mean your making an exception to the principles on which your decision - making process is based that would unreasonably undermine the stability of legal situations created by judicial decision . CARDINAL isolated case based , moreover , on transitional difficulties , can not serve to justify making such an exception ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In finding in favour of ORG in its judgment of DATE , the ORG d'Etat held as follows :", "\u201c Firstly , by virtue of LAW DATE the member GPE were required to take appropriate measures by DATE in order to bring their systems of value - added tax in line with the objectives of the Directive . Although the Ninth Directive of DATE , which was notified to ORG on DATE , granted GPE an extension of time \u2013 until DATE in which to transpose the provisions of the Sixth Directive , it is construed by ORG of ORG as having no retroactive effect . Thus , before DATE it was unable to afford the NORP authorities a defence for their failure to enact provisions complying with the objectives of the Sixth Directive on time .", "Further , in so far as they make dealings by insurance brokers liable to value - added tax when the remuneration for them does not take the form of commission or brokerage set by statute or regulations , ORG and CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINALo of LAW , which were enacted by LAW DATE and remained in force until amended by the PERSON of DATE , are not compatible with the objectives of the provisions of sub - paragraph ( a ) of Article CARDINAL of the Sixth Directive , which exempts from value - added tax all insurance and reinsurance transactions performed by insurance brokers or agents . Accordingly , it is to that extent necessary to rule that those provisions of ORG and CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINALo were inapplicable for the period from CARDINAL January to CARDINAL DATE . It follows that the submission by ORG firm , which carries on an activity as insurance brokers , that there was no basis in law for the demand for it to pay value - added tax on its business dealings during the period from DATE to DATE is well - founded .", "However , for the period from DATE to DATE the company is not entitled to rely on the incompatibility of ORG and CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINALo of LAW with the objectives of the provisions of sub - paragraph ( a ) of LAW , as the time - limit by which GPE was required to bring its legislation into line with that Directive was extended to QUANTITY DATE by ORG . Subsequently , the applicant company was rightly charged value - added tax for the period from DATE to DATE on the basis of the provisions of ORG and CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINALo of LAW that remained applicable .", "It follows from the foregoing that the sole valid submission made by ORG firm is that ORG erred in its impugned judgment in dismissing its claim for the periods from DATE and DATE to DATE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
