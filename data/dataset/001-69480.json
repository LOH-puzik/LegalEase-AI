{"ITEMID": "001-69480", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "LATIMER v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant , a former member of ORG ( UDR ) was convicted , along with CARDINAL others , of the murder of PERSON who was killed on DATE .", "The applicant had been arrested on CARDINAL DATE and detained in ORG for DATE . He made admissions on CARDINAL DATE but retracted them on DATE . He made further admissions on DATE . At the conclusion of DATE period , he obtained access to his solicitor for the first time . He retracted his confession again . At his trial , the ORG case comprised his confession evidence , the evidence of PERSON and the evidence of PERSON PERSON gave evidence that she had seen the gunman and described him inter alia as wearing a tartan cap and gold rim glasses , with a light moustache . She said that it was not the applicant , whom she knew as a neighbour . PERSON stated that she had seen the applicant , unusually wearing a tartan cap and gold rim glasses , getting into a ORG with CARDINAL soldiers shortly before the time of the shooting . The applicant challenged the admissibility of his confession evidence . The trial judge found that the confession statements were made freely and voluntarily and that the content came from himself .", "On DATE , ORG in GPE rejected the appeals of the applicant and his co - defendants , agreeing that the confessions had been properly admitted and were reliable accounts of their complicity .", "On DATE , the Secretary of ORG referred the case back to ORG , in particular in view of the availability of ORG ( electrostatic detection apparatus ) readings which showed that the police notes of interviews had been rewritten in CARDINAL places and accordingly were not contemporaneous as claimed at trial", "On DATE , ORG allowed the appeal of the applicant 's co - defendants but dismissed his appeal . It was satisfied from evidence other than that of the officers that the applicant had not made admissions because of threats , promises or improper pressure . It considered in detail the course of the interviews and the evidence of PERSON and PERSON and concluded that it remained satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that PERSON evidence was true , that PERSON was wrong in her assertion that the gunman whom she saw was not the applicant , that his initial detailed and elaborate account of the shooting had been clearly designed to protect the other members of the FAC patrol and that his second written confession on TIME DATE was a \" truthful confession made by a man who realised the game was up \" when confronted with confirmation of witness evidence that he had been seen getting into a landrover in civilian clothes .", "In DATE , the applicant was released from custody .", "On DATE , ORG referred the applicant 's case back to ORG , on the basis of their concerns about a report that the applicant had unusual personality characteristics making him psychologically vulnerable during detention and interrogation ; and fresh evidence that witness A. had a psychiatric history .", "On DATE , after hearing various expert witnesses on the applicant 's personality and PERSON psychological make - up , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . It reviewed the evidence about Mrs A. 's psychological make - up by CARDINAL consultants based on their examination of her medical records ( she had died DATE previously ) and noted that she had been admitted to hospital twice in DATE for periods of DATE against a background , inter alia , of depression and feelings of persecution . It considered that the judge , if faced by the conflicting opinions as to the relevance of this evidence on her reliability as a witness , would have recognised the need for more caution in accepting her evidence as reliable than in the case of most witnesses . However , in light of the circumstances before and at trial , it still did not find her evidence was the product of a desire to seek attention or that she had invented the whole incident in which she recognised the applicant , a person she had known quite well as they had worked together in a factory for DATE .", "As concerned the psychological evidence concerning the applicant , it reviewed the evidence of PERSON for the applicant and PERSON for the ORG . It concluded that the assessment by PERSON concerning his suggestibility and vulnerability was not supported by the applicant 's conduct during the interviews and trial , in particular the course of the interviews , his acceptance at the trial of the confessions and other statements which the police said he made to them and his alleged reasons and explanations for making them .", "Finally , concerning a submission that there had been a violation of LAW and ORG ) as regarded denial of access to a solicitor during his interrogation period , ORG observed that LAW DATE did not apply retrospectively to convictions before it came into force . While PERSON report set out the applicant 's claims that he had asked repeatedly to see a solicitor but that this was refused until he left PERSON for prison , ORG noted that there was no mention of any requests in the custody records and he had not given evidence at trial that he had requested to see a solicitor ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
