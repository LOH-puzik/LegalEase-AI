On DATE Gervaise McKerr was driving a green ORG Escort , registration no . ORG CARDINAL . There were CARDINAL passengers in the car : PERSON and PERSON . None of the men was armed . At FAC , GPE , CARDINAL rounds were fired into the car by police officers of a specially trained mobile support unit of ORG ( ORG ) . All CARDINAL men were killed .", "CARDINAL . The facts relating to the death of Gervaise McKerr remain in dispute despite over DATE of inquest proceedings , CARDINAL criminal prosecutions and other related legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE steps were taken by Chief Inspector PERSON to preserve the scene of the shooting . A doctor attended the scene and conducted a preliminary examination of the bodies . On CARDINAL DATE a forensic expert from ORG conducted a detailed examination of the scene and Professor PERSON carried out post - mortem examinations of the bodies . Photographs were taken of the scene and the bodies , and maps drawn up . On DATE the scene of crimes officer took possession of the police ORG rifles , a submachine gun and pistol . CARDINAL of the cartridges fired at the scene were recovered ( leaving CARDINAL unaccounted for ) . The police made house - to - house enquiries in the vicinity , in conjunction with an appeal in the press for any witnesses to come forward , and a meeting was organised with a local councillor .", "CARDINAL . As part of the investigation , on DATE , Detective Chief Inspector PERSON interviewed CARDINAL ORG officers from the CARDINAL - member mobile support unit . PERSON , PERSON and PERSON made written statements . These statements described the incident but did not mention that the deceased were the subject of surveillance by Special Branch officers and were believed to have set out to commit a murder . The officers had received instructions from the deputy head of Special Branch not to refer to the fact that they were Special Branch officers or that they had intelligence made available to them in advance of the incident . It was later alleged that this was in order to prevent the availability of advance intelligence becoming public knowledge and hampering efforts to fight terrorism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL officers , PERSON , PERSON and NORP , were interviewed again in the light of the available forensic evidence . Written records were made of these interviews .", "CARDINAL . NORP The results of the ORG investigation were sent to ORG ( ORG ) to consider whether any prosecution should be brought . The ORG requested that further inquiries be made . On DATE and DATE the CARDINAL officers were interviewed , and on this occasion they stated that they had been briefed that the CARDINAL deceased were the subject of surveillance and were believed to have set out to commit a murder .", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards , the ORG decided that charges should be brought against these CARDINAL officers ( \u201c the CARDINAL defendants \u201d ) . The indictment was issued on DATE and , as amended on CARDINAL DATE , charged PERSON with the murder of PERSON , and PERSON and NORP with aiding , abetting , counselling and procuring PERSON to commit that offence .", "CARDINAL . The trial of the CARDINAL defendants took place in GPE DATE and DATE before Lord Justice PERSON , sitting without a jury . The prosecution case involved CARDINAL witnesses appearing at the trial to give evidence , while statements from a further CARDINAL witnesses were read out . Over CARDINAL exhibits were submitted in evidence .", "CARDINAL . At the close of the prosecution case Lord Justice PERSON found that the evidence against the CARDINAL defendants did not establish their guilt and , concluding that there was no case to answer , acquitted them . In his judgment giving his reasons for this conclusion , he stated :", "\u201c The accused were tasked to arrest PERSON and PERSON on suspicion of having committed terrorist acts , including murder , and to prevent them carrying out a further murder which the police authorities had reason to believe was about to be attempted .", "Each of the accused was so advised by his superiors and was further informed that the suspects would probably be armed and that they were both dedicated and dangerous terrorists who had let it be known that they would not be arrested alive . If they were arrested therefore it would be known to all concerned that firearms would probably have to be used to effect their arrest .", "The degree of danger of the operation which was anticipated may be judged by the fact that the CARDINAL accused were issued with CARDINAL submachine gun , CARDINAL Ruger rifles , CARDINAL semi - automatic pistols and a total of CARDINAL rounds of ammunition .", "The deceased were under surveillance and according to information received they set off in a car driven by ORG with the object of carrying out the proposed murder . A road block was then set up by the police in order to stop and arrest them .", "They broke through the road block at high speed endangering the life of a police officer in so doing . The accused who were in a car nearby immediately gave chase . Shots were discharged after the escaping car .", "At this point I had to be careful in assessing the evidence to leave out of account any self serving parts of statements made by the accused .", "It was a dark wet DATE TIME and the forensic evidence satisfies me that bullets striking the rear window and other metal parts at the rear of the car would in such conditions emit flashes which could readily be mistaken for the muzzle flashes of guns fired from the back of the car especially after the rear window was broken as it was .", "... I have no doubt that it was a reasonable conclusion that the accused were being fired at . In fact none of the persons escaping did have any firearms but each of the accused opened fire from their car as they travelled at high speed along the Tullygally East Road ...", "I have no doubt that at this stage each of the accused was acting lawfully in shooting at the CARDINAL deceased as being the only practicable means of effecting their arrest and if need be of killing them in order to stop their escape and prevent the perpetration of murder ...", "Quite apart from any question of self defence which may have been raised as a result of the apparent gun flashes from the car , the car , driven by ORG , was driven at high speed . It failed to negotiate a turn to the right to a slip road and it came to a rest a matter of QUANTITY up the slip road just off the left hand verge and on the sloping ground giving a drop of QUANTITY . The car in which the CARDINAL accused were pulled up on the other side of the road . All jumped out .", "Without reference to the statements of the accused and relying exclusively on other ORG evidence it is clear that the passenger door of the car ... opened . The front passenger was PERSON and in the rear seat was PERSON .", "The evidence of [ the forensic expert ] , which I accept , was that the ... experiments which he carried out [ showed that ] the opening of the passenger door from inside produced CARDINAL distinct metallic sounds , the first like the slide of a gun hitting the back blade ; the second like the slide hitting the front blade . These sounds were heard by him distinctly at a distance of QUANTITY .", "The ORG case is that after the door was opened ... some or all of the accused struck PERSON in the back as he stood outside the car killing him instantly . ... the passenger side of the car would have been in shadow . In my view it matters not whether the accused on hearing the noise of the door being opened concluded that this was what was happening or whether they thought that CARDINAL of the occupants of the car was preparing to open fire on them .", "In either event the act of shooting was not murder . In any event the noise established that CARDINAL or more of the occupants was alighting . If the noise was taken to be indicating that the front passenger was preparing to get out of the car that could only be interpreted as an attempt to get down the hill to escape into the country beyond or being an attempt to take up a position behind the car with the intention of opening fire . If on the other hand the noise was taken to be the operation of a gun slide it was unmistakable that a gunman proposed to open fire and immediate retaliatory action was required .", "As seen and understood by the accused the car contained CARDINAL men , CARDINAL murderous gunmen who had not merely given no indication of submission but seemed prepared to shoot it out or at least escape in the dark . In those circumstances to open fire was to my mind the most obvious and only means of self defence and the only step consistent with their duty . Apart from running away it was the only reasonable course open to them .", "It was in my view the use by them of such as was reasonable in the circumstances as appreciated by them , including their understanding of the mortal danger in which they were to effect arrests even though it may be by killing and to prevent the commission of the contemplated murder .", "Their use of gunfire into the car was therefore plainly lawful within the terms of LAW of LAW ( GPE ) DATE as well as being the commensurate force for their own self - defence . ...", "There was no time to my mind to weigh up the possibilities . At all costs and at all possible speed the danger had to be eliminated otherwise the consequences might have been fatal to themselves .", "As I have read the papers and as I understand the evidence there never was the slimmest chance that the ORG could have hoped to secure a conviction . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge concluded with these comments :", "\u201c I speak not of the inevitable concerns and worries of the accused or the additional danger that they are now likely to be in because their identities and appearances have been publicly exposed by this trial . I am thinking of the very widespread effects among other members of the police and indeed of the armed forces generally when a policeman or a soldier is ordered to arrest a dangerous criminal and ... to bring him back . How is he to consider his conduct ?", "DATE it not be that some may now ask \u2018 Am I to risk my life carrying out this order knowing that if I survive my reward will be a further risk of life imprisonment as a murderer\u2019 . One would hope that they will accept the first risk as part of their duty but should they not also be entitled to expect that if they do so they will have the protection of the law unless it should appear with total blindness they may have overstepped the bounds of the criminal law .", "As far as the CARDINAL deceased men who unhappily forfeited their lives are concerned they died not because they were victims of murder but because knowing that CARDINAL of them were wanted by the police on a charge of multiple murder and many other crimes they decided not to stop when confronted by the police and to risk all in an attempt to escape . It was a gamble which failed .", "There is just CARDINAL final observation which I would like to make . ... I want to make clear that having heard the entire ORG case exposed in open court I regard each of the accused as absolutely blameless in this matter .", "I consider that in fairness to them that finding also ought to be recorded together with my commendation for their courage and determination in bringing the CARDINAL deceased men to justice , in this case to the final court of justice . \u201d", "Shortly after giving judgment , Lord Justice PERSON made a statement in open court :", "\u201c Having regard to the widespread publicity which parts of my judgment have received and the observations which have been made upon it in the press and elsewhere , I have considered it desirable to clarify my views on CARDINAL matters .", "First , I would point out that my observations related to the particular circumstances of that occasion and ought not to be read out of context . I would wish most emphatically to repudiate any idea that I would approve or that the law would countenance what has been described as a shoot - to - kill policy on the part of the police .", "Like every other member of the public they have no right , in any circumstances , to use more force than appears to be reasonably necessary having regard to all the circumstances understood by them .", "... I understand that in DATE certain further words of mine have been thought to mean that I was contemplating that the police force might be regarded as entitled to mete out summary justice by means of the bullet .", "I do not believe that on any fair analysis my words were capable of that interpretation . Indeed , nothing was further from my mind , nor would I or any other judge contemplate for a second that such a view was tenable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE there had been CARDINAL further fatal shooting incidents involving the ORG in GPE \u2013 the killing of PERSON and serious wounding of PERSON on DATE , and the killing of PERSON and PERSON on DATE . None of the deceased was armed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG exercised his statutory powers under Article PERSON ) of ORG ( GPE ) Order DATE to request the Chief Constable of the ORG to conduct further investigations into the CARDINAL cases . The Government stated that he did so as it appeared that , in certain statements of evidence , material and important facts had been omitted and matters which were untrue and misleading in material and important respects had been included . He also requested that he be provided with full information about the circumstances in which false and misleading evidence had been provided by any officer of the ORG and an investigation into whether there was evidence to suggest that any person was guilty of an offence of perverting the course of justice or any other offence in connection with the investigation of the CARDINAL shooting incidents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , then Deputy Chief Constable of ORG , was appointed by the Chief Constable of the ORG to carry out the investigation , which was to investigate the circumstances in which certain members of the ORG had provided false or misleading evidence or purported evidence , and to investigate the conduct of members of the ORG in connection with the inquiries into the incidents .", "CARDINAL .

He has concluded that the evidence does not warrant any further prosecution in respect of the shootings which occurred on DATE and CARDINAL DATE and which have already been the subject of prosecutions . ...", "The [ ORG ] has however concluded that there is evidence of the commission of offences of perverting or attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice or of obstructing a constable in the execution of his duty , and that this evidence is sufficient to require consideration of whether prosecutions are required in the public interest and he has consulted me accordingly .", "I have therefore taken steps to acquaint myself with all the relevant circumstances , including matters concerning the public interest and , in particular , considerations of national security that might properly affect the decision whether or not to institute proceedings .", "I have informed the Director fully with regard to my consultations as to the public interest , and in the light of all the facts and information brought to his notice , the [ ORG ] has concluded , with my full agreement , that it would not be proper to institute any criminal proceedings . He has given directions accordingly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL officers were , according to the Government , the subject of disciplinary proceedings , and received admonitions and advice as to their future conduct .", "CARDINAL . In the book PERSON , published by Mr Stalker in DATE , the following descriptions of his investigation into the CARDINAL shooting incidents appeared :", "\u201c The ORG inquiry discovered that the CARDINAL victims of the shooting had been under surveillance for TIME by the police who planned to intercept them at a place different from where the killings occurred . No serious attempt to attract the attention of the driver was made , and no policeman was struck by the car . Immediately after the incident the police officers drove from the scene with their weapons and returned to their base for a debriefing by senior Special Branch Officers . Officers from ORG ( ORG ) were denied access for DATE to the police officers involved and to their car , clothes and weapons for forensic examination . On TIME of the killings , ORG officers were given incorrect information about where the shootings began and part of the forensic examination was conducted in the wrong place . Many cartridge cases of rounds fired were never found . \u201d", "\u201c We believed ... that CARDINAL officer had been in an entirely different position from that which he had claimed to be in when some fatal shots were fired . I also established that the police pursuit took place in a different manner from that described . But most damning of all , DATE after the shooting we found fragments of the bullet that undoubtedly killed the driver still embedded in the car . That crucial evidence had lain undiscovered by the ORG and ORG service ... My conclusion in relation to the missing cartridge cases was that CARDINAL were deliberately removed from the scene . I could only presume that this was in order to mislead the forensic scientists and to hide the true nature and extent of the shooting . \u201d", "\u201c I had to regard the investigation of the matter as slipshod and in some aspects woefully inadequate . I was left with CARDINAL alternative conclusions , either that some ORG detectives were amateur and inefficient at even the most basic of murder investigation routines ; or that they had been deliberately inept . \u201d", "\u201c Even though CARDINAL deaths had occurred over DATE period ... and involved in each case officers from the same specialist squad , no co - ordinated investigation had ever been attempted . It seemed that the investigating officers had never spoken to each other . Worse still , despite the obvious political and public implications , no senior officer had seen fit to draw the reports together . \u201d", "\u201c We had expected a particularly high level of enquiry in view of the nature of the deaths , but this was shamefully absent . The files were little more than a collection of statements , apparently prepared for a coroner \u2019s enquiry . They bore no resemblance to my idea of a murder prosecution file . Even on the most cursory of readings I could see clearly why the prosecutions had failed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to ORG DATE , Mr Stalker also stated :", "\u201c I never did find evidence of a shoot - to - kill policy as such . There was no written instruction , nothing pinned up on a noticeboard . But there was a clear understanding on the part of the men whose job it was to pull the trigger that that was what was expected of them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG issued a response to the book by PERSON . It stated in its introduction that the book contained many inaccuracies and distortions and gave a misleading impression . Their document aimed to highlight a selected number of misrepresentations . It was stated , in contradiction to Mr PERSON \u2019s assertions , that it was wrong to allege that the CARDINAL investigations were carried out under different detectives as the same detective superintendent was in charge of CARDINAL of the investigations ; that the investigation files were presented to the ORG in the format approved by him ; that it was already established in a police statement of CARDINAL DATE that no police officer had been struck by the car driven by PERSON ; that it had been advisable , for the safety of the CARDINAL officers , that they leave the scene immediately ; that their weapons had been seized without delay by the scene of crimes officers ; that no incorrect information was given to the investigating officers concerning where the shooting occurred , although uniformed officers had mistakenly positioned the tape on the junction and it was repositioned accurately shortly afterwards ; it was accepted that all the cartridges were not recovered but due to the torrential rain at the time some could have been washed down the drains ; the area had nonetheless been swept over for DATE with metal detectors .", "Criticisms were also made that Mr Stalker had gone outside his remit to reinvestigate the shooting incidents as well as a terrorist incident on CARDINAL DATE in which QUANTITY police officers had been killed and that his report , when submitted , lacked the clarity and precision normally associated with criminal investigations .", "CARDINAL . The Government have also submitted that on DATE Mr PERSON , on the occasion of his withdrawal of a libel action against the RUC Chief Constable , made a statement in which he took the opportunity to submit publicly that he was satisfied that the ORG had not pursued a shoot- to - kill policy in DATE and that the ORG Chief Constable had not condoned or authorised any deliberate or reckless killings by his officers .

In the case of NORP v. the ORG and Others , ex parte PERSON , ORG on DATE quashed a decision not to prosecute for alleged gross negligence causing a death in dock unloading on the basis that the reasons given by the ORG \u2013 that the evidence was not sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of satisfying a jury DATE required further explanation .", "CARDINAL . R. v. ORG , ex parte PERSON and PERSON ( decision of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ) , concerned the ORG \u2019s decision not to prosecute any prison officer for manslaughter in respect of the death of a prisoner , although the inquest jury had reached a verdict of unlawful death DATE there was evidence that prison officers had used a neck lock which was forbidden and dangerous . The ORG reviewing the case still concluded that the ORG would be unable to establish manslaughter from gross negligence . The Lord Chief Justice noted :", "\u201c ORG makes clear that a decision by the Director not to prosecute is susceptible to judicial review : see , for example , NORP v. Director of Public Prosecutions , ex parte C [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . PERSON . But , as the decided cases also make clear , the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised . The reasons for this are clear . The primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by ORG to the Director as head of an independent , professional prosecuting service , answerable to the Attorney General in his role as guardian of the public interest , and to CARDINAL else . It makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the ORG , as it was here , and not by the Director personally . In any borderline case the decision may be CARDINAL of acute difficulty , since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried , a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial . If , in a case such as the present , the Director \u2019s provisional decision is not to prosecute , that decision will be subject to review by Senior ORG Counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment . The Director and his officials ( and Senior ORG Counsel when consulted ) will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match . In most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant , if brought , would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before ( in a serious case such as this ) a jury . This exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength , by the end of the trial , of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences . It will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment on such matters as wrong even if one disagrees with it . So the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law , on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere . At the same time , the standard of review should not be set too high , since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied . \u201d", "As regards whether the ORG had a duty to give reasons , the Lord Chief Justice said :", "\u201c It is not contended that the Director is subject to an obligation to give reasons in every case in which he decides not to prosecute . Even in the small and very narrowly defined cases which meet PERSON conditions set out above , we do not understand domestic law or the jurisprudence of ORG to impose an absolute and unqualified obligation to give reasons for a decision not to prosecute . But the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights . It is put at the forefront of the LAW . The power to derogate from it is very limited . The death of a person in the custody of the ORG must always arouse concern , as recognised by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) , ( CARDINAL)(b ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Coroner \u2019s Act DATE , and if the death resulted from violence inflicted by agents of the ORG that concern must be profound . The holding of an inquest in public by an independent judicial official , the coroner , in which interested parties are able to participate must in our view be regarded as a full and effective inquiry ( see ORG v. GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) . Where such an inquest following a proper direction to the jury culminates in a lawful verdict of unlawful killing implicating a person who , although not named in the verdict , is clearly identified , who is living and whose whereabouts are known , the ordinary expectation would naturally be that a prosecution would follow . In the absence of compelling grounds for not giving reasons , we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case : to meet the reasonable expectation of interested parties that either a prosecution would follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given , to vindicate the Director \u2019s decision by showing that solid grounds exist for what might otherwise appear to be a surprising or even inexplicable decision and to meet ORG expectation that if a prosecution is not to follow a plausible explanation will be given . We would be very surprised if such a general practice were not welcome to Members of ORG whose constituents have died in such circumstances . We readily accept that such reasons would have to be drawn with care and skill so as to respect third party and public interests and avoid undue prejudice to those who would have no opportunity to defend themselves . We also accept that time and skill would be needed to prepare a summary which was reasonably brief but did not distort the true basis of the decision . But the number of cases which meet PERSON conditions is very small ( we were told that since DATE , including deaths in police custody , there have been CARDINAL such cases ) , and the time and expense involved could scarcely be greater than that involved in resisting an application for judicial review . In any event it would seem to be wrong in principle to require the citizen to make a complaint of unlawfulness against the Director in order to obtain a response which good administrative practice would in the ordinary course require . \u201d", "On this basis , the court reviewed whether the reasons given by the ORG in that case were in accordance with the Code for ORG Prosecutors and capable of supporting a decision not to prosecute . It found that the decision had failed to take relevant matters into account and that this vitiated the decision not to prosecute . The decision was quashed and the ORG was required to reconsider his decision whether or not to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in the case of an application by PERSON for judicial review , ORG in GPE considered the applicant \u2019s claim that the ORG had failed to give adequate and intelligible reasons for his decision not to prosecute any police officer concerned in the arrest during which he had suffered serious injuries and for which in civil proceedings he had obtained an award of damages against the police . It noted that there was no statutory obligation on the ORG under the DATE Order to give reasons and considered that no duty to give reasons could be implied . The fact that the ORG in GPE and GPE had in a number of cases furnished detailed reasons , whether from increasing concern for transparency or in the interests of the victim \u2019s families , was a matter for his discretion . It concluded on the basis of authorities that only in exceptional cases such as the PERSON case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) would the ORG be required to furnish reasons to a victim for failing to prosecute and that review should be limited to where the principles identified by Lord Justice PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were infringed . Notwithstanding the findings in the civil case , it was not persuaded that the ORG had acted in such an aberrant , inexplicable or irrational manner that the case cried out for reasons to be furnished as to why he had so acted .", "CARDINAL .

In the report on its visit to GPE and GPE from DATE , published on DATE , ORG for the Prevention of Torture ( ORG ) reviewed the system of preferring criminal and disciplinary charges against police officers accused of ill - treatment .

In the view of the ORG , the creation of a fully - fledged independent investigating agency would be a most welcome development . Such a body should certainly , like the ORG , have the power to direct that disciplinary proceedings be instigated against police officers . Further , in the interests of bolstering public confidence , it might also be thought appropriate that such a body be invested with the power to remit a case directly to the ORG [ ORG ] for consideration of whether or not criminal proceedings should be brought .", "In any event , the ORG recommends that the role of the \u2018 chief officer\u2019 within the existing system be reviewed . To take the example of CARDINAL ORG officer to whom certain of the chief officer \u2019s functions have been delegated ( the Director of the FAC [ Criminal Investigations Bureau ] ) , he is currently expected to : seek dispensations from the ORG ; appoint investigating police officers and assume managerial responsibility for their work ; determine whether an investigating officer \u2019s report indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed ; decide whether to bring disciplinary proceedings against a police officer on the basis of an investigating officer \u2019s report , and liaise with the ORG on this question ; determine which disciplinary charges should be brought against an officer who is to face charges ; in civil cases , negotiate settlement strategies and authorise payments into court . It is doubtful whether it is realistic to expect any single official to be able to perform all of these functions in an entirely independent and impartial way .", "CARDINAL . ... Reference should also be made to the high degree of public interest in ORG decisions regarding the prosecution of police officers ( especially in cases involving allegations of serious misconduct ) . Confidence about the manner in which such decisions are reached would certainly be strengthened were the ORG to be obliged to give detailed reasons in cases where it was decided that no criminal proceedings should be brought .
