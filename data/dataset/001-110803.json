The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived at GPE airport and applied for asylum .", "CARDINAL . During the asylum proceedings , the applicant was heard on CARDINAL DATE and DATE , and on DATE . In the course of those interviews he submitted that he was a member of the political party ORG ( ORG ) , which was at the time an opposition party in GPE . In DATE , he was attacked by soldiers and members of the ruling party of GPE and thereupon fled to GPE , where he stayed until DATE . He then returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , areas of GPE were flooded and the applicant and his family lost their house and their possessions . They thus moved to a camp for flood victims . The applicant claimed that relief items sent by international organisations were unequally distributed in the camp , which was why he and a group of other young members of the ORG criticised the distribution methods and attempted to distribute the goods themselves . However , soldiers threatened the applicant by saying , inter alia , that after the DATE elections , the applicant and other ORG party members \u201c would see what would happen . \u201d This was the reason why the applicant decided to leave GPE and fled to LOC .", "CARDINAL . When making further statements on DATE , the authorities told the applicant that since the DATE elections , the ORG held CARDINAL seats in the NORP parliament . The applicant replied that he was aware of this . When asked who exactly had persecuted him , he repeated that during his stay in the camp for flood victims , he and other members of the ORG had organized demonstrations to demand fair distribution of the relief supplies , as some members of the ORG had not received any of the food donations . On CARDINAL or DATE the police came to the camp and told them they \u201c would see what would happen \u201d . The applicant left the camp on DATE and stayed with a friend in PERSON for DATE . Subsequently , he went on to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he was afraid that upon his return , the police would kill him because of his membership of the ORG . To the asylum authorities\u2019 reminder that the ORG was now an active and official part of the government , the applicant replied that the de facto regime of DATE was still in power and that there was no democracy in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request for asylum and subsidiary protection and ordered his expulsion to GPE . It held that the fear of persecution described by the applicant was not credible and that the applicant \u2019s story seemed to have been fabricated around real events . In the event of his return the applicant would not face a real risk of a violation of ORG or CARDINAL or of Protocols Nos . CARDINAL or DATE to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . With reference to the relevant country reports , ORG stated that on DATE , parliamentary elections were held in GPE in which the former president \u2019s party , RPT , won CARDINAL seats , the UFC CARDINAL seats and the party of the former prime minister , CAR , CARDINAL seats in parliament . Despite the elections having been described as generally fair and free , PERSON could not yet be considered a representative democracy . The DATE presidential elections were considered rigged and had been accompanied by severe outbursts of violence . With regard to respect for human rights in GPE , ORG held that although the situation had improved slightly , serious violations of human rights persisted , such as inhuman treatment of prisoners , impunity for illegal acts committed by the authorities , arbitrary arrests , prolonged detention pending trial , and similar . Freedom of opinion , freedom of the press and freedom of assembly were not generally respected . No violence on the part of state organs or government forces against opposition members had been recorded since DATE . Opposition parties , media , associations of civil society and religious faiths were free to act .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the applicant \u2019s arguments , ORG held that while the applicant \u2019s account of the flood and the tensions with the security forces in the camp were credible , the alleged threats by the police and the resulting fear of the applicant were not , and the fact that the police had apparently not used violence against the inhabitants of the camp was in contradiction with the applicant \u2019s statements . Furthermore , since the DATE parliamentary elections the ORG had held CARDINAL seats in parliament . Lastly , according to ORG information , returned asylum seekers had not been subjected to systematic persecution . Therefore , the authority concluded that the applicant \u2019s claim for asylum was based on a fabricated story and that he had only submitted speculations on what could happen to him upon his return to GPE , and provided no indication of actual persecution against him on grounds recognized in LAW DATE United Nations Convention Relating to LAW . ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s application for subsidiary protection , holding that he would not be exposed to a risk of persecution if returned .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and complained that he had been informed that it was not possible for the authority to collect CARDINAL different pieces of evidence and had refused to take all the evidence the applicant had put forward . He had also had difficulty understanding the interpreter properly and was never given a chance to tell his story , as he had only been asked questions to which he could answer \u201c yes \u201d or \u201c no \u201d . Thus , the authority should not be allowed to claim that the applicant \u2019s account was too vague and unsubstantiated , as it had never given him the opportunity to substantiate his story . The applicant claimed that due to a translation error , it was not recorded that he had been beaten up by the police several times after he had participated in demonstrations in the wake of the DATE presidential elections . In addition , the fact that he had fled to GPE and stayed there until DATE had not been taken into account , and nor had the fact that the police had searched for him several times . The applicant had also been beaten up together with the other protestors when they had organised a demonstration in the camp for flood victims . He stated that even though the ORG was represented in parliament , regular ORG members were still subject to persecution , and in the event of his return to GPE , the authorities would \u201c make him disappear \u201d and probably kill him .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) held a hearing on DATE . The applicant submitted a ORG membership card and confirmation that he had been an active member and had returned to GPE on DATE after having fled to GPE . He also provided a newspaper article from the paper \u201c Express \u201d of DATE , according to which his cousin \u2019s whereabouts after having been arrested were unknown , and the police were also looking for the applicant on account of his involvement in the demonstrations in the camp for victims of the floods in DATE and DATE . Finally , the applicant submitted a newspaper article about a protest march in DATE during which protestors were ill - treated by state forces .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the hearing , the ORG emphasised contradictions in the applicant \u2019s statement , for example , in relation to his school education , which he had allegedly followed until DATE in GPE , although he claimed to have fled to GPE in DATE . The applicant replied that he had spent DATE in GPE to go to school , but the weekends in GPE for safety reasons and to avoid arrest in GPE . The ORG also noted that the applicant had at CARDINAL point stated that he had never been beaten up by the police , only verbally threatened , whereas he had then claimed to have been beaten up by the police in the course of the demonstrations in the camp for flood victims . The applicant referred to language problems in the drafting of his appeal to ORG . He repeated that he had never been beaten up by the police , but that they had wanted to arrest him because of the demonstrations about the unfair distribution of food in the camp . He had fled on DATE , after the soldiers had threatened to arrest him and the other demonstrators . The applicant also mentioned that another organizer of the demonstrations , PERSON , had in the meantime been granted asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for asylum or subsidiary protection , and ordered his expulsion to GPE . It held that the applicant \u2019s claims were not credible , and the contradictions in his statements were not \u2013 as the applicant had claimed DATE due to translation errors . It stated that the newspaper article from the paper \u201c Express \u201d appeared to be a fake which had been paid for , as it was not probable that DATE after the demonstrations in the camp a newspaper would still publish such a story . In addition , the statement of the ORG according to which the applicant had fled GPE and only returned in DATE was in contradiction with his statements that he had returned at DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) against that decision and applied for suspensive effect , which was granted on DATE . However , on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid and refused to deal with the complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for the proceedings to be re - opened ( PERSON des PERSON ) , submitting a newspaper article from the paper \u201c FAC \u201d dated DATE which stated that due to the demonstrations in the camps , a clash between the police and a group of young people \u2013 among which the applicant was mentioned by name \u2013 had occurred . He also submitted other documents and a \u201c verification report \u201d in relation to the authenticity of the newspaper article from \u201c ORG \u201d , which had been drawn up in the course of ORG \u2019s asylum proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the re - opening of the asylum proceedings . With regard to the newspaper article from \u201c FAC \u201d , it found that it was unlikely that a newspaper would report on events about food distribution in a camp for flood victims DATE after that occurrence . Furthermore , it was well known to the court that such articles could be easily bought in GPE and that the applicant had only presented the print - out of an internet download of the page , which was again an indication of it being a falsification . This conclusion could not be altered by the \u201c verification report \u201d , which was not a reliable source for establishing the authenticity of the article and any resulting danger of persecution for the applicant , especially taking into consideration that it had not been drawn up in the course of the applicant \u2019s proceedings , but for entirely different proceedings . Even if the article from \u201c FAC \u201d were considered evidence to support the applicant \u2019s story , it alone was not enough to outweigh all the other remaining inconsistencies in his account presented in the former proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for legal aid to lodge a complaint against that decision . However , on DATE , ORG rejected the application for legal aid due to lack of the application \u2019s prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an application and a request for an interim measure under Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of the ORG to stay his expulsion to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the President of the Section granted the request for an interim measure and asked the Government to inform the ORG as to the exact content of the documents and the \u201c verification report \u201d submitted by the applicant in the proceedings for the re - opening of his asylum claim . Furthermore , if the document was public , the ORG was asked to submit the \u201c verification report \u201d to the ORG . Finally , they were requested to explain to what extent that report was relevant to the granting of asylum to GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government confirmed that the \u201c verification report \u201d had been commissioned by the NORP authorities in the course of GPE \u2019s asylum proceedings to verify the authenticity of the same article from \u201c FAC \u201d , which had been submitted in GPE \u2019s asylum proceedings and which also featured ORG full name , as it did the applicant \u2019s , in the context of the demonstrations in the camp for flood victims in relation to problems with the distribution of relief items . However , the Government emphasised that neither the authenticity of the article nor the chief editor \u2019s information on the extensive research done for the article could prove that the events were relevant to the applicant \u2019s asylum status . The Government further stated that the \u201c verification report \u201d was not public and that it did not concern the applicant . Therefore , reasons of data protection prevented the Government from submitting the whole report . With regard to the importance given to the article and the \u201c verification report \u201d in PERSON \u2019s asylum proceedings , the ORG submitted that the finding that the article was authentic carried no more weight in those asylum proceedings than other evidence , and that it had been considered together with all the other evidence in GPE \u2019s proceedings without taking any precedence .", "CARDINAL . M.A. was interviewed for the first time by ORG on DATE . He stated there that because of the flood in DATE , his family had lost their house and moved to a camp for flood victims . In the camp , relief items were distributed by soldiers and social workers ; however , they did not allow him and his friends to help with the distribution , called them \u201c members of the opposition \u201d and threatened them by stating \u201c you will see what will happen to you \u201d . PERSON was again interviewed on DATE . Asked to freely narrate his reasons for fleeing his country , he added that at the camp for flood victims , only supporters of the ruling government had had access to the relief items , whereas other groups of people and PERSON himself had not . Several families had protested against those practices and eventually ORG had organised demonstrations against the way relief items were distributed in the camp . As a result , the police had come , beaten them up and prohibited any further demonstrations . Police and security services had accused ORG and his followers of causing disturbances in the camp and uttered their threats . PERSON had told the story to a member of the ORG , who had helped him to leave the country . PERSON further claimed that he had also been persecuted by the military in DATE in the course of the presidential elections and the ensuing violent protests . Soldiers had come to his house several times , but he had never been there . He had also failed to comply with a number of summonses , but had left for GPE and stayed there until DATE . He had returned to ORG in DATE and had not had any problems with the authorities until the events in the camp for flood victims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG granted PERSON asylum in GPE . The decision did not elaborate on the reasons for granting him asylum in any depth . Referring to unspecified evidence in the file , the authority concluded that ORG submissions concerning the reasons for his fear of persecution , taken in conjunction with the results of investigations conducted by it , were credible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an NORP amendment statute repealed the possibility to lodge a complaint against a second - instance decision in asylum matters with ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE , Article CARDINALc of ORG had provided the possibility for decisions taken in asylum matters in the first instance to be appealed against in the form of a complaint with ORG ( PERSON ) . To appeal against decisions taken by ORG , an applicant had the option of lodging a complaint with ORG and/or with ORG .", "CARDINAL . After the entry into force on DATE of the amending statute in asylum matters , which established ORG and repealed the PERSON on ORG , it was no longer possible to lodge a complaint with ORG due to lack of jurisdiction : since DATE , ORG has decided upon appeals brought against decisions taken in asylum matters in the first instance . As concerns the possibility to lodge a complaint against a decision by ORG , Article CARDINAL no.CARDINAL of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL . The following matters are excluded from the jurisdiction of ORG :", "CARDINAL . matters pertaining to the jurisdiction of ORG ;", "..... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The new Article CARDINALa of LAW concerning jurisdiction of ORG now reads DATE after the entry into force of the amending statute DATE as follows :", "\u201c Article CARDINALa . ( CARDINAL ) . The Constitutional Court shall decide on complaints against decisions of ORG where the appellant alleges an infringement of a constitutionally guaranteed right by such decision ... .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG may decline to deal with a complaint ... if it has no reasonable prospects of success or if the decision is not expected to clarify a constitutional problem . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In sum , NORP asylum procedure includes the possibility of lodging a full appeal with ORG against a decision taken by ORG . Since DATE , ORG has no longer had jurisdiction over a complaint lodged against a decision by ORG . However , an asylum seeker can still lodge a complaint with ORG alleging a violation of a right guaranteed under LAW .", "CARDINAL . In GPE ORG has the status of a constitutional law ( ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of ORG provides that a decision rendered by an administrative authority must only be reasoned if the party \u2019s arguments were not fully adhered to .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) updated his information on the international protection needs of asylum seekers from GPE . It referred to its position paper dated DATE in which it had urged , inter alia , a moratorium on forced returns in the light of the precariousness of the security situation in GPE following an outburst of human rights violations in the aftermath of the presidential elections of DATE . In DATE since , the report found that the situation in GPE had stabilised and in a number of ways improved . Reports of kidnappings and killings at TIME continued to be received but in substantially diminished numbers . There had been no fresh outbreaks of widespread violence . According to ORG and diplomatic sources , the NORP government evinced a genuine intention to resolve issues with the political opposition in the country , although this intention had not yet translated into meaningful reform . However , ORG reported on the complete impunity in GPE for the perpetrators of the outbursts of violence in DATE . The ORG for its part acknowledged the difficulties balancing the desire for reconciliation and for justice and referred to a general amnesty announced by the NORP Prime Minister , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further referred to an avowed reluctance of many refugees to return to GPE , which was considered to be due in part to the lack of independent and reliable information on the treatment of individuals who had returned to GPE . It concluded that there was insufficient and contradictory information on the treatment of returnees to GPE to allow for a determination of the issue .", "CARDINAL . Based on the above conclusions , the ORG amended its position of DATE in respect to the international protection needs of NORP asylum seekers and urged host countries to consider every asylum claim on the basis of their individual merits and pursuant to the requirements of the DATE ORG Individuals already recognized as refugees should for the time being retain their status . For individuals found not to be in need of international protection following the determination of their claims in fair and efficient proceedings including a right of appeal , ORG did not object to their return to GPE . Host PERSON obligations under the principle of non - refoulement under application of human rights law remained unaffected and compelling humanitarian reasons were to be given due consideration .", "CARDINAL . Following an application by a NORP refugee in asylum proceedings in GPE , the organization ORG created a report in DATE about the current situation of members of the opposition party ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The UFC participated for the first time in the parliamentary elections on DATE . Pursuant to international observers , those elections took place peacefully and in an orderly fashion . The governing party ORG won CARDINAL of the CARDINAL seats of the NORP parliament and the ORG , as the strongest opposition party , won CARDINAL seats . The UFC contested the election results and claimed forged ballots . The independent national election commission , ORG , noted that CARDINAL of CARDINAL ballot boxes were not correctly sealed . However , ORG finally confirmed the election results .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report confirmed that from DATE the Government had bowed to international pressure and tried increasingly to re - establish national dialogue among the government , the opposition and representatives of civil society , since such a dialogue was a condition for the re - instatement of economic cooperation with ORG . High - level members of the opposition were considered to be safe in view of the NORP government \u2019s own interest in international approval of the democratisation process in the country and the ensuing economic consequences . However , the situation was different for opposition activists who had no public standing , and for \u201c simple \u201d members who went on protest marches and became entangled in skirmishes with the military . An [ unnamed ] expert on NORP affairs was quoted as saying that those opposition members were still being secretly arrested , threatened and tortured , but that their stories would never be heard by the broader public .", "CARDINAL . Freedom of speech was still not guaranteed in GPE , a fact which was illustrated by the dissolution by use of teargas of a peaceful march organised by the ORG to mark the CARDINALth Independence Day on DATE . It was unclear if demonstrators had also been arrested at the march .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report concluded that ORG members of low public profile could still be victims of reprisals in GPE upon their return . Returnees from LOC were furthermore viewed with more suspicion than returnees from GPE or GPE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life , disappearances and torture in GPE , the report referred to several notifications that the government or its agents had committed arbitrary or unlawful killings during DATE . ORG had reported that several people had died in detention in DATE \u201c probably as a result of torture or other ill - treatment \u201d . In DATE , a ORG special rapporteur found evidence that police and gendarmes abused detainees during interrogation , guards beat prisoners and young persons and children were at risk of corporal punishment while in detention . Impunity for such actions remained a problem .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the RPT candidate PERSON was re - elected as president with PERCENT of votes cast . International and national observers monitoring that election declared it generally free , fair , transparent and peaceful . The government arrested and held CARDINAL political detainees in connection with the presidential election , but denied that fact in public . As of DATE , according to ORG and ORG all CARDINAL detainees were released . None of those political prisoners had been mistreated .", "CARDINAL . Following the DATE elections , the ORG split into CARDINAL factions , CARDINAL led by PERSON , presidential candidate , and the other led by ORG president PERSON , who agreed to join the ruling RPT . As a result of an agreement between PERSON and the government , CARDINAL ORG ministers joined the presidential cabinet . As a result of internal rivalries in the ORG , the government banned the ORG DATE marches , justifying the action on the grounds that PERSON was no longer the lawful leader or the voice of the party .", "CARDINAL . Even though freedom of speech and of the press and freedom of assembly were guaranteed by the law and the constitution , the government continued to restrict those rights ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
