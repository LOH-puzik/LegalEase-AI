POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are : PERSON , born in DATE , living in GPE , and Mr PERSON , born in DATE , PERSON , born in DATE and PERSON , born in DATE , all CARDINAL living in GPE .", "They were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG , GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants\u2019 grandfather ORG owned a house in ORG that had been divided into flats . He survived the Holocaust and in DATE left GPE , having appointed PERSON as a representative for the purposes of managing the property . They remained in constant contact and PERSON \u2013 and subsequently his wife \u2013 kept the applicants\u2019 grandfather informed about the situation and financial affairs of the property until his death in DATE .", "In DATE the local municipality in ORG took over the management of the house , having stated in the relevant decision that the property had not been managed and supervised by its owner at all since DATE and that , as a result , it was in a bad state of repair . This decision was served on PERSON , the widow of the late manager of the property , PERSON , who subsequently stayed in touch with the applicants .", "In DATE ORG requested ORG to declare that it had acquired ownership of the property by way of adverse possession . The court accepted the claimant \u2019s submission that the owner was at that time of unknown abode and appointed a guardian ad litem for the ORG grandfather .", "On DATE the court allowed ORG request . No written grounds were prepared for that decision , as the court was obliged to prepare such grounds only if a judicial decision was being appealed against . Accordingly , ORG became owner of the property .", "On an unspecified later date , but in any case before DATE , an entry in the land register was made to confirm the ORG \u2019s ownership of the property concerned .", "In DATE ORG ownership of land was transferred to local municipalities as part of a countrywide legal reform of local government . Accordingly , the ORG municipality took over the rights to land within its borders that had previously been owned by ORG .", "In DATE the applicants obtained decisions from various NORP courts to the effect that they were the legal successors of their grandfather PERSON", "In DATE the applicants requested that the proceedings concerning the acquisition of ownership by adverse possession that had ended with the DATE decision be reopened . They argued that these proceedings were invalid in law since they had been flawed as a result of serious procedural shortcomings . The court had appointed a guardian ad litem for their father , which was obviously incorrect as he had died in DATE and no guardian ad litem could be appointed in respect of a deceased person . Further , the court had failed to publish an announcement about the guardian having been appointed for the applicants\u2019 grandfather , which resulted in the proceedings being invalid in law as it thereby became impossible for the parties to have their rights properly represented in the proceedings .", "Their request was eventually dismissed on DATE , the appellate court having upheld the lower court \u2019s conclusion that the applicants had failed to submit their request within the DATE time - limit from CARDINAL DATE , the date on which they had learned about the DATE decision .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG brought an appeal on points of law against the DATE decision on the applicants\u2019 behalf . The Minister argued that the decision should be quashed for the following reasons :", "i ) in the proceedings the court had failed to take into consideration that the property had not in fact been abandoned by the owner but had been managed , at least until DATE , by his representative , who had been validly appointed in DATE ;", "ii ) the claimant had failed to disclose to the court the fact that in DATE the defendant had been alive , and that it was not true that at that time it had been impossible to get in touch with him ;", "iii ) this failure had a direct incidence on the finding that ORG had been in de facto possession of the property for the period required by law for adverse possession ;", "iv ) the court had erred in that it had appointed a guardian ad litem for a person who was dead at that time ;", "v ) in the DATE decision the court had failed to indicate a ) DATE from which the ORG had acquired ownership by adverse possession , b ) whether it had regarded the ORG as being in possession in bad or in good faith and c ) how it had calculated the period of adverse possession necessary for the acquisition of ownership by adverse possession .", "Following the appeal , on DATE ORG quashed the DATE decision , invalidated the proceedings which had led to it and ordered that the ORG \u2019s request for a declaration that it had acquired the ownership by adverse possession be re - examined . ORG shared the view of the Minister of Justice concerning the error that the court had committed in appointing a guardian ad litem for a person who was dead . It observed that , contrary to the relevant legal obligation , no press announcement had been made about the proceedings having been instituted . Importantly , the court had also failed to make any effort to establish the whereabouts of the former owner or his legal successors .", "ORG further noted that when giving the DATE decision the court had failed to make findings crucial for the legal assessment of the case , such as the determination of DATE of possession , the manner of its calculation and the legal basis for considering that the ORG had been in possession of the property in question cum animo rem sibi habendi .", "ORG did not pronounce on the Minister \u2019s submission that the ORG \u2019s representatives had failed to disclose to the court in DATE certain relevant information regarding the status of the property .", "Subsequently , the proceedings concerning the ORG \u2019s original request for a declaration that it had acquired the property through adverse possession were resumed . In these proceedings the applicants submitted that because of all the procedural shortcomings identified by ORG , the ORG should be considered to have acquired ownership in bad faith . Under the relevant law , the period necessary at that time for acquisition of ownership through adverse possession where there was bad faith was DATE . This period could only be calculated as running , at the earliest , from DATE . Hence , it had not ended by the date on which the present set of proceedings was already pending , the running of the period of adverse possession having been interrupted by the appeal lodged on the applicants\u2019 behalf by the Minister .", "On DATE ORG held that ORG had acquired ownership of the property through adverse possession on DATE . The court noted that CARDINAL conditions had to be fulfilled for such acquisition to be effective : CARDINAL ) the property had to be in the possession of the claimant acting cum animo rem sibi habendi and CARDINAL ) the statutory period of possession had to have expired .", "The court found that the period DATE could not be taken into account as regards adverse possession of the property since during this period the ORG had been acting only as its manager . However , as from DATE , the date on which the decision of CARDINAL DATE had become final , the ORG had to be regarded as being in possession of the property \u201c like a property owner \u201d ( cum animo rem sibi habendi ) . The DATE decision authorised the ORG to dispose of the property , even if the decision itself had been procedurally flawed .", "ORG further found that the DATE decision had justified the ORG \u2019s assertion that it had become the owner of the property concerned . Accordingly , on DATE the ORG had obtained possession in good faith since that possession had arisen from a valid judicial decision . The period of adverse possession required by law in case of good faith was DATE .", "ORG further noted that the point in dispute was whether ORG could count towards the period of adverse possession required for acquisition of the property the period of its occupation arising from a judicial decision which had been quashed after the period of adverse possession had expired . That question was answered in the affirmative by ORG in the ORG of DATE , no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and ORG applied that conclusion to the present case . Accordingly , the period of adverse possession in good faith having come to end on DATE , it was on that date that the ORG had acquired title to the property concerned .", "The applicants appealed . They submitted that the lower court had erred in holding that the claimant had acquired title through adverse possession in the absence of good faith and of the requisite character of possession ( cum animo rem sibi habendi ) .", "It was wrong , in their view , to disregard DATE decision since the ORG had come into possession of the property when it had taken over its management in DATE . That coming into possession had been unjustified , and thus in bad faith , since the owner \u2019s representatives had at the relevant time duly managed the property . ORG had continued to manifest its bad faith by withholding relevant information from the court when making its application in DATE .", "The applicants contested the argument that the ORG could be regarded as being in possession in good faith as a result of the DATE decision having become final . Having regard to the circumstances in which the ORG had taken over the management of the property in DATE , they argued that after DATE the ORG had simply continued to manage the property . Thus , its possession could not be regarded as possession cum animo rem sibi habendi . Furthermore , the ORG could not benefit from the DATE decision because that decision had been rendered in proceedings in which the applicants DATE as a result of the ORG \u2019s actions \u2013 had been deprived of any possibility to defend their interests . If the court were to hold otherwise , the very concept of good faith would be undermined .", "The applicants also argued , referring to ORG Resolution of DATE , that it was necessary to consider whether the State authorities\u2019 actions had led to the deprivation of their property . They disagreed with the automatic conclusion that since the possession had arisen from a judicial decision it would always have to be considered possession in good faith .", "On DATE ORG dismissed their appeal as unfounded . It analysed in detail all the arguments raised in the appeal .", "ORG firstly noted that , contrary to the ORG assertion , it was not necessary to determine the circumstances relating to the ORG \u2019s taking over the management of the property in DATE since the ORG \u2019s rights stemming from an administrative decision on management could not be considered as possession cum animo rem sibi habendi . This view had been expressed by ORG in its decision of DATE .", "ORG stressed that the date of the decision on acquisition of title by adverse possession , and in particular the date on which this decision had become final , was of crucial relevance for the calculation of the period of adverse possession . It was from DATE that the claimant ( the ORG ) had obtained a judicial decision declaring that it had become the owner of the property concerned . It noted that ORG Resolution of DATE , no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL allowed ORG to count towards the period of adverse possession the period throughout which the ORG had exercised the right to dispose of the property \u201c like a property owner \u201d on the basis of a judicial decision which was quashed after the period of adverse possession had expired . In the present case the court was dealing with precisely such a situation .", "ORG observed that that situation was different from the CARDINAL which was analysed in ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , no . III CKU CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( published in OSNC CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which ORG had held that :", "\u201c if ORG right to dispose of a property \u201c like a property owner \u201d is based on an administrative decision which is subsequently set aside with retrospective effect ( ex tunc ) on account of a manifest mistake of law , then ORG may not take into account the fact and period of such occupation when calculating the period of adverse possession referred to in LAW \u201d .", "ORG noted , however , that as ORG had underlined in its ORG no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and by contrast to the above situation , adjudication by civil courts did not amount to ORG sovereign interference in private - law relations since the courts were established to apply the law in civil cases . In the same ORG had emphasised that even manifest breaches of procedural rules in deciding a case may not \u2013 as such \u2013 be qualified as manifestation of ORG exercise of its sovereign powers . ORG noted that ORG when deciding the case in DATE had committed flagrant errors which resulted in the decision being quashed , but nevertheless that did not deprive the claimant of a possibility to have its application granted .", "In these particular circumstances ORG concurred with ORG that certainly from the date on which the decision of CARDINAL DATE had become final the claimant should be regarded as being in possession of the property cum animo rem sibi habendi . That date marked also the beginning of the period of adverse possession . In this respect , ORG noted that the applicants had not rebutted the legal presumption established in LAW that the actual possessor of a property should be considered to be in possession of it \u201c like a property owner \u201d . Instead , they had focused their submissions on showing that the taking over of the property \u2019s management in DATE had been unlawful and had not analysed the relevance of the DATE decision which declared that the ORG had become the owner of the property .", "Lastly , ORG considered the issue of good or bad faith on the part of the ORG which was relevant for the calculation of the period of adverse possession . In this respect , it referred to the legal presumption in favour of good faith laid down in LAW and found that the applicants had not discharged the burden upon them of proving bad faith on the part of the claimant . In this respect ORG held as follows :", "\u201c If bad faith on the part of the claimant were to be assumed at the time when that ( DATE ) decision was given and when it became final , it would have to mean that , regardless of such content of the decision supported by the authority of the court vested with determination of civil - law cases , the claimant would have still to believe that the title did not belong to him or suspect that another person was the owner . Such a view , in the appellate court \u2019s opinion , can not be sustained \u201d .", "At the same time , ORG noted that the above conclusion could not be seen as its approval of the manner in which the DATE proceedings had been conducted .", "Consequently , ORG held that the DATE period of adverse possession in good faith having come to an end on DATE , the ORG had acquired ownership of the property concerned with effect from that date .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain a cassation appeal lodged by the applicants , finding that no serious legal issue arose in the case such as to justify examination of the appeal .", "LAW provides :", "\u201c If a law makes legal consequences dependent upon good or bad faith , good faith shall be presumed \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code reads :", "\u201c It shall be presumed that a person in actual possession of property is in possession \u201c like a property owner \u201d ( cum animo rem sibi habendi ) \u201d", "Adverse possession is regulated in Article CARDINAL of LAW . Up until DATE that provision provided that a person could acquire ownership of land after CARDINAL years\u2019 continuous and independent possession in good faith . Otherwise , a longer period of DATE applied .", "In DATE LAW was amended and the statutory periods of adverse possession in good and bad faith were extended by DATE . Article CARDINAL , in force since CARDINAL DATE , reads :", "\u201c \u00a7 CARDINAL . Persons in possession of property , although they are not the owner , shall acquire title thereto if they have been in continuous and independent possession thereof for DATE , save where they came into such possession in bad faith .", "\u00a7 CARDINAL . After DATE , persons in possession of property shall acquire title thereto even if they came into possession thereof in bad faith . \u201d", "Persons in possession of the property can apply to the district court for a declaration that , as of a specific date , they acquired ownership of property on the strength of adverse possession for a statutory period .", "In its Resolution No . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ( published in OSNC CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG held that :", "\u201c ORG may count towards the period of adverse possession , within the meaning of Article CARDINAL , the period of occupation \u201c like a property owner \u201d on the basis of a court judgment which was [ subsequently ] quashed as a result of an extraordinary appeal ( rewizja nadzwyczajna ) after the period of adverse possession had elapsed . \u201d", "In the written grounds ORG observed that the manner in which the possessor came into possession of the property , including whether he was aware of any unlawfulness in this respect , was immaterial for the validity of adverse possession . The latter circumstance was relevant for the calculation of the period of adverse possession . Furthermore , ORG noted that the validity of adverse possession would not be affected in a case where the final court judgment declaring acquisition of title was subsequently quashed on appeal .", "ORG further observed that in exceptional circumstances it might be possible to disregard the legal consequences of the application of civil law . In particular , such a possibility might arise when an unlawful interference by the ORG exercising its sovereign prerogatives ( imperium ) in private - law relations was a determining factor which led to the deprivation of a civil right . By contrast , adjudication by civil courts did not constitute ORG sovereign interference in private - law relations , since the courts had been established to apply the law in civil cases . Accordingly , even grave procedural errors committed by a court when determining a case could not of themselves be qualified as a manifestation of ORG exercise of its sovereign powers . There would have to be some additional , exceptional circumstances indicating that the ORG had abused its sovereign prerogatives or acted unlawfully with a view to depriving a person of his or her civil right ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
