On DATE ORG dismissed the claim as there had been no breaches of the law in DATE . On appeal , on DATE ORG judgment was quashed by ORG and the case remitted for renewed examination .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG declared null and void the DATE expropriation and compensation order , relying on section CARDINAL of LAW . The court found that at the relevant time an expropriation could only be effected by decision of ORG whereas the property of the applicant 's grandparents had been expropriated DATE and they had been given another property in compensation \u2013 by decision of the regional authority . As a result , neither the applicant 's grandparents nor the applicant , their heir , had ever become owners of the property provided in compensation .

On appeal , on DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment adding that the fact that the applicant 's grandparents had not been responsible for any omission was irrelevant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's ensuing petition for review ( cassation ) . It noted that section CARDINAL of LAW did not apply \u2013 it only concerned property obtained through transactions whereas the applicant 's title had been based on an administrative decision . Nevertheless , the lower courts ' findings that the DATE order was null and void had been correct . In these circumstances , the applicant 's grandparents had never become owners of the plot of land and the building they had received as compensation in DATE . That estate had thus remained ORG property until DATE ( acquisition through adverse possession against the ORG was not possible ) and in DATE the pre - nationalisation owners had acquired it back ex lege , under the general rule of LAW , its section CARDINAL , providing for the return of certain categories of ORG properties to their former owners .", "CARDINAL . The court therefore modified the characterisation of the claim in law and upheld the lower courts ' judgments insofar as they granted the rei vindicatio claim and ordered the applicant to vacate the property at issue . However , insofar as they declared null and void the DATE order also in its expropriation part , the lower courts had acted beyond their jurisdiction as circumscribed by the pre - nationalisation owners ' claim . That part of the judgments had to be quashed .", "CARDINAL .

It found that , therefore , PERSON had not been a tenant in the apartment at issue and that she had not been entitled to buy it . Furthermore , the DATE sale - purchase contract between PERSON and the municipality had not been signed by the mayor personally \u2013 a comma was visible before the signature , which meant that someone had signed in the mayor 's stead . It followed that PERSON title had been void and that the applicants \u2013 who had purchased the apartment from her in DATE \u2013 had not become owners either . The applicants were ordered to vacate the apartment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG judgment was upheld by ORG .
