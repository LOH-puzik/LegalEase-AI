On DATE it imposed on him a suspended sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and fined him MONEY .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG on points of law . He argued that in its judgment convicting him ORG had failed to give an adequate statement of its reasons and to attach sufficient weight to the records of the investigating judge \u2019s examinations ; he contended further that the judgment had been delivered following a violation of the rights of the defence . In accordance with usual practice , the procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2019s department of ORG did not submit a memorial in reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the appeal and quashed the contested decision on the ground that an adequate statement of the reasons on which it was based had not been given .
