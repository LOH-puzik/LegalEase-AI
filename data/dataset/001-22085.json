Subsequently , he filed a request for legal aid .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for legal aid as he had not demonstrated his indigence and , after a summary examination of the case , as the action lacked prospects of success .", "Against this decision the applicant filed a complaint ( Beschwerde ) with ORG ( ORG ) of the GPE of ORG which the latter declared inadmissible on DATE . In its decision the court stated , inter alia :", "\u201c whereas according to LAW ( hereafter : ORG ) a complaint must be filed within DATE after the contested decision was rendered ...", "whereas the contested decision was served on the applicant \u2019s representative on DATE ; the period for filing the complaint therefore began on DATE and ended on DATE ;", "whereas according to PERSON the time - limit will be complied with if the complaint was filed with the court , or transmitted to the NORP postal service , at the latest on DATE ;", "whereas if a person abroad files a complaint , it will suffice if the complaint is filed with a NORP diplomatic or consular representation abroad , though it is insufficient if the submission is merely transmitted to the foreign postal service ... ;", "whereas the applicant transmitted his complaint to the NORP postal service in GPE on DATE , i.e. , on DATE of the time - limit , and that the complaint arrived only on DATE in the area of the NORP postal service , and was received by ORG on DATE ;", "whereas the complaint was , therefore , filed only after the expiry of the time - limit for which reason it can not be admitted on account of the delay ... \u201d", "The applicant filed a public law appeal ( staatsrechtliche Beschwerde ) with ORG ( PERSON ) in which he complained , inter alia , that it was customary ( \u00fcblich ) to accept the NORP postal service as the recipient for such submissions , and that as he was a NORP , it was not possible for him to send them to the NORP embassy in GPE .", "On DATE ORG partly dismissed and partly rejected the applicant \u2019s public law appeal . It considered that PERSON ORG corresponded with CARDINAL of LAW ( Bundesgesetz \u00fcber das internationale GPE ) according to which it sufficed for persons living abroad to submit their documents on DATE of the time - limit to the NORP diplomatic or consular representation . The judgment continued :", "\u201c In this respect there has been no arbitrary interpretation or application of PERSON ORG .

S. CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that a complaint against a decision must be filed in writing within DATE after the decision was rendered .", "S.
