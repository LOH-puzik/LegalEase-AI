The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant , a bailiff by profession . He was charged with bribery , abuse of power and forgery , on the basis of criminal complaints lodged by ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the complainants \u201d ) , CARDINAL individuals he had assisted as a bailiff in enforcement proceedings . M.M. alleged that the applicant had requested money from her in exchange for him asking a judge to assist with the enforcement of a title deed , while PERSON stated that the applicant had requested a certain amount of money from him to assist with the enforcement of a judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an operation was set up in respect of the applicant . The police gave M.M. a tape recorder and money which was marked with a fluorescent substance . She and her cousin met the applicant in a bar . According to the report of the operation , PERSON had wanted to hand the money to the applicant , but he had made a signal to her to put it into his briefcase . Her cousin had not been there when this had happened . After the envelope containing the money had been placed in the applicant \u2019s briefcase , the police had appeared . The report of the operation stated that there had been no fluorescent substance found on the applicant \u2019s hands , but that money had been found in the briefcase .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was held in pre - trial detention from DATE until DATE , when he was released following a court order dismissing a request by a prosecutor to keep him in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor attached to ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) issued an indictment against the applicant for bribery and abuse of power . The charges against him were based on statements of the complainants and other witnesses , and the report of the operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of all charges after hearing evidence from the witnesses , the complainants and the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reaching its decision , the court noted that the only prosecution evidence available was the statements of the complainants and other witnesses , some of whom were the ORG relatives , who could only state what they had been told by them . Moreover , none of the witnesses actually saw the money being given to the applicant . Secondly , the court noted that no mention was made in any of the evidence submitted to it of the tape recorder that had been used during the police operation . It held , therefore , that none of the evidence was conclusive proof as to the applicant \u2019s guilt .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor appealed . In a hearing held on DATE before ORG , the prosecutor sought conviction of the applicant , while the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked for the appeal to be dismissed . The applicant did not give evidence before the court , but he was given the opportunity to address the court at the end of the hearing and declared that he was innocent . No witnesses were heard and no additional evidence was adduced at that stage of the proceedings . Neither the applicant nor his lawyer submitted written observations .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG overturned the acquittal and found the applicant guilty of both charges , sentencing him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment suspended . It concluded that the witness statements were proof that the applicant had committed the offences alleged .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , claiming , inter alia , that the appellate court had failed to hear the witnesses directly regarding the statements on which it had relied and had failed to take into account other evidence in his defence ; that the prosecution had withheld the taperecording of the operation from the case file even though the applicant had asked for it to be assessed by the courts and the prosecutor had authorised the recording himself ; and that none of the evidence adduced was conclusive proof that he had committed the offences alleged .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held on DATE before ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The applicant did not attend the hearing , but his lawyer was present . No witnesses were heard and no new evidence was adduced during the hearing . On DATE , the court concluded the proceedings and set a date for the public delivery of its final decision .", "CARDINAL . At the following hearing on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law with final effect . It concluded that ORG had assessed the evidence correctly and that the applicant \u2019s submissions were not corroborated by any of the other evidence adduced . It emphasised that besides the statements of the complainants , ORG had also relied on statements of witnesses who knew that PERSON had attempted to secure money to pay the applicant . It also considered the fact that no fluorescent substance had been found on the applicant \u2019s hands to be irrelevant , given that he had requested the money which was found in his briefcase . No reference was made to the applicant \u2019s submissions regarding the tape recorder or to the appellate court \u2019s failure to hear the complainants and the witnesses directly .", "CARDINAL .
