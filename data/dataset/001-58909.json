He is a journalist and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he noticed CARDINAL municipal guards who were ordering street vendors to leave a square in GPE where selling was allegedly not authorised by the municipal authorities and to move their makeshift stands to a nearby market - place . The Government maintain however that the guards , who were acting on sanitary and traffic considerations , merely requested the vendors to move to a nearby market - place . The applicant further submits that he intervened , informing the guards that their actions had no legal basis and infringed the laws guaranteeing freedom in the economic field . He pointed out that the municipal authorities had not passed any resolution which would allow the guards to clear the square . The applicant observed that the guards were apparently acting only on the basis of verbal instructions from the mayor and urged the vendors to stay . The exchange between the applicant and the guards was witnessed by a group of bystanders .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on an unspecified date , the GPE district prosecutor ( Prokurator Rejonowy ) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant . On DATE the district prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Zdu\u0144ska ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) . The applicant was charged with having insulted municipal guards while they were carrying out their duties and with having acted with flagrant contempt for legal order , an offence specified in LAW read together with LAW .", "CARDINAL .

He was also ordered to pay the sum of PLZ CARDINAL to charitable institutions and court costs of PLZ CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant filed an appeal against this judgment , submitting that his conviction was based on insufficient evidence . He pointed out that ORG had failed to establish precisely what defamatory words had been used and had only found that the applicant had called the guards \u201c ignorant \u201d . This word should not have been regarded as an insult but as an acceptable criticism of public servants . The applicant further contended that the trial court had wrongly applied the law since , contrary to its findings , it was evident that his acts had not involved any act of hooliganism as he had only intended to protect street vendors from illegal actions of the municipal guards .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) quashed the part of the contested judgment relating to the sentence of imprisonment and the order to pay PLZ CARDINAL,CARDINAL to charitable institutions . However , it upheld the fine of PLZ CARDINAL and reduced the court costs to the sum of PLZ CARDINAL . ORG was of the opinion that the trial court had wrongly considered that the offence at issue had been hooligan in nature as the applicant \u2019s motive had been to defend street vendors against the acts of the municipal guards which he had considered illegal . Therefore the applicant had not acted as he did without any justifiable motive , which was a prerequisite for finding that the offence was an act of hooliganism .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG agreed with the applicant that the ORG municipal council had not passed any resolution prohibiting the sale of merchandise on the streets and that no public notice to this effect had been posted at the material place and time . Therefore , there were no grounds for the trial court \u2019s finding that the applicant had demonstrated flagrant contempt for legal order .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG observed that the judgment had not mentioned the abusive words used by the applicant . Nevertheless , it considered that there was sufficient evidence in the case file to conclude that the applicant had in fact insulted the guards by calling them \u201c oafs \u201d and \u201c dumb \u201d ( \u201c \u0107woki \u201d and \u201c g\u0142upki \u201d ) . These words were widely considered to be offensive and by using them the applicant had exceeded the limits of freedom of expression . The court found that the resulting conviction was rightly imposed under LAW whose object was to ensure that civil servants were not hindered in carrying out their duties .", "CARDINAL .
