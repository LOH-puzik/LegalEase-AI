The first applicant , hereinafter referred to as Mr Lors\u00e9 , was taken into police custody ( in verzekering gesteld ) on DATE and subsequently placed in detention on remand ( voorlopige hechtenis ) . He was initially detained in ordinary remand institutions ( huizen van bewaring ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was convicted of drugs and firearms offences . He was sentenced at first instance to DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( NLG ) . On appeal the prison term was increased to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , the fine remaining the same . His conviction and sentence became final on DATE when his appeal on points of law was rejected by ORG ( PERSON ) . He is now serving that sentence . He will be eligible for provisional release no sooner than DATE . It would appear that he has been sentenced in GPE to a DATE prison sentence for drugs - related crimes but that the proceedings there are still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the criminal proceedings were still pending , Mr Lors\u00e9 handed his counsel a letter from the prison authorities from which it appeared that it was intended to place him ( Mr Lors\u00e9 ) in an extra security institution . On DATE Mr Lors\u00e9 was transferred to ORG ( PERSON Extra PERSON , \u201c TEBI \u201d ) , part of the PERSON Penitentiary Complex in FAC .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG informed PERSON Lors\u00e9 that apart from the fact that he was suspected of very serious crimes , official information ( ambtsberichten ) was available from which it appeared that he was likely to use violence in an attempt to escape . Reference was made to the fact that he had already once managed to avoid being arrested , endangering human life in so doing . Reference was also made to the prison sentence awaiting him in GPE . In these circumstances it was considered that public order would be severely affected should Mr Lors\u00e9 manage to escape .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was subsequently notified , by letters couched in similar terms and dated DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , of the prolongation of his detention in the ORG and DATE following the rejection of his appeal on points of law on DATE in the Extra Security Institution ( Extra PERSON , \u201c ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On a number of occasions Mr Lors\u00e9 made use of legal remedies to protest against his placement , and the prolongation of that placement , in the ORG . On DATE , for example , Mr Lors\u00e9 , through his counsel , lodged an appeal to ORG ( beroepscommissie ) of ORG ( Centrale PERSON ) against the decision of DATE to prolong his placement . In addition to stating that there was no factual justification for his continued detention in the ORG , he complained about the regime which he described as \u201c ill - befitting a state governed by the rule of law \u201d . Privacy was entirely lacking . Human contact with his wife and children was excessively restricted , any kind of intimacy with them being impossible . His psychological and physical health were affected , the symptoms being DATE headaches , shaking and loss of concentration , and he had had to seek the help of the prison psychologist . He referred to the findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( CPT \u2013 see below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE . It noted that there had been no new information since DATE which would tend to justify the fear that Mr PERSON might attempt to escape . Moreover , the remainder of his sentence had significantly decreased and that , together with the nature of the offences of which he had been convicted , reduced the prospect that public order would be affected if he did escape . Finally , his behaviour was reported to be good . In these circumstances any doubt should benefit Mr Lors\u00e9 . Accordingly , the competent authorities were ordered to reconsider their decision within DATE taking the decision of ORG into account .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a placement officer of ORG ( ORG \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) recommended that Mr PERSON should remain in the ORG . Mr PERSON \u2019s situation was described as \u201c relatively stable \u201d , the fact that his prolonged detention in the ORG was becoming more and more of a burden to him being \u201c a normal reaction to a situation that [ was ] in many respects relatively extreme ( waarbij het feit dat een verblijf in de EBI steeds zwaarder gaat wegen een normale reactie is op een in veel opzichten betrekkelijk extreme situatie ) .", "CARDINAL . The Minister of ORG gave a new decision on DATE , again prolonging Mr PERSON \u2019s detention in the ORG . It was stated that a new decision had been made taking into account advice given by the governor of the PERSON penitentiary complex and the decision of ORG . In addition , reference was made to official information dated DATE from which it appeared that there was new and recent information to the effect that Mr Lors\u00e9 still constituted an increased security risk . The nature of this information was not disclosed but it was concluded that Mr PERSON was planning an escape with help from outside the institution and possibly involving the use of violence against persons . Reference was also made to the prison sentence which he would have to serve in GPE . Finally , the Minister was of the opinion that in view of inter alia the seriousness of Mr Lors\u00e9 \u2019s offences , public order would be seriously affected if PERSON managed to escape . Thus , although account had been taken of the decision of ORG , this latter decision could not prevail over the new official information .", "CARDINAL . Mr Lors\u00e9 \u2019s detention in the ORG was again extended on DATE , since official information of DATE and DATE indicated that he still posed an increased security risk . In its decision of DATE on Mr Lors\u00e9 \u2019s appeal against the prolongation of his placement in the ORG , ORG noted his arguments to the effect that his protracted stay in the ORG had negative effects not only on him but also on his relatives , and that he had referred to the present complaint lodged with the ORG . PERSON had also submitted the report of the psychiatrist PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG rejected the complaint , finding that in the absence of facts or circumstances militating against a continuation of Mr PERSON \u2019s detention in the ORG , the decision to prolong his placement was lawful and that , weighing up all the interests involved , it could not be considered unreasonable or unjust . ORG noted that it had taken into account the arguments raised by Mr Lors\u00e9 relating to his psychological condition .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the Minister of ORG informed PERSON Lors\u00e9 of a further prolongation of his detention in the ORG . Reference was made to inter alia official information of DATE according to which Mr Lors\u00e9 still posed an increased security risk . There were indications that an attempt at escape would in all likelihood involve the help of co - detainees and/or persons outside the institution and the use of violence , inter alia through explosives , against persons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Lors\u00e9 lodged an appeal against the prolongation of his detention at the ORG with ORG , arguing that the official information of DATE had no basis in fact and further submitting that his continued detention at the ORG constituted a violation of LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention , not only with respect to himself but also with respect to his wife and children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , finding that the risk that Mr Lors\u00e9 might escape was still too great to justify detaining him anywhere else than in a maximum security institution . It further considered that its task was to examine the decision to prolong Mr PERSON \u2019s detention in the ORG , and not the regime pertaining in that institution as such . For that reason , ORG declined to rule on the complaint under LAW . As to the complaint of a violation of LAW , ORG considered that the second paragraph of that provision allowed for an interference with the right to respect for private and family life as long as such interference was in accordance with the law and was necessary in a NORP society in the interest of , inter alia , the prevention of disorder and crime . ORG concluded once more that in the absence of facts or circumstances militating against a continuation of Mr PERSON \u2019s detention in the ORG , the decision to prolong his placement was lawful and that , weighing up all the interests involved , it could not be considered unreasonable or unjust .", "CARDINAL . Besides lodging appeals with ORG to contest the extension of his maximum security detention , Mr Lors\u00e9 , while still detained on remand , also applied for an interim injunction ( kort geding ) against the ORG on CARDINAL occasions , arguing that his placement in the ORG was unlawful . Both applications were rejected , in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was transferred from the ORG to a prison in GPE with a different regime . Of all prisoners who have been subjected to the maximum security regime in the GPE , PERSON PERSON was by far the longest - serving .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s psychological condition was examined on a number of occasions . On DATE Mr V. , the head of ORG of the ORG , submitted an advisory opinion to the Minister of ORG concerning the prolongation of Mr Lors\u00e9 \u2019s placement at the ORG . His report of that date stated :", "\u201c ...", "The ORG has previously reported on [ Mr Lors\u00e9 ] on DATE ... At that time it was reported that [ Mr Lors\u00e9 ] , who has been detained in the ORG since DATE , was finding it increasingly difficult to cope with his stay there . [ Mr Lors\u00e9 ] appeared to have reversed his day - night rhythm . [ Mr Lors\u00e9 ] had no contacts with the prison \u2019s medical and mental health care team . It was reported that , all in all , a picture was beginning to emerge of a man for whom the stay in the ORG was becoming increasingly difficult to bear , with adverse consequences for his functioning . It was advised that an attempt be made to restore contacts with the medical and health care team so that the reaction to a renewed perspective of a further long stay in the ORG might be monitored .", "The report of DATE shows ups and downs with more pronounced and more frequent mood swings , especially lately . Apart from the long duration of the stay in the ORG and the lack of contact with the family , the changes in the composition of the [ ORG ] population also ... appear to play a role .", "All in all , I am of the opinion that the stay in the ORG is increasingly difficult to bear for Mr Lors\u00e9 , and , barring concrete evidence regarding the likelihood of an escape attempt , that a transfer is to be preferred on psychosocial grounds alone . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Lors\u00e9 was seen , in the ORG , by an independent psychiatrist , PERSON , at the request of his lawyer . Dr S. reported as follows :", "\u201c I am unable to make a definite psychiatric diagnosis from a single psychiatric examination ; in particular , there are insufficient indications to diagnose a depression .", "There are , nevertheless , a number of indications suggesting that [ Mr Lors\u00e9 ] is suffering under the protracted isolation ; he thus describes memory and orientation disorders as well as signs of depersonalisation which clearly point to that being the case .", "[ Mr Lors\u00e9 ] is a man ... who has learned to survive through toughness . It is debatable whether the psychological carapace he has built up over DATE will be capable of withstanding the current extreme isolation , and it is , in my opinion , important therefore that a close eye be kept on him . Should he decompensate in a depressive sense \u2013 the risk of which is certainly not hypothetical \u2013 this will not be without danger : in such a situation a risk of suicidal actions is not to be underestimated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after his transfer from the ORG , PERSON PERSON was seen by a different independent psychiatrist , PERSON , who had been requested by his lawyer to examine the psychological consequences of Mr PERSON \u2019s stay in the ORG . According to Dr C. , Mr PERSON was suffering from a moderately serious ( matig ernstig ) depression with endogenous features , moderately serious panic attacks and a conditioned avoidance response . Although PERSON was not found to be suicidal , he was troubled by nightmares relating mainly to suicide . He was also irritable and suffered regular panic attacks . CARDINAL of the reasons for this psychiatric condition was the fact that contact with his wife and children was seriously disrupted . He was incapable of working , either alone or with others , and his activity level was very much reduced . PERSON expressed the opinion that there was a causal link between the outward symptoms of the depression as well as the psychiatric disorders he found and PERSON long period of detention in the ORG . These disorders were becoming more marked now that PERSON Lors\u00e9 had more opportunities to have contacts with other people following his transfer from the ORG . His isolation in the ORG meant that his complaints were less visible to the outside world and he was in a better position there to fight against them . Now that he was receiving more attention , including some from social workers in the prison , there was a lowering of his resistance and fighting spirit against his helplessness and feelings of abandonment .", "CARDINAL . After PERSON report had been transmitted to the Government , they requested PERSON , a forensic psychiatrist employed by ORG of ORG , to examine Mr Lors\u00e9 in order to find out whether he was indeed suffering from the psychiatric disorders described by PERSON and , if so , whether these disorders were related to his detention in the ORG . Dr NORP saw Mr Lors\u00e9 twice , in DATE and DATE , and she noted in her report of CARDINAL DATE that during these meetings he had not displayed any symptoms of a disturbance of a depressive nature . She replied to the questions put by the ORG that at the time of her examination , Mr Lors\u00e9 was not suffering from a \u201c moderately serious depression \u201d . Although immediately after his transfer from the ORG he had had mild symptoms of an unspecified adjustment disorder , this was now in complete remission . PERSON acknowledged that this disorder was probably directly related to his prolonged detention in the ORG , but noted that most people who were detained in semi - isolation or maximum security facilities reacted in a similar manner . In PERSON opinion , Mr PERSON would have presented a similar profile if he had been detained in any other closed penal institution with rules similar to those in the ORG or semi - isolation facilities .", "CARDINAL . In a note dated DATE , the general practitioner of the third , fourth and fifth applicants described these children as being seriously traumatised as a result of the lack of contact with their father .", "CARDINAL . At the request of Mr Lors\u00e9 \u2019s lawyer , the probation services ( ORG ) issued an advisory report on DATE describing the situation of Mr PERSON \u2019s wife and their CARDINAL children ( i.e. the second to fifth applicants ) . Superficially , they seemed to have managed to cope with the problems they had faced in DATE . However , the very limited possibilities for contact with Mr Lors\u00e9 were causing problems . The fourth applicant had developed anorexia nervosa DATE previously . The second applicant felt unable to discuss relationship problems with her husband knowing that everything that was said would be recorded and could be used against her husband . In the report , the family was described as \u201c psychological wreckage \u201d ( psychisch wrakhout ) . The process which the CARDINAL children were going through in relation to their father was likened to a process of mourning . In conclusion , the probation services supported the appeal which Mr Lors\u00e9 had instituted against the prolongation of his placement in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In an information report ( voorlichtingsrapport ) of DATE , again requested by Mr PERSON \u2019s lawyer , the probation services stated that the term \u201c psychological wreckage \u201d was still fully applicable to Mr Lors\u00e9 \u2019s family .", "CARDINAL . All GPE penal institutions fall into CARDINAL of CARDINAL security categories , ranging from very limited security ( FAC beperkt beveiligd ) to extra security ( extra beveiligd ) . The Minister of Justice lays down criteria according to which prisoners are to be selected for each such category ( LAW and DATE LAW beginselenwet ) .", "The actual selection is carried out by a Ministry of Justice placement officer ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP EBIs are intended for prisoners who , in descending order of importance ,", "a ) are considered extremely likely to attempt to escape from closed penal institutions and who , if they succeed , pose an unacceptable risk to society in terms of again committing serious violent crimes ; or", "b ) if they should escape , would pose an unacceptable risk to society in terms of severe disturbance of public order , the risk of escaping being , as such , of lesser importance .", "CARDINAL . A special ORG circular governs decisions to detain a prisoner in an extra security category institution or ORG ( ORG circular no . CARDINAL of DATE ) . In principle , placements in the ORG are made from an ordinary custodial institution . The governor of the custodial institution submits a proposal to the placement officer , giving reasons why the persons concerned should be detained in the ORG . Before submitting this proposal , the governor requests information about the person concerned from the secretary of a special ORG selection board , which comprises a representative of ORG , a psychologist and a representative of the board of governors of the ORG in FAC . The secretary having obtained such information from various sources , the governor then discusses his proposal with the detainee . Finally , he completes his report by adding the detainee \u2019s comments and any objections he may have , and submits his proposal to the selection board .", "CARDINAL . The placement officer considers the proposal , consults with the governor and interviews the detainee . He then draws up his own report on the governor \u2019s proposal and submits it to the selection board secretary . If the detainee is serving a long sentence or if a psychologist considers it necessary , it may be forwarded to ORG , which is responsible for issuing recommendations on the psychological aspects of the enforcement of custodial sentences and orders . The ORG is always consulted about first placements . The case is subsequently discussed by the selection board , chaired by the placement officer .", "CARDINAL . The decision to detain a prisoner in an ORG is reviewed DATE . The ORG governor must submit a behavioural report ( gedragsrapportage ) on the detainee at corresponding intervals .

The following are features of the ORG regime :", "\u2013 all contacts with the outside world are screened ; all correspondence and telephone calls ( twice a week for TIME ) are screened except for those with privileged contacts ; detainees must be separated from their visitors ( CARDINAL visit DATE for TIME ) by a transparent partition ( \u201c closed visits \u201d ) ; members of their immediate families , spouses and partners may visit once a month without such partition ( \u201c open visits \u201d ) , although physical contact is restricted to a handshake on arrival and departure ; visitors must submit to a search of their clothes ( frisking ) before an \u201c open \u201d visit ;", "\u2013 only CARDINAL detainee at a time may come into contact with staff , and CARDINAL staff members must be present ; for this purpose , special corridors have been built leading to areas where group activities take place ; these areas are under camera surveillance or supervised by staff who are physically separated from inmates by a partition ;", "\u2013 detainees may take part in sports at least twice DATE ; they may spend TIME a day outdoors and may also use the exercise yard at fixed times during recreation periods in their programme ; they are entitled to spend TIME a week engaging in group recreation ;", "\u2013 CARDINAL people at a time may take part in group activities ;", "\u2013 detainees who leave the premises must be handcuffed , for instance when going to court or for hospital treatment ; they may also be handcuffed inside the ORG , in areas where they might have access to objects with which they could injure staff or take hostages , for example when visiting the hairdresser \u2019s or the clinic , or when being escorted to \u201c open \u201d visits ;", "\u2013 cells are periodically ( in practice : DATE ) subjected to a more thorough search ; at the same time or immediately afterwards the detainees are frisked and strip - searched ; the strip - search , which involves an external viewing of the body \u2019s orifices and crevices , including an anal inspection , is carried out in a closed room and , whenever possible , by a person of the detainee \u2019s own gender ;", "\u2013 frisking and strip - searching also takes place", "\u25aa on arrival in and release from the ORG", "\u25aa before and after \u201c open \u201d visits", "\u25aa after visits to the clinic , the dentist \u2019s surgery or the hairdresser \u2019s ;", "\u2013 the ORG governor , or in urgent cases an ORG officer or employee , may decide that the detainee must be subjected to an internal body search if this is considered necessary to prevent the maintenance of good order or safety within the prison being endangered , or to protect the detainee \u2019s own health ; an internal body search is usually carried out by a doctor but he may also instruct a nurse to carry out the search .", "CARDINAL . If a prisoner wishes to contest the decision either to place him in the ORG or to prolong such placement , he could , at the time relevant to the present case , file an appeal to the CARDINAL - member ORG of ORG for ORG ( LAW ) . ORG , which was superseded by ORG on DATE , was constituted of members appointed and dismissed by LAW . Its duties included advising the Minister of ORG , at the latter \u2019s request or proprio motu , on matters concerning the application of policy and legal rules relating to the prison system ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL sub CARDINAL of LAW DATE Beginselenwet gevangeniswezen ) .

A number of persons detained in the ORG has in the past instituted interim injunction proceedings , sometimes together with close family members , in order to have the regime , or certain aspects of it , relaxed . However , in cases decided under domestic law it has been held that where pursuant to prison law an administrative remedy , with sufficient procedural safeguards , is available against a particular decision , there is no room for an injunction decision that is in conflict with a decision made in the administrative proceedings ( see , mutatis mutandis , ORG judgment of DATE , PERSON ( GPE Law Reports ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ; and the judgment of ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE of DATE , case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL KG , relating specifically to aspects of the ORG regime ) . In cases where such an administrative remedy was available and where detainees and family members instituted injunction proceedings jointly , it has been argued on behalf of the ORG that those family members should await the outcome of the administrative proceedings even if the family members themselves may not appear as parties to those proceedings .

In interim injunction proceedings instituted by an ORG detainee , his wife and one of his children , in which one of the points at issue was the ORG governor \u2019s refusal to allow the detainee to conduct telephone conversations in NORP , counsel for the ORG had argued on appeal that the request for an interim injunction should be declared inadmissible , since the detainee \u2019s complaint had already been dealt with by ORG . However , by judgment of DATE , ORG declared the appeal admissible because , ORG having ruled on the detainee \u2019s complaint by then , there was no longer an administrative procedure pending which had to be disposed of on penalty of his civil proceedings being declared inadmissible . ORG then proceeded to reject the request for an interim injunction since ORG in its decision had considered the decision of the ORG governor lawful and the proceedings before ORG were deemed to have sufficient procedural safeguards ( case no .

The ORG \u2019s views on the nature of the regime which should be offered to prisoners held in special security units were set out in detail in the report on its DATE visit to the GPE . In that context , the ORG welcomed the recommendation of ORG that any future ORG should have \u2018 as normal a regime as PERSON .", "In its DATE report , the ORG stressed that prisoners should enjoy a relatively relaxed regime ( able to mix freely with the small number of fellow prisoners in the unit ; allowed to move without restriction within what is likely to be a relatively small physical space ; granted a good deal of choice about activities , etc . ) by way of compensation for their severe custodial situation . Special efforts should be made to develop a good internal atmosphere within such units . The aim should be to build positive relations between staff and prisoners . This is in the interests not only of the humane treatment of the unit \u2019s occupants but also of the maintenance of effective control and security and of staff safety . The existence of a satisfactory programme of activities is just as important \u2013 if not more so \u2013 in a special detention unit as on normal location . It can do much to counter the deleterious effects upon a prisoner \u2019s personality of living in the bubble - like atmosphere of such a unit . The activities provided should be as diverse as possible ( education , sport , work of vocational value etc . ) As regards , in particular , work activities , it is clear that security considerations may preclude many types of work activities which are found on normal prison location . Nevertheless , this should not mean that only work of a tedious nature is provided for prisoners . In this respect , reference might be made to the suggestions set out in paragraph CARDINAL of the Explanatory Memorandum to Recommendation No . R(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The current regime in the ( ORG and ORG units is governed by a circular which was issued by ORG on DATE ( cf . document CARDINAL ) . According to the circular :", "\u2018 The extra security institution ( ORG ) at ORG has a limited communication regime . A differentiation of regimes is referred to within the ORG , where a distinction is made between what is known as the A regime , where greater restrictions apply , and the B regime , with less extreme restrictions .", "Groups of CARDINAL and a maximum of CARDINAL inmates take part in activities . Under the B regime , a maximum of CARDINAL inmates takes part in communal activities , while the maximum number is CARDINAL under the A regime . Communal activities involve only inmates from a single section .", "For security reasons , staff in contact with inmates must always outnumber the inmates , or must even be completely separated from them physically by a transparent ( glass ) wall . Moreover , with a view to the safety of the staff concerned , in those cases covered by LAW , sub - sections CARDINAL , chapter III , of the internal regulations of ORG , inmates\u2019 movements are restricted by handcuffs.\u2019", "CARDINAL . The delegation found that , in practice , out - of - cell time in the ( ORG and ORG on DATE varied from a minimum of TIME ( of outdoor exercise ) to a maximum of CARDINAL ( of outdoor exercise / recreation and/or sport ) . Depending upon the regime in which an inmate had been placed ( A / B ) and the group to which they had been allocated , these activities would take place with CARDINAL other inmates .", "The outdoor exercise yards in the ORG were of a reasonable size and a \u2018 running strip\u2019 was available for inmates who wished to engage in more strenuous physical activities . The exercise yards in the ( ORG were also large enough to enable prisoners to exert themselves physically ; however , their cage - like design rendered them rather oppressive facilities .", "During recreation periods ( of TIME ) , inmates were allowed access to communal areas where they could associate with each other , cook and eat their own food , use a computer and/or play games including table tennis .", "As regards facilities for sport , each of the CARDINAL units in the ORG was equipped with an impressive array of exercise equipment , located in a lofty glass atrium . However , inmates only had access to this equipment for CARDINAL or TIME sessions per week . Again , the equivalent facilities in ORG were of a lower standard . The ORG also had a large and well - equipped gymnasium but , at the time of the visit , it appeared that comparatively little use was being made of this facility .", "There were no organised education activities . There was also no out - of - cell work ; some in - cell work was offered to inmates , but it was of a very unchallenging nature ( e.g. stringing plastic curtain hooks onto short rods ) .", "CARDINAL . All inmate activities within ORG and ORG were subject to a high level of staff surveillance ( which is perfectly understandable in a unit of this type ) ; however , direct contacts between staff and inmates were very limited ( staff and inmate usually being separated by armoured glass panels ) . This is not conducive to building positive relations between staff and prisoners . Contact with non - custodial staff \u2013 including medical staff DATE was also subject to a number of very significant restrictions ( ... ) .", "CARDINAL . It should also be noted that prisoners were regularly strip - searched ( a practice euphemistically referred to as \u2018 visitatie\u2019 ) . Such searches \u2013 which included anal inspections \u2013 were carried out at least once DATE on all prisoners , regardless of whether the persons concerned had had any contact with the outside world .", "CARDINAL . Concerning contact with the outside world , it should be noted that the house rules for ORG and ORG units provide that prisoners have the right to receive CARDINAL visit of TIME from family members and other persons approved in advance by prison management . In principle , visits took place under \u2018 NORP conditions ( i.e. through an armoured glass panel in a visiting booth ) . Prisoners also had the right to request CARDINAL \u2018 CARDINAL visit per month from family members ; however , physical contact during such visits was limited to a handshake on arrival and leaving . Prisoners and their families remained separated by a table equipped with a chest - high barrier and prison staff stood directly behind the prisoner throughout the visit . A number of inmates interviewed by the delegation indicated that , given the upsetting effects which these restrictions had had upon their families , they no longer requested \u2018 PERSON visits .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , prisoners held in the ( ORG and ORG units were subject to a very impoverished regime . They spent too little time out of their cells ; when out of their cells they associated with only a small number of fellow inmates and their relations with staff and visitors were very limited ; consequently , they did not have adequate human contact . Further , the programme of activities was underdeveloped . This was particularly the case as regards education and work . However , even as regards sport , inmates had insufficient access to the very good facilities available . Moreover , certain aspects of the regime ( in particular , systematic strip - searching ) did not appear to respond to legitimate security needs , and are humiliating for prisoners .", "DATE . The delegation \u2019s lengthy interviews with CARDINAL prisoners held in the ( T)EBI and ORG indicated that the regime as a whole was having harmful psychological consequences for those subjected to it . Indeed , the interviews revealed a consistent association of psychological symptoms which appeared to have been induced by the regime . The inmates concerned displayed the following symptom profile :", "- feelings of helplessness , which took the form of a disturbance of normal identity and severe difficulty of projection into the future ; in certain cases , the loss of identity was associated with definite episodes of depersonalisation ;", "- feelings of powerlessness , closely linked to helplessness , and leading to regression and excessive pre - occupation with bodily functions ;", "- anger , the predominant emotion being one of rage ( clearly linked to feelings of powerlessness ) and directed against self ( with expressions of low esteem , lack of confidence and associated depressive symptoms ) and others ;", "- communication difficulties , associated with the above - mentioned depersonalisation symptoms .", "The delegation \u2019s concerns about the harmful psychological consequences of the regime were reinforced during its subsequent visit to the Dr S. van Mesdag Clinic , where it interviewed a number of patients who had previously been held in the ( ORG or ORG , in whom persistent psychological sequelae ( insomnia ; anxiety symptoms ; disturbance of identity ; emotional liability and psychosomatic symptoms ) were clearly present .", "The ORG would add that it is aware that the psychologist employed in the ( ORG and ORG has publicly expressed the conviction that the regime has led to \u2018 no significant harmful effects on ORG . However , this opinion has never been subject to any form of peer review or professional assessment . It should be added that the Psychiatric Adviser to ORG expressed a contrary view to the delegation , citing as an example a case of a prisoner who had developed a florid paranoid psychosis while held in the ( T)EBI .", "CARDINAL . In the light of all of the information at its disposal , the ORG has been led to conclude that the regime currently being applied in ORG and ORG could be considered to amount to inhuman treatment . To subject prisoners classified as dangerous to such a regime could well render them more dangerous still .", "CARDINAL . The facilities in the extra security institution are of a high standard . They are quite capable of offering a regime meeting the criteria set out in paragraph CARDINAL without jeopardising legitimate security concerns .", "The ORG recommends that the regime currently applied in the extra security institution be revised in the light of the remarks set out in DATE . In particular , the existing group system , if not discarded , should at least be relaxed and inmates should be allowed more out - of - cell time and a broader range of activities . Further , the current searching policies should be reviewed in order to ensure that they are strictly necessary from a security standpoint . Similarly , current visiting arrangements should be reviewed ; the objective should be to have visits taking place under more open conditions .", "Finally , the ORG recommends that the NORP authorities commission an independent study of the psychological state of current and former inmates of the extra security institution . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Further , the current searching policies should be reviewed in order to ensure that they are strictly necessary from a security standpoint . Similarly , current visiting arrangements should be reviewed ; the objective should be to have visits taking place under more open conditions ( paragraph DATE )", "Response : The ( ORG houses prisoners who are deemed exceptionally likely to attempt to escape , either with help from outside or by violent means . Generally speaking , they fall into CARDINAL categories : prisoners believed to be members of criminal organisations ; prisoners serving sentences for manslaughter or murder ; and prisoners who have escaped from prison in the past either by taking staff hostage or by using firearms ( and perhaps with help from outside ) . Arrangements for the detention of such prisoners need to be based first and foremost on systematic , fail - safe security arrangements , though a humane regime should then be provided within that context . The task of the ORG , like any other prison , is to execute custodial sentences without disruption . The restrictions imposed on prisoners should be no more than are necessary to deprive them of their liberty . What distinguishes the ORG from other prisons is the nature of the restrictions required to achieve that purpose . They must be more severe because the prisoners present , by definition , an above - average risk of escape or disruption of the normal prison regime . In practice , this means that the purpose of ORG and ORG is to create a place and regime from which it is impossible to escape , even by taking staff hostage .", "The regime in the ORG is the most severe anywhere in the GPE . For that reason , use of the institution is kept to a minimum and the decision to place prisoners there is taken and later reviewed at frequent intervals by a broad - based external committee . Despite the severity of the regime , prisoners in the ORG are offered sufficient out - of - cell time ( paragraph CARDINAL ) and have the opportunity to take part in recreational , sporting , musical , creative , educational and other activities . The range of activities on offer gives prisoners regular opportunities for human contact and the staff of the ORG deliberately strive to encourage such contact and participation in activities wherever possible . The small size of the unit \u2019s population ( paragraph CARDINAL ) is essential to the maintenance of order , security and control and to the prevention of escapes . It is true that there are special restrictions on contact with the outside world ( in the form of the glass partition separating prisoners from visitors ) , but the frequency of visits is the same as in a normal remand centre .", "The arrangements for searches in the ( ORG and ORG are essential to ensure the safety of staff . They have been evaluated in the past , as part of the DATE assessment of the ORG , and it has been decided that prisoners should not be searched more often than strictly necessary . This means that prisoners are not always searched on return to their cells , but only if they have been out of sight of the warder who let them out .", "Visits are organised in such a way as to permit visual , verbal and non - verbal contact while preventing direct physical contact . The special visiting arrangements are among the most important security measures to prevent escapes . If visits were more \u2018 open\u2019 and there were any chance of smuggling contraband into the prison , there would be little point in the existence of the ORG .", "CARDINAL .

It will then consider instituting a further study of the impact of the ORG regime on the psychological state of inmates if the outcome of that investigation gives reason to do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Ministry of Justice commissioned researchers of ORG to conduct a preliminary study of the ORG \u2019s policy on care for the mental well - being of detainees and of the feasibility of a main study of the psychological impact of a high security regime on the mental well - being of ( former ) inmates . On DATE a report entitled \u201c Care in and around the Maximum Security Prison \u201d ( Zorg in en om de Extra PERSON ) was issued by the researchers .

It was further concluded in the report that a study of the psychological impact of a high security regime was feasible . The researchers nevertheless emphasised that they had examined neither the quality of the care for the mental well - being of the ORG detainees , the actual psychological condition of the detainees nor the effects which the regime was having on them .", "CARDINAL .
