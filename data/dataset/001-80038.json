On DATE the applicant was officially registered as a religious association having legal - entity status under LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new LAW ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) entered into force . It required all religious associations that had previously been granted legal - entity status to bring their articles of association into conformity with the LAW and obtain re - registration from the competent ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG an application for re - registration , together with the documents required by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG refused re - registration of the applicant on the ground that its purpose and activities contradicted the requirements of LAW and violated LAW as there was an on - going criminal investigation against the then president of the applicant . The applicant indicated that the investigation had been subsequently closed in the absence of indications of a criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a second application for re - registration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy head of ORG informed the applicant that the second application had been refused . He wrote that the applicant had adopted a \u201c new version of the Charter \u201d , rather than \u201c amendments to the Charter \u201d , and had indicated that by the charter , the applicant \u201c may have \u201d , instead of \u201c shall be entitled to have \u201d , attached representative offices of foreign religious organisations . He also claimed that there had been other ( unspecified ) violations of NORP laws .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the then president of the applicant sent a letter to the GPE ORG inviting them to indicate specific violations . He relied on the requirement in section CARDINAL of LAW , pursuant to which the grounds for a refusal were to be set out explicitly .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the deputy head responded to the applicant that ORG was under no obligation to clarify or review charters or other documents and that it could only carry out legal evaluation of the submitted documents and give a decision either to grant or to refuse reregistration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having taken further steps to remedy any supposed defects in the documents , the applicant submitted its third application for registration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy head informed the applicant that the application could not be processed because it had submitted an incomplete set of documents . Following a written inquiry of the applicant of CARDINAL DATE as to what documents were missing , the deputy head informed the applicant on DATE that his ORG was not competent to indicate what information was missing and what additional documents were to be submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG a fourth , more detailed application for re - registration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the application would not be processed because it had allegedly submitted an incomplete set of documents . The missing documents were not specified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a fifth , still more detailed application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG repeated that the applicant had submitted an incomplete set of documents and the application would not be processed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the time - limit for re - registration of religious organisations expired .", "CARDINAL . NORP The president and co - founder of the applicant brought a complaint before ORG of GPE against ORG refusal to re - register the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nikulinskiy ORG of GPE gave judgment , finding that ORG decision of DATE had not had any basis in law . It established that the wordings used in the applicant 's charter were in fact identical to those contained in LAW and held that religious associations should not \u201c be required to reproduce the text of the law verbatim in their charter \u201d . The court stressed that ORG could have suggested an editorial revision of the charter without refusing the application as a whole .", "CARDINAL . ORG further held that the decision of DATE had not been lawful , either . It established that all the documents required by LAW had been appended to the application with the exception of a document confirming the existence of the religious group in the given territory for DATE . However , that document was not necessary because , in accordance with the ruling of ORG , religious organisations established before the adoption of LAW were not required to confirm their DATE existence .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that ORG had been \u201c in essence , using subterfuges to avoid re - registration [ of the applicant ] \u201d . It pointed out that such avoidance or refusals had violated the rights of the plaintiffs and their fellow believers guaranteed by LAW and CARDINAL of LAW because the parishioners whose association had no legal - entity status would not be able to rent LOC for religious ceremonies and worship , to receive and disseminate religious literature , to have bank accounts , etc . ORG also held that the refusal had been inconsistent with international standards of law , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and Article CARDINAL of LAW . ORG also referred to LAW and held that \u201c the refusal to grant legal - entity status to a religious entity imposes a practical restriction on the right of each person to profess his / her religion in community with others \u201d . ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c Hence , the justice authorities ' avoidance of re - registration of ORG under far - fetched pretexts contradicts the above mentioned laws of GPE and the international law . \u201d", "ORG ordered ORG to re - register the applicant .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not appeal against the judgment and it became binding and enforceable on DATE . However , ORG refused to comply with it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the president of the applicant obtained a writ of execution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted its sixth application along with the writ of execution mandating re - registration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to process the application , repeating that an incomplete set of documents had been submitted . No clarification as to the nature of the allegedly missing document(s ) was given .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the GPE ORG asked the GPE prosecutor to lodge an application for supervisory review which he did . The prosecutor 's application was granted by the ORG of ORG . On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment of DATE by way of supervisory review . In doing so , it relied on the following grounds . Concerning the lawfulness of the decision of DATE , the ORG criticised ORG for the failure to verify the compliance of the amendments to the charter submitted for re - registration on DATE with the law . As to the refusal of DATE , the ORG opined that the book Scientology : The Theology and Practice of a Contemporary Religion ( NORP edition ) did not provide sufficient information on \u201c the basic tenets of creed and practices of the religion \u201d as required by section CARDINAL of LAW and that the set of documents was therefore incomplete . The ORG remitted the matter for a new examination by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nikulinskiy ORG gave a new judgment . ORG ruled in favour of ORG and dismissed the complaint about the refusal to re - register the applicant . It found that the applicant had not complied with CARDINAL of LAW in that ( i ) the application for re - registration only included copies , rather than originals , of the charter and registration certificate ; ( ii ) the book submitted by the applicant did not qualify to be the \u201c information on the basic tenets of creed and practices of the religion \u201d , and ( iii ) the document indicating the legal address of the applicant was missing .", "CARDINAL . Before the court the plaintiffs unsuccessfully argued that ORG had had in its possession the original charter and registration certificate , as well as the applicant 's legal address , as these documents had been included in the first application for re - registration and ORG had never returned them . ORG concluded , nevertheless , that \u201c the fact that some documents were [ physically ] in the building of the ORG did not relieve the applicant of the obligation to submit a complete set of documents for registration \u201d . It affirmed that \u201c all required documents were to be submitted simultaneously \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal , endorsing ORG reasoning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a seventh application for re - registration . In observance with the domestic courts ' judgments the application included ( i ) the original charter and registration certificate ; ( ii ) \u201c information about the basic tenets of creed and practices \u201d in the form of a CARDINAL - page document instead of a book ; and ( iii ) a new document confirming the legal address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a new deputy head of ORG refused to process the application on the ground that the time - limit for re - registration of religious organisation had expired and that a civil action for the applicant 's dissolution ( see below ) was pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Nikulinskiy ORG refused ORG civil action for dissolution of the applicant , referring to ORG decision of DATE in the case of ORG of ORG , according to which a religious organisation could only be dissolved by a judicial decision if it was duly established that it had ceased its activity or had engaged in unlawful activities ( for a detailed description of the decision , see ORG of The ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ... ) . Since the applicant had on - going financial and economic activities , maintained balance sheets and staged events in municipal districts of GPE , and had not commited any wrongful acts , the action for its dissolution was dismissed . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the system for State registration of legal entities was reformed . A new ORG was established and the competence to make entries was delegated to ORG ) . However , in respect of religious organisations a special procedure was retained , under which the regional departments of ORG would still make the decision of whether to register a religious organisation , whilst formal processing of the approved application would pass to ORG . All existing legal entities were required to provide to local tax authorities certain updated information about themselves by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted its eighth application for re - registration to ORG , under the new procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to process the application , repeating that re - registration was no longer possible due to the expiry of the time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after ORG upheld the judgment refusing dissolution of the applicant , the applicant submitted a ninth application for re - registration . On DATE it also submitted the updated information required under the new procedure , to the local registering tax authority , ORG no . DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG , responded to the applicant 's letter of DATE in the following terms :", "\u201c ... a situation exits when , on one hand , the action of the [ GPE ORG ] seeking dissolution of your religious organisation has been refused , and , on the other hand , the very same court has upheld as lawful our decisions to leave the applications and documents for re - registration of this organisation unexamined , whereas the time - limit for re - registration established by law has expired . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant submitted a tenth application for re - registration , attaching the registration certificate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG left the tenth application unexamined , repeating once again that the time - limit had expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against ORG persistent refusal to re - register the applicant under LAW . It argued , in particular , that the actions of ORG constituted a breach of the rights to freedom of religion and association of the applicant and its members .

On DATE the Presnenskiy District Court of GPE dismissed the complaint , holding that LAW did not provide for a possibility to re - register religious organisations that had missed the time - limit for re - registration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case . It held as follows :", "\u201c ... failure to re - register within the established time - limit can not in itself serve as a basis ... for refusal to register amendments to the charter ... of a religious organisation upon expiry of the established time - limit ...", "Refusal of registration of amendments to the founding documents of a religious organisation restricts the rights of the organisation , and , as a consequence , those of its members , to determine independently the legal conditions of its existence and functioning . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presnenskiy District Court granted the applicant 's complaint against ORG . It found that LAW could not be interpreted as restricting a religious organisation 's ability to amend its founding documents after the expiry of the time - limit set for re - registration . ORG decision not to process the application for registration of the amended charter was therefore unlawful . ORG ordered ORG to re - register the applicant by way of registering its charter as amended in DATE .", "DATE . On DATE ORG upheld the interpretation of LAW given by ORG . However , it found that ORG was wrongly ordered to register the amended charter without reviewing its compliance with the law . ORG amended the operative part of the judgment and ordered ORG to examine the applicant 's application for registration in accordance with the established procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant re - submitted its application for registration to ORG , that is , the legal successor of ORG in matters of registration of religious organisations following a reform of the justice system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that its application would not be processed because it had not submitted a document confirming its presence in GPE for DATE .", "CARDINAL .

NORP By letter of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , ORG informed its departments that LAW did not establish a special procedure for re - registration of religious organisations . Since section QUANTITY required them to bring their founding documents into conformity with LAW , the applicable procedure was that for registration of amendments to the founding documents described in LAW . LAW provided that the procedure for registration of amendments was the same as that for registration of a religious organisation .", "CARDINAL .

In relation to religious organisations created earlier , that would be incompatible with the principle of equality enshrined in LAW , LAW and LAW and QUANTITY of the LAW of GPE , and would be an impermissible restriction on freedom of religion ( LAW ) and the freedom of [ voluntary ] associations to form and to carry out their activities ( LAW ) ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Moreover , some regional and local departments of ORG have refused to ( re)register certain religious communities , despite their registration at federal level .
