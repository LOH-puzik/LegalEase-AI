At the first hearing held on DATE the applicant again gave his evidence , in the presence of his chosen counsel . The next hearing , scheduled for DATE , was adjourned on a request by the applicant \u2019s counsel who explained , in a submission filed on DATE , that he had already planned a journey on DATE . The hearing scheduled for DATE was adjourned on account of the illness of the presiding judge .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , before a hearing scheduled for DATE his counsel contacted ORG by telephone and asked for an adjournment on account of his sudden illness .", "CARDINAL . At the beginning of the hearing the applicant asked that the hearing be adjourned and informed the court that he did not wish to defend himself in the absence of his counsel . The presiding judge , however , decided to hold the hearing . A counsel for the prosecution was also absent . The applicant , who had already given evidence at the previous hearings , gave additional evidence . The applicant \u2019s request that further witnesses be heard was dismissed . The applicant then gave his closing arguments . The hearing was concluded and a judgment was pronounced . The applicant was found guilty of using various items of computer software without the consent of the holder of the relevant licence . He was given a suspended sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment with a DATE probation period .", "CARDINAL . In an appeal lodged on DATE the applicant complained , inter alia , that the hearing of CARDINAL March CARDINAL had been held in the absence of his counsel although there had been a good reason for the latter \u2019s absence . He asserted that on TIME his counsel had contacted ORG by telephone . His call had been answered by an usher and the counsel had asked to speak to the presiding judge . However , the judge had not answered the call . Therefore , the counsel had asked the usher , PERSON , to inform the presiding judge about his inability to attend the hearing owing to his sudden illness . The usher had done so . The counsel \u2019s request that the hearing be adjourned on account of his sudden illness had not been noted in TIME of the hearing . The applicant enclosed a medical certificate for his counsel , of DATE , indicating that he had been given sick leave as of that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON u GPE ) upheld the first - instance judgment . It found that the presence of the applicant \u2019s counsel at the hearing held on DATE had not been necessary . The relevant part of the appellate judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c The ground for appeal raised by the defendant that the first - instance court had made a grave breach of the rules of LAW , Article CARDINAL ) , when it held a hearing in the absence of the defendant \u2019s counsel , this court finds unfounded . The facts established in TIME of the hearing held on DATE lead to the conclusion that , although the defendant requested the adjournment of the hearing on account of the justified absence of his counsel , the first - instance court assessed that the counsel \u2019s absence was not detrimental to the defence and therefore held a hearing and on DATE adopted a first - instance judgment . The conduct of the first - instance court has to be viewed in the light of a [ possible ] violation of the defence rights and an assessment of its effect on the judgment adopted [ by the first - instance court ] has to be made . The new facts presented by the defendant at that hearing , on account of which he asked for an adjournment claiming that his counsel was in possession of fresh evidence in connection with the purchase and the price of the \u201c Autocad \u201d software , could not have been of decisive importance for the crime [ at issue ] as such . That is because the [ first - instance ] court found the defendant guilty of the principal criminal offence under LAW in respect of which it is not relevant whether it resulted in significant financial gain or significant damage . Exactly for that reason the absence of the defence counsel at the hearing could not have been of influence for the adoption of the impugned judgment and its legality . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
