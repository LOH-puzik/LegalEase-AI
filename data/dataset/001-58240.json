These objections are , in summary , that the conduct which can be the ground for a binding - over order is too vaguely defined ; that binding - over orders when made are in terms which are too vague and are therefore potentially oppressive ; that the power to imprison someone if he or she refuses to consent to be bound over is anomalous ; that orders which restrain a subject \u2019s freedom can be made without the discharge of the criminal , or indeed any clearly defined , burden of proof ; and that witnesses , complainants or even acquitted defendants can be bound over without adequate prior information of any charge or complaint against them . \u201d ( Law Commission Report no .
