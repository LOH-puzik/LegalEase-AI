In DATE a court found that the applicant , who suffered from schizophrenia , had committed a number of criminal offences , including possession of drugs and aggravated robbery , and ordered his admission to a psychiatric hospital . The applicant was placed in a mental institution in GPE , where he remained until DATE , when he escaped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was arrested by the NORP border police for an unlawful attempt to cross the border . On DATE the Lychakivsky ORG sentenced him to DATE administrative detention . According to a certificate issued by ORG in PERSON , the applicant was detained from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the police opened a criminal investigation into the arson of vehicles belonging to a private company .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he was arrested by the police in GPE , a town near the NORP border , during a random identity search operation . He was taken to a police station and allegedly beaten up to force him to confess to the criminal offences . The following day the applicant confessed to having set a vehicle on fire on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A report indicated that the applicant was arrested on DATE . On DATE he wrote a statement , confessing to having burnt out a car together with an accomplice . The investigator assigned a legal - aid lawyer and questioned the applicant in his presence . The applicant again confessed to the arson attack . He also mentioned that DATE he had escaped from a psychiatric hospital , where he underwent treatment under a court \u2019s order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator asked ORG of GPE to order the applicant \u2019s placement in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the request was granted . ORG held that the applicant was charged with a serious criminal offence punishable by up to DATE imprisonment . His escape from a mental hospital and his lack of a permanent place of residence demonstrated his liability to abscond . Furthermore , relying on statements by a witness who had testified to having been approached by the applicant with a view to \u201c discussing charges against him \u201d , the court found that the applicant was prone to influencing witnesses and obstructing justice . It concluded that only detention could ensure the interests of justice .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was admitted to temporary detention facility no . GPE in GPE . He shared a cell with other detainees . There is no evidence suggesting that the detention authorities had made an effort to accommodate the applicant \u2019s mental disorder .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that after his admission to the detention facility the police officers who had allegedly beaten him up after the arrest had again driven him to the police station for questioning , had handcuffed him to a heating unit and had left him in that position until TIME . He had not been given food for DATE and had only twice been allowed to use a toilet .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant confessed to having blown up a car with an accomplice on DATE . He later repeated the confession at the crime scene .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the investigating authorities charged the applicant with a robbery committed on DATE . They also asked ORG to extend the applicant \u2019s detention pending investigation , claiming that the case was complex and that more time was necessary to complete the investigation . The defence argued that the applicant was in need of psychiatric treatment and that he therefore should be released and admitted to a mental institution . On DATE the court extended his detention until DATE , having considered that that there were no circumstances warranting the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . Another extension , based on the same reasoning , followed on DATE . The applicant was to be detained until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the investigators authorised a psychiatric expert examination of the applicant . In a report issued on DATE , psychiatrists indicated that the applicant suffered from paranoid continuous progressive schizophrenia and the initial stage of paraphrenia . The doctors also noted that that serious emotional disorder made the applicant particularly dangerous and thus called for his detention under constant psychiatric supervision .", "CARDINAL . Acting in response to the psychiatrists\u2019 findings , the authorities appointed , on DATE , a legal guardian to assist the applicant in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the pre - trial investigation was closed and the applicant was committed for trial before ORG of Belgorod . Referring to his diagnosis , the prosecution sought his admission to a psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG asking for a preliminary hearing to be held in his case . He disputed the charges and declared his innocence . Without submitting documentary evidence the applicant argued that he had been detained in GPE DATE and DATE and thus he had not committed any crime during that period . He also disagreed with the expert report of DATE , stating that a psychiatric hospital with a lighter security regime would be more appropriate for his condition . Lastly , he asked that his presence at the trial be ensured , as he doubted the efficiency of the legal aid . He noted that he had never met with his legal guardian .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held the preliminary hearing . The applicant was present . The court was to decide on the applicant \u2019s continued detention and the need for his personal presence at trial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his legal - aid counsel expressed different opinions on several matters . While the applicant insisted on his transfer from the ordinary detention facility to a psychiatric hospital , his legal guardian and legal - aid lawyer agreed to the extension of his detention . As regards the necessity of his presence , the applicant \u2019s counsel argued that it was desirable , but not necessary . The legal guardian submitted that the issue could be discussed at a later stage . The applicant strongly insisted on his personal participation , as he was afraid that otherwise he could be convicted of crimes which he had not committed .", "CARDINAL . Having heard the parties , the court ordered the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial and stated that the trial was to be held in his absence , as the personal participation of persons suffering from a mental disorder was not provided for by LAW for cases such as the one to be decided .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the decision of DATE , but DATE his claim was returned without examination on the merits . The court held that his lawyer or legal representative only had a right , under NORP law , to lodge an appeal in such category of cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court held a trial hearing in the presence of a prosecutor , the victims , their lawyers , the applicant \u2019s counsel and legal guardian .

It further read out statements by CARDINAL witnesses and studied the applicant \u2019s written confessions made on CARDINAL DATE and DATE . It examined other documents and material evidence . Neither the legal - aid counsel nor the legal guardian made any applications or objections . They did not ask any questions during the victim \u2019s cross - examination and did not challenge the admissibility of any item of evidence , including the applicant \u2019s confession . During their closing arguments the lawyer and the guardian acknowledged that the applicant had committed the impugned offences . They stated that owing to his mental disorder he should not bear criminal or civil responsibility and should be admitted to a high - security psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . It established that on DATE the applicant and his accomplice had set fire to a car ; that on DATE they had blown up another car and that on DATE they had committed a robbery . Relying on the psychiatric report of CARDINAL DATE the court ordered the applicant \u2019s treatment in a high - security psychiatric institution under intensive supervision . It held that the preventive measure in the form of the applicant \u2019s detention should remain unchanged until his admission to a psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . He also asked the court to provide him with the trial records from the first - instance court proceedings . The applicant argued that he had been unlawfully convicted of crimes he had not committed , that his confession had been given under pressure and that his defence team , comprising the legal - aid counsel and the legal guardian assigned against his will , had been manifestly ineffective . The applicant submitted that on DATE he had still been in detention in GPE and therefore he could not have blown up a car in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A similar complaint was filed with the ORG regional prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . Neither the applicant \u2019s counsel , nor his guardian lodged an appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for access to the trial records as such a request could only be lodged by his defence counsel or legal guardian . DATE ORG returned the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE , informing him that his lawyer or legal guardian were the only ones with the authority to appeal . A similar response arrived from the prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was enforced and the applicant was admitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP regional prosecutor \u2019s office applied to the ORG of ORG for supervisory review of the case referring to the breach of the applicant \u2019s right to defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the request was granted . Invoking Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of the LAW , the court held that the trial court \u2019s decision to hold the hearings in the applicant \u2019s absence had been unjustified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG acknowledged a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to defence , quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case to ORG for a fresh examination on the merits .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing in the case was to be held on DATE , but the court was unable to summon the applicant . The summons was returned with a note that the applicant could not be found at the indicated address . On DATE and DATE ORG repeatedly attempted to inform the applicant of the hearing by registered post and telegram . The summons was not served on the applicant as he had left the place of his residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that it could not proceed with the examination of the criminal case in view of the lack of any knowledge of his whereabouts . It returned the case to the investigating authorities with an order to find the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The parties did not inform ORG outcome of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the NORP town prosecutor \u2019s office about his arrest and subsequent ill - treatment . The complaint contained no references to bodily injuries or possible witnesses to the beatings . It was not supported by any other evidence .", "CARDINAL .
