The account of the investigation in GPE is based on the submissions by both parties .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are all nationals of the GPE . The first and third applicants were recruited in DATE and DATE respectively by an employment agency in GPE to work as maids or au pairs in GPE ( GPE ) . The second applicant travelled to GPE in DATE for the same purpose , at the suggestion of the first applicant , not via an agency . All of the applicants had their passports taken away by their employers . During the course of their work in GPE , they allege that they were subjected to ill - treatment and exploitation by their employers , who also failed to pay them their agreed wages and forced them to work TIME , under the threat of further ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant contacted an agency in GPE in order to find a job abroad . She is a single mother with CARDINAL daughter who was DATE at the time . She signed a contract in which she agreed to work for a family in GPE for DATE , from DATE until DATE . The contract also stipulated that she would be paid CARDINAL GPE dirhams ( AED \u2013 approximately CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) at that time ) per month to work for TIME each working day . Upon her arrival in GPE the first applicant was taken to her employers , who were CARDINAL sisters or sisters - in - law sharing CARDINAL large residence with their families . CARDINAL of them took possession of her passport .", "CARDINAL . For most of the initial DATE contract the first applicant was not subjected to physical abuse or direct threats of harm by her employers , and she was paid regularly . However , she had to work from TIME to TIME throughout the initial DATE period . Her duties included looking after her ORG children , preparing meals , cleaning the house , doing the laundry and numerous other jobs around the house and garden . During DATE she was required to perform DATE without DATE off , and was not allowed to leave the house unsupervised . She was not allowed to have her own telephone and was only allowed to call her family in the GPE once DATE , the costs of these calls being deducted from her wages . Further , the first applicant was forbidden from speaking to any of the other workers from the GPE in their native language . She was constantly hungry , as she was generally only given the family \u2019s leftover food . Only when she accompanied the family to the supermarket DATE was she allowed to buy some basic food for herself .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , the first applicant faced the first punishments by her employers . She was forced to sleep on the floor when they found out that she had been talking to another employee from the GPE in their native language . When she became ill after sleeping on the cold floor , her employers prevented her from buying medicine or contacting a doctor ; instead , she had to continue working TIME .", "CARDINAL . Towards the end of her DATE contract , the first applicant \u2019s employers informed her that they wished her to stay , and offered her better pay , DATE off and a telephone of her own , as well as permission to visit her family , provided that she recruited someone to take over her job while she was away .

While the first applicant was in the GPE , she received threats from her employers that if she did not return to GPE to work , she would be banned from ever going back there , and the second applicant would be subjected to ill - treatment . The first applicant therefore returned to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . After she returned to GPE , she was taught how to drive . After she failed her first driving test , she was forced to pay for further lessons and tests out of her own salary , with CARDINAL further driving tests costing LAW each , a DATE \u2019s salary . While she was driving , one of her employers hit her on the shoulder on a number of occasions to force her to speed up . The employer also started to slap or hit her regularly for no or little reason . She also repeatedly threatened to let her husband hit the first applicant if she did not follow her orders or made any mistakes .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant accompanied her employers on trips to LOC , GPE , GPE and GPE , where she spent significant amounts of time locked up in hotel rooms or under the close supervision of her employers . She only had to visit CARDINAL embassy in person to obtain entry documents , and that was in relation to a trip to GPE , at which time she was ordered by her employers to lie about her work conditions . When they arrived in GPE , the first applicant was not allowed at any time to leave the apartment in which they were staying .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was married with CARDINAL young children in the GPE . Her husband had no regular work . Because she expected better pay in GPE , she agreed to work for the same employers as the first applicant . The employers in GPE arranged a visiting visa for her , under false pretences . As a result of this arrangement , the second applicant did not approach the employment agency in the GPE and did not have a written contract with her employers . Her understanding was that she would get LAW per month , which would be paid directly to her family in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the second applicant started to work in GPE . After the first applicant returned to the GPE for DATE in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the employers significantly changed their conduct towards the second applicant . They threatened not to pay her family if she made any mistakes . They refused to let her leave GPE , including by refusing to return her passport and ordering her to repay them her travel costs and related expenses . They also told her that she would be put in prison if she ran away or went to the authorities in GPE for help . They physically and emotionally abused her , and there was CARDINAL incident when CARDINAL of her employers struck her across the shoulder using significant force . She was also forced to work from CARDINAL or TIME until TIME DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the violent and threatening behaviour of the employers increased . The second applicant was punched by CARDINAL of her employers on CARDINAL occasion , and in another incident the employer aimed a hard slap at her face , but instead struck her across the shoulder .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant \u2019s family were desperate for money to pay for crucial medical treatment for her brother . Therefore , in DATE she contacted an employment agency in the GPE and was offered work as a maid in GPE . She was informed that she would be earning CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL at that time ) per month , roughly twice her salary in the GPE . Upon her arrival in GPE in DATE she had to hand over her passport and mobile phone to someone supposedly working for the employment agency . She was told that these items would be returned to her when she finished her work in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant was working for a family member of the first and second applicants\u2019 employers . The applicants got to know each other , as the CARDINAL families met DATE . They secretly shared their experiences on these occasions .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant was also bound by TIME going from TIME . Her employer forced her to clean her car in the sun and in unbearable heat , and she was prohibited from going to the toilet without letting her employer know . She was only allowed to call her family in the GPE once DATE , and only in the presence of her employer . She did not receive any remuneration at all for DATE of her employment . Afterwards , she only received approximately ORG DATE , less than what had been agreed . On CARDINAL occasion she was slapped by her employer , and on a different occasion she witnessed another employee being hit over the head .", "CARDINAL . When the third applicant told her employer that she wished to return to the GPE , she was told that she would have to pay the cost of the flight and the agency fees , which her employer knew she could not afford at that point . Her employer also made it clear that , in any event , her passport would not be returned to her until she had completed DATE of work in GPE . Subsequently , the third applicant was too scared to ask to leave GPE again , owing to her fear that her employer would take her earnings from her or refuse to return her passport for an even longer period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 employers took them along on a short holiday trip to GPE . The applicants all stayed at the same hotel in the city centre of GPE . The applicants slept in their own , separate apartment together with the female children . The male children slept in the same apartment as their parents . As in GPE , the applicants had to take care of all of the ORG children and perform numerous other domestic duties . They were still required to work from CARDINAL or TIME or even later . The third applicant was regularly shouted at by her employer , for example if she failed to get all the children ready TIME . In addition , their employers woke the first applicant up at TIME and forced her to cook food for them . Furthermore , the first applicant was forced to carry the employers\u2019 CARDINAL suitcases into the hotel by herself . While the applicants were in GPE , their passports remained with their employers . In the hotel in GPE in which the applicants were staying , they became acquainted with ORG , an employee at the hotel who could speak LANGUAGE , the first applicant \u2019s mother tongue .", "CARDINAL . When the applicants accompanied their employers to a zoo DATE after their arrival in GPE , CARDINAL of the children went missing for some time . CARDINAL of the employers started screaming at the first and third applicants in a manner which the applicants had not experienced before . The first applicant found the level of verbal abuse extreme , and this was a particularly distressing and humiliating experience for her . The employer threatened to beat the third applicant , and said that \u201c something bad \u201d would happen to her if the child was not found safe and well . By this stage , the third applicant had formed the impression that this employer , of whom she lived in a constant state of fear , was a dangerous person who might try to hurt her very badly . She had the feeling that the violence towards her was likely to escalate at any time . Therefore , she believed that something bad was going to happen to her if she remained with the family . Similarly , the first applicant believed that they could not live with their conditions of work any longer , and did not want to risk waiting to see what happened if they travelled with their employers from GPE to GPE , as they were scheduled to do . The applicants therefore decided to speak to ORG , the LANGUAGE - speaking employee at the hotel , to see whether she could help them .", "CARDINAL . The night following the incident \u2013 that is , DATE after their arrival in GPE \u2013 the applicants left the hotel with the help of N. , who had organised a car to pick them up in a side street near the hotel and take them to a \u201c safe place \u201d . The applicants subsequently found support within the local NORP community in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE or DATE , DATE after they had left their employers , the applicants contacted a local NGO called \u201c LEF\u00d6 \u201d for assistance in reporting their ill - treatment , abuse and exploitation to the police . PERSON is actively involved in the fight against trafficking in human beings in GPE . It is financed though government funds , in particular for the provision of assistance to victims of trafficking . In DATE the applicants decided to turn to the NORP police and filed a criminal complaint ( PERSON ) against their employers . They explained that they had been the victims of human trafficking . On CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL DATE , accompanied by representatives of ORG , they were interviewed at length by officers from ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr ORG ) at ORG ( Bundeskriminalamt ) . In their report , the officers concluded that the offences had been committed abroad .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were informed that their employers had also made allegations about their conduct , alleging , inter alia , that they had stolen money and a mobile phone from them when they had fled the hotel . Those allegations were subsequently formally recognised by the NORP authorities as false . The applicants all expressed their willingness to actively cooperate with the authorities and to engage in criminal proceedings against their employers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office ( Staatsanwaltschaft Wien ) discontinued the proceedings under LAW ( Strafgesetzbuch \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) relating to human trafficking ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , pursuant to LAW ( Strafprozessordnung \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE the public prosecutor gave a short written decision with reasons for the discontinuation of the proceedings . In the public prosecutor \u2019s view , the offence had been committed abroad by non - nationals , and did not engage NORP interests within the meaning of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an application to continue the investigation ( Fortsetzungsantrag ) with ORG ( Straflandesgericht Wien ) . They submitted that NORP interests had indeed been engaged , and that their employers had continued to exploit and abuse them in GPE . In their view , the elements of the crime punishable under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG had been present .", "CARDINAL . The GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office then submitted a statement to ORG , specifying its reasons for discontinuing the investigation . There had been no indication in the case file that any of the criminal actions exhaustively listed in LAW had occurred in GPE , particularly since the offence had already been completed in GPE ( zumal das Delikt bereits in GPE vollendet wurde ) , and the accused were not NORP citizens . Furthermore , from the ORG statements ( looking after children , washing laundry , cooking food ) , it did not appear that they had been exploited in GPE , especially since they had managed to leave their employers DATE after their arrival in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 application . The relevant parts of the decision read ( translation from NORP ) :", "\u201c The decision to discontinue [ criminal proceedings ] requires DATE by implication \u2013 that the facts of a case are sufficiently clear , or a lack of indication that investigations would be promising .", "There is no reason for further prosecution if , on the basis of the ... results of the investigation , a conviction is no more likely than an acquittal ...", "According to LAW , if NORP interests have been harmed by the offence or the perpetrator can not be extradited , NORP criminal laws apply independently of the criminal laws of the place where the crime was committed , for example in relation to the offence of kidnapping for ransom under LAW . Owing to the fact that the applicants spent DATE in GPE , the conditions regarding the fulfilment of the elements of the crime under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG have not been met , since the relevant acts relating to the exploitation of labour must be committed over a longer period of time ; therefore , the commission of the offence in GPE is ruled out .", "The jurisdiction of the NORP criminal - law enforcement authorities can not be deduced from LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG either .", "NORP interests are engaged if either the victim or the perpetrator is an NORP citizen , or if the criminal acts have a concrete connection to GPE , or if an obligation arises under international law in relation to the prosecution of certain offences . NORP interests are , in any event , engaged if a criminal offence under LAW , CARDINAL , ORG or CARDINAL of the ORG is committed against an NORP citizen , or if NORP funds or NORP securities ( Wertpapiere ) are the subject of offences under LAW , or LAW in conjunction with LAW , of the ORG .", "The applicants\u2019 argument that the elements of the crime under LAW had also been fulfilled in GPE therefore fails , and the plea that the alleged criminal actions against them by their employers in GPE ... would lead to an obligation on the part of GPE under international law is likewise not convincing . In relation to the present case , [ this latter argument ] also can not be inferred from the quoted [ ORG ] judgment no . CARDINAL Os CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which affirmed that NORP interests had been damaged as a result of the import into GPE of a large amount of narcotics for transport ... \u201d", "This decision was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE of the CARDINAL applicants lodged a civil claim against their employers with ORG ) in order to claim their wages . However , they alleged that because of the high risk of having to pay the costs of the proceedings because the employers did not reside in GPE , they withdrew the action .", "CARDINAL . The NGO LEF\u00d6 not only assisted the applicants in filing a criminal complaint against their employers , but also supported them in applying for a special residence permit in GPE for victims of human trafficking , under the former section CARDINAL of LAW ( Niederlassungs- und DATE see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .
