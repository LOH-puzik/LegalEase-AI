The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At birth , she was registered as male , with the forenames PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before LOC , asking it to change her forenames to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request . The court found that the conditions under LAW ( PERSON \u00fcber die GPE der FAC die Feststellung der Geschlechtszugeh\u00f6rigkeit in besonderen NORP ) were met in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having heard the applicant and having regard to the written opinions of the psychiatric experts Prof . NORP and PERSON of DATE DATE , and of the psychological expert Prof . NORP of CARDINAL DATE , considered that the applicant was a male - to - female transsexual . It noted that , although Prof . NORP and PERSON had indicated that the applicant was not a typical transsexual , LAW required only that the condition of transsexuality be met , irrespective of the particular form it took . Moreover , the court found that the experts had convincingly shown that the applicant had been for DATE under the constraint of living according to these tendencies and that there was a high probability that the she would not change these tendencies in the future .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , brought an action with ORG against a NORP health insurance company . Having been affiliated to this company since DATE , she claimed reimbursement of pharmaceutical expenses for hormone treatment . She further requested a declaratory judgment to the effect that the defendant company was liable to reimburse PERCENT of the expenses for gender reassignment operations and further hormone treatment . As an employee of ORG , she was entitled to allowances covering CARDINAL of her medical expenses ; the private health insurance was to cover the other CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to take expert evidence on the questions of whether or not the applicant was a male - to - female transsexual ; whether or not her kind of transsexuality was a disease ; whether or not the gender reassignment operation was the necessary medical treatment for the transsexuality ; and whether or not this treatment was generally recognised by medical science .", "CARDINAL . NORP The psychiatrist PERSON , having examined the applicant in DATE , delivered his opinion in DATE . In his conclusions , he confirmed that the applicant was a male - to - female transsexual and that her transsexuality had to be regarded as a disease . He further indicated that gender reassignment surgery was not the only possible medical treatment in cases of transsexuality . In the applicant \u2019s case , he recommended such an operation from a psychiatric - psychotherapeutic point of view , as it would improve her social situation . He noted that gender reassignment surgery was not generally recognised by medical science and that there were several comments in the specialised literature questioning whether the operation was effective ; however , it could be assumed that the fact that transsexuals accepted themselves and their bodies contributed to their stabilisation . According to him , many transsexuals reached such stability only after an operation . In his view , this was the case for the applicant and an operation should therefore be approved . The expert concluded that the gender reassignment operation formed part of the curative treatment of a mental disease .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following an oral hearing , dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims . The court considered that under the relevant provisions of ORG ( Allgemeine Versicherungsbedingungen ) governing the contractual relations between the applicant and her private health insurance company , the applicant was not entitled to reimbursement of medical treatment regarding her transsexuality .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , the court , having regard to the opinion prepared by Dr H. and to the expert opinions prepared in the proceedings before LOC , considered that the applicant was a male - to - female transsexual and that her condition had to be regarded as a disease . The question whether the treatment in question was recognised by medical science was irrelevant . In the court \u2019s view , hormone treatment and gender reassignment surgery could not reasonably be considered as necessary medical treatments . Having regard to the relevant case - law of ORG , the court found that the applicant ought first to have had recourse to less radical means , namely an extensive course of CARDINAL psychotherapy sessions , as proposed by the psychiatric expert Prof . NORP and terminated by the applicant after CARDINAL sessions ( according to the Government , the original manuscript decision referred to CARDINAL sessions ) . The court was not convinced that , on account of the applicant \u2019s resistance to therapy , the intended operation was the only possible treatment .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG found that the evidence did not show conclusively that the gender reassignment measures would relieve the applicant \u2019s physical and mental difficulties , a further criterion for assuming their medical necessity . The expert PERSON had merely recommended the operation from a psychiatric - psychotherapeutic point of view , as it would improve the applicant \u2019s social situation . His submissions , according to which the effect of gender reassignment surgery was often overrated , did not show that the gender reassignment measures were necessary for medical reasons . The court had not , therefore , been required , of its own motion , to summon the expert to explain his opinion orally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . In the written appeal submissions , the applicant objected to the findings of ORG in so far as they denied the necessity of gender reassignment measures . The applicant also submitted that she had unsuccessfully attended CARDINAL psychotherapy sessions . In this connection , she referred to the written expert opinions and also mentioned the possibility of taking evidence from these experts .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant underwent gender reassignment surgery . According to her , having been unfit for work since DATE , she had agreed with the physician treating her that her suffering would not permit her to await the outcome of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following an oral hearing , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . ORG valued the claims at stake at MONEY .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant was a male - to - female transsexual and that , according to the opinion of the expert PERSON , her transsexuality constituted a disease , a matter not in dispute between the parties to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Referring to clause CARDINAL of ORG , ORG upheld ORG conclusions that the expert PERSON had not confirmed the necessity of gender reassignment measures . ORG had regard to various passages of the expert opinion . Thus , it noted that the expert had considered gender reassignment surgery as CARDINAL possible medical treatment ; however , the question of necessity could not be clearly affirmed given the diverging scientific opinions and results . In his view , consensus existed on the improved psycho - social situation following the change of the sexual role , although the effect of the operation as such was often overrated . In the applicant \u2019s case , the advantages of an operation would , in the expert \u2019s view , prevail , while psychotherapy could not cure the transsexuality on account of the applicant \u2019s chronic narcissistic character structure ; even extended psychotherapy was not likely to result in any changes . Turning to the expert \u2019s statement that gender reassignment was not the only possible curative treatment , but recommendable from a psychiatric - psychotherapheutic point of view in order to improve the applicant \u2019s social situation , ORG found that , with this cautious formulation , the expert had not clearly affirmed the necessity of an operation . The applicant had therefore failed to prove that the conditions for reimbursement of medical treatment were met in her case . ORG added that , while the expert had mentioned that the gender reassignment operation \u201c formed part of the curative treatment of a mental disease \u201d , taking his other statements into account , he had regarded success as rather uncertain . Such a vague hope could not justify the necessity of medical treatment , bearing the aim of health insurance in mind . Thus , the health insurance had to bear only costs of treatment suitable to cure a disease . In the applicant \u2019s case , the expert had explained that gender reassignment measures could not be expected to cure the applicant \u2019s transsexuality , but at best to improve her psycho - social situation . This result was insufficient , as such an improvement did not affect the applicant \u2019s transsexuality as such . With regard to these remaining doubts , ORG concluded that the applicant had failed to prove the necessity of her treatment .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further considered that , in any event , the applicant was not entitled to reimbursement under clause CARDINAL ) of ORG on the ground that she had herself deliberately caused the disease , as argued by the defendant in earlier submissions .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the details of her case history as contained in the expert opinion of Dr O. of DATE , ORG found in particular that the applicant was born as a male child and did not claim that she was a female on account of chromosomal factors . Initially , she had not adopted female behaviour . On account of her male orientation , she had been able to resist feelings that she would have preferred to be a girl and that this would have been more appropriate , and had controlled her emotional life at an early stage .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant had continued to live as a man . In its view , the applicant \u2019s \u201c fear of bigger boys \u201d at school was not gender - specific . Furthermore , applying to join the armed forces did not indicate female feelings , and she had left the armed forces not because of the feeling that she was a \u201c woman \u201d but because she had experienced degrading treatment . The applicant had married in DATE , likewise a sign of her male orientation at that time . As from DATE , the spouses had wished to have a child .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the \u201c turning - point \u201d , as stated by the applicant , had been the moment when , after an unsuccessful operation in DATE , she had realised that she was infertile . ORG quoted the following passage from the expert opinion of DATE :", "\u201c The recognition that he was infertile is a decisive factor confirming the subsequent transsexual development . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It continued in the following terms :", "\u201c Fully aware of this position , the plaintiff concluded for herself : \u2018 If you can not have children , you are not a man\u2019 , and as a consequence she went CARDINAL step further and wanted to be a woman from then on . She had never otherwise felt that she was , or that she had to become , a woman , but was merely making a statement that she could do without a penis and still have satisfying relations with his [ sic ] wife ... Doing without the one is not the same as an irresistible desire for the other . In furtherance of the self - imposed goal of wishing to be a woman , from DATE without medical advice , assistance or instruction \u2013 she took female hormones ...", "That was deliberate . Having recognised \u2013 no doubt painfully \u2013 that she could not have children , she decided to distance herself from her past as a man ... It was this deliberate act of self - medication that led the plaintiff ever more to her decision that she wanted to be a woman and to look like one , although it was biologically impossible . This was based on her limited preparedness or ability to reflect critically ... but was wrongfully deliberate because the plaintiff was at all events at that stage in a position to see what the consequences of her \u2018 self - medication\u2019 would be , and to act accordingly .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . The German Transsexuals Act ( ORG \u00fcber die GPE der FAC die Feststellung der Geschlechtszugeh\u00f6rigkeit in besonderen NORP ) of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG I , p. DATE ) was adopted following the decision of DATE of ORG according to which the refusal to change the sex of a post - operative transsexual in the register of births was an unjustified interference with human dignity and everyone \u2019s fundamental right to develop his personality freely ( Reports of ORG , BVerfGE DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW govern the conditions , procedures and legal consequences of a change of a transsexual \u2019s forenames without gender reassignment surgery . Under section CARDINAL , persons may request that their forenames be changed if , on account of their transsexual orientation , they no longer feel they belong to the sex recorded in the register of births , they have been for DATE under the constraint of living according to these tendencies , and if there is a high probability that they will not change this orientation in the future . The competent civil courts have to obtain CARDINAL medical expert opinions in order to establish whether the medical conditions are met ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Following gender reassignment surgery , section CARDINAL provides for a change of the sex entered in the register of births , if , in addition to the conditions laid down in section CARDINAL , the persons concerned are not married and are not able to procreate . The forenames will be changed , if proceedings under section CARDINAL have not yet taken place .", "CARDINAL .

Subsequently , further reform legislation was enacted . Under the relevant provisions , persons insured under the health system are entitled to medical treatment which is necessary in order to diagnose or to cure a disease , in order to prevent its aggravation or to offer relief for its symptoms .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( Reports of Decisions , ORG , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , confirmed the lower social courts\u2019 decisions that the cost of gender reassignment surgery had to be reimbursed if , in the circumstances of the individual case , the psychophysical state of the transsexual amounted to a disease and if gender reassignment was the sole means of finding relief , psychiatric and psychotherapeutic treatment having remained unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . The basic rules for private health insurance , as for any other private insurance , are laid down in LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber den GPE ) of DATE , as amended . According to section CARDINAL.b , private health insurance covers expenses for curative treatment which is medically necessary on account of a disease or injuries suffered as a result of an accident or for other medical services for illness , as far as stipulated in the contract . The insurer is exempted from liability if the insured person has deliberately caused his or her own disease or accident ( section CARDINAL.l ) . The contractual relations are standardised in general insurance conditions .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in a decision of DATE ( ORG , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , endorsed the lower court \u2019s finding that gender reassignment surgery had to be considered as necessary medical treatment of a disease if the insured person \u2019s change of gender had been recognised under sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE in PERSON ORG . DATE , p. I-CARDINAL ) , ORG ( ECJ ) found that discrimination arising from gender reassignment constituted discrimination on grounds of sex and , accordingly , LAW of DATE , on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment , vocational training and promotion and working conditions , precluded dismissal of a transsexual for a reason related to a gender reassignment . It held , rejecting the argument of ORG that the employer would also have dismissed PERSON if PERSON had previously been a woman and had undergone an operation to become a man , that", "\u201c ... [ w]here a person is dismissed on the ground that he or she intends to undergo or has undergone gender reassignment , he or she is treated unfavourably by comparison with persons of the sex to which he or she was deemed to belong before undergoing gender reassignment .", "To tolerate such discrimination would be tantamount , as regards such a person , to a failure to respect the dignity and freedom to which he or she is entitled and which the ORG has a duty to safeguard . \u201d ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , in PERSON v. ORG ( C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG . DATE , p. GPE ) , the ECJ clarified the resulting position as follows", "\u201c ... That reasoning , which leads to the conclusion that such discrimination is to be prohibited just as is discrimination based on the fact that a person belongs to a particular sex , is limited to the case of a worker \u2019s gender reassignment and does not therefore apply to differences of treatment based on a person \u2019s sexual orientation .", "...", "...
