The applicants , PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) and PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) , who are wife and husband , are NORP nationals of NORP origin and were born in GPE in DATE and DATE respectively . They live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant left GPE on DATE and entered GPE illegally on DATE after travelling from GPE .", "CARDINAL . He applied for asylum DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant left GPE at a later date in order to join the second applicant in GPE as they had been engaged to be married . She entered GPE illegally on DATE after travelling from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants married in GPE on DATE and the first applicant applied for asylum on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 asylum applications were examined jointly by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG held an interview with the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Their applications were dismissed on DATE on the ground that they did not fulfil the requirements of LAW of DATE ( as amended up to DATE ) , in that they had not shown that they had a well - founded fear of persecution for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular group or political opinion or a well - founded fear of serious and unjustified harm for other reasons . ORG noted that there had been contradictions in the account of facts given by the second applicant with regard to his participation in a demonstration concerning the PERSON events which raised doubts as to his credibility . Furthermore , it considered that there was no possibility of the second applicant being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment if returned to GPE . Consequently , it held that the asylum applications had not been substantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decision was upheld and the appeal dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The Reviewing Authority underlined the contradictions and inconsistencies in the second applicant \u2019s claims . It pointed out that he had not given the same reasons for leaving GPE in his written application and in his interview . In the former he had stated that he had come to GPE to find work whereas in his interview he claimed that he had left GPE because he feared arrest following his participation in a demonstration . Further , ORG gave weight to the fact that the second applicant had stated that following the demonstration he had allegedly participated in , nothing had actually happened to him and that he had not been sought by the authorities . In his asylum application he had stated that he had not been arrested , detained , harassed , persecuted or wanted by the NORP authorities . He had also been able to leave GPE legally . The second applicant \u2019s claims were therefore unsubstantiated . No issue arose in respect of the first applicant as she had stated that she had left GPE in order to join the second applicant and marry him and had admitted that she did not face any problems in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded by observing that the applicants had not established that they were at risk of persecution if they returned to GPE . Nor did they satisfy the conditions for temporary residence on humanitarian grounds .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the second applicant brought a \u201c recourse \u201d ( judicial review proceedings ) before ORG ( first - instance revisional jurisdiction ) under LAW challenging the decision of ORG . A subsequent application to amend the recourse by adding the first applicant as a complainant was withdrawn as the time - limit of DATE had in the meantime expired ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed the present applications with the ORG . The second applicant , in his application form stated that on DATE he had taken part in a demonstration in his village in PERSON . The purpose of the demonstration was to go to PERSON to show solidarity with the NORP demonstrators following the events of DATE . Following the intervention of the authorities this had not been possible . The second applicant stated that the police had attacked the demonstrators killing CARDINAL persons . After going into hiding for DATE in a neighbouring village , the second applicant was arrested in PERSON . He was detained for DATE and subjected to torture . He was subsequently transferred to the central prison of GPE where he was detained for DATE . After bribing the authorities he was released on the condition that he would present himself to the authorities in GPE DATE . He did not do so , however , out of fear to be detained and tortured again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s recourse . It upheld ORG decision of DATE after examining all the grounds of annulment put forward by the second applicant . The court noted , inter alia , that the main ground for which the second applicant \u2019s asylum claim had not been accepted was the lack of plausibility of his principal allegations and the existence of significant contradictions and omissions which had undermined his credibility . The second applicant had not substantiated that he was at risk of persecution if returned to GPE because he had allegedly participated in a demonstration . Furthermore , the fact that the second applicant was of NORP origin was not sufficient in itself to justify the granting of refugee status . ORG also held that new grounds and allegations concerning his detention , arrest and ill - treatment following the events could not be taken into account . Its jurisdiction under LAW was limited to reviewing his claim as it had been made before ORG and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Grounds for annulment that had not been put before ORG could not be examined for the first time by the court .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged against the first instance judgment .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE ORG and other NORP from GPE organised a demonstration in GPE , near ORG , ORG and ORG . They were protesting against the restrictive policies of ORG in granting international protection . CARDINAL NORP from GPE , including the applicants , remained in the area around the clock , having set up CARDINAL tents on the pavement . According to the ORG , the encampment conditions were unsanitary and protesters were obstructing road and pedestrian traffic . The encampment had become a hazard to public health and created a public nuisance . The protesters performed their DATE chores on the pavement , including cooking and washing in unsanitary conditions . The sewage pits had overflown , causing a nuisance and offensive odours . The public lavatories were dirty and the rubbish bins of the Government buildings were being used and , as a result , were continuously overflowing . Furthermore , the protesters were unlawfully obtaining electricity from ORG . Members of the public who lived or worked in the area had complained to the authorities . The Government submitted that efforts had been made by the authorities to persuade the protesters to leave , but to no avail . As a result , the authorities had decided to take action to remove the protesters from the area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE instructions were given by the Minister of the Interior to proceed with the deportation of NORP - NORP failed asylum seekers in the normal way .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister requested the Chief of Police , among others , to take action in order to implement his instructions . Further , he endorsed suggestions made by the competent authorities that deportation and detention orders be issued against NORP - NORP failed asylum seekers who had passports and did not have PERSON or PERSON status and that the police execute the orders starting with the ones issued against the leaders of the protesters . The police were also directed to take into account the policy guidelines and to use discreet methods of arrest .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , letters were sent by ORG to a number of failed NORP - NORP asylum - seekers informing them that they had to make arrangements to leave GPE in view of their asylum applications being turned down ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ( extracts ) ) . They submitted a copy of such a letter which was dated DATE and addressed to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . From documents submitted by the Government it appears that from DATE until DATE the authorities kept the area under surveillance and kept a record of the NORP DATE activities and of all comings and goings . In the relevant records it is noted that invariably , between TIME a.m. and TIME , things were , in general , quiet , and everyone was sleeping apart from those keeping guard . During the above - mentioned period a large - scale operation was organised by ORG , \u201c ERU \u201d ( \u201c FAC ) , and a number of other authorities , including the Police Aliens and Immigration Unit , for the removal of the protesters and their transfer to the ORG headquarters for the purpose of ascertaining their status on a case - by - case basis .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , CARDINAL DATE and DATE orders for the detention and deportation of CARDINAL failed asylum seekers were issued following background checks . Letters were sent by ORG of ORG to the Director of ORG and ORG , containing a short paragraph with information as to the immigration status of each person . This information included the date of rejection of the asylum application or the closure of the asylum file by ORG , the date of dismissal of the appeal by ORG , where lodged , and the date some of those concerned had been included on the authorities\u2019 \u201c stop list \u201d ( a register of individuals whose entry into and exit from GPE is banned or subject to monitoring ) . The letters recommended the issuance of deportation and detention orders . The Government submitted copies of CARDINAL such letters with information concerning CARDINAL people .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , letters were also prepared in LANGUAGE by ORG informing those concerned of the decision to detain and deport them . The Government submitted that , at the time , the authorities did not know whether those individuals were among the protesters .", "CARDINAL . The removal operation was carried out on DATE , TIME with the participation of CARDINAL officers from ORG , the ERU , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG . The protesters , including the applicants , were led to buses , apparently without any reaction or resistance on their part . At TIME the mini buses carrying the male protesters left . The women , children and babies followed at CARDINAL a.m. A total of CARDINAL people were located at the place of protest and were transferred to the ORG headquarters : CARDINAL men , CARDINAL women and QUANTITY children . Upon arrival , registration took place and the status of each person was examined using computers which had been specially installed DATE . The Government submitted that during this period the protesters had not been handcuffed or put in cells but had been assembled in rooms and given food and drink . It appears from the documents submitted by the Government that by TIME the identification of CARDINAL of the group had been completed and that the whole operation had ended by CARDINAL p.m.", "CARDINAL . It was ascertained that CARDINAL of the adults , along with their CARDINAL children , were in the Republic unlawfully . Their asylum applications had either been dismissed or their files closed for failure to attend interviews . Those who had appealed to ORG had had their appeals dismissed . Some final decisions dated back to DATE . A number of people had also been included on the authorities\u2019 \u201c stop list \u201d . PERSON orders had already been issued for CARDINAL of them ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The authorities deported CARDINAL people on DATE at TIME ( CARDINAL adults and QUANTITY children ) . CARDINAL people ( QUANTITY men and QUANTITY women ) , including the applicants , were arrested . The persons against whom deportation and detention orders had been issued on DATE were detained under these orders . The remaining persons , including the applicants , were charged with the criminal offence of unlawful stay in the LOC under section LOC ) of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They were all arrested and transferred to various detention centres in GPE . The applicants were placed in the immigration detention facilities in LOC ( FAC and CARDINAL respectively ) . Further , on humanitarian grounds , QUANTITY women whose husbands were detained pending deportation and who had a total of CARDINAL children between them were not arrested themselves .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government the applicants and their co - detainees were informed orally that they had been arrested and detained on the basis that they had been staying in the ORG unlawfully and were thus \u201c prohibited immigrants \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They were also informed of their rights pursuant to ORG Detained Law CARDINAL ( LAW ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and , in particular , of their right to contact by phone , in person and in private , a lawyer of their own choice . The applicants submitted that they had not been informed of the reasons for their arrest and detention on that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE letters were sent by ORG of ORG to the Director of ORG and ORG , recommending the issuance of deportation and detention orders . The letters contained a short paragraph in respect of each person with information as to his or her immigration status . This included the date of rejection of the asylum application or the closure of the asylum file by ORG and the date of dismissal of the appeal by ORG where lodged . Some letters also referred to the date the asylum application had been lodged and the date some of the individuals concerned had been included on the authorities\u2019 \u201c stop list \u201d . The Government submitted copies of letters concerning CARDINAL people ( most of these letters referred to groups of people ) .", "CARDINAL . Deportation and detention orders were also issued in NORP on DATE in respect of the remaining CARDINAL people detained ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , including the applicants , pursuant to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON on the ground that they were \u201c prohibited immigrants \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(k ) of that PERSON . These were couched in identical terms . In respect of CARDINAL people the orders also mentioned sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , letters were prepared in LANGUAGE by ORG informing all the detainees individually , including the applicants , of the decision to detain and deport them . The Government submitted CARDINAL copies of these letters , including those addressed to the applicants , the text of which was virtually identical , a standard template having been used .", "The text of the letter reads as follows :", "\u201c You are hereby informed that you are an illegal immigrant by virtue of paragraph ( k ) . section CARDINAL , LAW law , LAW , as amended until DATE , because you of illegal entry [ sic ]", "Consequently your temporary residence permit / migration permit has been revoked and I have proceeded with the issue of deportation orders and detention orders dated DATE against you .", "You have the right to be represented before me , or before any other ORG and express possible objections against your deportation and seek the services of an interpreter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The only differences was that some letters referred to illegal stay rather than illegal entry and that the letters issued earlier referred to DATE as the date of issuance of the deportation and detention orders ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On the copy of the letters to the applicants provided by the Government , there is a handwritten signed note by a police officer stating that the letters were served on the applicants on DATE but that they refused to receive and sign for them . The other letters had a similar note or stamp on them with the same date , stating that the person concerned had refused to sign for and/or receive the letter . In a letter dated DATE the Government stated that the applicants had been served on DATE . In their subsequent observations the Government submitted , however , that this was the second attempt to serve the letters , the first attempt having been made on DATE , that is , the day of the arrest .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that they had never refused to receive any kind of information in writing . They claimed that it had only been on DATE that they had been informed orally that they would be deported to GPE on DATE but that the deportation and detention orders were not served on them on that date or subsequently . They submitted that they had eventually been informed by their lawyer , following the receipt of information submitted by the Government to the ORG in the context of the application of Rule CARDINAL of ORG , that deportation and detention orders had been issued against them .", "CARDINAL . From the documents submitted by the Government , it appears that CARDINAL of the detainees were to be deported on DATE ( this figure is stated in documents submitted by the Government with no further details ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , the applicants , along with CARDINAL other persons of NORP origin , submitted a Rule CARDINAL request in order to prevent their imminent deportation to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the First Section decided to apply Rule CARDINAL , indicating to the respondent Government that the detainees should not be deported to GPE until ORG had had the opportunity to receive and examine all the documents pertaining to their claim . The parties were requested under LAW ( a ) of ORG to submit information and documents concerning the asylum applications and the deportation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the First Section reconsidered the application of Rule CARDINAL in the light of information provided by the parties . He decided to maintain the interim measure in respect of CARDINAL cases , including the present ones . Rule CARDINAL was lifted with regard to the CARDINAL remaining cases ( for further details see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Rule DATE was subsequently lifted with regard to CARDINAL cases , but remained in force in the present CARDINAL applications .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed habeas corpus applications with ORG claiming that their continued detention from DATE had violated LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of ORG and of ORG on common standards and procedures in Members states for returning illegally staying third - country nationals , \u201c the EU Returns Directive \u201d . The applicants , relying on the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON v. GPE , DATE , ( Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) and the ORG \u2019s report in PERSON v. GPE ( no . ORG report of CARDINAL DATE ) also claimed that their detention had breached LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and LAW ( see GPE , \u00a7 DATE , cited above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG set the applications for directions for DATE . On that date the ORG asked for DATE so they could file an objection to the applications . They were given until DATE and the habeas corpus applications were set for hearing on DATE . The parties were also requested to prepare a short note with the issues they would address and to produce it on DATE of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The Government filed their objection on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parties appeared before the court and submitted their written addresses . The hearing of the applications was held . Judgment was reserved on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applications . With regard to the preliminary issues raised , ORG first of all held that it had the competence to examine the applications as it was called upon to examine the lawfulness of the applicants\u2019 protracted detention and within the context of a habeas corpus application , examine the conformity of their detention with LAW ) of ORG and LAW ( CARDINAL ) not the lawfulness of the deportation and detention orders . The applicants were not estopped from bringing a habeas corpus application just because they had not challenged the deportation and detention orders issued against them . Even if the lawfulness of the detention was assumed , detention for the purpose of deportation could not be indefinite and the detainee left without the right to seek his release . ORG also rejected the argument that the applicants were estopped from bringing the application because their continued detention had been brought about by their own action , that is , by their application to ORG for an interim measure suspending their deportation .", "CARDINAL . ORG then examined the substance of the applications . It noted that the EU Returns Directive had direct effect in the domestic law , as the period for transposition had expired and the Directive had not been transposed . It could therefore be relied on in the proceedings . However , it went on to hold that the DATE period provided for in the Directive had not yet started to run . The applicants had been arrested on DATE with a view to their deportation but had not been deported by the Government in view of the application by ORG on DATE of Rule DATE and the issuing of an interim measure suspending their deportation . Consequently , the authorities had not been able to deport them even though , as they stated before the court , they had been ready to do so from DATE . As the applicants themselves had taken steps to suspend their deportation , the ensuing time could not be held against the Government and could not be taken into account for the purposes of LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the Directive . The DATE period would start to run from the moment that the interim measure had been lifted . From that moment onwards the Government had been under an obligation in accordance with LAW to proceed with the applicants\u2019 deportation with due diligence . The situation would have been different if the deportation had not been effected owing to delays attributable to the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the ORG complaints under LAW ) of LAW and LAW were concerned , ORG distinguished the applicants\u2019 situation from those in the cases they relied on and in which responsibility for the protracted detention lay with the authorities . Further , it held that it had not been shown that the continued detention of the applicants had been arbitrary , abusive and contrary to the ORG \u2019s case - law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged CARDINAL separate appeals with ORG ( appellate jurisdiction ) on DATE . Another CARDINAL appeals were lodged at the same time by PERSON ( see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , cited above ) and another NORP of NORP origin ( see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sent a letter dated DATE to ORG requesting that the appeals be fixed for pre - trial within a \u201c short period of time \u201d and then for hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were released on CARDINAL DATE following revocation of the deportation and detention orders of DATE by the Permanent Secretary of ORG . They were informed on CARDINAL DATE by a letter dated CARDINAL DATE that they would be issued with a special residence / employment permit under the Aliens and Immigration PERSON and the relevant LAW for a period of DATE from the date of their release with a possibility of further renewal . However , prior to the issuance of this permit they were obliged to sign a contract of employment with an employer indicated and approved by ORG . The applicants were also asked to report to the police once DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicants that one of the other appeals that had been filed at the same time as theirs was set down for hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyer filed an application for joining the CARDINAL appeals ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an order joining the appeals and also instructed the parties to file their written addresses . The applicants submitted that on this date the court was informed that they had been released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed an application requesting an extension of DATE for filing their written addresses . These were filed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeals were set for directions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government filed an application requesting the parties to appear before ORG and requested a DATE extension for filing their written address . This was granted and the appeals were set down for hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the Government filed their written address on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hearing was held and judgment was reserved .", "CARDINAL . The appeals were dismissed on DATE . ORG held that as the applicants had , in the meantime , been released , the application was without object ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that following their release on CARDINAL DATE the authorities did not grant them residence permits . The applicants were not able to fulfil the terms and conditions imposed by ORG in order to have residence permits . Their issuing was subject to finding an employer approved by ORG and to present to the immigration authorities an approved contract of employment . The applicants could not find and/or were not referred by ORG to an approved employer despite their numerous attempts to that effect . Their situation was explained to the competent authorities in a letter dated DATE to which they never received a reply . As a result they were not able to regularise their stay in GPE and had no access to any rights apart from a tolerated residence status .", "DATE . On DATE , at TIME , the applicants , along with another NORP couple who had CARDINAL children , were stopped at GPE airport while they attempted to take a flight to ORG in GPE by using false NORP passports . During passport control , the police officer in charge suspected that their passports were false because the colour of the page containing the biometric data differed to that used in genuine passports . The applicants were then requested to give a sample of their signatures . These did not correspond to those in the passports they had presented . After having being questioned by the officer they admitted that the passports were not their own and revealed their true personal details . An immigration officer carried out a search of their immigration status and ascertained that they were failed asylum seekers as their appeal to ORG been dismissed and they did not have valid residence permits .", "CARDINAL . According to the statement of the police officer taken on DATE , the applicants were arrested for committing the flagrant offences of personation and unlawful stay in GPE see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . The second applicant was arrested at TIME and the first applicant at TIME . In his statement the police officer stated that he had drawn their attention to the law and that the second applicant replied \u201c I made a mistake \u201d .

The other couple was also arrested and the social welfare office was contacted concerning the children . Around TIME they were all taken to ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant along with the other man , was then arrested by virtue of an arrest warrant issued by ORG at TIME the same day pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON .

There is a handwritten signed note on the warrant by the arresting police officer stating that he arrested the second applicant at CARDINAL TIME at GPE ORG and that with the assistance of an interpreter he had informed him of the reasons for his arrest , had drawn his attention to the law and that the second applicant had replied \u201c I did it for a better life \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant also signed a document containing his rights to communication as set out in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL below ) . The copy of the document signed by him was in LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL .

The second applicant signed next to this paragraph .", "CARDINAL . In his statement the second applicant stated that he had decided to leave GPE , as following his release and the expiry of DATE , he was not given another residence and work permit ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He also admitted that he had bought the passports from a NORP national for the amount of QUANTITY ( ORG ) and explained how these were secured . The applicants intended to leave GPE and go to GPE through GPE . He also apologised for what happened \u201c DATE \u201d and that he had done it because he could no longer live in GPE . The statement was read to the applicant by the interpreter ; he confirmed it and signed it . A statement was also given by the interpreter .", "CARDINAL . According to the relevant police report of GPE ORG , the first applicant and the other woman stated that they did not know anything about the passports and that their husbands had organised everything .", "DATE . At around TIME both women were released from custody as they were both pregnant and the one also had CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . The following day , CARDINAL DATE , the second applicant was taken to ORG and was remanded in custody for DATE for the purposes of further investigation of the alleged commission of a number of offences by the applicants under LAW and the Aliens and Immigration PERSON ; in particular , the offences of conspiracy to commit a felony , forgery , uttering false documents and personation ( sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , PERSON .
