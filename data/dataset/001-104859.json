The lorry , driven by P.P. , reached a crossroad and started turning left . The ORG was moving behind it at QUANTITY . It did not slow down and collided headon with the lorry \u2019s trailer . Immediately after the crash the ORG caught fire .

On DATE the police sent the case to ORG , proposing to convert the inquiry into a fully fledged homicide investigation . The case was then forwarded to ORG , which on DATE opened a criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator to whom the case had been assigned asked an expert to determine whether P.P. had manoeuvred properly . In his report , filed on DATE , the expert said that ORG had carried out the left turn correctly and that the accident had occurred because of the ORG \u2019s high speed , well above the maximum allowed on that part of the road .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator interviewed P.P. again .", "CARDINAL .

Both of them stated that the one driving the ORG at the time of their meeting had been Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator sent the case to ORG , recommending that the proceedings be discontinued . He noted that the technical expert report and the inspection of the site of the accident showed that the accident had been the fault of the ORG \u2019s driver . The only contentious issue was whether this had been ORG or PERSON . P.P. had stated that the one behind the wheel had been ORG However , the latter had disputed this assertion and had provided CARDINAL witnesses \u2013 I.M. , GPE and DATE who had all asserted that the one driving the ORG had been Mr PERSON . It could therefore be concluded that the ORG had been driven by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG referred the case back to the investigator for additional investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator interviewed the police officer who had started the inquiry .

On DATE the investigator asked CARDINAL medical experts to assess the extent of ORG \u2019s injuries and to express an opinion on whether he had indeed been unable to make coherent statements after the accident . In their report , filed on DATE , the experts said that it was impossible to determine this solely from the materials in the file because shortly before the accident ORG had been involved in another road traffic accident . It was necessary to examine him personally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator asked CARDINAL experts to express their opinion on whether PERSON or ORG had been driving the ORG at the time of the accident .

On DATE ORG sent the case back to the investigator , noting , among other things , that he had not properly worded the charge , that no information had been gathered on any previous road traffic offences committed by ORG , and that the medical expert report ordered on DATE had not been finalised . It instructed the investigator to examine whether ORG had made the left turn in line with road traffic rules and , if he found that this was not the case , to charge him as well .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the investigator asked an expert to determine whether P.P. had turned left properly . In his report , filed on DATE , the expert stated that ORG had not breached any road traffic rules .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator asked CARDINAL experts to determine , on the basis of the injuries sustained by PERSON and ORG , which of the CARDINAL had been driving the ORG at the time of the accident . The experts studied the documents in the file , including the medical report drawn up when PERSON had been admitted to the hospital in GPE , his autopsy report , and a medical report on ORG \u2019s condition on DATE after the accident . On DATE they examined ORG and on DATE subjected him to an X - ray and a CAT scan . However , they were not able to inspect the ORG , as it had apparently disappeared .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator interviewed ORG in relation to the ORG \u2019s whereabouts . He said that he had left it on a street in the village of PERSON . Somebody had later removed it from there and he had no idea where it was .", "CARDINAL . In their report the experts said that , without inspecting the ORG and on the basis of the medical data alone , they could not reach a definite conclusion as to which of the CARDINAL had been driving it at the time of the accident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator charged ORG anew and interviewed him , and on DATE ordered that the applicant be allowed to participate in the proceedings as a civil claimant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator sent the case to ORG , proposing that ORG be brought to trial .", "CARDINAL . However , on DATE ORG decided to discontinue the proceedings , reasoning that it had not been conclusively established who had been driving the ORG at the time of the accident . According to GPE , GPE and FAC , it had been Mr PERSON , whereas P.P. maintained that it had been ORG The experts had been unable to arrive at a categorical conclusion on this point . It was also unclear whether the line in the middle of the carriageway had been continuous or dotted . Therefore , the accusation had not been proved . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office sent the case of its own motion to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG , noting that in accordance with an intervening legislative amendment the decision to discontinue an investigation was no longer subject to automatic review by the courts , but could only be reviewed pursuant to an application by those concerned , referred the case back to the prosecution authorities with instructions to inform the applicant of the discontinuance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor of ORG again discontinued the investigation . He described the circumstances of the accident and said that it was clear that the ORG \u2019s driver had breached road traffic regulations , whereas ORG had properly made a left turn . However , despite taking all the necessary steps , the investigation had been unable to ascertain who had been driving the ORG at the time of the accident . CARDINAL witnesses \u2013 I.M. , GPE and DATE were categorical that the ORG had been driven by PERSON . The experts were unable to arrive at a definite conclusion on this point . The police officer who had inspected the scene could not say who had been driving the ORG either . On the other hand , P.P. , when interviewed , had stated that the ORG had been driven by ORG , and had identified him as the driver during an identity parade . It was also unclear whether the line in the middle of the carriageway had been continuous or dotted . Therefore , the accusation had not been proved .", "CARDINAL . This decision was sent to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought judicial review by ORG . She argued that the conclusion that it could not be determined whether ORG had been behind the wheel at the time of the accident was based on incomplete evidence . The authorities\u2019 preference for the testimony of GPE , GPE and FAC , who had not witnessed the accident , over the testimony of P.P. , who had taken the victims out of the burning ORG , was unwarranted . The discrepancy between their versions should have been elucidated through a confrontation . She further pointed out that it would not have been very hard to establish the identity of ORG driver and then interview him , which had not been done .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court , observing that the prosecution authorities had failed to serve a copy of the application on ORG , referred the case back to them with instructions to do so . They apparently complied with these instructions and re - sent the file to the court .", "CARDINAL . After holding a hearing on DATE , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court upheld the decision to discontinue the proceedings . It held that when hearing a challenge against a decision discontinuing a criminal investigation it could not scrutinise the manner in which the prosecution authorities had assessed the evidence , nor take their place and fill in the gaps in their reasoning . It was not competent to gather fresh evidence either ; its assessment had to be based on the available material . Accordingly , even if it were to find gaps in it , it could not set aside the discontinuance decision on that ground .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , but , following a legislative amendment effective from DATE and providing that firstinstance court decisions reviewing prosecutor \u2019s decisions to discontinue criminal investigations were final , the court terminated the proceedings on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout the proceedings the applicant wrote many letters to the prosecuting authorities , urging them to expedite the processing of the case . On some of those occasions ORG sent letters to the lower prosecutor \u2019s offices , instructing them to finalise the case promptly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a tort claim against ORG in ORG . After holding a hearing on DATE , on DATE the court stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal investigation . On several occasions DATE it enquired about the investigation \u2019s progress . On DATE , following the upholding of the investigation \u2019s discontinuance , it resumed the examination of the claim .", "CARDINAL . The court then held CARDINAL hearings , on DATE and DATE . The applicant could not be found and summoned for the first of those at her home , and was regarded as summoned under a rule allowing constructive summoning where a party failed to inform the court of a change of address . The court summoned the applicant for the second hearing through the counsel who represented her before the proceedings were stayed . However , neither the applicant nor the lawyer appeared . The court admitted in evidence the prosecutor \u2019s decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings and the decision whereby ORG had upheld the discontinuance ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim on DATE .

The prosecutor \u2019s decision shows that the criminal proceedings against [ ORG ] under LAW ( c ) , read in conjunction with LAW of LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] have been discontinued for lack of evidence . The reasons for the discontinuance are that it was not established in a categorical manner who had driven the car at the time of the road traffic accident , and that there was a lack of categorical findings as to whether the line in the middle of the carriageway at the area of the accident had been continuous or dotted .", "In those circumstances , the [ court ] finds that the claims under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Obligations and Contracts Act [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] are unfounded and should not be allowed . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The law does not allow the [ civil ] court freely to assess the evidence and requires that court , in order to abide by the criminal judgment , to regard as established the facts that that judgment has found to have occurred or otherwise . The criminal court \u2019s judgment is res judicata in relation to the matters mentioned in LAW . That res judicata effect has to be taken into account by all courts and ORG authorities . It can not be challenged when the criminal court \u2019s judgment has taken effect . It presupposes that the act that forms the subject matter of the criminal judgment and the act that needs to be established in the civil proceedings coincide . It does not matter whether the act has been perpetrated by the defendant to the civil action or is an act by a third party that has an effect on the defendant \u2019s liability . [ The court ] must treat as binding not only convictions , but also acquittals , in cases where they have established the lack of elements of the tort [ in question ] : for instance , the lack of an tortious act , [ or ] the lack of a causal link between the act and the damage [ suffered by the claimant ] . However , a criminal court \u2019s judgment does not need to be treated as binding where it has acquitted the defendant on the ground that his or her act was not criminal \u2013 an act , although not amounting to a criminal offence , may still be a tort . The binding effect of the criminal court \u2019s judgment relates to all elements of the criminal offence . When the amount of the damage is an element of the offence , the criminal court \u2019s findings as to that amount are binding on the court which rules on the civil claim . When the criminal court has made findings in relation to the amount of the damage caused because it was an element of the criminal offence of which a person has been accused , those findings are binding on the court determining the civil claim . [ For instance , ] in the case of a theft , where the sum of money stolen is an element of the criminal offence , the criminal court \u2019s findings as to that sum are binding in the civil case . [ Similarly , in ] the case of the offence of wilful mismanagement ... , the amount of damage caused is an element of the offence ; in order for the impugned act to have constituted an offence , it must have caused significant damage . In order to determine whether the damage is significant , the criminal court must make findings as to its amount .
