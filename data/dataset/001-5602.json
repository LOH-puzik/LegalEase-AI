{"ITEMID": "001-5602", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "CAGLAR v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Antonio Pastor Ridruejo", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a NORP national born in DATE , lives in LOC ( GPE ) . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "On DATE the applicant entered GPE by virtue of the Agreement concluded on DATE between the Government of ORG and ORG on the recruitment of NORP workers . The applicant was granted the appropriate work and residence permits . On DATE he was granted a residence permit of unlimited duration .", "The applicant was first employed by a company in GPE . Thereafter he worked in various restaurants .", "The applicant \u2019s wife entered GPE in DATE with the couple \u2019s CARDINAL children born in GPE in DATE , DATE and DATE . She holds a permanent residence permit .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and detained pending trial on suspicion of being implicated in a case of drug trafficking .", "By a judgment of DATE , which subsequently became final , ORG ( ORG ) convicted the applicant of illegal drug trafficking and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant \u2019s accomplice was convicted of illegal drug trafficking and attempted importation of narcotics and sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The court found that the applicant who was not a drug addict , had bought together with his accomplice , a co - national , QUANTITY of heroin for the price of MONEY . In DATE a third person supplied them with CARDINAL samples of respectively QUANTITY of heroin . Not being satisfied with the quality , they refused to buy a larger amount . DATE further negotiations took place with the same person and with the same result . As from DATE the applicant \u2019s accomplice sold several times altogether QUANTITY of heroin in quantities of QUANTITY . According to the court , the applicant and his accomplice acted in a professional way to the detriment of the health and life of numerous drug addicts .", "Since DATE the applicant served his sentence in the ORG prison . He was granted day parole release and worked for a private enterprise in PERSON . On DATE the ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release on probation . The applicant was released on DATE . He was employed by the private enterprise until DATE .", "After having heard the applicant on several occasions , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s expulsion on DATE and invited him to leave GPE within DATE . The decision to expel the applicant was based on Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) according to which an alien is to be expelled when he has been sentenced to a minimum of DATE imprisonment and serious reasons of public safety and order justify his expulsion . ORG pointed out that the applicant had been convicted of drug offences , sentenced to DATE imprisonment and it considered that his expulsion had to be ordered on general preventive grounds having the objective of deterring other aliens . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s personal conduct when committing the offences indicated a specific risk of re - offending . ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s wife lived for DATE in GPE and was granted a residence permit . However , a medical examination did not show that she suffered from psychiatric health problems , as was alleged by the applicant . The couple \u2019s CARDINAL children were of full age and sufficiently independent to organise their life without their father . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s expulsion was justified by the public interest , which had greater importance than the applicant \u2019s personal interest to stay in GPE .", "Following the partial dismissal of his objection ( Widerspruch ) , the applicant brought the case before ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim to have the expulsion order revoked . The court considered that the applicant \u2019s conviction of drug trafficking and his term of emprisonment of DATE reflected a serious breach of public order . The applicant had direct and narrow connections with drug dealers and the drug scene . He had acted in a professional manner as was shown by the quantity of the heroin and the fact that in DATE he and his accomplice twice refused to accept offers to buy heroin because of its unsatisfactory quality . This also proved that the applicant had a profound knowledge of drugs and did not accept bad quality . Furthermore , the heroin was sold in quantities of TIME during a longer period and the deals were concluded generally in the restaurants in which the applicant was employed . Finally it had to be taken into account that the applicant did not make his confession until very late in the proceedings , namely when he realised that he had no other choice . For that reason , his sentence was relatively more severe than that of his accomplice . The court added that there was no doubt that offences such as illegal heroin trafficking , because of the danger they present for the health of the users and the widespread drug - related criminality , constituted a particularly serious threat to public safety and justified the expulsion of aliens who contravened the laws on drugs for the purpose of deterring other aliens . The court found that the applicant \u2019s conduct which gave rise to his conviction was evidence of a genuine and sufficiently serious risk that he might commit further drug offences . Furthermore , there was no indication of exceptional circumstances that would justify non - expulsion . The court noted that the applicant had been integrated into GPE after having lived there for DATE with his wife and other close members of his family , and that he had been legally employed there for DATE . The court considered , however , that a foreign national could be denied the right to the protection of his marriage on the basis of general preventive grounds if he had committed drug offences . The applicant \u2019s case was therefore not different from that of other aliens who after a long stay had to leave the country for having committed serious offences .", "Moreover , ORG found that the interference with the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his private and family life , as guaranteed by LAW , did not infringe the principle of proportionality . The measure complained of was not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant and was thus justified under paragraph CARDINAL of this provision .", "On DATE the applicant filed a request for leave to appeal ( Antrag auf Zulassung der Berufung ) .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed this request and on DATE rejected the applicant \u2019s request to reconsider this decision .", "On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) declined to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication and on DATE declined to accept for adjudication the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the communication of ORG of DATE .", "In the meantime , on DATE , ORG had informed the applicant that he would be expelled to GPE if he did not to leave GPE before DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed an objection against this decision . He submitted that he had not committed any offence after his conviction in DATE . His personal conduct did thus not indicate any specific risk to the requirements of public order and safety . Furthermore , his wife suffered from serious psychiatric health problems and needed his help . According to him , his expulsion could not be justified only on the basis of general grounds of prevention .", "On DATE the applicant applied for an interim injunction ( einstweilige Anordnung ) requesting to stay his expulsion pending the administrative proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the request . It confirmed the decision to expel the applicant to GPE reaffirming that the applicant \u2019s personal interest to stay in GPE did not outweigh the public interest to expel him .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal ( Antrag auf PERSON ) .", "On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint against this decision and applied for an interim injunction . These proceedings are still pending ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
