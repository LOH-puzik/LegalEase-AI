THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of P4-2;No separate issue under Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON ( PERSON ) of GPE , relying on Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of GPE ( PERSON ) as amended on DATE , imposed a prohibition order ( verwijderingsbevel ) on the applicant to the effect that the latter would not be allowed for a period of DATE to enter a particular area , i.e. the \u201c LOC area , CARDINAL of the emergency areas designated by the PERSON . The following events were referred to in the PERSON \u2019s decision as having led to this order being issued :", "\u2013 It appeared from police reports that on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant had either overtly used hard drugs , had had utensils for the use of hard drugs in his possession or had had hard drugs in his possession in LOC and that on CARDINAL of those occasions the applicant had been ordered to leave the area for TIME .", "\u2013 On DATE the applicant had been heard by the police about his conduct and he had been told that he would either have to refrain from acts which disturbed the public order ( openbare orde ) or have to stay away from the area . The applicant had further been informed that if he committed such acts again in the near future , the PERSON would be requested to impose a prohibition order for DATE on him . On that occasion the applicant did not wish to state anything as to the reasons for his presence in that area .", "\u2013 On DATE the applicant had nevertheless overtly used hard drugs in the GPE area . He had once again been ordered to leave the area for TIME and the police had subsequently requested the PERSON to impose a prohibition order for DATE on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the opinion of the PERSON the applicant would again commit acts disturbing public order within the near future . In this respect the PERSON took account of the kind of conduct involved , i.e. acts seriously disturbing public order , the repetition and continuity of this conduct , the statement of the applicant , the short period of time within which the acts concerned had been observed and the fact that the applicant had continued his disruptive behaviour despite the TIME prohibition orders imposed on him and the warning given by the police . Finally , the PERSON noted that neither the applicant \u2019s home nor his place of work were situated in the area concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against the prohibition order to the PERSON . He submitted , inter alia , that the PERSON had failed to take into account the fact that he was residing in LOC , that he needed to be present there in person twice a week in order to collect his social security benefits and that he received social counselling there . The applicant stated that the police knew this , but had failed to mention it in the police report on the applicant \u2019s hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further submitted that the prohibition order could not be considered as having a legal basis in that the emergency powers granted to the PERSON under LAW were intended for emergency situations . According to the applicant , the legislature had never intended structural nuisance caused by drug abusers to be considered as creating an emergency situation . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s absence from LOC would not make any difference in this respect since he was CARDINAL of many drug abusers in that area . The applicant also complained that the order was contrary to LAW in that it constituted a sanction and could therefore only be imposed by a judge . He further complained that the order restricted his freedom of movement and was contrary to his right to respect for his private life , family life , home and correspondence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place before an advisory committee . During this hearing the representative of the PERSON stated that already on DATE a prohibition order for DATE had been imposed on the applicant and that on DATE the applicant had not wished to make any statement to the police as to the reasons for his presence in LOC . Despite the previous orders , the applicant had continued his undesirable conduct and on this ground the imposition of a new prohibition order had been sought . The PERSON \u2019s representative further stated that the address where the applicant had stated that he resided and where he collected his mail and social security benefits was in fact the address of ORG . It was not possible to reside at that address . This ORG had a procedure under which social - security benefits for persons subject to a prohibition order could be collected by an authorised third party and it was possible for the applicant to avail himself of that procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the committee advised the PERSON to reject the objection and to maintain the prohibition order . It considered , inter alia , having regard to the fact that the applicant had , within a short period of time , regularly committed acts which had disrupted public order and that the prohibition orders for TIME which had been issued had not prevented him from behaving in that manner , that the imposition of the prohibition order had not been unreasonable . It further found that the order was in conformity with Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , that therefore it was not necessary to examine the question whether or not the conditions set out in LAW had been fulfilled , and that the PERSON had not exceeded his competence under LAW . It did not agree with the applicant that the impugned measure constituted a penalty as it had been issued in order to maintain public order . The committee finally found that the interference with the applicant \u2019s right to liberty of movement had been justified and that the prohibition order could not be regarded as disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE the PERSON rejected the applicant \u2019s objection , adopting as his own the reasoning applied by the advisory committee .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings in the course of which a hearing was held on DATE , ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal well - founded and quashed the prohibition order .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted that the overt use of hard drugs in public places and the presence of a concentration of drug abusers and dealers disrupted public order and acknowledged the necessity to end such nuisance , in particular when this occurred continuously at specific locations in the city . ORG noted that the PERSON availed himself of CARDINAL means to that end , namely prohibition orders of either TIME or DATE . It considered the procedure established as regards the imposition of prohibition orders for a duration of DATE and noted that this procedure had not been fully complied with in that the applicant \u2019s prohibition order had not been sought by the competent police officer . However , as it was not established that this had harmed the applicant \u2019s interests , it did not find that this flaw should result in the quashing of the order . It did , however , find that the order should be quashed on other grounds .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that , unlike the situation in which an eighthour prohibition order has been imposed , Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW offered no basis for the imposition of a prohibition order for a duration of DATE . It held on this point that the competence established by this provision aimed to create a possibility for direct reaction to an expected disturbance of public order and might serve to prohibit someone \u2019s presence for a limited period of time in the area where the disturbance of public order was expected . It held that the TIME prohibition order was such as to meet this need , but not the DATE prohibition order , the latter measure being disproportionate in relation to the expected disruption of public order and thus going beyond what could be considered necessary for maintaining public order .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that in the present case this was all the more so as the applicant had no permanent place of residence and used the address of ORG as his postal address . The prohibition order implied that the applicant \u2019s freedom of movement was limited for DATE in a manner which prevented him from collecting his mail and from receiving his social security benefits . It rejected the argument advanced by the PERSON \u2019s representative that the police would not undertake any formal action against the applicant for acting contrary to LAW the offence of failure to comply with an official order ( ambtelijk bevel ) , when collecting his social security benefits at the address of ORG , considering that the applicant \u2019s freedom of movement could not be made dependent on the willingness of the police officer on duty to tolerate intrinsically punishable conduct .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that the situation at issue , i.e. nuisance caused by drug abuse , did not constitute a situation within the meaning of LAW and accordingly held that the PERSON could not have based the prohibition order on this provision . As it had already found the prohibition order to be incompatible with national law , ORG did not find it necessary to determine whether or not the order was compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the PERSON lodged an appeal against ORG judgment with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE , following adversarial proceedings , ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE and rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG as ill - founded . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c The prohibition order issued against PERSON is based on a decision of the appellant , dated DATE and addressed to ORG , which contains an instruction to the police relating to the preparation and issuing of a DATE prohibition order . This instruction designates the PERSON area as an \u201c emergency area \u201d and indicates the behaviour which the appellant considers to be constitutive of serious breaches of public order , including the overt possession or use on or near the public highway of addictive substances within the meaning of LAW .", "ORG held , among other things , that the appellant was not competent to act on the basis of LAW , because a situation within the meaning of that Section was lacking . ORG does not share this opinion . Its reasons are the following .", "It is laid down in LAW , first paragraph , of GPE that in case of a riotous movement , of other serious disorders or of calamities , as well as in case of a well - founded fear of the development thereof , the PERSON is empowered to issue all orders which he deems necessary for the maintenance of public order or the limitation of general danger . In doing so he may deviate from rules other than those of the LAW .", "ORG notes at the outset that giving orders in the situations described in LAW is not contrary to the right to freedom of movement as guaranteed by LAW to LAW , since provision has been made for the possibility to limit this right by law \u2013 which also includes an order given by the LAW pursuant to the law \u2013 for the protection of public order .", "Section CARDINAL of GPE replaced LAW which was repealed as of DATE . As did LAW , LAW grants the ORG emergency powers which should only be used in exceptional situations . Thus provision has been made by law for circumstances in which ordinary means are insufficient to restore and maintain public order . ORG notes in this connection that the wording of LAW does not lead to the conclusion that that provision , as compared with Section CARDINAL , is intended to introduce any changes as regards the circumstances in which emergency powers may be used . Its drafting history does not justify holding otherwise .", "In the opinion of ORG , ordinary means may be considered insufficient in the present case and there was , at the time of the decision on the objection , an exceptional situation of the kind referred to above . ORG finds in this regard that the facts relating to the situation in the PERSON area , based on which the appellant decided to issue the DATE prohibition order , are established . In light of the decision of DATE the situation there was characterised by the presence of a large number of drug addicts and the attendant nuisance , inconvenience , insecurity and threats to other citizens . This factual situation is so serious that the personnel and means available to the appellant were insufficient to counter the disruptions of public order thereby caused .", "It is important to note in this context that at the time the objection was decided on , it was not possible to solve the problem there by means of a regulation adopted by the municipality ( gemeentelijke regeling ) . At that time there was no relevant provision in any municipality bye - law , nor were any other adequate administrative - law means available . Given that the decision dismissing the objection was given before ORG delivered its decision of DATE ... , the absence of such a provision can not be held against the appellant . Apart from that , by a decision of DATE , LAW has been added to ORG law of GPE , which contains a regulation governing prohibition orders in relation to hard drugs . Against this background , ORG is of the opinion that it can not be maintained that the appellant was not entitled to use the powers granted him by LAW .", "... The position taken by the appellant , that the risk of repetition of behaviour constituting a breach of the peace was so great that a DATE prohibition order was necessary , is not unreasonable .", "ORG further notes that PERSON is not resident in LOC , is not dependent on that area for work , and that he was offered the possibility to collect his social - security benefits from ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Apart from the proceedings described above , the applicant was arrested and placed in detention on DATE for failure to comply with the prohibition order of DATE . On DATE the single - judge chamber ( politierechter ) of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) suspended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention in order to allow the applicant to be admitted to ORG and adjourned the criminal proceedings against the applicant sine die .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the single - judge chamber of ORG convicted the applicant of having failed to respect a prohibition order on CARDINAL occasions and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment with deduction of the time spent in pre - trial detention . The applicant appealed to ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and convicted the applicant of having failed to respect a prohibition order on CARDINAL occasion . However , as the applicant had also amassed other convictions which the law required to be taken into account for sentencing purposes , ORG was prevented from imposing any sentence as the maximum aggregate penalty had already been attained . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal on points of law was rejected on DATE by ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL .

In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , Administratiefrechtelijke Beslissingen ( ORG ) DATE , no . CARDINAL , given under former LAW and relating to a part of the old city centre of GPE where the situation was similar to that in LOC , the President of ORG held as follows :", "\u201c As ORG has held in previous decisions , LAW \u2013 paraphrased above \u2013 confers on the PERSON emergency powers which should be used only in exceptional situations .

Thus provision has been made by law for situations in which it may definitely be expected that ordinary measures will be insufficient for restoring and maintaining public order .", "It must now first be examined whether in the present case there was a situation of the kind aimed at by the aforementioned LAW , first paragraph .", "In so doing , we will consider the undisputed statement made by the respondent party at the hearing concerning the situation in the ( old ) city centre of GPE :", "\u2018 The old city centre of GPE is known internationally and nationally as a centre for the trade in hard drugs . It continues to attract large numbers of addicts . The doings and dealings of addicts and dealers generally cause serious nuisance : overt use and dealing , intimidating group behaviour , threats to passers - by ( frequently with knives ) , shouting , raving , fights , robberies ( frequently with knives ) , thefts , receiving stolen property , etc . The old city centre has many functions ; an important one is as a residential and commercial area . However , the situation threatens all the time to become unliveable .", "The extent to which matters have deteriorated for the residents yet again is apparent from the desperate protests which took place at DATE . These protests ended , for the time being , at a meeting of ORG which was attended by a crowd of people .", "The NORP , PERSON , FAC and QUANTITY Hoogstraat are part of the crisis area .

In this part of the town all manner of soft drugs , but especially hard drugs , are for sale , in small or large amounts : hashish , cocaine , amphetamine , ORG , heroin and other mindaltering substances . In this area especially street traders go about more than elsewhere in the city centre peddling fake hard drugs .", "The presence of the dealers and large numbers of addicts with the attending criminality seriously affect the area .", "Because of , amongst other things , the strong protests of local residents a special project team of the police was active in LOC for DATE from DATE . Their actions were directed in particular towards the bridge between FAC and the Oude Hoogstraat , the so - called pills bridge .
