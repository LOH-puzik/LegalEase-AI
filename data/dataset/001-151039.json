Although they all , and in particular witnesses DATE . and GPE , attempted to exclude the possibility of the convict \u2019s presence in the area where the killings of the NORP soldiers took place in DATE , this panel considers that these statements are not sufficiently credible or precise to completely exclude the possibility of the convict \u2019s participation in the massacre .", "In the proceedings before ORG Sanader was found guilty of the offence under LAW and ORG upheld that judgment . Based on the comprehensively and correctly established facts [ the trial court ] found beyond reasonable doubt that the massacre of the NORP soldiers had been committed by the so - called \u2018 PERSON and that the leader of that group had been the convict \u2019s brother , PERSON .", "Witness PERSON , who had been a soldier in the paramilitary group , testified that the third convict , PERSON , had told him that he had killed the prisoners at the request of PERSON , while witness GPE , one of the survivors of the shooting , testified that he had recognised PERSON as the perpetrator of the crime from a photo and PERSON as having killed CARDINAL prisoners while they had been lying face down on the ground with their hands on their heads .", "Against this background , the panel considers that the second convict , PERSON , has not managed to cast doubt on the facts established during the trial which led to his conviction for the offence under LAW and his sentencing to DATE imprisonment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Accordingly , the applicant \u2019s request was dismissed .", "CARDINAL .
