The family , living in a local authority flat in GPE , were known to the social services of GPE and ORG ( \u201c the local authority \u201d ) . The records provided by the ORG show that they were principally concerned from DATE onwards in relation to the mother \u2019s severe financial difficulties . The mother suffered from bad health and it was noted in DATE that when she had a broken arm she always kept CARDINAL of the children off school ( presumably to help in the home ) and was likely to be summoned before ORG . Problems with rent and electricity arrears were noted as recurring through DATE and DATE , as well as continuing health difficulties suffered by the mother . An entry on DATE noted that the CARDINAL children were all happy though overcrowded and that there were no behavioural problems .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , it was recorded however that PERSON , the first applicant , who had been causing concern as she had been staying out at TIME , was found semi - conscious at a nearby flat , having taken an overdose . It was noted that the mother was to take her to attend a psychiatric clinic . The medical notes recorded that PERSON complained that she disliked intensely her mother \u2019s cohabitee PERSON who hit her , shouted and upset her so much that she ran away with intent to kill herself .", "CARDINAL . A social work report dated DATE noted that the family consisted of CARDINAL daughters and CARDINAL sons living with their mother . PERSON , the father of the CARDINAL youngest children , was recorded as not cohabiting and the mother had stated that she would not marry him as she would be worse off financially . The state of the home was said to fluctuate according to the mother \u2019s health but was considered to be adequately furnished with a warm , friendly atmosphere . The mother had always demonstrated a great deal of concern for her children and had perhaps overindulged them at times . In spite of the fact that there was much juvenile delinquency in the area , this was noted as being the first time that any of her children had given cause for concern . The mother \u2019s ambivalent attitude to school attendance was commented on .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , PERSON left school and the social services gave assistance in finding employment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON , the third applicant , then aged CARDINAL , ran away from home , following an incident in which she claimed that PERSON had attempted to rape her . She was referred as an emergency by the police to the social services . The police interviewed all the family . It is not apparent that the family , in particular the children , were interviewed by social workers concerning the implications of PERSON \u2019s disclosures .

On DATE , PERSON was arrested by the police and charged with indecently assaulting PERSON and L.", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG entered a guilty plea concerning charges involving offences of indecent behaviour against PERSON before ORG . The pleas were accepted by the prosecution and the case proceeded on the basis that PERSON had committed CARDINAL act of indecency against PERSON between DATE and CARDINAL DATE , and CARDINAL acts of indecency against L. DATE . The ORG requested the social services to prepare social enquiry and psychiatric reports . PERSON was not detained pending sentence .

The family was considered as appearing a happy well - adjusted group though they were well known to the social services as they had been given assistance from time to time . The children attended school regularly and appeared happily settled . PERSON was recorded as admitting the offence and as being more than ashamed of his conduct , though he could offer no explanation for these actions . It was noted that he did not appear to realise fully the serious nature of these charges . Since the alleged offence he had obtained accommodation outside the applicants\u2019 home - it indicated an address in the same apartment block . It was further noted that the mother was not prepared to accept the charges relating to this man and stated that they had plans to marry in the Spring as they had had a close relationship for DATE . It was concluded that , in view of the serious nature of the offences , it would be necessary for firm control to be exercised over the accused for a period of time .", "CARDINAL . NORP The psychiatric report found that PERSON did not show any psychiatric abnormality . His criminal record showed CARDINAL prior minor offence of dishonesty .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was sentenced by the Sheriff to two years\u2019 probation . The applicants state that this was with a condition that he cease to reside at the applicants\u2019 address .

They accepted however that it was the social services\u2019 responsibility to supervise PERSON \u2019s probation . According to the recollection of PERSON , who was the supervising officer for part of that period ( after DATE ) , he would have made it clear to PERSON that he was not permitted to live in the family home due to the nature of the offences . He recalled visiting PERSON at a separate address in GPE during this period and sending mail to that address . He believed that PERSON was living there and not at the applicants\u2019 home . In the precognition annexed to the Government \u2019s observations , PERSON , who was also probation officer for PERSON and acted as replacement for the family social worker , recalled however that he did have suspicions that PERSON might still be living at the family home and that on visiting the family home CARDINAL times unexpectedly he found PERSON \u201c just leaving \u201d .

In his later affidavit , he stated that this entry was based on information from the mother . Entries indicated concerns about school attendance and that the mother had been repeatedly told that she should not keep the girls off school . In DATE , it was noted that the school had expressed concerns about the welfare of T. , the fourth applicant , which was attended to by a senior social worker . A school meeting concerning the children \u2019s attendance was arranged but the mother and PERSON , the second applicant , failed to attend . In DATE , the social worker paid an unexpected visit to the home and found that PERSON was there . Both he and the mother denied that he was living there .", "CARDINAL .

NORP In DATE , the mother was recorded as giving her various health problems as the reason for keeping PERSON and T. off school . It was noted that her speech was slurring , among other symptoms , but that she had shown reluctance in going to see her doctor or in allowing the social workers to approach her doctor . In DATE , she was keeping CARDINAL or both girls off school to help her at home or to run messages .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , it was noted that the house was becoming even more disordered and the younger children and the mother were becoming more unkempt . The mother gave the impression of having given up . In DATE , the mother was finally referred through her doctor for hospital tests , though she failed to attend the appointments set . In DATE , it was noted that the house stank and that the carpet was matted . The mother informed the social worker that PERSON , who lived in GPE , had invited her to go and live with him there . She gave up that idea shortly afterwards .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , PERSON was referred to a Children \u2019s Hearing for failure to attend school .

After being discharged from hospital on DATE , PERSON went to live with a DATE man with whom she had a sexual relationship . On CARDINAL DATE , the police picked up PERSON who told them about the relationship . The mother agreed that PERSON was beyond her control and agreed that she be put in a place of safety . An order lasting DATE was made to that effect . From DATE , she was made the subject of compulsory care measures by the local authority which brought her before the Children \u2019s Hearing . In the background report drawn up by the social worker PERSON for the hearing , details were given of the mother \u2019s financial difficulties and ill - health and comment was made that , apart from truancy , the family had not been in any trouble . No reference was made to the past sexual abuse . The hearing extended the place of safety order . PERSON was sent to ORG from DATE to DATE . She appears to have remained there for most of the period until her CARDINALth birthday on DATE , at which date she ceased to be subject to the legislation governing the compulsory education of children .

An entry in DATE referred to problems of school attendance of CARDINAL years\u2019 standing and the mother \u2019s frequent summoning before the school council .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , it was noted that the family had moved to a larger home , a self - contained house provided by the local authority .", "CARDINAL .

By DATE , she was living at an address with her DATE daughter and was in contact with the social services concerning her financial problems . In DATE , she indicated to her social worker that she had been subject to sexual abuse in the past .

As at the time she was in regular contact with PERSON , whom she considered had reformed , she was counselled concerning the risk to her own child .", "CARDINAL . Following counselling , PERSON the history of abuse by PERSON to the police in or DATE . In her statement of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON stated that after PERSON had been arrested in DATE , various social workers used to come around and she and the others had had to tell them that PERSON was not living with them anymore . When they came to the house , PERSON used to hide and her mother used to keep the children out of their way if possible . She recalled wanting to tell a social worker what was happening but was so petrified of PERSON that she did not .

PERSON was duly convicted of serious acts of indecency against PERSON between DATE and DATE and of further such acts against her DATE and DATE ; of serious acts of indecency against L. between DATE and DATE ; and of similar acts against T. between CARDINAL DATE and DATE . Only part of the latter charge concerned the period after PERSON \u2019s earlier conviction on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial was adjourned for sentencing reports to be obtained . On DATE , ORG sentenced PERSON to a DATE suspended sentence of imprisonment , having regard to the reports which indicated that he now lived in GPE and that most of the offences predated his earlier conviction in DATE . However , it was only at this time that the applicants alleged that they became aware that PERSON had been subject to criminal proceedings in DATE and that he had been placed on probation on the condition that he did not reside in their home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the CARDINAL applicants brought proceedings against the local authority seeking damages on the basis that the local authority had failed to carry out its statutory duties , in particular , that PERSON had breached his probation order by residing at the family home and that the social services had , or ought to have , known this and had failed to report the breach to the court or to take the children into care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the decision of ORG in X. and Others v. ORG ( [ DATE ] PERSON ) and in the light of counsel \u2019s advice that their case was indistinguishable , the applicants consented to an order that their action be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In or DATE , the applicants applied for compensation to ORG in respect of the abuse suffered . In their applications , they alleged as follows :", "( i ) E. stated that from DATE she suffered DATE of abuse from PERSON The first incident which she recalled was when she was DATE when he struck her , sending her flying into the wall . Soon after , he began coming into her room at TIME and doing things to her , requiring her to masturbate him . If she cried , he would punch her in the face . From DATE , he used to make the girls have a bath together and would touch them all over their bodies , inserting his finger into them . Often he would keep her off school and would abuse her sexually . He assaulted her often , coming up behind her to hit her on the back of the head . He also used to stand on her naked feet with his shoes on and twist , pinch her with his nails and punch her . This physical abuse happened on a DATE basis . He would also get her and the others to strip to the waist and hit each other with dog chains . This conduct continued regularly until she left home on her CARDINALth birthday ( DATE ) . She recalled going to the social services when she was aged DATE and telling them that PERSON was living with them when he was not supposed to . Nothing happened as a result . While the social services were coming to the house , she did not remember them talking to her . She recalled that this period was before she was DATE or DATE , before DATE or DATE . When she was DATE , she started running away from home . On CARDINAL occasion she took pills . When she was visited by the police in hospital , she told them that PERSON was interfering with her . She also told this to a psychiatrist whom she saw soon after . However , PERSON continued interfering with her . PERSON was only arrested after PERSON had run away from home in DATE . E. had suffered serious problems since that time , having made several suicide attempts and having developed a severe drink problem . A psychiatric report of DATE concluded that her symptoms accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder .", "( ii ) PERSON stated that he suffered from physical abuse , assaults and threats of violence from PERSON from DATE . From about DATE CARDINAL , PERSON used to punch him in the stomach and bash him against the wall . He also made him and the others strip to the waist and punch and hit each other with chains . These relentless assaults went on regularly until he left home during DATE . A psychiatric report of DATE concluded that he had long term relationship problems , poor self confidence and long standing personality difficulties .", "( iii ) PERSON stated that she had suffered sexual and physical abuse from PERSON from DATE until she left home in DATE and on occasion after that . PERSON had started interfering with her when she was CARDINAL or CARDINAL . The first thing she remembered was him bathing her with her sister PERSON and rubbing her private parts . Hardly a day went past when he did not do something of a sexual nature to her ( e.g. touching her breasts or private parts ) or batter her . When she was older , he made her touch him on his private parts and perform oral sex . He made her and the other children hit each other with chains and whips and would sometimes join in . She was often left with bad bruises and a bleeding nose . From the age of DATE or DATE , he had sexual intercourse with her several times . When she ran away in DATE , she told the police and he was arrested . However , he returned home and started interfering with her again , having intercourse with her and punching or kicking her if she refused . She ran away again in DATE and was put into a home , first in GPE , then PERSON and finally PERSON , which she eventually left in DATE when she was DATE . At that point , she did not return home but went to stay with her sister and then embarked in a series of relationships . When she visited her mother on DATE , PERSON put his hands up her skirt but let her go when she threatened to tell her boyfriend . On another occasion in DATE , PERSON tried to fondle her but she got up and left . She had never been able to tell anyone about these things as she was scared of him and thought that he would severely assault her . A psychiatric report of DATE concluded that her symptoms , including nightmares and sleep disturbance , accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder .", "( iv ) PERSON stated that she had suffered sexual and physical abuse from PERSON from DATE . Though she did not remember anything specifically before DATE , she slept in the same bed as L. and remembered him coming naked into the bed with them . From an early age , he used to stand on her naked feet in his shoes and twirl round , nip her and punch her in the stomach . She had black eyes occasionally . When she was DATE , she remembered him making her touch him and masturbate him . She had to do that to him CARDINAL or CARDINAL times a week when he came home from work . He then started keeping her off school and would lie down on the bed naked , making her take her clothes off and masturbate him . This occurred CARDINAL or CARDINAL times a week . When she was DATE , he began to touch her breasts and rub his penis over her until he ejaculated . When she was DATE , he forced her to have sexual intercourse with him . He did not repeat that but continued touching her and making her masturbate him or have oral sex . This continued until DATE when she was able to leave home \u2013 she deliberately got pregnant by having sex with someone she knew , so that the local authority would provide her with accommodation away from home . In DATE , PERSON started coming to her house and would try to touch and grab her . She became very depressed and suicidal . She then told ORG about the abuse . A psychiatric report of DATE concluded that her symptoms , including low self - esteem , fear , mistrust and depression , accorded with a diagnosis of severe post traumatic stress disorder .", "CARDINAL . Though the applicable provisions did not permit claims for injuries from violence arising before DATE where the victim and assailant were in the same household , ORG ( \u201c CICB \u201d ) , in an apparent oversight , made an assessment awarding MONEY ( GBP ) to PERSON and PERSON for general damages . They appealed against the failure to award damages for loss of earnings . As it was noted that in the proceedings for the fourth applicant PERSON that most of her injuries had arisen before DATE , the applicants PERSON withdrew their appeals to prevent their awards being reconsidered altogether . In deciding ORG \u2019s appeal , ORG decided that as she had sustained some damage post - DATE it would not disturb the award but made no award for alleged loss of earnings or damage to employment prospects . H. did not receive any award . A letter dated DATE from the PERSON indicated that his application had been rejected in that his claim had not been made within DATE of the incident giving rise to the claim and the Chairman had decided not to waive the requirement in his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants requested the Commissioner for ORG in GPE to undertake an investigation into their allegations of negligence and maladministration by the local authority . By letter dated DATE , the ORG stated that he had no jurisdiction pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG ( GPE ) Act DATE , which precluded investigations where the complainants had a remedy by way of proceedings in a court of law , and that , even if he had jurisdiction , he would not have undertaken an investigation due to the lapse in time since the events occurred . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , he declined to reconsider his decision .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted CARDINAL reports by PERSON , a social work consultant who has worked for DATE in the field of child care , principally in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In her first affidavit dated DATE , PERSON stated that with the exception of cases of incest there was in the DATE no real appreciation of the incidence of , and consequences for victims of , child sexual abuse within families . Circulars referred to non - accidental injury without specific reference to sexual abuse which was not recognised as a particular issue . It was only in DATE that literature began to arrive in GPE from GPE on the subject of child sex abuse and initially this was regarded as controversial . The first real recognition of the problem in GPE was a ORG publication \u201c Child Sexual Abuse in the Family \u201d published in DATE . ORG on the topic was set up by ORG of ORG in which she was involved and which reported in DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to her experience , during DATE and before , where a case of incest or sexual abuse had been identified , the focus would be on ensuring that the perpetrator was punished . Little or no attention was given to the needs of the victim and once the perpetrator was convicted that would be seen as the end of the matter . There was no real appreciation of the extent to which abusers might continue to abuse their victims over DATE or of the skills of abusers in avoiding detection . Social workers were not given any specific training about child sex abuse . There was also the practice at the time of local authorities keeping their probation and child care functions separate , with social workers working separately rather than as part of a team and there was a tendency for there to be relatively little interaction between schools and social work departments .", "CARDINAL . In her view , after PERSON had been convicted and sentenced to probation in DATE , it would have been generally assumed that any continuing problem would have been resolved , particularly if a condition in his probation was that he was not allowed to live in the family home . No work would have been envisaged with the victims unless they were showing obvious distress or problems . A mere suspicion that the PERSON was in breach of the probation order , and his presence found in the house during DATE , would not have been sufficient proof of breach . He was the father of CARDINAL of the mother \u2019s youngest children , contact with the family was not prohibited and his presence in the house would have even been seen as positive . Even if they had considered the possible breach of probation further , they would not have gone on to consider possible harm to the children . It would have been standard practice to make specific appointments to visit the home in order to avoid wasted time and she would not have expected the social worker to make spot checks or call at unexpected times to check on ORG .. As was the practice , social services provided support for the mother who had considerable problems in running the home , and would have had a tendency not to investigate the causes of any running away or of truancy , particularly where the child was close to school leaving age . Nor would it have been expected at the time for the social workers to make a point of talking individually to the children , unless for the purpose of a specific report .", "CARDINAL . In her additional comments of DATE , added in the light of the examination of further documents , PERSON noted that at the meeting convened by the school in DATE concerning PERSON the social work department had not sent a participant though invited to do so . The school problems drawn to the attention of the social services did not appear to have prompted the social worker to suggest a meeting to try to draw together the issues for the family and this meant that the full extent of the problems that PERSON and the others in the family faced were not discussed by the wider group of professionals who knew the family . By this time , the use of case conferences was well established in social work practice .", "CARDINAL . She also noted that following PERSON \u2019s overdose of pills in DATE , the social services did not appear to react to PERSON \u2019s dislike of PERSON and her allegations of an earlier sexual assault and his shouting and hitting . Nor was there any social work follow - up when PERSON ran away in DATE , beyond a visit of the emergency social worker , or any discussion with PERSON after PERSON had been sentenced . Even if social workers at the time were not aware of the incidence of sexual abuse , the incidents with the QUANTITY girls and the evident distress shown by them should have usefully led to an attempt to discuss with them individually how things were at home , in particular to establish the severity of past incidents and whether any other children in the house were at risk of sexual or physical abuse .", "CARDINAL . Further , in the light of Mr R \u2019s report to the court which commented on the need for firm control of ORG and the mother \u2019s refusal to accept that he had committed the offences , this made the assurances given by PERSON and the mother that PERSON was not living in the home much less safe to rely on . PERSON did not appear to have issued any warning to them about the consequences of breaching the probation order . When the report was made on PERSON in DATE there was no reference to the sexual abuse or home difficulties . Also the report to ORG on L. in DATE failed to give a full picture of her difficulties . Throughout the case there was an emerging pattern of different people not using the information available to assess the safety of the girls and PERSON \u2019s adherence to the probation conditions . After the report on PERSON in DATE , it could have been expected that the workers involved in the family would have increased their scrutiny of the living arrangements in the family . The lack of detail in the reports on L. deprived the Children \u2019s Hearing of vital information which could have led them to place NORP on supervision and afforded more opportunity for her to speak about the home situation .", "CARDINAL . Though by DATE PERSON was too old to be referred to the reporter of ORG , grounds existed for referring PERSON at that time . Given the abuse , her level of truancy , the poor financial and material circumstances in the family and the offence of PERSON , coupled with allegations by PERSON as to shouting and hitting in the family home , she considered that a referral of PERSON ought to have been made . This would have given an opportunity for all the different agencies involved with the family to contribute to the discussion and for the Hearing to appreciate the full extent of the problems . Though L. might not have been removed in the first instances , a supervision requirement would have allowed closer contact and more individual work . The Reporter would also have had the opportunity to consider whether any other children in the household were in need of compulsory measures of care .", "CARDINAL . She concluded that the failure to share significant issues with ORG about L. , the failure to work collaboratively with the school , the lack of attention to the assessed need for firm control of the situation after PERSON was placed on probation and the lack of attention to the significance that the mother did not believe her daughters\u2019 complaints against PERSON , all contributed to a failure to help get the girls the support they were likely to need after the conviction of PERSON and disclosed a failure in the approach taken to the family by the social work department .", "CARDINAL . The applicants provided CARDINAL reports dated DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE by Mr PERSON , a consultant in social work with experience in social work practice over DATE .", "CARDINAL . He stated that from DATE , when circular SWCARDINAL/CARDINAL was issued , a mult - disciplinary approach by professionals was promoted in respect of neglect and child protection , though sexual abuse was not explicitly referred to . While public and professional acknowledgement of a significant child abuse problem did not emerge until the DATE \u2019s , in this case PERSON had made disclosures which were believed and not in doubt . Literature as to the nature of the problem was available to practitioners , in particular with GPE and ORG work published in DATE , inter alia , identifying clear indicators as to the behaviour exhibited by abused children .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite long - term problems with the family and notes of truanting dating back to DATE , there was minimal reference to dialogue between the social services and the education authority . There was no reference in the social work records to the disclosures made by PERSON to medical personnel or to a visit to her in hospital by an emergency social worker , disclosing a significant breakdown in communication . The family social worker PERSON appears to have had no clear knowledge as to the situation , while PERSON , who later supervised probation of PERSON , was not a qualified social worker and did not appear to have proper knowledge of the seriousness and persistence of the offences in issue .", "CARDINAL . Once disclosures had been made by PERSON in DATE , it would have been reasonable , given the ages of the children , to discuss PERSON with them outwith the presence of the mother . A serious discussion ought to have taken place in the social services as to the potential risks to the children in the household and at the very minimum a report should have been prepared for the Reporter to ORG . In fact there was nothing to suggest that the social services explored PERSON \u2019s impact on the children in the family at all .", "CARDINAL . NORP The social service records noted clear suspicions that PERSON continued to live in the household . Though it was stated in the context of the probation order that firm control was needed , no steps were taken such as further enquiries from neighbours or the local police as to PERSON \u2019s actual place of residence . Breach of the probation order was a very serious matter and should have triggered a referral of his case back to the court and of the children to the Reporter .", "CARDINAL . When PERSON \u2019s truancy was referred to the Children \u2019s Hearing in DATE , there was no reference to the background of her running away in DATE or to the history of neglect and turbulent dynamics in the family . It was negligent of the social services not to provide the panel with full information . Nor when there was a case study meeting at the school in DATE did any social worker attend . There was never any multi - disciplinary case conference which reviewed in a full , objective and accurate manner the history and circumstances of the family .", "CARDINAL . Imprisonment is used in GPE only where there is no alternative . CARDINAL alternative is probation , which was at the relevant time imposed under section CARDINAL of the Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) Act DATE . When an offender is placed on probation he is allowed to retain his liberty during the period of probation but must comply with the requirements of the probation order . In all cases the order requires the offender to be of good behaviour , conform to the directions of the supervising officer and to inform the supervising officer if he changes residence or employment . Other requirements may be imposed , such as conditions as to the place of residence . If the offender fails to comply with requirements of the probation order , that failure may be reported to the sentencing court by the supervisory officer or other responsible officials of ORG . The supervising officer has a degree of discretion where there is an apparent breach of the order . He may warn the probationer about the conduct if he considers a warning is likely to alter the probationer \u2019s behaviour .
