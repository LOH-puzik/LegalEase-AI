Noting that the funeral had subsequently turned into propaganda for the ORG - KONGRA / GEL , thus an illegal demonstration , and considering that the applicant had walked close to the coffins , the court considered that the applicant had played an active role in the illegal demonstration . The court noted that it was not established that the applicant had chanted slogans during the funeral . As to the demonstration held on DATE at ORG , the trial court noted that the applicant had applauded while other demonstrators had chanted slogans in support of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the funeral of the ORG militants and the demonstration of DATE had both been held in line with calls and instructions issued by the ORG .

Hence , the court found it established that the applicant had acted with the intention of supporting the deceased on DATE and had acted together with illegal demonstrators on CARDINAL DATE , thereby committing the offence of disseminating propaganda in favour of the ORG and its leader .", "CARDINAL . ORG further referred to a decision dated DATE ( case no . CARDINAL , decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of ORG of ORG , in which the latter had considered that the acts of the accused demonstrators ( participation in the demonstration of DATE after calls for a demonstration had been made by the ORG , in accordance with the latter \u2019s aims ; the chanting of slogans in support of the ORG and PERSON ; singing the ORG \u2019s youth march song ; burning tyres and blocking traffic ; carrying ORG flags and banners and \u00d6calan posters ; attacking public buildings , as well as police and civilian vehicles with stones and Molotov cocktails ; carrying the bodies of the ORG militants who had been killed by the security forces ) should be considered as offences committed on behalf of that organisation . ORG found therefore that the accused should be punished for those offences and also be convicted of membership of an illegal organisation . Noting that the applicant had acted together with the aforementioned demonstrators on DATE , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s participation in the funeral and demonstration and his conduct at that time had also occurred as a result of instructions and calls by the ORG . The court considered that the applicant had acted on behalf of the organisation , in line with the goals and activities of the ORG , and that therefore he should be punished for not only disseminating propaganda , but also for membership of an illegal organisation .", "CARDINAL . One of the CARDINAL judges sitting on the bench of the assize court dissented . In his dissenting opinion , the judge stated that neither LAW of LAW nor the explanatory memorandum on LAW explained the concept of committing an offence on behalf of an illegal organisation . The dissenting judge noted that such an offence should be capable of producing a result for a terrorist organisation and its aims , such as the offences of aggravated injury , kidnapping , deprivation of liberty , murder or bombing . He also noted that such an offence should have devastating repercussions for society when the way of committing the offence , the time of the offence and its effects were taken into consideration . He finally opined that in order to conclude that non - members of an illegal organisation had committed an offence on behalf of that illegal organisation , there should be a decision to commit an offence on behalf of that organisation and an intention to join the organisation in question . The judge therefore concluded that the applicant should only have been convicted under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE in so far as it related to the applicant \u2019s conviction under LAW of LAW , on the basis of LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the same Code , for membership of an illegal organisation .

DATE , which had entered into force on DATE .
