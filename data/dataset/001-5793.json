{"ITEMID": "001-5793", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "POL", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "SIEMINSKA v. POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE , residing in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE in the morning the applicant \u2019s husband lost consciousness . The applicant \u2019s neighbour called an ambulance from the local emergency station . As it was not equipped with necessary resuscitation appliances , a second one was called . Despite resuscitation measures taken by the doctor , the applicant \u2019s husband died at TIME", "On DATE the applicant requested that criminal proceedings be instituted against the medical personnel involved in the incident , alleging that they had been negligent in dealing with her husband .", "On DATE the ORG discontinued the investigation finding that no criminal offence had been committed . It had been established that the ambulance had been called by the applicant \u2019s neighbour who had failed to inform the dispatchers at the local emergency station that the applicant \u2019s husband had an infarctus in DATE and that he had been unconscious . Immediately after the ambulance arrived at TIME , the physician had ordered at TIME that a resuscitation ambulance be called . This ambulance arrived at TIME and resuscitation measures had been taken , to no avail .", "The applicant filed an appeal with ORG against this decision .", "On DATE the ORG quashed the decision under appeal , considering that the evidence gathered in the case had to be completed . In particular , copies of the dispatching documents of the emergency station on which the lower prosecutor had relied , were unreadable and nothing could reasonably have been established on this basis in respect of the exact time when the ambulance had been called and when the applicant had urged the station to speed up their action . There were also certain discrepancies between these documents , which had not been explained . Moreover , the neighbour who had first called the ambulance should have been questioned . The prosecutor emphasised that the dispatching document had shown that the first call referred to the applicant \u2019s husband as \u201c dying \u201d . Thus , it was necessary to establish why an ordinary ambulance had been sent to a person qualified as dying . It was further necessary to find exact times when the applicant and her neighbours had called the emergency station . Moreover , it was necessary to explain whether it was indeed the case that under existing regulations only a physician was entitled to call a resuscitation ambulance .", "On DATE ORG again discontinued the investigations . It was established that on DATE the applicant \u2019s neighbour called the ambulance . As the applicant was in a state of shock , she did not give precise information concerning her husband \u2019s state . The neighbour was consequently unable to provide details as to his medical past . PERSON , dispatcher at the emergency station , noted information she obtained stating that the applicant \u2019s husband was \u201c dying and conscious \u201d . A decision was taken by CARDINAL dispatchers PERSON and ORG to send an ordinary ambulance . It was noted that a regulation was in force at that time which allowed for dispatching a resuscitation ambulance only on the order of a physician . Exceptions from this rule were allowed only if the calling person provided medical details allowing for such a decision . The ambulance left the station at TIME and arrived at the applicant \u2019s address at TIME In the meantime , at CARDINAL approximately , the applicant \u2019s neighbour had urged the emergency services to send the ambulance . After the ambulance arrived , physician PERSON ordered the driver at CARDINAL to call a resuscitation ambulance and proceeded to the resuscitation with the equipment available at the ordinary ambulance . The resuscitation ambulance arrived at CARDINAL . Subsequently , further resuscitation efforts had been made with the use of a special cardiological equipment , but to no avail . At TIME the applicant \u2019s husband died . The prosecutor concluded that in the light of the evidence there were no grounds on which to find that the medical staff was negligent or too slow in their actions in such a manner as could contribute to the applicant \u2019s husband \u2019s death .", "The applicant appealed again , complaining that the evidence taken during the investigations was insufficient for the proceedings to be discontinued .", "On DATE the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Regional Prosecutor upheld the decision of DATE , considering that in the light of the evidence there were no grounds on which to accept that the staff of the emergency station had acted in breach of any regulations in force at the material time . It was true that certain doubts could be expressed as regards the fact that no resuscitation ambulance had been sent after the second phone call by which the applicant \u2019s neighbour provided more detailed information about the state of the applicant \u2019s husband . However , on the whole , the manner in which the staff had acted confirmed the conclusion of the lower prosecutor that they had no case to answer .", "The applicant subsequently requested ORG to reopen the proceedings , to no avail . The prosecutor , in its letter of DATE stated that the case - file had been re - examined . It was further emphasised that the first ambulance was called at TIME approximately , it left the station at CARDINAL a.m. and arrived at the applicant \u2019s address at TIME . The second ambulance , carrying resuscitation equipment , was called at CARDINAL a.m. and arrived at CARDINAL . There were numerous documents concerning the calling , dispatching and arrival of the ambulances and a number of persons were involved in making these documents . They were acting independently in this respect . This in itself cast doubt on the applicant \u2019s arguments that the relevant documents had been forged so that the staff could evade criminal responsibility . The evidence given by the applicant \u2019s neighbours corresponded with the conclusions which had been drawn from the testimony of other witnesses . The evidence was also concordant in that the applicant \u2019s neighbour , in the first phone call for the ambulance to be sent did not give details concerning the state of the applicant \u2019s husband at that time , which in turn entailed a decision to send the ordinary ambulance .", "The Chambers of Physicians\u2019 Act of CARDINAL DATE established ORG as a professional organisation of physicians . Membership of the ORG is mandatory . Disciplinary responsibility of physicians for professional misconduct may be determined in proceedings before the organs of the ORG , i.e. agents for disciplinary matters and disciplinary courts . Agents and members of the courts for each region are elected by members of a local chamber . The Chief Agent for ORG and ORG are elected by ORG , composed of delegates of local chambers .", "Pursuant to LAW , the following penalties may be imposed in disciplinary proceedings : a warning , a reprimand , suspension of the right to practise medicine for a period from DATE and striking out of the register of physicians .", "The procedure to be followed in disciplinary proceedings is governed by the Order on Procedure in Disciplinary Proceedings issued by the Minister of Health on DATE .", "Under this Order , the agent for disciplinary matters must investigate the matter if he obtains credible information that the rules of professional conduct have been infringed . While investigating such a complaint , the agent may question physicians charged with professional misconduct , may appoint experts and question witnesses , and take such other evidence as he or she sees fit . A physician charged with professional misconduct is entitled to make any submissions which he or she deems relevant .", "If information existing at the time the investigations are instituted , or gathered in the course thereof , is sufficient to charge a physician with professional misconduct , the agent shall draw up a motion to the court for a disciplinary penalty to be imposed , containing a detailed description of the alleged offence and written grounds .", "Pursuant to LAW , the agent shall discontinue proceedings if he concludes that the material gathered does not suffice for drawing up a motion for a penalty to be imposed .", "A complainant may lodge an appeal against that decision with the Chief Agent for Disciplinary Matters . A further refusal of the Chief Agent may be appealed against to ORG .", "Under LAW , if the court , having received a motion for a penalty to be imposed , decides that the case is ready for examination at a hearing , it orders that a hearing be held . A physician is summoned to a hearing , whereas his defence counsel and the agent are informed of its date .", "Under LAW , in disciplinary proceedings the complainant is entitled to : submit a request for evidence to be taken , lodge with the disciplinary court an appeal against the agent \u2019s decision to discontinue the proceedings , and lodge an appeal against a decision of a first - instance court on the merits , but only on the question of responsibility . The complainant is entitled to have access to the case - file but the agent can limit this access to documents that are not covered by medical confidentiality .", "Pursuant to LAW , the proceedings before the court are public for members of ORG .", "Under LAW of LAW Civil Code , the ORG and local municipalities are liable for damage caused by its agents in the exercise of their functions . There is established case - law of NORP courts to the effect that this liability of the ORG includes also liability for damages caused by medical treatment in a public system of medical care , run either by the ORG or by the municipalities ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
