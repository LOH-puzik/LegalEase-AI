From DATE PERSON refused all contact between the applicant and the girl . His attempts to see PERSON , with the help of the local custody and guardianship office , were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE was examined by PERSON , the director of the psychological centre , Inex-CARDINAL . PERSON stated that A. had a wide range of fears and displayed increased anxiety . On the basis of the tests conducted , it was established that A. had a close relationship with her mother and elder sister , but was distanced from her father and tended to reject him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE was examined by psychologist M - va , with a view to determining her emotional state following the long absence of her father . M - va 's conclusion stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ A. ] easily establishes contact with a stranger ( psychologist ) which proves that [ she ] has developed a feeling of safety .", "CARDINAL . [ A. ] is in stable emotional state . The girl is cheery , clever , actively reacts to jokes , displays initiative in communication and in games .", "CARDINAL . The child is surrounded by love and care from her mother and grandmother [ and ] likes to play with her elder sister .", "CARDINAL . The following [ ORG 's ] statements give rise to concern : \u201c My father does not give me presents ... \u201d , \u201c I feel good without him ... \u201d and \u201c I do n't want to see him \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The absence of the father is compensated by communication with a great - uncle and role - play games ( used as a therapeutic means ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's marriage was dissolved and PERSON was granted full custody of A.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sued PERSON for the obstruction of access to his daughter , A.", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON filed a counter - claim seeking to divest the applicant of his parental rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE Psychoneurological Dispensary No . CARDINAL carried out a psychological examination of the applicant at the request of ORG of GPE . The applicant consented to the examination . The panel of CARDINAL doctors that examined the applicant stated that he might be suffering from paranoid personality disorder or \u201c sluggish schizophrenia \u201d . However , the conclusive diagnosis could only be made upon an in - patient examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE was examined for a second time by PERSON , the director of the psychological centre , Inex-CARDINAL . PERSON stated that PERSON was highly communicative , intellectually developed and emotionally free . She also displayed a high degree of reflection , stability of mood , optimism and an interest in life . Various tests conducted revealed close relationships between PERSON and her mother and her elder sister and a rejection of her father . The main reasons for the rejection were expressed by A. as follows : \u201c he offends PERSON ( the elder sister ) \u201d , \u201c it is bad with him \u201d and \u201c he is mean \u201d . According to PERSON , the latter statement could be understood to mean that the applicant had an excessive tendency to preach . PERSON further stated that ORG 's rejection of her father was of a stable psychological and motivated nature , which might have been caused by a previous traumatic experience and was not inspired by another person . At the same time , PERSON willingly accepted the father of her elder sister , her maternal grandfather , sports coaches and a male psychologist . PERSON concluded that there had been a positive development in GPE over DATE that had passed since her first examination : the fears had disappeared , the anxiety had eased , she displayed optimism and emotional stability . A phobic reaction to men , which had previously been observed , had also disappeared . PERSON stated that , in his view , it was necessary to take into account ORG 's opinion concerning the choice of parent so as not to cause repeated psychological trauma .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON examined the applicant . He noted that the examination was of a superficial nature and could not substitute a complete in - patient psychological examination . PERSON further stated that the examination did not reveal any psychopathic symptoms . However , taking into account A 's persistent rejection of her father , he recommended exercising caution as regards their interaction so as not to cause repeated psychological trauma .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Izmaylovskiy ORG of GPE allowed the applicant to visit DATE between CARDINAL noon and TIME in the presence of PERSON The court relied , inter alia , on an expert 's opinion which stated that contact with the father would not have a negative effect on the child .

On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal and upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . PERSON failed to comply with the court order and the visit scheduled for DATE did not take place . On DATE the bailiffs ' office opened enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not able to see PERSON on either DATE or DATE . The bailiff summoned PERSON and requested her to obey the court order on pain of an administrative fine .", "CARDINAL . The applicant saw his daughter on DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE . The meetings were held in the presence of PERSON who , according to the applicant , prevented PERSON from speaking to him , playing with him or accepting his gifts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the Izmaylovskiy ORG claiming additional visiting TIME without PERSON supervision . PERSON requested that the applicant 's access rights be terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing during which it granted PERSON motion to adduce the following documents for examination : the medical report from ORG CARDINAL on A. 's psychological state , psychologists ' reports on her mental state DATE , reports from the school and the sports centre that A. had attended and the CARDINAL reports from ORG 's psychological examinations . The applicant submitted a detailed statement in support of his claim and requested an expert psychological examination of NORP The court granted the request . It also granted the motion of the local custody and guardianship office to examine A. at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . Following the examination conducted pursuant to the court order , expert PERSON stated the following .", "a ) PERSON and her mother had a close relationship characterised by an emotional bond and cooperation . PERSON attitude to her daughter was emotionally - open , she tried to understand and accept the child 's emotional state and the relationship was based on the girl 's interests . The mother undertook a democratic approach to parenting , which included a high level of verbal communication , the inclusion of the girl in discussions on family issues , the supporting of the child 's interests and independence . She paid sufficient attention to the girl 's physical and intellectual development .", "b ) During DATE contact with the applicant had been of an episodic and formal nature and , as a rule , in the presence of third persons . The applicant substituted direct parental communication with moralising and attempts to obtain assurances of A. 's affection in front of third persons or to demonstrate PERSON \u201c undue \u201d conduct . The values and behavioural motives of the applicant and PERSON differed significantly . The applicant typically had formal relationships with people devoid of pronounced emotional involvement , which were based on certain rules , worked out in the course of his life . His approach to parenting was based on control , implying significant restrictions to the child 's conduct . The applicant did not recognise his daughter 's right to her own interests and independent choice . He poorly understood , and did not take into account , the girl 's psycho - emotional and age - related behaviour .", "c ) A child 's \u201c core personality \u201d is formed at DATE . A. had a sufficiently high level of intellectual development . However , her emotional sphere was much more labile than that of an adult and mostly depended on her environment . Her own values and opinions were being developed in the course of communication within the family . Furthermore , it is typical for children to copy the conduct of other persons , primarily the parent of the same sex . Therefore , it might be asserted that ORG 's perspective of the issue was nearly identical to her mother 's . From the point of view of further social adaptation , her female upbringing ( mother , grandmother , elder sister ) was sufficiently auspicious as it enabled a model of \u201c female conduct \u201d in society to be successfully put into practice . The remote negative result is that A. might have difficulties in building her own family , due to the absence of an adequate model of conjugal partnership . However , this applies to all children from single - parent families .", "d ) The feeling of safety is a vital human need . The basic feeling of safety is provided by the family . In DATE of a child 's life , communication with the mother is more important , irrespective of the child 's gender . The child forms an image of the father through the prism of the mother 's perception and his / her own communication with him , which A. had been deprived of for DATE . At the time in question , PERSON saw the applicant as an incomprehensible stranger , whose actions had subverted her feeling of safety . Her mother and grandmother , in compliance with the court order , had effectively forced A. to communicate with her father , whom she did not love and was afraid of . As a result , ORG 's immediate family ( mother and grandmother ) and relatives ( father ) , instead of being the safety factor , became the danger factor . A. 's negative emotional stress , brought about by the meetings with her father was expressed in affective reactions ( shouts , tears , obsessive movements ) observed after the meetings . The increase of the duration of the meetings , especially in the mother 's absence , would entail the risk of the child 's persistent neurosis or depression , due to the impossibility of avoiding the subjectively distressing situation . The extreme manifestation of such a condition is self - aggression ( suicidal tendencies , thoughts and actions ) .", "e ) The so - called \u201c female upbringing \u201d was not a factor that would foster a negative or \u201c wrong \u201d attitude by the girl towards men in general . A. was unlikely to develop serious problems from the point of view of social or professional adaptation . She had sufficient experience of communication with the opposite gender through contacts with her peers , teachers , sports coaches , and so on .", "f ) Blood relations do not guarantee mutual love , respect or deep attachment . Emotional relationships are formed in the course of cohabitation , communication , upbringing and communal activity . The inability or unwillingness of the parents to establish a civilised relationship might have affected the negative attitude of ORG towards the applicant . The prolonged conflict between the applicant and PERSON , with whom PERSON identifies , resulted in the child 's lack of belief in the possibility of a positive development of her relationship with her father .", "g ) Ignoring the girl 's emotional and rational rejection of her father and forcing her to meet with him might cause irretrievable adverse effects on the latter 's health and psychological well - being . It might also adversely affect ORG 's moral development , since in such a situation neither the family nor the ORG would provide her with psychological support and safety .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Izmaylovskiy ORG delivered its judgment . The court had studied several expert reports . In particular , in DATE and DATE had been referred to a psychologist at the GPE centre for children . In the report , the psychologist stated that in DATE had been provided with psychological aid after meetings with her father since , after the resumption of contacts with her father , the girl was highly agitated , irritable and suffered from nightmares . The same psychologist had consulted the applicant and stated that he was showing no parental interest in or affection for his daughter . His perception of the child was \u201c inadequate \u201d and he displayed \u201c a pathological tendency towards litigation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court also studied the report of the expert examination conducted pursuant to its order of CARDINAL DATE and examined expert PERSON during the hearing . She confirmed the conclusions she had stated in the report and emphasised that forcing PERSON to meet with the applicant , especially without the presence of PERSON , might irreversibly affect her physical and psychological well - being and possibly lead to neurosis and depression . Furthermore , expert PERSON asserted a strong opinion that the applicant was interested in having contact with A. only to boost his self - esteem and not to establish a relationship with the child . The absence of such a relationship was acknowledged by the applicant himself in his letters to PERSON and the bailiff , where he stated that his daughter did not wish to see him , hated him , wanted to change her surname and refused to accept his gifts .", "CARDINAL . ORG further examined the opinion of the local custody and guardianship service which stated that meetings between the applicant and PERSON should be discontinued , having regard to the interests and wishes of the latter , who strongly resisted communication with her father .", "CARDINAL . The court questioned the applicant , who reiterated his claim . It also questioned PERSON , who stated that during the meetings the applicant had provoked a negative reaction on the part of GPE , for example , by forcibly removing her glasses or earphones , forcing her to accept a book as a present and then taking pictures so as to document her refusal . He failed to establish a relationship with the girl , did not take into account her opinion , applied coercion and brought her to tears . After the meetings with the applicant A. developed nervousness , problems sleeping and refused to leave the house . This behaviour was noted in the psychologists ' reports .", "CARDINAL . ORG further examined several other witnesses . A. 's school sports coach and her aunt stated that the girl was very sociable , but reacted negatively to her father , wanted to have her mother 's surname , had not allowed him to take a picture of her and had left the classroom when the applicant had come to visit her at school . The applicant 's father and brother believed that PERSON had turned her daughter against her former husband . PERSON step - father said that the applicant and his child had had a wonderful relationship until the parents ' separation .", "CARDINAL . ORG also questioned PERSON in the presence of a teacher . A. explained that she did not like her father , did not want to see or talk to him and wanted to have her mother 's surname .", "ORG held as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with LAW [ of LAW ] and section CARDINAL of ruling no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE of ORG of GPE , in exceptional cases a court may refuse a parent 's claim to determine the order of [ his or her ] participation in the child 's upbringing when communication between the child and ... the parent may adversely affect the child , his physical and psychological wellbeing .", "The court grants the claim to discontinue the father 's contact with his daughter and dismisses [ his ] claim for additional visiting TIME , having regard exclusively to the interests of the minor , in particular : the contact ... affects the child 's physical and psychological well - being , which is demonstrated by the lack of mutual understanding and communication between the father and the daughter during the meetings ordered by the court 's previous decision ; having the father 's surname is a traumatising situation for the child ; the meetings have a very formal nature ; the child 's conduct at the appearance of her father , when in her mother 's presence , is characterised by strong rejection ( [ she ] hid under the desk ; ran away ; tore up [ her ] letter of commendation bearing the surname \u201c GPE \u201d ; after seeing her father , she refused to go to a picnic with her classmates ) , which is not conducive to creating psychological comfort and a feeling of safety for the child ; the very litigation is psychologically traumatising since it was initiated by [ the applicant ] but is centred around the DATE child , who knows about it because the court decision of CARDINAL DATE is being enforced with her participation . Furthermore , the court takes into account that the child was being seen repeatedly by psychologists ...", "The lack of contact between the father and the daughter and the psychologically traumatising environment for the child is corroborated by the parties ' explanations , documentation from the case , statements by witnesses and the opinion of the local custody and guardianship office . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the judge removed CARDINAL of the applicant 's representatives from the courtroom . The applicant also asked his second representative to leave the courtroom and requested that the judge provide him with legal representation . After the refusal to grant his request , the applicant unsuccessfully challenged the judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment .
