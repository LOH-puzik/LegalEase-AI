De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicants , ORG , PERSON , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are citizens of GPE and GPE who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively . They were represented before the ORG by ORG , a law firm based in GPE . The Government of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants were registered owners of a public road running alongside their house in PERSON .", "On DATE the Konjic Municipality started civil proceedings against the applicants before ORG . It maintained that the applicants had mistakenly been registered as the owners of the road and requested the rectification of the register .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the claim . It held that the applicants had acquired the title by adverse possession .", "On DATE ORG ruled in favour of GPE on the grounds that public roads were not subject to the rules on adverse possession . It appears that the register was then rectified and that the ORG title to the road was extinguished as a result .", "On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG as well as an appeal with ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the case as premature as it was still pending before ORG . It instructed the applicants that they could again lodge a constitutional appeal after ORG had rendered its decision .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal because the value of the claim did not exceed MONEY ( BAM ) and the case did not raise any questions affecting the application of the law in other cases .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a new constitutional appeal , as instructed by ORG in its decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the case as out of time . It held that the appeal on points of law had not been an effective remedy and that the applicants should have therefore lodged a constitutional appeal within DATE from the delivery of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE the applicants requested ORG to revise that decision in view of the fact that they had lodged their first constitutional appeal regarding the same matter on DATE . On DATE ORG accepted that request . On DATE it examined the merits of the case and dismissed the case as manifestly ill - founded .", "The Roads Act DATE was in force at the relevant time ( from DATE until DATE ) . Section CARDINAL of that Act provided that public roads were a matter of general interest and that title to a public road could not be acquired . The Roads Act DATE , which entered into force on DATE , contains a similar provision ( see section CARDINAL of that Act ) .", "LAW DATE has been in force since DATE . Under section CARDINAL of that Act an appeal on points of law is , in principle , not allowed if the value of the claim in issue does not exceed BAM CARDINAL , but ORG may exceptionally take such a case if it considers that it raises a question affecting the application of the law in other cases .", "The current Rules have been in force since DATE . Under Rule CARDINAL a party may , in the event of the discovery of a fact which might by its nature have a decisive influence on the outcome of the dispute concerned and which , when a decision was taken , was unknown to ORG and could not reasonably have been known to that party , request ORG , within DATE after that party acquired knowledge of the fact , to revise that decision .", "In principle , if a constitutional appeal concerns civil proceedings dealing with a claim the value of which does not exceed BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL , an appeal on points of law is not considered to be an effective remedy for the reason that ORG deals with the merits of such appeals only exceptionally ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) . Therefore , ORG will not reject such a case on non - exhaustion grounds only because an appellant has not lodged an appeal on points of law . In the same way , ORG will reject such a case as out of time if an appellant has awaited the outcome of his or her appeal on points of law and has thus lodged a constitutional appeal DATE from the date of delivery of the second - instance decision ( unless ORG has exceptionally examined the merits of the case ) . However , if an appellant lodges a constitutional appeal in parallel with an appeal on points of law , ORG may reject the constitutional appeal as premature pending the outcome of the appeal on points of law even if the value of the civil claim in issue does not exceed BAM CARDINAL . If so , the appellant may lodge a second constitutional appeal within DATE from the date of delivery of the decision on the appeal on points of law ( regardless of weather ORG has dealt with the merits of that case or not ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
