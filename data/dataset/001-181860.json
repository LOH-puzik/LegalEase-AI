In his defence , the applicant explained that he and his wife had been visiting her daughter in GPE who had recently had a serious attack of epilepsy , and submitted documentary evidence suggesting that his wife \u2019s daughter did indeed suffer from epilepsy . The money he had been carrying originated from : ( a ) a company called ORG soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile immobili\u00e8re ) PERSON registered in GPE , of which he was the director and the only member , from whose account he had withdrawn ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL with a view to starting another business ; and ( b ) the sale of their house in GPE ( the remaining amount ) . The applicant submitted relevant documents as evidence of those transactions . He also explained that he had not wished to deposit the money in a bank account because , in the wake of the global financial crisis of DATE , he had been afraid that his bank would go bankrupt and that he would lose most of that money , given that the NORP ORG only guaranteed up to LAW of bank deposits .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the ORG requested information from the relevant authorities in GPE , GPE and GPE . While the NORP authorities did not reply at all , the NORP authorities informed the ORG that neither the applicant nor his wife had been recorded in their register of suspicious transactions , and the NORP authorities only confirmed the authenticity of the transactions on which the applicant relied to prove the origin of the money he had been carrying .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of having committed the administrative offence in question and fined him CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) .

On the basis of the documentary evidence , the Ministry established that : ( a ) the company ORG had been founded in DATE and recorded in the business and companies register in GPE , and under NORP law its members were liable for its debts in proportion with their share in the company , that is , the applicant in respect of PERCENT and his wife in respect of PERCENT ; ( b ) on DATE the applicant had indeed sold his house in GPE , and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL from the proceeds of sale had been paid into his bank account on DATE , from which he had first transferred ORG CARDINAL to his company \u2019s account on DATE and then withdrawn ORG CARDINAL ; and ( c ) on DATE the applicant , acting as the company \u2019s director , had sold its real estate , and EUR FAC from the proceeds of sale had been paid into the company \u2019s bank account on DATE , a sum which had been withdrawn by the applicant DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Ministry held that the origin of the money which the applicant had failed to declare was irrelevant in relation to the commission of the offence of which he had been convicted or the imposition of the fine . However , that consideration was relevant in relation to the imposition of the protective measure of confiscation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the Ministry decided not to confiscate LAW of the money which the applicant had not declared , because it found that this sum did indeed originate from the sale of his house in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the remaining ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( of the EUR CARDINAL which had been seized ) , the Ministry held that this sum was part of the funds which the applicant had withdrawn from his company \u2019s bank account ( ORG ORG ) on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Ministry further held that : ( a ) since there was no evidence that the applicant had borrowed that money from his company , by carrying it across border he had disposed of it as if it had belonged to him , which amounted to misappropriation of the company \u2019s funds , an offence punishable in every country ; and ( b ) he had failed to pay the relevant taxes in GPE on that amount . It therefore decided to confiscate that sum .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed by arguing that : ( a ) the evidence collected indicated that the NORP authorities had been aware of the transaction from which the confiscated sum originated , but had done nothing about it , which suggested that they considered that it originated from a legitimate source , ( b ) the Ministry correctly assumed that he had not borrowed the confiscated sum from his company , as he had actually lent EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL to his company in DATE and DATE , for which he had submitted documentary evidence ; ( c ) NORP under NORP law , he was fully liable for the debts of his company , the payment of which , including taxes , he therefore could not have avoided by misappropriating the company \u2019s funds as the ORG implied ; ( d ) the ORG had attempted to interpret foreign ( NORP ) law , and in such a complex area as tax and commercial law , about which it had known very little ; and ( e ) it was peculiar that the Ministry had confiscated for the benefit of the NORP State budget the amount on which he had , in the ORG \u2019s own view , not paid the relevant taxes in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( ORG prekr\u0161ajni sud PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the ORG \u2019s decision , endorsing the reasons given therein .", "CARDINAL .

It found that , even though the applicant had relied on the relevant Articles of the LAW in his constitutional complaint , he had not substantiated his complaint by any constitutional - law arguments , but had merely repeated the arguments raised in the proceedings before ORG and ORG . Therefore , ORG had been unable to examine the merits of his constitutional complaint ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
