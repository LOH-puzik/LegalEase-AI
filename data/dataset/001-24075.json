Upon solemn promise ( gegen NORP ) to refrain from such activities he was released on CARDINAL DATE . ORG ) preferred the indictment ( PERSON ) on DATE , charging the applicant with offences under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( LAW ) . From the beginning the proceedings received extensive press coverage .", "On DATE the applicant was questioned as a witness in criminal proceedings brought against GPE , who was also charged with offences under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . Following his testimony , the presiding judge ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest on the suspicion of having given false evidence .", "On DATE the trial against the applicant started before ORG ) at ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) . The presiding judge was the same that had conducted the proceedings against GPE and had ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest during the hearing on DATE .", "Trial hearings were held on DATE . As of DATE , evidence was taken by hearing witnesses , reading out documents and showing video tapes . On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel , who was at that stage given the opportunity to make an extensive comment on the evidence taken so far , expressly appreciated the fair and objective conduct of the proceedings . When on the eighth hearing day personal letters of the applicant and his father were read out neither the applicant nor his defence counsel opposed this manner of taking evidence .", "On DATE ORG convicted the applicant under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( GPE ) and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "The jury found that the applicant had as leader of an association ( ORG ) amongst other activities recruited new members , organised special events where the members of the association were familiarised with a historical view glorifying the dictators of ORG , its army , the ORG and the ORG , denying at the same time the systematic killing by use of toxic gas under the ORG regime and transmitting ORG ideology to the members and that he had organised the distribution of pamphlets with similar contents . Further , the jury found that the applicant had organised as of DATE paramilitary training camps ( Wehrsport\u00fcbung ) by mobilising members in uniform of different associations organised in the extreme right - wing \u201c ORG \u201d ( ORG ) with a view to strengthen the feeling of solidarity among the participants , their tactical preparation for violent conflicts and the setting - up of a military cadre which could impose if necessary by the use of force the aims of the ORG , namely the seizure of power in GPE and the simultaneous incorporation of GPE into an GPE ( Grossdeutschland ) .", "In imposing the sentence , ORG considered the applicant \u2019s confession as a mitigating circumstance while his leading position in the above organisations , the multitude of his activities and the indoctrination of a great number of young people with ORG ideas were taken into account as aggravating circumstances .", "On DATE the applicant filed a plea of nullity and an appeal against sentence ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde und Berufung ) . In his plea of nullity he complained in particular that the questions put to the jury were not duly formulated and that the legal instructions given to the jury were incorrect .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) confirmed the conviction while reducing the sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "ORG found that ORG had not duly weighed mitigating and aggravating circumstances . In particular , it had not attached sufficient weight to the applicant \u2019s confession and had failed to take into account that the applicant had renounced the incriminated activities in DATE . Moreover , he had clearly placed himself at a distance from his former activities during the trial . Having regard to the recent conviction under section CARDINALa ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of GPE who had been the founder and leader of ORG and was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , a sentence of DATE imprisonment for the applicant appeared disproportionate . Finally , ORG , referring to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) found that the conditions for an extraordinary mitigation of sentence ( ausserordentliche GPE ) were met , i.e. a sentence below of the statupplicant \u2019s guilt .", "B.
