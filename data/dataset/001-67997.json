They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , acting on behalf of \u201c ORG , a non - governmental organisation based in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON ORG , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "All the applicants ( except PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , see above ) are suffering from chronic renal failure ( a gradual and progressive loss of the ability of the kidneys to excrete waste , concentrate urine , and conserve electrolytes ) and consequently they need haemodialysis ( a medical procedure that uses a machine to filter waste products from the bloodstream and to restore the blood \u2019s normal constituents ) .", "They are all disabled on account of their disease and receive ORG disability allowances which vary DATE ( MDL ) and MDL CARDINAL .", "The applicants have their haemodialysis done at a PERSON hospital called ORG NORP ( the \u201c LAW \u201d ) , where CARDINAL patients are treated . The applicants submit that before DATE the expense of their haemodialysis was covered entirely by the hospital . DATE the hospital \u2019s budget was reduced and only strictly necessary procedures and medication were provided free to them . From DATE the situation became more or less identical to that existing before DATE , with the exception of the frequency of haemodialysis sessions ( see below ) .", "There are CARDINAL more hospitals in GPE that perform haemodialysis - another hospital in PERSON called Spitalul de Urgen\u0163\u0103 ( the \u201c SU \u201d ) , and hospitals in GPE , GPE and PERSON . The applicants submit that , unlike the ORG , the ORG was financed from the budget of GPE and therefore always provided its patients with all the necessary medication free . They also argue that there are administrative barriers presenting the applicants who do not live in PERSON from receiving treatment at the ORG . As to the other CARDINAL hospitals , the applicants submit that the quality of the haemodialysis treatment provided by them is inferior to that of the SCR .", "According to the parties , the following are necessary for haemodialysis treatment : a haemodialysis package , heparin , physiological saline , syringes , CaCl ( PERCENT ) , glucose ( PERCENT ) , euphylin PERCENT , alcohol and vitamins . There are also some medications and accessories which are necessary in some cases , namely riboxin , antibiotics , plaster , gauze and blood .", "According to the applicants , before DATE the hospital provided them free with the haemodialysis procedure and some basic medication and accessories such as the haemodialysis package , heparin , physiological saline , syringes and CaCl ( PERCENT ) . They had to pay for the rest of the necessary medication . In DATE , the applicants were allegedly told by the hospital authorities that the haemodialysis unit at the ORG might close due to insufficient financing from the ORG budget . The applicants were forced to protest before ORG and in front of the President \u2019s residence , and consequently the hospital continued to provide them with haemodialysis , but , as previously , without full coverage .", "After DATE the hospital started to provide them free with almost all the necessary medication . The hospital does not provide them , however , with a drug called ORG , which operates to raise the haemoglobin level , or with calcium , PERSON and GPE . In order to increase their level of haemoglobin , the applicants are usually given blood transfusions . DATE the applicants were not provided with free blood by the hospital . After that date the hospital started to provide free blood , but the applicants still have to wait until it becomes available . Since they sometimes need blood urgently , they have to buy it . The applicants also submit that no medical investigation for the determination of anaemia status is performed at the ORG and that the doctors only establish the existence of anaemia .", "According to the ORG , before DATE the treatment of the applicants was carried out in accordance with the provisions of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE on the minimum of medical assistance guaranteed by the ORG ( see below ) . In accordance with that law , the applicants received only the strictly necessary medication free . They had to buy the rest of the medication prescribed by their doctors . PERSON treatment has never been stopped and has never been refused to anybody . According to the official documents provided by the Government , in DATE the haemodialysis section of the ORG received MDL CARDINAL ( the equivalent of CARDINAL ( ORG ) at the time ) from the ORG budget .", "On DATE a new medical insurance system was implemented in GPE and in accordance with the new legislation the applicants started to receive all the necessary medication free ( see below ) . If a patient needs some particular medication not provided by the ORG , then the doctor recommends that the patient buys it . According to a directive of ORG of DATE , the ORG spends MDL CARDINAL ( the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL at the time ) for DATE of hospitalisation , MDL CARDINAL ( the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL at the time ) for a haemodialysis of the first degree and MDL CARDINAL ( the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL at the time ) for a haemodialysis of the second degree .", "According to the applicants , in the GPE , GPE and GPE countries , renal failure patients receive TIME of haemodialysis in CARDINAL sittings per week . The same practice was followed in GPE before DATE . After DATE the practice changed and the patients started to receive TIME of haemodialysis in CARDINAL sittings per week . \u201c Only applicants that are in bad physical condition or ill are allowed to undergo the third haemodialysis permanently \u201d .", "The Government submitted a document from the haemodialysis section of the ORG according to which , in DATE , CARDINAL applicants underwent CARDINAL haemodialysis sessions per week ; CARDINAL applicants underwent CARDINAL sessions per week and the rest CARDINAL or CARDINAL haemodialysis sessions per week . According to the Government , the number of haemodialysis sessions is determined in each case by the doctors , who consider the gravity of the disease , the presence or absence of complications and the results of laboratory investigations .", "In their application lodged on DATE the applicants submitted that there were CARDINAL haemodialysis machines at the ORG which were all old and in a bad technical condition . In their observations of DATE they submitted that before their application was lodged with ORG the haemodialysis machines were in bad technical condition ; however , they had been replaced after the application was lodged with ORG . They also stated : \u201c In DATE the majority of the haemodialysis machines performed dialysis on an acetate basis . After the application was lodged with the ORG , the number of machines that performed haemodialysis on a bicarbonate basis increased . DATE the majority of the applicants are undergoing bicarbonate - based haemodialysis . The bicarbonate - based haemodialysis is much better assimilated by most of the applicants . \u201d", "The Government submit that DATE there were CARDINAL haemodialysis machines , CARDINAL of which were new and the rest of which were old . In DATE the old machines had become unusable because of the shelf - life provision in their documentation and accordingly they had been replaced with new machines of NORP origin .", "According to the applicants , before the application was introduced , the water used for haemodialysis was not distilled . \u201c After the application was lodged with the ORG a water - filtration system was purchased and installed . After the new system was installed , they began to feel much better .... \u201d", "The Government submit that a contract has been signed with a NORP company and in DATE the number of haemodialysis machines will double .", "According to the applicants , many of them live in the provinces and have to travel to PERSON each time they need the treatment . Although there is no legal obligation in this respect , there is a practice according to which the local authorities cover the travel expenses for persons suffering renal failure who have to go to PERSON for haemodialysis . The applicants submit that this practice is usually followed and most of them get reimbursed . However , there are cases when these expenses are not covered and it is too expensive for the applicants to pay themselves .", "According to the Government , the obligation to cover the transportation expenses of invalids of the first and second degrees is provided for in LAW of LAW on the protection of invalids ( see below ) . The Government submitted copies of the payment rolls proving the payment of all the travel expenses and the applicants did not make any comment on them .", "On DATE the applicants sent the ORG a copy of a letter addressed to them and to several PERSON newspapers by the doctors of the ORG \u2019s haemodialysis section , together with a chart setting out the expenses of each patient . The letter was signed by the medical staff of the PERSON section of the ORG but not by the applicants . The chart was drawn up on DATE and bore the signatures of all the patients of the haemodialysis section of the SCR . The ORG representative admitted that all the applicants had signed the chart .", "According to the letter signed by CARDINAL doctors , there was a media campaign led by some PERSON newspapers and news agencies after the present application was lodged with the ORG . The doctors stated that the information presented by the newspapers was erroneous and misleading . They submitted that the situation of renal failure patients from the ORG had been over - dramatised for political reasons related to the forthcoming local elections and that it did not reflect reality . The doctors argued that the death rate of renal failure patients had diminished tenfold in comparison with DATE and that State financing of haemodialysis had increased threefold in DATE . \u201c We understand that the state of the country \u2019s economy is not perfect for CARDINAL to have everything ; and that is how it is in the case of health protection \u201d . The doctors contradicted the statement made by the ORG representatives in various newspaper articles according to which all the haemodialysis machines were old . According to the doctors , CARDINAL machines were brand new . They also disagreed that the situation of the patients of the ORG was worse than that of the patients of the ORG . They argued that their patients were provided with free basic services and medication in exactly the same conditions as patients from other hospitals , and that it was a general practice in GPE that doctors would ask the patients to buy supplementary medication not covered by the \u201c legal guaranteed minimum \u201d . The doctors also referred to the death of PERSON and stated that he had been their patient for DATE . According to them , in DATE he had had both his kidneys removed and in DATE of his life he had suffered terminal chronic renal failure and arthritis - like tuberculosis .", "The submitted chart contained information as to the coverage of the applicants\u2019 expenses for services / medication and for travel expenses . According to the chart , from the total number of CARDINAL applicants who were patients of the SCR , CARDINAL applicants ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ) had the services and medication not covered by the hospital paid for by the local authorities of their hometowns . Another CARDINAL applicants ( PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ) , in addition to the services and medication covered by the hospital , also had the rest partially covered by the local authorities of their hometowns . CARDINAL applicants ( PERSON , PERSON , ORG and PERSON ) did not have their travel expenses covered by the local authorities , and CARDINAL of those had been without cover for DATE .", "In their application submitted on DATE the applicants argued that their disability allowance was insufficient to pay for the medication necessary for the haemodialysis which was not provided free by the ORG . According to them , the minimum DATE expense associated with the haemodialysis amounted to MDL CARDINAL per person . Therefore they could not afford the procedure . They submitted that many of them were forced to undergo the procedure without all the necessary medication and were caused unbearable pain and suffering . According to them , there were cases of patients who refused to undergo the procedure for lack of money , and died .", "According to the applicants , \u201c as a result of the reduced number of haemodialysis sessions ... the level of microelements in the blood decreases significantly and that causes headaches , vomiting , sickness , cramps ... \u201d", "The applicants submit that the scarcity of funds made the death rate among renal failure patients higher than in other countries . They invoke the case of PERSON , an applicant who died in DATE . According to them , the death rate in the GPE is CARDINAL deaths per CARDINAL patients per year while at the ORG the death rate before DATE was CARDINAL and CARDINAL deaths . \u201c The increased death rate was determined by the inadequacy of haemodialysis and by the poor anaemia status . By improving the quality of haemodialysis , the death rate significantly decreased after DATE , when the new haemodialysis machines and the water filtration system were installed \u201d .", "According to the Government , in DATE there have been no deaths due to the insufficiency of haemodialysis . The Government contests the death rate invoked by the applicants , arguing that the applicants had failed to give the names of the persons who had allegedly died because of insufficient or improper medical care . As to the case of PERSON , the ORG submitted that he had survived for DATE without kidneys and that he had died in DATE of chronic arthritis - like tuberculosis and terminal renal failure . The ORG submitted an autopsy report in support of their argument and the applicants did not comment on it .", "The Government submitted a TIME video , filmed on DATE in the haemodialysis section of the ORG . The tape contains a brief presentation of the haemodialysis section and interviews with a doctor from that section ; a patient who had undergone haemodialysis at the LAW for DATE ; a patient who had undergone haemodialysis at the ORG for DATE and an applicant in the present case ; a patient who had undergone haemodialysis at the ORG for DATE ; and a patient who had undergone haemodialysis at the ORG for DATE .", "The doctor made a brief presentation of the haemodialysis section and stated in particular that the section had CARDINAL patients and that nobody has ever been refused haemodialysis treatment .", "CARDINAL of the patients stated that they received CARDINAL haemodialysis sessions per week , but that they could receive a third session if need be . The fourth patient answered that he received CARDINAL haemodialysis sessions per week .", "All the patients stated that they had never been refused a haemodialysis treatment ; that they received all the necessary medication free ; that their transportation expenses were covered and that they had never been discriminated against .", "CARDINAL of the patients stated that they sometimes used to spend TIME at the hospital and that in those cases they were provided with free food . The fourth patient stated that he never needed to spend TIME at the hospital .", "All the patients stated that they had never been maltreated by the hospital personnel and that they considered that the ORG took proper care of them .", "The ORG representative submits that the interviewer asked the patients leading questions aimed at obtaining answers convenient to the Government . He also argues that the video shows the present situation of the haemodialysis section and that it does not refer to the situation prior to DATE .", "The LAW of GPE provides in Article CARDINAL :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The minimum level of health care protection provided by the ORG shall be free . \u201d", "Law no .

They also stated that no similar cases had been examined by their courts . The President of ORG stated that his court had examined a case in which a hospital was obliged to pay compensation to a renal failure patient ; however the letter did not state what the compensation was for and no copy of the relevant judgment was attached to it .", "It appears from the parties\u2019 submissions that after the new law on medical insurance entered into force on DATE the situation of the haemodialysis patients improved considerably in respect of the supply of free medication .
