In addition , since ORG has not granted leave , the prosecution is declared inadmissible if it concerns an offence committed when the defendant was a member of parliament . If , however , criminal proceedings were initiated prior to that , when the defendant was not a member of parliament , then they are suspended until the said leave is granted or until the defendant \u2019s status as a parliamentarian ends ... It should be noted that in the present case no matter arises concerning the interpretation of Articles CARDINAL , DATE and QUANTITY of the LAW ... and of LAW , so as for the court to rule that ORG \u2019s leave is not required to conduct this trial because the above - mentioned act did not take place , according to the civil claimant \u2019s allegations , in the context of her parliamentary duties . That is because the prosecutable offence ( slander for an interview that the defendant gave to a newspaper in her capacity as General Secretary for ORG , ORG ) clearly does not concern a private dispute ; it should be examined if it relates and is linked to the political activity of the defendant - deputy and in general to the exercise of her parliamentary duties .
