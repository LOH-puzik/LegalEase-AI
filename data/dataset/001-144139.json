As regards the new mandatory retirement age for judges ( and prosecutors ) , the ORG stated that ORG rules on equal treatment in employment ( Directive CARDINAL ) prohibited discrimination at the workplace on grounds of age . Under the case - law of ORG of the ORG , an objective and proportionate justification was needed if a government were to decide to reduce the retirement age for CARDINAL group of people and not for others .

The court observed that the categories of persons concerned by the provisions at issue benefited , until their entry into force , from a derogation allowing them to remain in office until DATE , which gave rise , in those persons , to a well - founded expectation that they would be able to remain in office until that age . However , the provisions at issue abruptly and significantly lowered the age - limit for compulsory retirement , without introducing transitional measures to protect the legitimate expectations of the persons concerned ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
