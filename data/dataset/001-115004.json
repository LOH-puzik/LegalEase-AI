In the issue of the DATE news magazine ORG an article was published on searches carried out by police in the PERSON seminary . According to the article , police had searched the seminary on suspicion of someone having downloaded child pornography from the Internet . The article further stated that , according to rumours , police had also found photographs showing seminarians engaging in homosexual activities , and that there were rumours of unwanted homosexual advances towards seminarians involving abuse of authority . The article was accompanied by a photograph of the applicant , showing him standing in a garden , and by an interview with him in which he said that he did not believe that there had been any unwanted sexual advances by superiors and that the rumours were part of an intrigue or a revenge plot by a former seminarian . He denied involvement in any such incidents .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its issue of CARDINAL DATE ORG published an article entitled \u201c Go on ! \u201d ( Trau dich doch ) .

First the principal and now the deputy principal have resigned . High - ranking dignitaries expect PERSON [ the bishop of the diocese ] to be removed from office . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The article stated that the applicant and the deputy principal had had sexual relations with seminarians and that CARDINAL of them had regularly spent DATE or longer periods with the applicant at the GPE monastery . It also stated that there was nothing to corroborate the rumours of unwanted homosexual advances which had been reported DATE . The article further reported that some seminarians had downloaded pornography and child pornography onto their computers . According to the article , the existence of homosexual relations was well - known within the seminary and was even known to the bishop , who had tried to \u201c hush up \u201d the case at first . The article contained a photograph showing the applicant with his left arm around one of the seminarians , holding the DATE \u2019s wrist with his left hand and with his right hand on the man \u2019s crotch . This picture had been taken by CARDINAL of the seminarians at a birthday party and the applicant was shown looking into the camera , apparently aware that he was being photographed . In the article the applicant was identified by name while the ORG identities were not disclosed . Likewise , in the published photograph , the applicant \u2019s face was visible while that of the seminarian was blurred . The article was also accompanied by a statement from the applicant saying that the photograph could be interpreted in different ways .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant initiated proceedings under LAW ( Mediengesetz ) against ORG , the publisher of ORG , in relation to the article published on DATE . Relying on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the said LAW , he requested compensation for defamation ( \u00fcble GPE ) and for the violation of his strictly personal sphere ( h\u00f6chstpers\u00f6nlicher Lebensbereich ) caused by the publication of the photograph and the impugned article , especially the following passages :", "\u201c \u2018 NORP scandal . Photographic evidence of sexual antics between priests and their students has thrown the diocese of PERSON into disarray.\u2019 ; \u2018 A painful truth : PERSON \u2019s principal engaged in sex with subordinates , also PERSON \u2019s private secretary and legal adviser ... \u2019 ; \u2018 Photos showing , among others , seminarians from PERSON in kinky situations , in some cases with their superiors ... and because they were doing it with the boss and his deputy too , it was all quite normal and they felt perfectly safe ... \u2019 ; and \u2018 In DATE of DATE principal PERSON allegedly performed a kind of \u2018 sacrament of GPE DATE and NORP priest ORG in a PERSON restaurant.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The publisher of ORG replied that the content of the article was true . The company also argued that in the light of ORG position condemning homosexuality , and the fact that the applicant was responsible for the training of future priests in the seminary , the public had an interest in knowing about the facts published in the article and there was a direct connection with public life . The article was thus lawful by virtue of the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after holding several hearings at which evidence was heard from a number of witnesses , ORG ( PERSON , hereinafter \u201c the Regional Court \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for compensation .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that a large percentage of readers of the DATE ORG that had published the impugned article and the photograph would read the news magazine in only a cursory manner and would also consult other media before forming their opinion . Those readers would learn that there had been homosexual contacts between the applicant and seminarians and also among seminarians , and that there existed photographs to support this . The published photograph showed that the applicant and the seminarian were more than just friends and had had homosexual contacts . It represented the applicant with his left arm around the seminarian and his hand on the man \u2019s crotch and conveyed the impression that the latter consented to this close embrace .", "CARDINAL . Giving a detailed evaluation of various witness statements , ORG found it established that the applicant had had consensual homosexual relationships with several seminarians , one of whom had repeatedly spent DATE at GPE monastery ; this had led to an explicit instruction from Bishop PERSON prohibiting such visits by seminarians . Furthermore , the court found that the applicant had spent DATE with a seminarian during which they shared an apartment in a hotel . It also found that the applicant had performed a ceremony in a restaurant which an outside observer could have understood as bestowing a kind of \u201c sacrament of marriage \u201d on CARDINAL seminarians . Moreover , the statements of the witnesses had confirmed that the published photograph had been taken in the applicant \u2019s apartment at GPE monastery during a birthday party for CARDINAL of the seminarians . ORG therefore held that the facts contained in the article were in essence true .", "CARDINAL . Owing to the considerable importance of ORG as a role model , the public had a great interest in being informed about what was going on within the ORG . The public also had an interest in knowing what happened in the seminary , especially since it had become known that pictures containing child pornography had been downloaded from the Internet . The circumstances leading to such incidents were a subject of public interest and had a direct connection with public life . The applicant , as the head of the seminary , was a public figure in that capacity . Even though the impugned picture had been taken in his private residence there was a connection to his public life . While accusing a dignitary of ORG of having homosexual contacts constituted the actus reus of defamation within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW and exposed his strictly personal sphere within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , the publisher had proved that the reported facts were essentially true . Accordingly , the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation had to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law and fact with ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) . ORG , after holding a hearing , dismissed the appeal in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the judgment of ORG , ruling that the said court had not erred in fact or in law and had rightly held that the newspaper publisher had managed to prove that the content of the article was true . Regarding the complaint concerning the performance of a sort of sacrament of marriage , ORG found that it had not been proven that this allegation was true ; however , the allegation in question made up only a minor part of the article and thus would not render the judgment void . Furthermore , ORG held that , in reporting on photographic evidence of seminarians in \u201c kinky situations \u201d , the publisher had provided proof that the statements were true . The average reader of the magazine would understand the term \u201c kinky \u201d to mean a deviation from what was considered normal , which would include a photograph of priests and seminarians in a sexual pose wearing clerical clothing , especially as the persons concerned belonged to a group of people who publicly spoke out against homosexuality and denounced homosexual contacts as sinful . ORG went on to state as follows :", "\u201c The court can not accept the additional arguments to the effect that the substantive law was incorrectly applied because the conduct reported on fell within the sphere of strictly private life and had no connection with public life . ORG , to which the majority of the NORP population belongs and which , according to LAW ( BGBl . II No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , has public - law status , has a level of importance in GPE going beyond that of a small association , as is clear from the overall content of the ORG and the circumstances in which it was ratified . Accordingly , conduct on the part of ORG dignitaries which is in flagrant contradiction with NORP teachings may very well be of public interest , particularly where DATE as in the present case \u2013 homosexual contacts take place and are maintained , albeit on a consensual basis , between staff and students in an educational establishment and between students themselves . ORG strives for acceptance and credibility among the public at large , and the activities of a principal and a deputy principal , particularly those in charge of a training college for future priests , are directly related to public life . ORG is engaged in public relations work in many spheres and regularly makes its views on ( sexual ) morality known to the population as a whole , with the result that the general public is also entitled to be informed if individual officials are failing to practise what they preach , condemning homosexuality as a sin in public while practising it in private , even between staff and students . It should also be taken into consideration that the teachings of ORG on the subject of homosexuality are contrary to the fundamental right to sexual self - determination under LAW and to the prohibition on discrimination ; hence , on this basis also , there is a public interest in the publication of specific allegations that Church dignitaries are failing to observe their ORG \u2019s teachings on sexual morals . This is even more so where the reports concern homosexual contacts between a teacher and his students . Such relationships of dependency call for particular vigilance in order to avoid potential breaches of a fundamental code of conduct designed to protect the physical and psychological integrity of the students . The media have a vital role in publicly exposing misconduct in a democratic society governed by the rule of law .", "The exposure and public condemnation of such misconduct is thus in any event in the public interest ; the same is true of the reports identifying those concerned , without which it would not be possible to express credible criticism of specific inadmissible situations and thus fulfil the role of \u201c public watchdog \u201d . The weighing of interests in the present case should undoubtedly lead to the conclusion that the public right to information prevails . The professional activity of an ordained priest who is active in public life both as a clergyman and as head of a seminary does not take place merely within the ORG ; ORG has an important and , in some respects even a ORG role , and the credibility of its officials , who demand moral standards from the population and compliance with the ORG \u2019s rules of community life , occupies an important position in that regard . In particular , the fact that the events involved students who , as future officials of ORG are supposed to be taught these moral precepts by example , lends those events a public - interest dimension extending beyond the ORG itself and affects all sections of the population ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that since the article had reported essentially true facts and there was a public interest in their being reported , ORG had rightly rejected the applicant \u2019s request for compensation . The judgment was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after publication of the first article in ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant brought proceedings against the publisher and the editor - in - chief under LAW ( Urheberrechtsgesetz ) and LAW ORG ) . Those proceedings are the subject of application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE . They are summarised here , in so far as is necessary for the examination of the present case .", "CARDINAL . Relying on section CARDINAL of LAW the applicant asked ORG ( ORG ) to order the publisher of ORG and its editor - in - chief to", "( i ) refrain from making and publishing express statements or statements to the effect that photographs existed which showed him having homosexual contacts or appeared to show that he was homosexual and", "( ii ) refrain from publishing photographs of the applicant which violated his legitimate interests , especially in connection with allegations of unwanted homosexual advances involving abuse of authority , which were damaging to his honour and reputation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also requested ORG to issue an interim injunction prohibiting the publisher and the editor - in - chief of ORG from publishing the above - mentioned statements and pictures .", "CARDINAL . After publication of the second article in the issue of ORG , showing for the first time the photograph of the applicant with his hand on the seminarian \u2019s crotch , the applicant notified ORG of the further statements contained in that article and of the fact that the photograph had been published . He repeated the requests made on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In so far as relevant in the context of the present case , the applicant \u2019s request for an interim injunction was rejected by ORG , which gave its decision on DATE , and by ORG , which gave its decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG varied the lower courts\u2019 decisions , granting point ( ii ) of the applicant \u2019s request for an interim injunction . The publisher and the editor - in - chief of ORG were thus prohibited from publishing photographs of the applicant , in particular in connection with allegations of unwanted homosexual advances involving abuse of authority , which were damaging to the applicant \u2019s honour and reputation . However , ORG dismissed point ( i ) of the applicant \u2019s request , namely that the defendants be ordered to refrain from making and publishing express statements or statements to the effect that photographs existed which showed the applicant having homosexual contacts or appeared to show that he was homosexual .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) held that even the publication of true statements was capable of interfering with a person \u2019s right to privacy and thus might become unlawful . In such cases the interests of the persons concerned in the protection of their reputation or the intimate sphere of their private lives had to be weighed against the interests of the recipient of the information . Referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law under LAW , ORG noted the importance of freedom of the press , in particular where the latter reported on issues of general interest . In the present case , information about the homosexuality of officials of ORG was an important issue and as such was often the subject of public attention and discussion . It was the media \u2019s task to report and comment on actual cases . Thus , the applicant \u2019s interest was outweighed by the publisher \u2019s right to publish the statements , the truth of which was not in dispute .", "CARDINAL . As to the publication of the photograph , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The publication of images that would cause injury to legitimate interests is prohibited ( section CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . The injury must arise out of the actual publication of the image ( ORG ) . However , not only the image itself must be assessed , but also the manner of its dissemination and the context in which it is set ( PERSON ) . The assessment as to whether legitimate interests have been infringed must aim to establish whether the interests of the person depicted can be objectively said to be worthy of protection ( CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINALy = MR DATE , CARDINAL with further references ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP On the basis of these principles , the interests of the claimant in the present case should be considered worthy of protection , contrary to ORG view .", "The accompanying text portrays the claimant in a negative light . He is neither a \u2018 figure of contemporary society \u2018 par excellence \u2019\u2019 ( to use the terminology of the NORP case - law ) nor a \u2018 public figure\u2019 ( the term used in NORP legal practice ) whose appearance was already known to the general public before the picture was published ( CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It is clear that the publication of the picture intensifies the demeaning effect of the accompanying text , which is damaging to the honour of the person concerned ( \u2018 pillorying effect\u2019 ) . In such cases , therefore , publication of the picture can be justified only if , after the required weighing of interests , the interest of the publisher in publishing is found to prevail ( RIS - Justiz RSCARDINAL ) . However , that is not the case here . The protection of the intimate sphere of the claimant \u2019s private life carries greater weight in this case than the public interest in being informed of the image , in contrast to the case already examined concerning the text of the article . Of course , there is some force to ORG argument that publication was designed to some extent to \u2018 prove the claimant guilty\u2019 after he had denied the accusations as \u2018 ORG , and thus to allow the public to make up its own mind on the basis of the photograph . In ORG view , however , this argument is not sufficiently decisive to justify intruding upon the intimate sphere of the claimant \u2019s private life and providing documentary \u2018 evidence\u2019 of the allegations denied by the claimant . It must first be taken into consideration that the photograph was taken at a private party and thus indisputably fell within the private sphere protected by LAW ORG . If sexual freedom between consenting adults is recognised as an absolute personal right and the innermost private sphere is protected under the LAW , then this must also apply in principle to members of religious organisations and ORG officials , even if the practice of that sexual freedom is contrary to the ORG \u2019s teachings . Forfeiture of the right to anonymity requires particularly weighty reasons which do not apply here to the required degree . There is no overriding interest for the public at large to be informed of the claimant \u2019s appearance and to identify him via publication of his photograph . Even when publication takes place in connection with a criminal offence , the principle of proportionality of the interference applies . Likewise , even a genuine need to inform must not go beyond what is strictly necessary , so that it can not be accepted in all cases in which the public has reason to take an interest in a particular individual that there is a genuine need to be shown a picture of that person ( RIS - PERSON ) . The interest in dissemination of a picture can only take precedence if the picture has a particular news value \u2013 for instance , to warn the public about an escaped criminal ( CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL = SZCARDINAL CARDINAL Ob CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In any case , the proportionality principle prohibits publication merely in order to satisfy an appetite for scandal . The interest in being informed can be sufficiently met without publication of an image , simply by reporting the facts and referring to the existence of a photograph ( several photographs ) as evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant narrowed his previous claim to the publication of pictures , amended the wording of the injunction sought and added a claim for damages . He thus requested the court to order the publisher of ORG and its editor - in - chief to refrain from publishing photographs of him which violated his legitimate interests , especially in connection with allegations of unwanted homosexual advances towards seminarians involving abuse of authority , and/or of engaging in sexual antics or \u201c kinky \u201d situations with seminarians or similar allegations .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the claims .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG partly granted the applicant \u2019s appeal . Relying on section CARDINAL of LAW , it prohibited the publication of photographs of the applicant which violated his legitimate interests by accusing him of unwanted homosexual advances towards seminarians , especially involving abuse of authority , and of engaging in sexual antics or \u201c kinky \u201d situations with seminarians or similar accusations . However , it dismissed the claim for compensation .", "CARDINAL . ORG summarised the content of the articles published in ORG on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE and the reasoning set forth by ORG in its decision of DATE in the interim injunction proceedings . It went on to state as follows :", "\u201c No factual circumstances came to light in the main proceedings which would cause ORG to alter the manner in which it weighed the interests at stake in the preliminary injunction proceedings .", "It was established that the photograph was taken in PERSON monastery at the birthday party of CARDINAL of the seminarians , attended by the claimant and CARDINAL students of the seminary . The party was held in a meeting room and a \u2018 reception GPE of the apartment made available to the claimant in his capacity as provost of the monastery .", "Protection of the private sphere encompasses all matters which , on the basis of their information content , are typically classified as private . This covers individuals in their home , family or other environment removed from the public gaze ( Neukamm , ORG in GPE , CARDINAL ) . The right to protection of CARDINAL \u2019s private sphere encompasses the spaces in which the individual can rest , relax or simply let go . This includes any LOC from which the individual can exclude outsiders and escape the public gaze ( Neukamm , loc . cit . , CARDINAL ) .", "On that basis , there can be no doubt that the birthday party in the claimant \u2019s apartment fell within the private sphere , despite the fact that it was attended by seminarians and took place ( partly ) in a \u2018 reception GPE in the claimant \u2019s apartment .", "Neukamm , loc . cit . , CARDINAL ) . Hence , it is beyond dispute that the photograph in question falls ( exclusively ) within the claimant \u2019s private sphere .", "Furthermore , ORG previously ruled in the preliminary injunction proceedings that the public interest in the text of the article did not automatically justify publication of pictures of the person concerned .", "The publication of pictures depicting private conduct is not justified on the grounds of the public \u2019s interest in being informed ( Neukamm , op . cit . , CARDINAL , and ECtHR judgment of CARDINAL , application no . CARDINAL \u2013 News Verlag GmbH ) . This applies also to articles concerning private - life matters ( Neukamm , op . cit . , CARDINAL ) . If the publication of photographs serves the public \u2019s interest in being informed , that interest must be weighed against the personality rights of the person depicted . As a general rule , the latter should prevail ( Neukamm , op . cit . , CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also upheld ORG decision in so far as the latter had dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for damages . It noted that damages under LAW were to be awarded only if the general requirements laid down in LAW were met . In particular , it was necessary for the publisher to have acted culpably , with at least minor negligence . In the present case , the defendants had based their decision to publish the photograph on an arguable legal opinion . It was a borderline case in which a detailed weighing of the interests at stake had eventually led to the assessment that the publication of the photograph at issue had violated the applicant \u2019s legitimate interests . In the preliminary injunction proceedings ORG and even ORG had come to the opposite conclusion , holding the view that the publication of the picture had an information value of its own , while ORG had overturned their decisions . In these circumstances , the defendants were entitled to believe that the publication of the picture was admissible , and they had therefore not acted culpably .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the defendants lodged extraordinary appeals on points of law with ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the extraordinary appeals in a judgment of DATE , holding that the prerequisite for it to deal with the case , namely a question of law which was of fundamental importance for the unity of the law , was not met . With regard to the defendant \u2019s appeal it noted that it had already given detailed reasons in its decision of DATE explaining why , as far as the publication of the photograph was concerned , the applicant \u2019s interests in the protection of his private sphere under LAW outweighed the freedom to impart information protected by LAW in the circumstances of the present case . ORG had followed that reasoning in the main proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG dismissed the defendant \u2019s argument that the ORG decisions in the proceedings under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW were binding on the courts in the present case . It held that a decision taken under sections DATE CARDINAL of LAW did not resolve a preliminary question ( ORG ) in relation to the claim under section CARDINAL of LAW . There was no logical contradiction in prohibiting a newspaper publisher from publishing a picture under section CARDINAL of LAW while on the same facts dismissing a compensation claim under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The finding that the requirements for granting compensation were not met did not provide a basis for concluding that the publication of a picture did not violate legitimate interests within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
