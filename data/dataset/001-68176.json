The applicant , who had requested the court to decide the case in his absence , did not participate in the hearing . The court noted that , by the final decision of ORG dated CARDINAL DATE , the applicant 's land had been taken for public needs and that the lawfulness of that deprivation could not be disputed in the present proceedings .

As the applicant had already been evicted from the house , no execution of that decision was required .", "The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE on the grounds of the unlawful composition of the court , and the court 's failure to examine properly the evidence or to apply the relevant law . The case was remitted to the first instance court for a new examination .", "On DATE ORG examined the case . The applicant , who had been duly notified of the hearing , did not appear , having requested the court to decide the case in his absence . The applicant amended his claims , now requesting higher compensation for the house and the garden plants , as well as compensation for an alleged loss of profit from the plants . The court observed that , in order to implement the public purpose for which the land had been taken , namely the construction of a hotel complex , the demolition of the applicant 's house had been necessary . The court noted that the hotel complex had been built in DATE and that it was now used for the reception of representatives of the federal government and governments of foreign GPE , being managed by a ORG institution . The court found that the applicant never owned the land de jure . He used it in so far as he owned the house on it . Moreover a part of the land had been taken by him without permission . The court held that , in the absence of the applicant 's consent to acquire ownership of the CARDINAL flats offered to him , the district authority had rightly given him a protected tenancy in the flats . Taking into account the applicant 's entitlement to the acquisition of the ownership of the flats free of charge by way of privatisation , the court noted that they were at least twice as expensive as the cost of the applicant 's house . The court found that , together with the RUR CARDINAL paid to the applicant for the house , the ORG had duly compensated the applicant . As regards the garden plants , the court estimated their value in accordance with statutory requirements , and found that the compensation paid to the applicant exceeded that amount . The court found for the district authority . The applicant 's claims for repossession of the house and non - pecuniary damages were made into separate proceedings . The remainder of his claims was rejected . The court declared that the applicant 's property rights to the house had ceased in DATE , and ordered the eviction and transfer of the applicant and his family to the CARDINAL flats given by the district authority . As the applicant had already been evicted from the house , no execution of that decision was required .", "On appeal , on DATE ORG , having heard the applicant and his counsel and the district authority , quashed the part of judgment concerning the applicant 's claim for loss of profits in relation to the plants , and upheld the remainder . The court referred to the fact that the applicant 's house had been declared unsuitable for permanent residence .", "On DATE ORG examined the applicant 's claims against the district authority for repossession of the house and damages , including the alleged loss of profits in relation to the plants . It also examined CARDINAL other actions brought by the applicant against various authorities of GPE in connection with the demolition of his house . The court rejected the claim concerning loss of profits as being unsubstantiated , taking into account an expert opinion on the point . The remainder of the claims was rejected as ill - founded .", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal .", "Being dissatisfied with the way in which the judicial authorities in the aforementioned proceedings and various local and federal authorities and other persons had dealt with his case , the applicant attempted to bring proceedings against them all . However , his actions were either disallowed as having no basis in domestic law or not examined because of the applicant 's failure to meet relevant procedural requirements ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
