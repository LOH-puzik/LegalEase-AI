Another difficulty is that the ' kitchen trade ' has a high proportion of workers from ethnic minority groups who , with little chance of getting work elsewhere , are wary of being sacked \u2013 as many have been \u2013 for attempting union organisation .", "ORG have a policy of preventing unionisation by getting rid of pro - union workers .

The applicants were unable to pay for DATE transcripts of the proceedings , which cost MONEY CARDINAL per day , or GBP CARDINAL if split between the CARDINAL parties .

The trial judge refused to order ORG to supply the transcripts in the absence of the applicants ' undertaking , and this ruling was upheld by ORG . Thereafter , the applicants , using donations from the public , purchased transcripts at reduced cost ( GBP DATE ) , DATE after the evidence had been given . They submit that , as a result , and without sufficient helpers to take notes in court , they were severely hampered in their ability to examine and cross - examine witnesses effectively .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , Mr PERSON faced an unconnected action brought against him by the GPE of GPE relating to possession of a property . Mr PERSON signed an affidavit ( \u201c the GPE affidavit \u201d ) in support of his application to have those proceedings stayed until the libel trial was over , in which he stated that the libel action had arisen \u201c from leaflets we had produced concerning , inter alia , nutrition of ORG food ... \u201d . ORG applied for this affidavit to be adduced as evidence in the libel trial as an admission against interest on publication by ORG , and ORG agreed to this request . Mr PERSON objected that the affidavit should have read \u201c allegedly produced \u201d but that there had been a mistake on the part of his solicitor . The solicitor confirmed in writing to the court that the second applicant had instructed her to correct the affidavit , but that she had not done so because the error had not been material to the GPE proceedings . The applicants submitted that they assumed that the solicitor 's letter would be admitted in evidence , and that ORG did not warn them that it was inadmissible until the closure of evidence , so that they did not realise they needed to adduce further evidence to explain the mistake .

On DATE , ORG ruled on the meaning of the paragraph in the leaflet entitled \u201c What 's so unhealthy about ORG 's food ? \u201d , finding that this part of the leaflet bore the meaning", "\u201c ... that ORG 's food is very unhealthy because it is high in fat , sugar , animal products and salt ( sodium ) , and low in fibre , vitamins and minerals , and because eating it may well make your diet high in fat , sugar , animal products and salt ( sodium ) , and low in fibre , vitamins and minerals , with the very real risk that you will suffer cancer of the breast or bowel or heart disease as a result ; that ORG know this but they do not make it clear ; that they still sell the food , and they deceive customers by claiming that their food is a useful and nutritious part of any diet \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG against this ruling , initially relying on CARDINAL grounds of appeal . However , DATE before the hearing on DATE before ORG , ORG gave notice on behalf of both applicants that they were withdrawing QUANTITY of the CARDINAL grounds , and now wished solely to raise the issue whether the trial judge had been wrong in determining a meaning which was more serious than that pleaded by ORG in their statement of claim . The applicants submitted that they withdrew the other grounds of appeal relating to the meaning of this part of the leaflet because lack of time and legal advice prevented them from fully pursuing them . They mistakenly believed that it would remain open to them to raise these matters again at a full appeal after the conclusion of the trial . ORG decided against the applicants on the remaining single ground , holding that the meaning given to this paragraph by the judge was less severe than that pleaded by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the GPE affidavit , ORG sought permission from the court to amend their statement of claim to allege that the applicants had been involved in the production of the leaflet and to allege publication dating back to DATE . The applicants objected that such an amendment so late in the trial would be unduly prejudicial . However , on CARDINAL DATE ORG J gave permission to ORG for the amendments ; the applicants were allowed to amend their defence accordingly .", "CARDINAL .

Having assessed the evidence of a number of witnesses , including ORG herself , he found that her involvement had begun in DATE and took the form of participation in GPE Greenpeace 's activities , sharing its anti - ORG aims , including distribution of the leaflet . The judge found that the applicants were responsible for the publication of \u201c CARDINAL \u201d copies of the leaflet .

However , various of the First and Second Plaintiffs ' advertisements , promotions and booklets have pretended to a positive nutritional benefit which ORG 's food , high in fat and saturated fat and animal products and sodium , and at CARDINAL time low in fibre , did not match .", "It was true to say that the Plaintiffs exploit children by using them as more susceptible subjects of advertising , to pressurise their parents into going into ORG .

Accordingly the judge should have considered and applied LAW ...", "( b ) The judge was wrong to hold that [ ORG 's ] need [ not ] prove any particular financial loss or special damage provided that damage to its good will was likely .", "( c ) The judge should have held that the burden was on [ ORG 's ] to prove that the matters complained of by them were false .", "( d ) The judge was wrong to hold that , to establish a defence of justification , the [ applicants ] had to prove that the defamatory statements were true . The rule should be disapplied in the light of LAW ORG .", "( e ) It should be a defence in LANGUAGE law to defamation proceedings that the defendant reasonably believed that the words complained of were true .", "( f ) There should be a defence in LANGUAGE law of qualified privilege for a publication concerning issues of public importance and interest relating to public corporations such as [ ORG ] .", "( g ) The judge should have held that the publication of the leaflet was on occasions of qualified privilege because it was a reasonable and legitimate response to an actual or perceived attack on the rights of others , in particular vulnerable sections of society who generally lack the means to defend themselves adequately ( e.g. children , young workers , animals and the environment ) which the [ applicants ] had a duty to make and the public an interest to hear . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

A corporate plaintiff which showed that it had a reputation within the jurisdiction and that the defamatory publication was apt to damage its goodwill thus had a complete cause of action capable of leading to a substantial award of damages .", "On grounds ( c ) and ( d ) , the applicants ' submissions were contrary to clearly established LANGUAGE law , which stated that a publication shown by a plaintiff to be defamatory was presumed to be false until proved otherwise , and that it was for the defendants to prove the truth of statements presented as assertions of fact . Moreover , the court found some general force in ORG submission that in the instant case they had in fact largely accepted the burden of proving the falsity of the parts of the leaflet on which they had succeeded .", "Dismissing grounds ( e ) to ( g ) , the court observed that a defence of qualified privilege did exist under LANGUAGE law , but only where ( i ) the publisher acted under a legal , moral or social duty to communicate the information ; ( ii ) the recipient of the information had an interest in receiving it ; and ( iii ) the nature , status and source of the material and the circumstances of the publication were such that the publication should be protected in the public interest in the absence of proof of malice . The court accepted that there was a public interest in receiving information about the activities of companies and that the duty to publish was not confined to the mainstream media but could also apply to members of campaign groups , such as ORG . However , to satisfy the test , the duty to publish had to override the requirement to verify the facts . Privilege was more likely to be extended to a publication that was balanced , properly researched , in measured tones and based on reputable sources . In the instant case , the leaflet \u201c did not demonstrate that care in preparation and research , or reference to sources of high authority or status , as would entitle its publishers to the protection of qualified privilege \u201d .", "LANGUAGE law provided a proper balance between freedom of expression and the protection of reputation and was not inconsistent with LAW . Campaign groups could perform a valuable role in public life , but they should be able to moderate their publications so as to attract a defence of fair comment without detracting from any stimulus to public discussion which the publication might give . The relaxation of the law contended for would open the way for \u201c partisan publication of unrestrained and highly damaging untruths \u201d , and there was a pressing social need \u201c to protect particular corporate business reputations , upon which the well - being of numerous individuals may depend , from such publications \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further rejected the applicants ' contention that the appeal should be allowed on the basis that the action was an abuse of process or that the trial was conducted unfairly , observing as follows :", "\u201c Litigants in person who bring or contest a ORG action are inevitably undertaking a strenuous and burdensome task . This action was complex and the legal advice available to the [ applicants ] was , because of lack of funds , small in extent . We accept that the work required of the [ applicants ] at trial was very considerable and had to be done in an environment which , at least initially , was unfamiliar to them .", "As a starting - point , we can not however hold it to be an abuse of process in itself for plaintiffs with great resources to bring a complicated case against unrepresented defendants of slender means . Large corporations are entitled to bring court proceedings to assert or defend their legal rights just as individuals have the right to bring actions and defend them . ...", "Moreover the proposition that the complexity of the case may be such that a judge ought to stop the trial on that ground can not be accepted . The rule of law requires that rights and duties under the law are determined . ...", "As to the conduct of the trial , we note that the CARDINAL hearing days were spread over a period of DATE . The timetable had proper regard to the fact that the [ applicants ] were unrepresented and to their other difficulties . They were given considerable time to prepare their final submissions to which they understandably attached considerable importance and which were of great length . For the purpose of preparing closing submissions , the [ applicants ] had possession of a full transcript of the evidence given at the trial . The fact that , for a part of the trial , the [ applicants ] did not receive transcripts of evidence as soon as they were made does not render the trial unfair . Quite apart from the absence of an obligation to provide a transcript , there is no substantial evidence that the [ applicants ] were in the event prejudiced by delay in receipt of DATE transcripts during a part of the trial .", "On the hearing of the appeal , we have been referred to many parts of the transcripts of evidence and submissions and have looked at other parts on our own initiative . On such references , we have invariably been impressed by the care , patience and fairness shown by the judge . He was well aware of the difficulties faced by the [ applicants ] as litigants in person and had full regard to them in his conduct of the trial . The [ applicants ] conducted their case forcefully and with persistence as they have in this ORG . Of course the judge listened to submissions from the very experienced leading counsel appearing for [ ORG 's ] but the judge applied his mind robustly and fairly to the issues raised . This emerges from the transcripts and from the judgment he subsequently handed down . The judge was not slow to criticise [ ORG 's ] in forthright terms when he thought their conduct deserved it . Moreover , it appears to us that the [ applicants ] were shown considerable latitude in the manner in which they presented their case and in particular in the extent to which they were often permitted to cross - examine witnesses at great length .", "... [ We ] are quite unpersuaded that the appeal , or any part of it , should be allowed on the basis that the action was an abuse of the process of the ORG or that the trial was conducted unfairly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants also challenged a number of ORG findings about the content of the leaflet , and ORG found in their favour on several points , summarised as follows :", "\u201c On the topic of nutrition , the allegation that eating ORG 's food would lead to a very real risk of cancer of the breast and of the bowel was not proved . On pay and conditions we have found that the defamatory allegations in the leaflet were comment .", "In addition to the charges found to be true by the judge \u2013 the exploiting of children by advertising , the pretence by the respondents that their food had a positive nutritional benefit , and ORG responsibility for cruel practices in the rearing and slaughtering of some of the animals used for their products DATE the further allegation that , if CARDINAL eats enough ORG 's food , one 's diet may well become high in fat etc . , with the very real risk of heart disease , was justified . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal therefore reduced the damages payable to ORG , so that ORG was now liable for a total of GBP QUANTITY and Mr PERSON for a total of GBP CARDINAL . It refused the applicants leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG also refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Under LANGUAGE law the object of a libel action is to vindicate the plaintiff 's reputation and to make reparation for the injury done by the wrongful publication of defamatory statements concerning him or her .", "CARDINAL . The plaintiff carries the burden of proving \u201c publication \u201d . As a matter of law ( per Bell J at p. CARDINAL of the judgment in the applicants ' case ) ,", "\u201c any person who causes or procures or authorises or concurs in or approves the publication of a libel is as liable for its publication as a person who physically hands it or sends it off to another . It is not necessary to have written or printed the defamatory material . All those jointly concerned in the commission of a tort ( civil wrong ) are jointly and severally liable for it , and this applies to libel as it does to any other tort \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A defence of justification applies where the defamatory statement is substantially true . The burden is on the defendant to prove the truth of the statement on the balance of probabilities . It is no defence to a libel action to prove that the defendant acted in good faith , believing the statement to be true . NORP law does , however , recognise the defence of \u201c fair comment \u201d , if it can be established that the defamatory statement is comment , and not an assertion of fact , and is based on a substratum of facts , the truth of which the defendant must prove .", "CARDINAL . As a general principle , a trading or non - trading corporation is entitled to sue in libel to protect as much of its corporate reputation as is capable of being damaged by a defamatory statement . There are certain exceptions to this rule : local authorities , government - owned corporations and political parties , none of which can sue in defamation , because of the public interest that a democratically elected organisation , or a body controlled by such an organisation , should be open to uninhibited public criticism ( see ORG v.

Under the AJA DATE the presumption remains that civil legal aid should not be granted in respect of claims in defamation ( paragraph CARDINAL ) of Schedule ) . However , the LAW contains a provision ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) to enable discretionary \u201c exceptional funding \u201d of cases which otherwise fall outside the scope of legal aid , allowing the Lord Chancellor , inter alia , to authorise the ORG to grant legal aid to an individual defamation litigant , following a request from the ORG .", "The Lord Chancellor has issued guidance to the ORG as to the types of case he is likely to consider favourably , stressing that such cases are likely to be extremely unusual given that ORG has already decided in the AJA DATE that the types of case excepted from the legal aid scheme are of low priority . As well as financial eligibility for legal aid , the Commission must be satisfied either that \u201c there is a significant wider public interest ... in the resolution of the case and funded representation will contribute to it \u201d , or that the case \u201c is of overwhelming importance to the client \u201d , or that \u201c there is convincing evidence that there are other exceptional circumstances such that without public funding for representation it would be practically impossible for the client to bring or defend the proceedings , or the lack of public funding would lead to obvious unfairness in the proceedings \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The normal rule in civil proceedings in GPE and GPE , including defamation proceedings , is that the loser pays the reasonable costs of the winner . This rule applies whether either party is legally aided or not . An unsuccessful privately paying party would usually be ordered to pay the legal costs of a successful legally aided opponent . However , an unsuccessful legally aided party is usually protected from paying the costs of a successful privately paying party , because the costs order made against the loser will not usually be enforceable without further order of the court , which is likely to be granted only in the event of a major improvement in the financial circumstances of the legally aided party .", "CARDINAL .

The measure of damages for defamation is the amount that would put the plaintiff in the position he or she would have been in had the wrongdoing not been committed .
