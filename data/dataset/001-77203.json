He was represented before the ORG by Mr C. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the ORG opened an investigation against the applicant on suspicion of aggravated assault .", "It appears that on DATE the applicant went to GPE . Subsequently , ORG ( Prokurator Rejonowy ) stayed the investigation since the applicant had not replied to the summons and his place of residence was unknown . On DATE ORG issued a search and arrest warrant in respect of the applicant on suspicion of aggravated assault .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police and subsequently the investigation against him was resumed . ORG laid additional charges against the applicant .", "Subsequently , ORG applied to ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) for the applicant to be detained pending the investigation . On DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody until DATE on suspicion of aggravated assault , handling stolen goods and forgery of a car body . It found that in the light of the evidence obtained , in particular witnesses\u2019 testimonies , there was a strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged . It also observed that there was a reasonable risk that the applicant would go into hiding given that he had been at large since DATE .", "On DATE the ORG ( PERSON ) upheld that decision . It underlined that the applicant had been suspected of committing the offences in question DATE and DATE and that CARDINAL search and arrests warrants had been issued . It also observed that progress in the proceedings against the applicant had been impossible as he had gone into hiding for DATE . Further , it held that the applicant \u2019s detention was justified by the severity of the anticipated sentence .", "It appears that the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was prolonged by ORG on DATE for an unspecified period .", "On DATE the ORG ( S\u0105d Apelacyjny ) upheld ORG decision of DATE . In addition to the arguments previously invoked , it also found that on DATE of his arrest , the applicant had been using a forged driving licence . That , in the court \u2019s view , further warranted the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention so as to prevent him from absconding .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant undergo psychiatric observation . The relevant report was submitted to the prosecutor on DATE .", "On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , relying on the same grounds as in the earlier decisions . That decision was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be held in custody until DATE . It reiterated the grounds previously given .", "On DATE the ORG filed a bill of indictment against the applicant . He was charged with attempted homicide , handling stolen goods , forgery of documents and a car body and having used a forged driving licence . The second defendant , PERSON , was charged with directly endangering the life of another person . The prosecution requested the trial court to hear evidence from CARDINAL witnesses .", "On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It considered , having regard in particular to the victim \u2019s evidence , that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question . It also observed that the applicant \u2019s continued detention was necessary in order to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings given the severity of the likely sentence . On DATE the ORG upheld ORG decision . It observed that the applicant \u2019s detention was necessary given the fact that he had evaded justice for DATE . It also noted that the severity of the sentence which could be imposed justified of itself the applicant \u2019s continued detention . It appears that the applicant \u2019s detention was subsequently extended on later unspecified dates .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be held in custody until DATE , reiterating the grounds previously given .", "On DATE ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . That decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . The courts repeatedly relied on the strong likelihood that the applicant had committed the offences with which he was charged . In addition , they had regard to the severity of the likely sentence and the fear that he might go into hiding if released . The latter was justified , in the courts\u2019 view , by the length of time the applicant had evaded justice prior to his arrest and his having used a forged identity document .", "ORG held CARDINAL hearings on the following dates : CARDINAL and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ; PERCENT , CARDINAL and DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL May , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . CARDINAL trial hearing was adjourned on account of the absence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer ( DATE ) .", "On numerous occasions the applicant requested the trial court to release him . However , his requests were dismissed for the same reasons which had served to justify his continued detention .", "On DATE the ORG gave judgment . It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to CARDINAL half years\u2019 imprisonment . It also prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE . The applicant appealed against the first - instance judgment .", "On DATE the ORG upheld the judgment of ORG . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment of ORG .", "On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal due to its manifestly ill - founded character .", "The Code of Criminal Procedure of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , defines detention on remand as CARDINAL of the so - called \u201c preventive measures \u201d ( \u015brodki zapobiegawcze ) .
