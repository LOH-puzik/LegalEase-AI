The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE he was employed by a NORP company which was carrying out construction work in GPE . The NORP workers were employed on the basis of the international agreement signed on DATE between GPE and GPE on the secondment of workers of NORP companies to carry out construction work ( Umowa mi\u0119dzy PERSON a PERSON Federalnej PERSON o oddelegowaniu pracownik\u00f3w polskich przedsi\u0119biorstw do realizacji um\u00f3w o dzie\u0142o z DATE r. , Dz . U. DATE , ORG , GPE . CARDINAL ) . The rates of the applicant \u2019s pay were determined by an employment contract and the regulations which the contract referred to .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a civil claim against his former employer for payment . He claimed that , instead of the rate of CARDINAL or CARDINAL NORP PERSON ( ORG ) per hour which he had been receiving under his employment contract in the period from DATE to DATE , he should have been receiving a higher rate of pay . Relying on the provisions of the above - mentioned international agreement , he claimed that he should have been receiving a rate comparable to that of the NORP workers occupying the same positions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG gave a partial judgment in which it established that the applicant was entitled to the rates of pay fixed in the employment contract .", "The court observed that the essential issue in the case was whether the applicant was entitled to a higher rate of pay , equivalent to that paid to the NORP employees working in similar positions at the material time . It was noted in this connection that the parties had not chosen to regulate the employment contract under NORP law . Instead NORP labour law was applicable .", "In so far as the applicant relied on the provisions of the international agreement of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and argued that it should serve as the basis for setting his rate of pay , the court observed that this agreement was of a public - law character . Its object and purpose was to regulate relations between GPE and GPE in the construction market with a view to preventing unfair competition by NORP companies setting wages of construction workers working in GPE at too low a level , and to protect NORP workers against being paid too low a rate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He argued that the Opole ORG had violated the provisions of LAW . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , the court \u2019s finding that the applicant \u2019s rates of pay were fixed in his employment contract was erroneous , because that contract did not contain any rates ( only symbols which were not understood by the applicant ) . Besides , in his view , the court had violated the provisions of the abovementioned international agreement , according to which the rates of the applicant \u2019s pay should be comparable to those received by the NORP workers occupying the same positions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the first - instance partial judgment on account of its procedural shortcomings and remitted the case to the lower court . ORG comprised CARDINAL judges . Judge FAC . sat on the bench . He was not a judge rapporteur and he did not preside .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in the applicant \u2019s case there were no grounds for delivering a partial judgment . It noted that a partial judgment could be delivered only when a part or some of the claims in a lawsuit had been sufficiently clarified for the decision . In the applicant \u2019s case there was CARDINAL claim and thus there had been no grounds for delivering the partial judgment .", "In the final part of the written grounds for the judgment ORG stated that the position of the Opole Regional Court as to the substance of the case was supported by the wording of the international agreements and existing domestic case - law . This part of the court \u2019s reasoning read as follows :", "\u201c As to the substantive grounds for the court \u2019s legal view expressed in the judgment under appeal , it should be stated that it finds support in the content of the Agreement between the Governments of GPE and GPE on the secondment of workers of NORP companies to carry out construction work ( Journal of Laws CARDINAL/CARDINAL , items CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) as well as in the hitherto interpretation of this agreement in judicial decisions ( see , e.g. , III A Pa CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG , decision of CARDINAL DATE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged one of the judges , alleging his partiality . He further requested that the case be transferred to another town because , in his view , the judges were not impartial and the defendant company \u201c had enjoyed considerable influence in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , finding no grounds for the judges of the Opole ORG to step down .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG gave judgment granting the applicant \u2019s claim in part and dismissing the remainder . ORG ordered the defendant company to pay the applicant the sum of MONEY ( ORG ) for unused leave . As to the rate of the applicant \u2019s pay , the court reiterated the reasoning of the judgment of DATE and dismissed the claim ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court accepted the reasoning of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged a cassation appeal on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the cassation appeal , quashed the challenged judgment and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the NORP - German agreement of DATE was not a source of universally binding law and did not contain provisions applicable to labour relations . The agreement could not be regarded as constituting the legal basis for claims of employees concerning remuneration for their work . Moreover , GPE \u2019s accession to ORG did not have an impact on the applicability of that agreement . Furthermore , ORG law did not apply retroactively to situations predating GPE \u2019s accession .", "The fact that employees\u2019 claims concerning the applicable minimum wages could not be regarded as having their legal basis in the said ORG agreement did not mean , in the court \u2019s opinion , that those claims could not be raised upon the basis of employment contracts . In ORG view , ORG had not sufficiently clarified the meaning of those contracts in the light of statements made by the NORP company concerning the applicant \u2019s employment conditions and the obligations imposed on the company by the provisions of NORP law to which those statements referred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having taken into account the recommendations of ORG , again dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal lodged against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The court reiterated that the applicant was entitled to the rates of pay fixed in his employment contract .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further cassation appeal with ORG .", "He first raised substantive arguments . He averred that the Opole Regional Court had disregarded the provisions of LAW . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , the court \u2019s finding that his TIME rate of pay had been fixed in his employment contract had been erroneous , because that contract had not contained any rates ( only symbols which the applicant had not been able to understand ) . Besides , in his view , the court had disregarded the provisions of the applicable international agreement ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , according to which the applicant \u2019s rate of pay should have been comparable to that received by the NORP workers occupying the same positions .", "He further complained that the appellate court had failed to take heed of the interpretation of the applicable law expressed by ORG in its previous judgment as to the applicable rate of the applicant \u2019s salary .", "It was further argued that the court had failed to take into consideration the evidence gathered in the case . The court had also erred when refusing to allow certain requests for evidence to be taken .", "The applicant further complained that in the written grounds for its judgment ORG had failed to provide reasons for which it had disregarded the interpretation of relevant applicable provisions made in the past by ORG \u2013 a substantive question which had been crucial for the outcome of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal .", "Judge ORG . , who had sat on the bench of the Court of Appeal deciding the case on DATE , had in the meantime been promoted to ORG . He sat on the bench of ORG . He was not a judge rapporteur and he did not preside .", "ORG noted that the appellate court , contrary to the applicant \u2019s objection , had followed the interpretation of the applicable law expressed by the earlier judgment of ORG ( pronounced on DATE ) given in the same case . In this judgment ORG had confirmed that the international agreement referred to by the applicant could not be regarded as a legal source of employees\u2019 and ORG rights and obligations . The appellate court \u2019s decision had followed this view and it had confirmed that the substantive provisions of that agreement had not applied to the setting of the applicant \u2019s rate of pay , which had been fixed by his employment contract .", "CARDINAL . ORG stressed that in his cassation appeal the applicant raised the same complaint which had already been made in his earlier cassation appeal . This was inadmissible as under section CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) it was not allowed to found a cassation appeal against a judgment rendered after a new examination of a case upon complaints contrary to the interpretation previously established by ORG dealing with the earlier cassation appeal lodged in the same case .", "CARDINAL . Additionally , ORG noted that the interpretation made by the lower courts of the applicant \u2019s contract of employment , seen as a whole , had taken into account the applicant \u2019s employer \u2019s declarations submitted to the NORP authorities and also a wealth of other evidence in so far as it had been relevant for the determination of the applicant \u2019s working conditions and remuneration .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that the applicant \u2019s remuneration had been set at the level of the minimal remuneration of NORP employees performing similar work determined on the basis of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant complained in his cassation appeal of the alleged failure of the courts to take further evidence and of the assessment of the evidence they had carried out , those complaints could not be examined in the context of those proceedings . It was not the task of ORG in cassation proceedings to act as an ordinary court of appeal and to examine issues concerning the admissibility and assessment of evidence and the factual findings made by the lower courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
