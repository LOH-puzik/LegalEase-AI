The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . At the material time he was the owner and manager of the company AS GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE police instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of tax offences under LAW CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . In the course of the preliminary investigation the applicant was further charged with the offence of inadequate accounting under LAW as well as with falsification of documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor approved the bill of indictment , and the case was sent to ORG ( ORG ) for trial . The charges set out in the indictment related to acts and omissions of the applicant in the period from DATE .", "In particular , under LAW the acts which were the subject of the charges against the applicant concerned his failures to pay the required taxes , to file by the set deadline revenue statements for DATE , to inform ORG of the change of his company 's location , and to comply with the order of ORG of CARDINAL DATE to pay the required taxes . Under LAW CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW the applicant was accused of having unsatisfactorily arranged his company 's bookkeeping , in breach of the legal requirements . The existing records were incomplete and a number of documents had not been preserved , which made it impossible to determine the company 's performance .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant of the offences under LAW and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It also found the applicant guilty of the offence under LAW and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . As the latter sentence was absorbed by the former , the aggregate sentence imposed on the applicant was DATE imprisonment , which was suspended for DATE .", "ORG found that the application of Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , which had been in force as from DATE , was justified in the case on the grounds that the applicant 's failure to pay the required taxes had been intentional and continuous and his criminal activity had lasted until DATE . It ordered the applicant to pay the city tax authorities CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL NORP kroons in outstanding taxes . No fine or tax surcharge was imposed apart from the requirement to pay the taxes which were due under the relevant tax laws .", "As regards the offence of inadequate accounting under LAW , which was in force as from DATE , ORG noted that the applicant 's company had operated from DATE until DATE . During that period there had been no recording of its economic activity and it was impossible correctly to determine the company 's performance , income , expenditure , profit , loss , debts , solvency or amount of its assets . The applicant had failed to comply with the obligations imposed on him by the PERSON on personal responsibility for the organisation of accounting . The law came into effect on DATE , i.e. at the time of the operation of the company , and the applicant , being its owner and manager , had to comply with the provisions of the law . The applicant also failed to adopt rules and procedures for bookkeeping and to secure the preservation of the relevant documents , as required under the Government decree of DATE concerning the organisation of accounting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against the judgment to ORG ( GPE ) . He argued that in convicting him under Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of acts committed prior to its entry into force on DATE , ORG had applied the criminal law retrospectively . Before that date a conviction of the offences defined in LAW could follow only if the person concerned had been previously subjected to an administrative sanction for a similar offence .", "The applicant further submitted that , in making him responsible for the inadequate bookkeeping in his company during the whole period from CARDINAL DATE until DATE , ORG had also applied retroactively Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW which had only been in force as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG . It found that the acts with which the applicant was charged under LAW amounted to ongoing crimes . After his first criminal act on DATE the applicant had embarked upon a criminal enterprise which had lasted until DATE , DATE on which ORG discovered the abuses and issued its order . Therefore , ORG had correctly qualified his acts as falling under that law .", "It also considered that the ongoing nature of the applicant 's acts relating to inadequate accounting justified his conviction under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law to ORG ( NORP ) raising the same arguments as in his appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed his appeal . It held that , according to the principles of NORP criminal law , the law to be applied to a criminal act was the law which had entered into force before the end of a criminal activity . As the applicant 's criminal activity ended on DATE , his actions fell under the law in force at that time , i.e. Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW .
