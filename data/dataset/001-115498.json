The court further noted that , according to a court supervision order produced by the applicant , he had been arrested in NORP GPE in DATE and prohibited from leaving the territory .

This appeal had no suspensive effect ( Article R. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Administrative Courts Code ) .", "CARDINAL . The consequences of the setting aside of an administrative removal order were covered by LAW First of all , it put a stop to any administrative detention or house arrest . The alien was then issued with a temporary residence permit while the administrative authority reviewed his or her case . Lastly , the judge responsible for removal matters did not merely refer the alien back to the administrative authorities ; under LAW , it also ordered the prefect to decide whether the person was entitled to a residence permit , \u201c regardless of whether he or she had applied for CARDINAL \u201d and set a time - limit within which the situation of the alien concerned was to be reviewed ( see , for example , ORG d\u2019Etat , CARDINAL DATE , application no . DATE , PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . However , a judgment of the administrative court setting aside a removal order did not oblige the prefect to issue a residence permit , as it did not concern the setting aside of a refusal to issue a residence permit ( see the leading judgment of the ORG d\u2019Etat of CARDINAL DATE , application no . DATE , PERSON , followed by others ) . This applied even when the decision to set aside a removal order was based on substantive grounds , such as a violation of LAW . According to the caselaw , a review of the person \u2019s situation sufficed to fully execute a decision to set aside a removal order on substantive grounds . However , the principle of res judicata prevents the administrative authority from issuing a new removal order on the same grounds without showing any change in the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . These provisions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) were amended in part by PERSON no . DATE of DATE on immigration , integration and nationality , which harmonised the procedure for removing illegal aliens . The solutions previously adopted in the case - law concerning administrative removal measures are generally transposable to the present situation .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL - CARDINAL and L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL to L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL [ whereby a removal order issued by the prefect may be challenged before the administrative court within TIME , with suspensive effect on the execution of the removal order ] shall not apply in NORP GPE or PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Unlike in ordinary NORP law , therefore ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , an appeal to the administrative court does not stay the execution of a removal order . This exception , originally introduced for a limited period , was made permanent in NORP GPE by LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

It is for the urgent - applications judge to whom an application for a stay of execution of a decision not to issue a residence permit has been referred to assess the urgency and give reasons , taking into account the immediate impact of the refusal to issue the residence permit on the practical situation of the individual concerned . As Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Code regulating the entry and residence of aliens and asylum - seekers stipulates that Article L.
