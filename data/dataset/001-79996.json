During her employment , the applicant \u2019s telephone , e - mail and Internet usage were subjected to monitoring at the ORG \u2019s instigation . According to the Government , this monitoring took place in order to ascertain whether the applicant was making excessive use of College facilities for personal purposes . The Government stated that the monitoring of telephone usage consisted of analysis of the ORG telephone bills showing telephone numbers called , the dates and times of the calls , and their length and cost . The applicant also believed that there had been detailed and comprehensive logging of the length of calls , the number of calls received and made , and the telephone numbers of individuals calling her . She stated that on CARDINAL occasion the ORG became aware of the name of an individual with whom she had exchanged incoming and outgoing telephone calls . The Government submitted that the monitoring of telephone usage took place for DATE up to CARDINAL DATE . The applicant contended that her telephone usage was monitored over a period of DATE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s Internet usage was also monitored by the ORG . The ORG accepted that this monitoring took the form of analysing the websites visited , the times and dates of the visits to the websites and their duration , and that this monitoring took place from DATE . The applicant did not comment on the manner in which her Internet usage was monitored but submitted that it took place over a much longer period of time than the Government had admitted .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant became aware that enquiries were being made into her use of e - mail at work when her step - daughter was contacted by ORG and asked to supply information about e - mails that she had sent to ORG .

Given the forthcoming legislation making it illegal for organisations to examine someone \u2019s e - mail without permission , I naturally felt concerned over recent events and instructed [ ST ] not to carry out any further analysis . Furthermore , I asked you to do likewise and asked that any information you have of concern regarding [ the applicant ] be forwarded to me as a matter of priority . You indicated that you would respond positively to both requests , whilst reaffirming your concerns regarding [ the applicant ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The applicant provided the ORG with statements from other members of staff alleging inappropriate and intrusive monitoring of their movements . The applicant , who is still employed by the ORG , understands that the ORG has been suspended .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time there was no general right to privacy in LANGUAGE law .", "CARDINAL . Since the implementation of LAW DATE on DATE , the courts have been required to read and give effect to primary legislation in a manner which is compatible with Convention rights so far as possible . The LAW also made it unlawful for any public authority , including a court , to act in a manner which is incompatible with a LAW right unless required to do so by primary legislation , thus providing for the development of the common law in accordance with Convention rights . In the case of PERSON v. Hello ! Ltd ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) , Lord Justice PERSON indicated that he was prepared to find that there was a qualified right to privacy under LANGUAGE law , but ORG did not rule on the point .", "CARDINAL .

In GPE , ORG was concerned with the award of so - called \u201c stigma compensation \u201d where an ex - employee is unable to find further employment due to association with a dishonest former employer . In considering the damages that could be awarded for breach of the obligation of trust and confidence , the ORG was solely concerned with the payment of compensation for financial loss resulting from handicap in the labour market . Lord PERSON expressly noted that \u201c [ CARDINAL the present purposes I am not concerned with the exclusion of damages for injured feelings , the present case is concerned only with financial loss \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In limiting the scope of the implied term of trust and confidence in GPE , Lord PERSON stated as follows :", "\u201c [ T]he implied mutual obligation of trust and confidence applies only where there is \u2018 no reasonable and proper cause\u2019 for the employer \u2019s conduct , and then only if the conduct is calculated to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence .
