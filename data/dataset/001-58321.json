The applicants , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON Sales PERSON and Mr PERSON , were born in DATE respectively and live in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . At an unknown date in DATE ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) of the PERSON ( government ) of GPE received through ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , an association formed to fight against sects , a request for help from several people who alleged that members of their families had been ensnared by a group known by the name of ORG ( FAC ) . According to the NORP complaints , those who ran the ORG managed to bring about a complete change of personality in their followers , leading them to break off ties with their family and friends and inciting them to prostitution and other activities designed to obtain money for the organisation . The ORG infiltrated an officer into the ORG to check the truth of the complaints and , in the light of the findings , brought the facts to the attention of ORG at FAC , who forwarded the complaints and the information gathered to the judicial authorities . Acting on this information , GPE investigating court no . CARDINAL opened a preliminary investigation in DATE and ordered searches of the homes of members of the ORG , including the applicants . The searches took place on DATE and numerous people were arrested , including the applicants . After the applicants were arrested , they were transferred to the seat of the investigating court . In the light of information from GPE , an official at the FAC , which was confirmed by the prosecuting authorities , there was a danger that the members of the sect would react unpredictably if they were released , and might even commit suicide . The duty judge nevertheless decided to release the applicants but gave oral instructions to the police that those detained , including the applicants , should be handed over to their families , to whom it should be suggested that it would be as well to have them interned in a psychiatric centre , on a voluntary basis as regards the persons of full age , in order for them to recover their psychological balance . The judge in question confirmed his oral instruction in a decision of DATE . In that decision he also ordered the chief of the NORP police ( mossos GPE ) to interview and question all those detained during the searches who had subsequently been released .", "CARDINAL . Later , on the orders of ORG , ORG , the applicants were transferred to the LOC of the FAC . From there , on DATE , they were taken by members of the NORP police in official vehicles to a hotel QUANTITY from GPE , where they were handed over to their families with a view to their recovering their psychological balance . Once at the hotel , the applicants were taken to individual rooms under the supervision of persons recruited for the purpose , CARDINAL of whom remained permanently in each room , and they were not allowed to leave their rooms for DATE . The windows were firmly closed with wooden planks and the panes of glass had been taken out . While at the hotel the applicants were allegedly subjected to a process of \u201c deprogramming \u201d by a psychologist and a psychiatrist at the request of Pro Juventud . On CARDINAL and DATE , after being informed of their rights , they were questioned by ORG , the Assistant Director - General of Public Safety , aided by GPE , in the presence of a lawyer not appointed by the applicants . On DATE the applicants left the hotel .", "CARDINAL . As soon as they had regained their freedom , the applicants lodged a criminal complaint alleging false imprisonment , offences against the exercise of personal rights , falsification of documents , usurpation of functions and misappropriation of goods against GPE , C.T.R. and L.R.F. , the latter as Director - General of Public Safety , and against all other persons who had taken part in depriving them of their liberty . In the criminal proceedings thus instituted the prosecuting authorities filed submissions against the persons mentioned above accusing them of false imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG acquitted the accused , holding that the acts complained of had been prompted by a philanthropic , legitimate and well - intentioned motive and that there had been no intention of depriving the applicants of their liberty , so that the offence of false imprisonment was not made out .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution and the applicants lodged appeals on points of law , which were dismissed by ORG on DATE . In its judgment ORG held , inter alia :", "\u201c \u2026 A detailed examination of the facts held to have been proved shows that there is no doubt that the appellants were placed in detention [ detenci\u00f3n ] ( the expression \u2018 administrative detention\u2019 [ retenci\u00f3n ] has no validity , since it is not defined in our legal order ) , but the detention took place with the sole aim \u2013 a very laudable and plausible DATE of avoiding worse evils than those complained of by the appellants , so that there was no unlawfulness strictly and properly understood . \u2026 Furthermore , that there was no unlawfulness , the criterion required by law , is all the plainer if it is borne in mind that it was the appellants themselves , together with the closest members of their families , who consented to undergo deprogramming tests which logically required them to be physically isolated initially . That isolation lasted for a very limited time and , it must be emphasised , with the agreement of those concerned and their families . \u2026 It can not be maintained , in order to argue the contrary , that the wishes of the persons who underwent deprogramming could only have been overridden by the members of their families after proceedings to establish incapacity , seeing that the position of those concerned called for immediate treatment , without any delay , as appears from the judgment under appeal , which refers to fears that the members of the sect might commit suicide .", "In conclusion , the offence of false imprisonment can not be said to have been committed since , firstly , there was no intention on the part of the defendants to deprive anybody of his or her liberty and , on the contrary , their intention , which has been fully proved , was to prevent imminent and very serious harm befalling the persons concerned , such that the mens rea for the offence was lacking . In the second place , the requirement of \u2018 ORG was lacking inasmuch as the GPE conduct was in keeping with what society and the legal order , taken as a whole , require in situations and at times such as those of the instant case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal ( recurso de amparo ) with ORG . In their appeal they alleged violations of the right to religious freedom ( LAW ) , the right to liberty ( LAW ) , the right to freedom of movement ( LAW ) , the rights of the defence during their detention ( LAW ) and the right to a fair trial ( LAW ) . They asked ORG to quash the judgments of FAC and ORG , to order the officials complained of to pay MONEY as compensation for the damage sustained and to make a declaration to the effect that the PERSON of GPE was liable in default .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings in the Constitutional Court Mr PERSON was held to have withdrawn on account of failure , through his own fault , to comply with a formal requirement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the amparo appeal . In section CARDINAL of the \u201c As to the law \u201d part of the judgment the court first examined a preliminary objection raised by ORG that appropriate remedies had not been used , namely a habeas corpus application or contentious - administrative proceedings , in the following terms :", "\u201c ORG , while holding that a person in possession of a fundamental right could choose the most effective remedy for infringement of that right \u2026 , has also stated that that had to be understood \u2018 subject , of course , to the possibilities afforded by each class of ORG .", "Consequently , in order to resolve the issue raised by ORG , it would be necessary to determine what those possibilities were in the criminal courts . In the instant case , however , it is not necessary to do so since the appeal is being brought not against administrative acts but against judicial decisions . That being so , the issue is not \u2013 and can not be \u2013 whether or not use was made of an effective judicial remedy ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG [ LAW ] ) but whether the remedies afforded by the judicial process chosen ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ORG ) have been exhausted , an issue that has not been canvassed and could not be since the appellants went to the highest court , ORG , which heard the appeal on points of law in the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . That being said , ORG pointed out , firstly , that there was no fundamental right to have a person convicted and , secondly , that it could not protect fundamental rights by quashing final substantive judgments whereby defendants had been acquitted . It also pointed out that , according to its case - law , the LAW did not confer , as such , a right to secure criminal convictions of third parties . Furthermore , decisions of criminal courts were never decisions affecting fundamental rights of the prosecuting party . The court added that the decisions being challenged had not infringed any of the rights relied on by the CARDINAL remaining appellants , seeing that they were limited to declaring that the acts with which the defendants were charged did not amount to the offences for which they were being prosecuted .", "CARDINAL .
