NORP The applicant was born in DATE and lived in GPE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant came to the GPE with his mother and CARDINAL brothers in DATE , when he was DATE , in order to join his father who had already been living there for DATE . He was granted a residence permit ( vergunning tot verblijf ) which he was required to renew at DATE intervals until DATE , when he obtained a permanent residence permit ( vestigingsvergunning ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted by the single - judge chamber of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of the offence of breach of the peace ( lokaalvredebreuk ) , and fined MONEY ( NLG \u2013 CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) . The same court convicted him on DATE of violent offence against the person , committed in public ( openlijke geweldpleging ) , and sentenced him to a fine of NLG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) and a suspended term of imprisonment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant entered into a relationship with a GPE national . They started living together in or around DATE . A son was born to the couple on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted by ORG ( gerechtshof ) of violent offence against the person , committed in public , and sentenced to TIME of community service ( in lieu of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ) .", "CARDINAL . During the second pregnancy of the applicant \u2019s partner , the relationship began to suffer . In order to alleviate the situation , the applicant moved out in DATE , but remained in close contact with both his partner and his son . The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was involved in a dispute in a caf\u00e9 . He pulled a loaded gun and shot a man , wounding him in the leg . Outside the caf\u00e9 he then got into a fight with a friend of the injured man . He pulled a second loaded gun and shot him in the head . The man died . The applicant was convicted of manslaughter ( doodslag ) and assault ( zware mishandeling ) by ORG on DATE and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Whilst serving his prison sentence , from CARDINAL DATE until DATE , the applicant took courses in computer skills , administration and accounting , and also obtained a retailer \u2019s certificate ( middenstandsdiploma ) . He took further courses in order to qualify as a sports instructor . His partner and son visited him in prison at least once DATE and regularly more often . A second son was born to the applicant and his partner on DATE , whom he also saw DATE . Both his children have GPE nationality and have been recognised ( erkend ) by the applicant . Neither his partner nor his children speak NORP .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) withdrew the applicant \u2019s permanent residence permit and imposed a DATE exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) on him in view of his conviction of DATE and DATE prison sentence . The Deputy Minister considered that the general interest in ensuring public safety and the prevention of disorder and crime outweighed the applicant \u2019s interest in being able to continue his family life with his partner , children , parents and brothers in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against this decision , arguing that the offence in question had been committed long before , in DATE , that he had not reoffended , that there was no indication that he would reoffend , and that his partner and children could not be expected to follow him to GPE . Following a hearing before ORG on matters concerning aliens ( PERSON voor vreemdelingenzaken ) on DATE , at which the applicant was assisted by an interpreter , the Deputy Minister rejected the objection on DATE and ordered the applicant to leave the GPE as soon as he was released from prison .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , submitting that , as there was no risk of his reoffending , there was no necessity to impose an exclusion order on him and that to do so amounted to the imposition of a second penalty .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released from prison on DATE and subsequently placed in GPE detention ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) pending his deportation .", "CARDINAL . Following a hearing on DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . ORG did not accept the applicant \u2019s argument that the period of time that had elapsed DATE on which his criminal conviction had become irrevocable and the date on which the exclusion order had been imposed was so long that the Deputy Minister should be deemed to have acquiesced in the applicant \u2019s continued residence in the GPE . Furthermore , it did not discern any facts or circumstances capable of justifying a reduction of the period for which the applicant would be excluded from GPE territory . The applicant \u2019s claim that there was no risk of his reoffending was based solely on his own statements and was not supported by the facts , given that he had also been convicted of violent offences in DATE and DATE . In addition , it did not appear that the applicant had put down roots in the GPE or become dissociated from NORP society to such a degree that he would be unable to return to his country of origin . Finally , ORG considered that the interference with the applicant \u2019s family life was justified for the purposes of preventing disorder and crime .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was deported to GPE on DATE . However , it appears that he returned to the GPE soon afterwards , as he was apprehended there on CARDINAL DATE . He was again deported to GPE on DATE , and a request for a provisional stay of execution of the deportation order , which he had lodged with ORG of The Hague , was declared inadmissible on DATE . He was also convicted of the offence of residing illegally in the GPE while subject to an exclusion order ( LAW ( PERSON ) ) and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the exclusion order be revoked . The Deputy Minister of ORG refused the request on CARDINAL DATE and on DATE dismissed an objection the applicant had filed against that refusal . The applicant subsequently lodged an appeal , which was declared inadmissible by ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , on DATE . No appeal lay against that decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that , prior to his deportation in DATE , he had only been back to GPE once in order to attend the funeral of his grandmother , and that he did not speak the NORP language apart from understanding certain expressions . His only relative in GPE was an uncle with whom he had no contact .", "CARDINAL . According to a report drawn up by a psychiatrist in GPE on DATE , the applicant was suffering from psychological problems as a result of being separated from his family . In particular , not being able to see his children was making him depressed . Treatment had begun in DATE and was continuing , though some improvement had been noted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was discovered working at an illegal cannabis plantation in the GPE . He was arrested and subsequently placed in GPE detention . This detention was discontinued on DATE in order to execute the judgment whereby the applicant had been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the applicant was deported to GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the decision to withdraw the applicant \u2019s residence permit and to impose an exclusion order on him was taken under sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) and in accordance with the policy laid down in Chapters ACARDINAL and ACARDINAL of LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingencirculaire \u2013 a body of directives drawn up and published by ORG ) . Underlying this policy is the principle that the longer an alien has lawfully resided in the GPE DATE and the stronger , therefore , his or her ties with the GPE are assumed to be DATE the more serious an offence must be before it can justify withdrawing a residence permit and excluding the alien from GPE territory ; the authorities thus apply a sliding scale ( glijdende schaal ) .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with this policy , a residence permit may be withdrawn and an exclusion order imposed on an alien who , at the time of committing the offence , has been lawfully residing in the GPE for CARDINAL but DATE like the applicant in the present case \u2013 if he or she is sentenced to an unsuspended prison sentence of DATE following a conviction for a serious , violent crime or for drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . If an exclusion order is imposed on the basis of a conviction for a serious , violent crime or drug trafficking , this order will in any event be revoked , upon request , if the alien has been residing outside the GPE for a period of DATE and if he has not been convicted of further criminal offences ( LAW ACARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
