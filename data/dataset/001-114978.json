GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , Mr PERSON and CARDINAL others , are NORP nationals . Their names and personal details are listed in the annex at the end of this decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were born DATE with deformities of their upper and/or lower extremities and other malfunctions of inner organs , resulting from the fact that their mothers had taken the tranquilliser \u201c thalidomide \u201d , sold in GPE under the name \u201c LOC , during a certain , sensitive period of pregnancy . CARDINAL persons suffering from likewise impacts of the drug are living in GPE alone .", "CARDINAL . \u201c Contergan \u201d was produced by the pharmaceutical manufacturer PERSON ORG , a company with limited liability , from DATE until DATE . It was available on the NORP market without a medical prescription and was sold as an analgesic suitable to soothe discomforts caused by pregnancy .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the criminal proceedings for injuries caused by negligence against the management and the owners of the manufacturer company PERSON were stayed . Civil proceedings on compensation for damages lodged by some affected children or their parents were pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the pharmaceutical manufacturer PERSON covenanted to pay a lump sum of MONEY ( DEM - CARDINAL million euros ( ORG ) ) to the victims in order to settle all compensation claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public law foundation \u201c Hilfswerk f\u00fcr behinderte NORP \u201d was established by federal law in order to facilitate a settlement with all persons affected and in order to provide a solid financial basis for benefit payments . The foundation received MONEY from the manufacturer and the same amount from the NORP ORG . Each person affected by \u201c GPE was eligible for a single payment of MONEY CARDINAL and at maximum DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL and additionally DATE pensions CARDINAL and DEM CARDINAL . All payments from this fund were exempt from taxes and were not credited against other social benefits . All legal claims against the manufacturer expired by law . The law entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found ORG of DATE henceforth : the DATE LAW to be compatible with the provisions of LAW , in particular compatible with the property protection of LAW . It held that the legislator voluntarily incurred a position as a creditor and was therefore constitutionally obliged to guarantee the liquidity of the foundation in future and to safeguard that the pensions to the victims were adequate .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and in DATE the financial funds of the foundation were supplemented by DEM CARDINAL and DEM CARDINAL by ORG . Since DATE the DATE pensions have been financed entirely from the federal budget . From DATE until DATE the height of the pensions had been raised CARDINAL times .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the foundation was renamed to ORG ( Conterganstiftung f\u00fcr behinderte NORP ) . The persons affected by \u201c GPE received a non - recurring capital sum and again a DATE life - long pension depending on the established degree of health impairment . Payments from the foundation could not be credited against any other social benefit payment in order to ensure that the aggrieved persons received the pension as an extra monetary benefit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the DATE pensions were doubled by LAW . According to the legislator the higher pension should contribute to compensate for the increasing secondary health deterioration of the now middle - aged persons affected by \u201c GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Second Law on Amending the Contergan Foundation Law entered into force . The ORG was endowed with a further ORG CARDINAL of which MONEY were provided by the manufacturing company PERSON and the rest by GPE . The amendment slightly increased the DATE pensions ( now between ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) which are still funded entirely from the federal budget and the non - recurring payment ( GPE ) between ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL depending on the extent of the bodily damage caused by \u201c GPE . The law further introduced an DATE additional payment ( j\u00e4hrliche GPE ) from the capital interests gained by the foundation . The amount of this payment varies between EUR CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL depending on the degree of disability . Furthermore , the increase of the DATE pension was tied to the adaptations of the general retirement pension scheme . By the amendment a further CARDINAL persons who had been previously time - barred to claim benefits became eligible for the benefits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants directly lodged a constitutional complaint in which they attacked the constitutionality of the DATE LAW and all subsequent legislation in that respect . They invoked a violation of their property rights and felt discriminated against in comparison to other vulnerable groups . They further complained about a legislative failure to act insofar as they did not receive benefits to the extent they would receive if the present laws on pharmaceutical liability were applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a composition of a panel of CARDINAL judges , declined to review the constitutional complaint of the applicants . ORG held that the complaint was inadmissible for being time - barred insofar as LAW and LAW were challenged . Regarding the complaint on LAW the ORG found it inadmissible for reasons of subsidiarity of the constitutional complaint , as the applicants had not priorly objected against their pension with the competent administrative courts . ORG underlined that the applicants had failed to challenge the regulatory framework . The ORG further reasoned that the complaint as a whole was not sufficiently substantiated . Insofar as the applicants complained about a violation of their property rights the ORG held that the sum of all benefits the applicants had received since DATE was significantly higher than the amount of damages the applicants could have reasonably claimed against the manufacturing company of limited liability . The applicants had further failed to clarify why the present statutory provisions on liability for pharmaceutical products which had been enacted well after the \u201c FAC scandal \u201d had taken place should become applicable in this case . Furthermore , the current provisions on liability for pharmaceutical products provided for compensation only in cases which involved CARDINAL severely damaged persons , whereas the \u201c LOC case still affected CARDINAL persons . In regard to their complaint about arbitrary discrimination the ORG held it insufficient to compare just the amount of the payments and disregard the different legal and factual circumstances . All other groups in question like victims of warfare , war crimes as well as of criminal deeds and of contaminated blood preserves were compensated under significantly different factual and legal circumstances . The benefit payments from the \u201c LOC foundation were tax - free and not considered to be income or assets in order to guarantee that the benefits actually improved the financial situation of those affected by \u201c LOC .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG DATE henceforth DATE LAW ( ORG \u00fcber die PERSON f\u00fcr behinderte PERSON \u201c ) provided that claims against the manufacturing company of limited liability , PERSON , or against its associates , managers or clerks of that company be extinct insofar as the claims relate to a damage which falls under the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Second Law on Amending the Contergan Foundation Law stipulates that the benefits based on this law are exempt from income tax and are not considered to become part of the assets of the beneficiary . According to section CARDINAL LAW of the same law the obligation of other state authorities to provide for benefits is not affected . Authorities may not decline benefits provided for by law because the person receives benefits according to this law .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgerichtsgesetz ) stipulates that a constitutional complaint shall be lodged and substantiated within DATE after the final decision of the competent court . Section QUANTITY stipulates that a constitutional complaint on the constitutionality of a statutory law against which there is no other way of recourse must be lodged within DATE after the enactment of that law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
