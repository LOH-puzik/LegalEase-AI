He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant became a civil servant employed by ORG ( ORG , ORG ; henceforth \u201c the GPE \u201d ) where he worked until his retirement .", "On DATE the Trustees of the ORG ( pankkivaltuusto , bankfullm\u00e4ktige ) amended the pension rules of the ORG so that men who had entered into the service of the ORG prior to CARDINAL DATE and who continued their employment until retirement were also granted an opportunity to lower their retirement age from DATE . For DATE the retirement age was lowered , the pension accrued prior to DATE was reduced by PERCENT . At its highest the early retirement reduction was PERCENT for DATE . Under the pension rules of CARDINAL DATE the retirement age for women who had entered the service of the ORG prior to CARDINAL DATE was DATE and no reductions applied to pension accrual .", "Prior to his retirement the applicant applied for a preliminary ruling on how his pension would be calculated . His application was rejected by ORG ( johtokunta , direktionen ) on DATE as giving such a decision was not considered particularly important to the applicant . On DATE the applicant was granted a pension , which was reduced by PERCENT for DATE prior to DATE on the ground that he had retired at DATE . The pension so calculated amounted to MONEY ( ORG ) per month .", "On DATE the applicant petitioned ORG , requesting rectification so that no reduction should apply when his pension was calculated . He also requested that the decision of CARDINAL DATE be overturned as it had been taken by a body which was not competent and was contrary to LAW now CARDINAL ) of LAW . He underlined that his petition was not to be interpreted as an appeal to ORG , ORG ) against the decision to grant him a pension . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant 's petition without examining the merits since it had no competence to review the lawfulness of the impugned decision and the issue could not be rectified .", "It appears that the applicant did not appeal to ORG against any of the decisions of DATE and DATE . However , he lodged an appeal with ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) against the decision of DATE . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It found that the decision by the Trustees of the ORG in DATE was not a decision that could be rectified . Therefore , and as there was no indication of partiality and as the NORP aspects relied on by the applicant were irrelevant for the outcome of the case , it found that there were no reasons to alter the finding of ORG .", "Having received the decision , the applicant requested a copy , inter alia , of the referendary 's written proposal to the judges . On DATE the referendary sent copies of the requested documents , save for the confidential parts of her proposal which under LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) formed part of the deliberations of the court . On DATE the applicant maintained that he had a right to receive a complete copy of the latter document and demanded that his request be transferred to the chancellery 's session for decision . On DATE the applicant 's request was rejected in the chancellery 's session as he had not shown that he needed the said part of the document which formed part of the court 's deliberations and which could therefore be produced only exceptionally .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's request of DATE for the said document to be sent directly to ORG as such an application for documents fell outside the scope of the LAW on the Openness of Government Activities ( laki viranomaisten toiminnan julkisuudesta , lagen om offentlighet i myndigheternas verksamhet ) . The applicant 's subsequent request for copies of the proposals underlying these decisions was rejected as no written proposals had been drawn up . On DATE the applicant requested a fresh decision , arguing that the previous one was poorly reasoned . He also alleged partiality . ORG interpreted his petition as an extraordinary appeal , which it rejected on DATE as ill - founded .", "The applicant 's request for a copy of the proposal underlying the decision was granted on DATE save for those parts of the court 's deliberations which were to be kept secret under ORG ( laki oikeudenk\u00e4ynnin julkisuudesta hallintotuomioistuimissa , lagen om offentlighet vid r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ng i f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolar ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . On DATE the applicant renewed his request , arguing that the contents might affect the proceedings before ORG . On DATE ORG rejected his request under the said LAW .", "The applicant was granted a separate old age pension as of DATE at DATE , amounting to ORG CARDINAL per month , from ORG Valtiokonttori , ORG ) due to his service in ORG during DATE . No reduction for the accrual prior to DATE was applied .", "The applicant petitioned the Chancellor of ORG ( oikeuskansleri , justitiekanslern ) and ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the Deputy Chancellor of ORG and the Deputy ORG respectively found no reason to take measures . On DATE the Deputy ORG found no reason to re - examine the case . On DATE the applicant was informed by ORG that his case would not be re - examined in the absence of new facts relevant to the case .", "In DATE the applicant petitioned ORG in order to obtain information for the proceedings before ORG . The Bank produced certain information such as the names of employees affected by the DATE amendment . However , it refused to produce information about their retirement age , their addresses , telephone numbers , bank account details and so on . It is not known whether the applicant appealed to ORG .", "Meanwhile , on DATE ORG granted PERSON a pension and applied , in accordance with its practice , the early retirement reduction as described above . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the ORG 's decision in the case of PERSON without considering its merits as the decision did not directly affect him . In any event , an appeal against a pension decision lay with ORG , not ORG . On DATE ORG ( decision no . CARDINAL ) rejected PERSON arguments that the early retirement reduction was discriminatory and in breach of LAW and LAW . However , it amended the pension decision by granting PERSON a pension right amounting to PERCENT on the ground that he fulfilled the so - called pension guarantee requirement as he had completed DATE of service . ORG has ruled in a similar case also on DATE in the case of Mr PERSON", "Meanwhile , following the judgment of DATE by ORG in the case of PERSON in which it was found that the fact that the applicant 's pensionable age was set higher than that of men doing the same work was in breach of the principle of equal pay laid down by LAW , ORG reached the same conclusion in its decision concerning ORG on DATE .
