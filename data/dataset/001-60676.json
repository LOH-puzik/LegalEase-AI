On DATE ORG delivered a second judgment . It first upheld an appeal by the prosecution concerning some of the defendants , including the applicant , finding that the latter was also guilty of conspiracy . The applicant \u2019s sentence was accordingly raised to DATE imprisonment . ORG then considered the appeal against the order made by the judge of ORG on DATE . It held that the application made by the applicant alone was provided for in LAW , which permitted a defendant to submit pleadings or observations directly to the court . Taking into account LAW ( e ) of the LAW , ORG then set aside the impugned decision and ordered the appeal lodged by the applicant to be translated so that it could be \u201c duly examined \u201d .

It noted that in any event the application was signed only by the applicant and not by his lawyer , and that accordingly it could not be declared admissible .", "CARDINAL .

Formerly , it was the established case - law of ORG that it was permissible to dismiss outright any appeals submitted in breach of the formal conditions laid down in LAW . In particular , it took the view that an appellant was not entitled to be asked to make good any deficiencies of his appeal , unlike the position provided for in LAW . That was justified by the particular requirements of speedy trial imposed by criminal procedure , the question of celerity being deemed not to be raised in the same terms in civil cases . It was therefore normal for ORG to dismiss appeals on points of law , for example , on account of the prolixity of the related pleadings , regard being had to the provision in LAW requiring an appellant to \u201c summarise \u201d the reasons for his appeal .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , published in ORG on DATE , ORG declared , with general binding force , that LAW was unconstitutional if interpreted so as to permit the outright dismissal of an appeal on points of law on account of the wordiness of the related pleading without the appellant being first asked to rectify his appeal .

CARDINAL , which are similar to LAW and applicable to summary offences , were unconstitutional if interpreted so as to permit the outright dismissal of an appeal on account of its being unaccompanied by submissions without the appellant being first asked to make such submissions . ORG referred to its case - law concerning the dismissal of appeals on points of law on account of the wordiness of the related pleading , observing that the same reasoning applied to the case under consideration , regard being had to the requirements of the principle of fair trial and the right to due process .", "CARDINAL .
