The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE her parents built a holiday home without planning permission on land situated in GPE ) . According to the applicant , however , the house was built in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following her mother \u2019s death , a deed of partition was drawn up on DATE between the applicant ( who , inheriting from her mother , became the remainderman of CARDINAL of the property ) and her father . That deed , which specifically mentions the existence of the building , was registered with ORG at ORG and a registration fee was paid .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s father died on DATE and she became the full and sole owner of the entire property . On inheriting the property , the applicant specifically declared in the notarised deed of distribution that the plot was a holiday home . The deeds were registered with the local authorities and the applicant paid the inheritance tax . From then on , the applicant paid an DATE property tax ( pr\u00e9compte immobilier ) and secondresidence tax on DATE home . According to the applicant , it went without saying that her father had also paid the relevant taxes on the house .", "CARDINAL . The applicant carried out renovations on the house costing MONEY ( ORG ) and had the trees on the adjoining land felled .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the partly government - controlled NORP water - supply company carried out works to connect the house to the drainage and water - supply systems . There was no reaction from the local authorities at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a report was drawn up by a police officer who noted that trees had been felled on the property in breach of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the NORP forestry decree of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a report was drawn up by a police officer who noted that the holiday home had been erected in DATE without planning permission and that it was located in a forested area in which no such permission could be issued . The report also noted that the exterior and roof of the house had been renovated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant voluntarily reported to the police to make a statement , which was placed on record .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the municipal council ( coll\u00e8ge des bourgmestre et \u00e9chevins ) asked the planning inspector to issue an opinion on any remedial action to be taken . By a letter of DATE , the planning inspector applied to the public prosecutor for the site to be restored to its original condition .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL reports dated DATE and DATE mention that the police had sought to question the applicant again but had found it difficult to contact her and that she was temporarily unable to travel for health reasons .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the ORG public prosecutor , the applicant was questioned in GPE on DATE by a NORP police officer . A report was drawn up on that occasion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor asked the local police to confirm whether or not the building in issue still existed .", "CARDINAL . A report of DATE established that the situation had not changed .", "CARDINAL . NORP The NORP public prosecutor issued the applicant with a summons to appear in court on CARDINAL DATE , firstly , for having maintained a holiday home , erected without planning permission , DATE and DATE and , secondly , for having felled CARDINAL pine trees in breach of the above - mentioned NORP forestry decree . According to the applicant , there were CARDINAL other houses built without permission in the same forested areas , which had neither been the subject of reports establishing that an offence had been committed nor of prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an interlocutory judgment in absentia , since the applicant had not been duly summoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she was once again summoned to appear before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that court acquitted the applicant of the above - mentioned charges . It held in particular that after DATE the applicant could legitimately assume , as could any reasonably prudent citizen , that maintaining the building in issue would no longer constitute an offence . The court further held that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the planning inspector \u2019s application to have the land restored to its original condition . The prosecutor appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the judgment in so far as the applicant was acquitted of the charge of felling the trees . However , it found her guilty of maintaining a building erected without planning permission , pursuant to LAW of CARDINAL DATE , and changed the impugned period to DATE and DATE , having regard to the date on which the applicant \u2019s father had died .", "CARDINAL . In her submissions the applicant had alleged a violation of the reasonable - time requirement under LAW , considering that the criminal proceedings had been conducted beyond that time - limit and that after such a long period there had been an interference with her rights of defence , in particular since it had been impossible for her to prove that the house had been built before DATE . She had also criticised the failure of the authorities to act , pointing out that her parents had paid the second - residence tax , that a notarised deed mentioning the building had been registered by the authorities , that she had paid inheritance tax on property that included the building , that extensive infrastructure works had been carried out by a partly government - controlled company with no reaction on the part of the local authorities and that for DATE no legal action had been taken . She had also alleged a violation of the principle of protection of the legitimate expectations of citizens and complained of discrimination in comparison with neighbouring property owners .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that a deed of partition drawn up in DATE and signed by the applicant established that the holiday home had been built in DATE and concurred furthermore with the findings contained in the report drawn up on DATE . ORG considered that the applicant knew or should have known that the building had been erected without planning permission . As a reasonable and prudent citizen , and even taking account of the attitude of the authorities as she had described it , the applicant could not have inferred that the situation was totally legal and that no proceedings would be brought against her . ORG found that the applicant had acted most imprudently by proceeding to renovate the LOC after the death of her father . It also found that the fact that CARDINAL other dwellings had also been erected in the same forested area without planning permission and without their owners being prosecuted did not amount to discrimination .", "CARDINAL . With regard , more particularly , to compliance with the reasonable - time requirement , ORG found that the length of the criminal proceedings had been unreasonable but that this did not alter the fact that the offence had been established and that the applicant had , since DATE , been liable to prosecution . Considering , firstly , that overrunning the reasonable time did not cause the proceedings to become time - barred and , secondly , that , and in particular of the fact that the applicant had no criminal record , ORG merely pronounced a finding of guilt against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the planning inspector \u2019s application lodged pursuant to Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the above - mentioned decree of CARDINAL DATE , which it deemed to be reasonable , ORG ordered the applicant to restore the site to its former condition and to demolish the building within DATE of the judgment becoming final , with a fine of ORG CARDINAL per day \u2019s delay . It also authorised the municipal council or the planning inspector to enforce the order at the expense of the applicant in the event of non - compliance with the demolition order . The applicant was also ordered to pay the costs and expenses of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On grounds based on a violation of LAW , the applicant claimed that the length of the criminal proceedings had been unreasonable and it could therefore be concluded that they were time - barred .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that exceeding a reasonable time did not cause criminal proceedings to become time - barred and that , consequently , ORG had not been bound to base its decision on that point .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also submitted that , bearing in mind that ORG had merely pronounced a finding of guilt against her , she could not be bound to restore the site to its original condition or to pay the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG responded that restoration of the site to its original condition did not constitute a penalty but a civil measure , in the same way as the payment of the full costs of the proceedings at the fixed rate , and that consequently these measures were not inconsistent with a simple finding of guilt .", "CARDINAL . The court also dismissed the ground based on LAW whereby the applicant alleged that after a DATE period during which they had tolerated the situation , thus creating an apparently lawful situation , the authorities could no longer rely on the public interest to justify interference with the peaceful enjoyment of her property rights and respect for her private life .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that ORG had held , in its unfettered discretion , that the applicant had been most imprudent in maintaining the house without planning permission , that the measure sought by the planning inspector was reasonable and that , consequently , that ground of appeal was inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . The house was demolished in DATE pursuant to an enforcement order . According to an expert , the value of the house at the material time was EUR CARDINAL .
