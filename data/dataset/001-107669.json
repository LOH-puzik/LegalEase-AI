On DATE general elections took place in GPE . The preliminary results of those elections were announced on DATE . According to them , the ruling ORG had narrowly won the elections .", "CARDINAL . On DATE growing discontent with the results of the elections and with alleged electoral fraud was felt , notably in various online forums . At TIME CARDINAL people , mostly young , gathered in front of ORG ) monument in the centre of PERSON . TIME there were already CARDINAL people assembled , who began to protest against the alleged electoral fraud , doing so in front of ORG and ORG buildings and then returning to ORG . A bigger demonstration was then announced for CARDINAL a.m. DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the protest restarted with the participation of CARDINAL people . While the demonstration was peaceful at the beginning , CARDINAL of the participants gradually became violent . As established by the subsequently created parliamentary inquiry commission tasked with the elucidation of the causes and consequences of the events following the general elections held on DATE in GPE ( \u201c the Commission \u201d ) , CARDINAL incidents of poorly planned intervention by a fire truck and riot police brought the crowd to a point beyond which massive violent acts could no longer be prevented . Following violent attacks and stone throwing , which met very weak police resistance , CARDINAL violent protesters were eventually able to take over the lower floors of ORG and ORG buildings . They looted those floors and set the canteen in FAC alight . During TIME , several fires broke out in the ORG building , some of them breaking out after full control over the building was recovered by the authorities at TIME", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE various police and special forces units started a massive operation aimed at re - establishing public order . However , as established by the Commission , excessive force was used and all those still present in the main square were arrested , regardless of whether they had acted violently or not . The arrests continued for DATE . The media reported cases and showed video footage of young people being arrested and/or beaten by both uniformed police and plain - clothed officers in the city centre during DATE and thereafter , long after the protests ended on TIME DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE he and his friend PERSON went to the centre of PERSON to see the protests .", "CARDINAL . Having spent some time peacefully attending the protests , they stopped a taxi with the intention of returning home . However , they were forced into the taxi by CARDINAL plain - clothed police officers who did not identify themselves . The officers ordered the driver to drive to GPE police station . The applicant and PERSON were taken to that police station and locked in a cell which was cold , unfurnished and lacked access to daylight .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE an officer in police uniform entered the cell . He was accompanied by the CARDINAL arresting officers , who started beating the applicant and PERSON for no reason . The applicant lost consciousness and woke up with blood running from his nose and upper lip . No medical help was given to him .", "CARDINAL . According to the record of the applicant \u2019s arrest , he was arrested on DATE at TIME The reason indicated in the record was that he had been \u201c caught in the act and the investigating authority suspects that he may abscond \u201d . No further details were given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the detention facility of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , where he was held together with CARDINAL other people in a cell measuring QUANTITY , was given meagre quantities of inedible food and was denied water . The cell lacked access to daylight and ventilation . According to the Government , the applicant was examined by a prison doctor on DATE . No signs of ill - treatment were noted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge from ORG , Judge PERSON , accepted a prosecutor \u2019s request to order the applicant \u2019s detention pending trial for DATE .

On the way there , he was allegedly made to pass through a \u201c death corridor \u201d formed of police officers , each of whom hit him as he passed by .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the investigating judge \u2019s decision of DATE and ordered the applicant \u2019s release .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the applicant was not ill - treated during his detention or his transfers to other detention facilities . Despite being assisted by a lawyer , he made no complaints of such ill - treatment until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to the ORG prosecutor \u2019s office of his ill - treatment . He made a similar complaint to the military prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE , describing in detail his ill - treatment and the conditions of his detention . He relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and noted that he had not received any reply to his complaint of DATE . The stamps present on his complaint of CARDINAL DATE reveal that the case file was received by the military prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Also on DATE the applicant was examined by a doctor , who found an abrasion on his face which had formed a scab and a bruise accompanying an abrasion on his upper lip on the right side , which were considered to be injuries that had not caused damage to his health . According to the applicant , he was not told to take off his clothes , and for this reason the doctor did not establish the presence of other injuries , notably on his back .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a report dated DATE the military prosecutor dealing with the applicant \u2019s complaint noted that requests had been made to ORG ( without specifying the nature of the requests ) but that no answer had been received . In the absence of such materials no decision as to next steps could be made . The prosecutor therefore asked for an extension of the period for finalising the case until DATE . This request was granted .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the same prosecutor noted that on CARDINAL DATE ORG had been asked to carry out an internal investigation to identify the officers who had allegedly ill - treated the applicant . As no officers from GPE police station had been heard , the prosecutor asked for an extension of the period for finalising the case until CARDINAL DATE . This request was granted .", "CARDINALand his friend PERSON had been heard . The officers who were on duty at GPE police station on DATE were still to be heard . In such circumstances , the prosecutor asked for an extension of the period for finalising the case until DATE . This request was granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor decided not to initiate a criminal investigation into the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment . He noted that S. had not confirmed having been ill - treated or having seen the applicant being ill - treated . All the police officers had denied any wrongdoing and the officer on guard had denied that anyone had entered the applicant \u2019s cell during TIME DATE . That officer had not seen any injuries on the applicant \u2019s body when the applicant had returned from his interview with the investigators concerning his alleged participation in mass disorder on DATE . The CARDINAL officers who had arrested the applicant ( GPE , ORG and ORG ) stated that they had brought him and S. to ORG police station and had then returned to the centre of PERSON , where they had guarded Government buildings until TIME on DATE . They had not returned to the police station and had not entered any cells there . Moreover , according to a report concerning a medical examination of the applicant on DATE , no injuries had been noted on the applicant \u2019s body . The prosecutor considered that the injuries on the applicant \u2019s face could have been caused during his participation in the riots in the centre of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the military prosecutor \u2019s office informed the applicant of the decision taken on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained about the prosecutor \u2019s decision to the military prosecutor \u2019s office . He noted that he had been in police custody DATE and that his injuries had appeared during that period . Moreover , none of the arresting officers had noted any injuries on his body at the time of his arrest . He noted the discrepancies between the CARDINAL medical reports of CARDINAL and DATE and called into question the professionalism and independence of the doctor who had filed the report of the examination on DATE . He also noted that PERSON was a former police officer and might have given a statement in support of his former colleagues , either out of solidarity with them or after having been threatened . The applicant referred to his complaint , in which he had noted that he could identify the people who had ill - treated him , but that no identity parade had been organised to verify his claim in that regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor \u2019s office rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint as ill - founded . The prosecutor referred to S. \u2019s statement that he had not seen any ill - treatment occurring .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG about the decision not to initiate criminal proceedings . He considered that the investigation had been protracted , given that his complaint of DATE had reached the military prosecutor \u2019s office DATE . Having received no response to his complaint , he had made another complaint on CARDINAL DATE . After a decision had been taken on DATE after his initial complaint \u2013 not to initiate a criminal investigation , he had been informed of it DATE . The applicant repeated his arguments made in his complaint of CARDINAL DATE and added that the prosecution had not ordered any additional medical examination in order to dispel the doubts concerning the discrepancies between the medical reports of CARDINAL and DATE . The applicant also noted that he had been undergoing a series of extensive medical examinations which would confirm his ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Memoria Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims , a non - governmental organisation financed by ORG and a member of ORG of ORG ( ORG ) , issued an Extract of the medical file ( NORP din PERSON ) concerning the applicant \u2019s examination during the period DATE . He appears to have undergone detailed medical tests and examinations by various medical specialists . According to the document , the applicant had suffered , inter alia , the consequences of a head injury including intracranial hypertension syndrome and post - traumatic stress disorder , which had had both physical and psychological effects on him . The document was submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint as unfounded . It found that the prosecutor had interviewed all those concerned and noted that PERSON had not confirmed the applicant \u2019s allegations . The ORG decisions having been adopted in full compliance with the law , there was no reason to quash the decisions taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) refused to extend the appointment of Judge PERSON ORG , following which he was dismissed from his position as a judge by the acting President of GPE . The reason for the ORG \u2019s decision was that the judge had examined a number of cases concerning the events of DATE outside the courtroom and at the LOC of ORG , which was \u201c a grave violation of the LAW and of LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal case against the applicant was discontinued for lack of evidence that he had committed a crime .", "CARDINAL .

The specific issue of the treatment of the people detained in relation to the events was the central focus of the Commissioner \u2019s attention .", "The majority of the persons interviewed by the Commissioner \u2019s delegation , who had been arrested in connection with the DATE post - electoral demonstrations , alleged that they had been beaten \u2013 some of them severely - by police officers . In several cases , the medical expert accompanying the Commissioner directly observed physical marks consistent with those allegations . Moreover , the medical files in the establishments visited contained records of injuries which were consistent with the ORG accounts .", "...", "Representatives of the NORP authorities accepted that police had abused their powers in the aftermath of the protests when dealing with persons deprived of their liberty , and expressed their resolve to overcome the problem of ill - treatment by the police . It was strongly underlined by the Commissioner that such large - scale violations of the fundamental right to be free of ill - treatment must never be allowed to recur , and that active steps must be taken to pursue accountability whenever individual cases of ill - treatment emerge ...", "... CARDINAL . NORP The Minister of the Interior informed the Commissioner that CARDINAL people were detained in the aftermath of the CARDINAL - CARDINAL DATE demonstrations on suspicion that they had committed criminal offences . CARDINAL of those persons were still in custody as of DATE , remanded in Prison No . CARDINAL , an institution under the authority of ORG . Moreover , CARDINAL people , including CARDINAL young women , had been detained on administrative charges related to the events in question ; all of those persons had been released by the time of the Commissioner \u2019s visit .", "CARDINAL . Based on the information at the Commissioner \u2019s disposal , the persons apprehended in the aftermath of the demonstrations were brought to CARDINAL of the following police establishments in GPE : ORG , or ORG , GPE , PERSON , PERSON and GPE district police stations . People who were initially detained in CARDINAL of the district police stations were then transferred to the detention facility at ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Commissioner received no complaints regarding the treatment of persons in Prison No . CARDINAL . However , the majority of the persons interviewed by the Commissioner \u2019s delegation , who had been arrested in connection with the DATE post - electoral demonstrations , alleged that they had been physically ill - treated by police officers . In most cases , the persons who were subjected to the alleged ill - treatment were relatively young ( under CARDINAL ) . As ORG has himself observed , the alleged ill - treatment broadly related to CARDINAL different situations : CARDINAL ) at the time of apprehension ; CARDINAL ) during transport to a detention facility ; and CARDINAL ) ill - treatment within the detention facility , including during questioning with the objective of extracting a confession .", "CARDINAL . The physical ill - treatment alleged included punches , kicks and blows with rubber batons , wooden sticks , the butts of firearms , or other blunt and hard objects . Certain persons claimed that the ill - treatment was sufficiently severe or prolonged so as to make them lose consciousness at least once and/or to result in fractures or permanent nerve damage . Many persons also alleged that they had been threatened with physical violence or even with summary execution , verbally abused , and/or subjected to humiliating treatment ...", "CARDINAL . According to the Minister of ORG , of the CARDINAL persons admitted to Prison No . CARDINAL following a period of deprivation of liberty by the police , CARDINAL persons displayed various degrees of injuries . The Minister of the Interior informed the Commissioner that , as of DATE , CARDINAL complaints concerning ill - treatment were being processed . ORG indicated that his office had received CARDINAL complaints as of that date , and that investigations in CARDINAL further cases had been initiated ex officio . In addition , CARDINAL criminal prosecution had been initiated .", "CARDINAL . In several cases , the medical expert accompanying the Commissioner directly observed physical marks consistent with allegations of ill - treatment , despite the fact that DATE had elapsed since the time the alleged ill - treatment occurred . Moreover , the files studied by the Commissioner \u2019s medical expert contained records of injuries which were consistent with the accounts of physical ill - treatment given by the persons who had been in police custody . For instance , the records in ORG in GPE revealed that QUANTITY persons had sought medical attention during the relevant period because of injuries they sustained due to use of force by the police . Of those , CARDINAL had to be hospitalised because of severe injuries , including concussions , contusions of the kidneys , fractured limbs or ribs , and/or multiple soft tissue injuries ...", "CARDINAL . In contrast to the prison and hospital medical records , the Commissioner \u2019s medical expert observed that the records of injuries kept in the detention facility at ORG in GPE were extremely cursory and superficial . The explanation given for this was that the feldsher ( paramedic ) employed in that facility was not a forensic doctor . These deficiencies in the recording of injuries in police establishments have already been highlighted by ORG for the Prevention of Torture ( ORG ) in the report on the ORG \u2019s DATE visit to GPE . ... The ORG made a detailed recommendation on screening for injuries of persons within TIME of their admission to a police detention facility outside the presence of police officers , and on the imperative to record any injuries in a thorough manner . If the injuries recorded are consistent with allegations of ill - treatment , they should immediately be brought to the attention of the relevant prosecutor and an examination should be ordered by a recognised forensic doctor . In the interests of preventing ill - treatment , the Commissioner strongly urges the GPE authorities to provide for proper screening , recording and reporting of injuries , in light of the ORG \u2019s recommendations on this subject .", "... CARDINAL . NORP ... representatives of ORG ( the National Preventive Mechanism under the UN OPCAT ) were reportedly prevented on DATE from visiting certain police establishments in GPE where persons were being held , including ORG and FAC .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner received many complaints about the conditions of detention in police establishments following the large - scale arrests ; most of these involved reports of serious overcrowding , very poor hygiene , lighting and ventilation , as well as the lack of provision of food , clean bedding , and personal hygiene or sanitary items . As already noted , the Commissioner only visited CARDINAL police detention facility , i.e. the one at ORG in GPE . The Commissioner observed that the material conditions in the cells were poor , with very dim lighting and bad ventilation ; in general , the conditions corresponded quite closely to the descriptions provided by the persons who had been held in those cells . As for the issue of overcrowding , it was confirmed by the staff that the capacity of the establishment was exceeded during the dates in question .", "... DATE . It is of great concern to the Commissioner that a large number of the CARDINAL persons \u2013 certain of whom were minors - arrested in the context of or following the protests were subjected to ill - treatment by the police , some of it severe .", "... CARDINAL . The Commissioner \u2019s official interlocutors accepted that police had abused their powers in the aftermath of the protests when dealing with persons deprived of their liberty . The Commissioner underlined strongly that such large - scale violations of the fundamental right to be protected from ill - treatment must never be allowed to recur , and that active steps must be taken to pursue accountability whenever individual cases of ill - treatment emerge .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor General stated that he will investigate each case brought to his attention and also take initiatives himself upon information indicative of ill - treatment even in the absence of a complaint . According to him , special prosecutors which have not had working relations with police departments implicated in the events were being assigned to the cases . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of the report of the visit to GPE carried out by ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) from CARDINAL to DATE read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The main purpose of the visit was to assess the manner in which investigations were being carried out into cases possibly involving ill - treatment by the police in the context of post - election events in DATE in GPE . The visit also provided an opportunity to review the treatment of persons detained by the police .", "In the course of DATE , the ORG received reports from various sources according to which , following the parliamentary elections of DATE , CARDINAL of persons had been apprehended by the police after violent incidents occurred during public protests in front of the Presidency , ORG and Government buildings in PERSON . Those reports referred to severe physical ill - treatment at the time of apprehension , during transportation and/or during subsequent police custody . ORG also received information indicating that some persons had died as a result of police action on DATE .", "... CARDINAL . During the DATE visit , the delegation observed that the practice of holding remand prisoners in police temporary detention facilities ( izolatoare de deten\u0163ie preventiv\u0103 , abbreviated \u201c ORG \u201d ) continued unabated . In the report on the DATE visit , the ORG called upon the GPE authorities to give the highest priority to the implementation of the decision to transfer the responsibility for persons remanded in custody to ORG . In response , ORG indicated that it was in favour of a temporary transfer of responsibility for IDPs to ORG , pending the building of pre - trial establishments under the latter ORG authority . However , at DATE visit , the Minister of Justice indicated that the responsibility for the IDPs could not be taken over by his Ministry because conditions of detention in these facilities were substandard .", "The ORG shares the view that IDPs do not offer suitable conditions for holding persons remanded in custody . ORG would nevertheless like to stress that , in the interests of the prevention of ill - treatment , the sooner a criminal suspect passes into the hands of a custodial authority which is functionally and institutionally separate from the police , the better . The delegation \u2019s findings from the DATE visit support that ; most cases of alleged police ill - treatment in the context of the DATE events had emerged only after the persons concerned had been transferred to an establishment under ORG or released . ...", "... CARDINAL . NORP In the course of the DATE visit , the ORG \u2019s delegation heard a remarkably large number of credible and consistent allegations of police ill - treatment in the context of the post - election events in DATE . Many persons interviewed referred to the remarks made by police staff , which suggested that the alleged ill - treatment was inflicted in retaliation for acts of violence against the police during DATE of DATE .", "... CARDINAL . The delegation also heard numerous accounts , from women , men and juveniles alike , of physical ill - treatment whilst in police custody in the course of CARDINAL DATE and/or during DATE . Most persons interviewed who had not been released shortly after apprehension complained of repeated or prolonged beatings during the initial questioning by operational police officers or between interrogation sessions ( e.g. kicks and blows with a truncheon or with a plastic bottle filled with water ) . The delegation also heard widespread allegations of threats of physical ill - treatment ( including rape ) and killing during the initial police questioning . The persons interviewed referred not only to the retaliatory nature of the alleged ill - treatment , but also claimed that it was aimed at extracting statements from them .", "Many persons interviewed also alleged that they had been hit with truncheons and kicked when going through a \u201c corridor \u201d of police officers before entering a police establishment or transfer .", "Further , the delegation received a few allegations of ill - treatment by custodial staff ( e.g. kicks ) upon admission to the ORG of ORG in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Most of the above allegations were supported by forensic or other medical evidence . In some cases , the competent prosecuting authorities considered that the ill - treatment alleged was such that it could amount to torture ... The ORG shares this view . Moreover , the above findings lead the ORG to the conclusion that , rather than isolated incidents , there were patterns of alleged ill - treatment .", "... CARDINAL . In its previous visit report , the ORG stressed that effective screening for injuries by health - care staff can make a significant contribution to the prevention of ill - treatment of persons detained by the police , and it made a series of recommendations designed to improve the procedures followed by feldshers working in IDPs . During the DATE visit , the delegation observed the same shortcomings as those identified in the past . There were undue delays in the examination of newly admitted detainees ( i.e. of DATE ) . The screening for injuries was generally superficial and was routinely carried out in the presence of custodial or operational staff , and a copy of the report drawn up following an examination was accessible to police staff . Not surprisingly , the injuries sustained by detained persons in the context of the DATE events had frequently been detected and/or recorded only after release or transfer to a penitentiary establishment .", "In contrast , the screening for injuries on arrival at Penitentiary establishment No . CARDINAL in PERSON was generally of a better standard : newly arrived remand prisoners were examined by prison health - care staff shortly after admission and reports describing injuries observed during medical screening were forwarded to the prosecuting authorities . However , the recording of injuries was not fully satisfactory : in a number of instances , the description of lesions was succinct and the records rarely contained the ORG accounts as to the origin of their injuries .", "... CARDINAL . ... A new system of free legal assistance for indigent criminal suspects came into operation in DATE , following the entry into force of ORG of DATE . However , a considerable number of detained persons interviewed by the delegation complained about the quality of ex officio lawyers . The inaction of certain ex officio lawyers during the DATE events when their clients displayed visible injuries or alleged ill - treatment provoked scepticism about their independence from the police and the prosecuting authorities .", "CARDINAL . The right of persons in police custody to have access to a doctor ( including to CARDINAL of their own choice ) , is still not expressly guaranteed by law ... Many persons who were in police custody in the context of the DATE events complained that , despite repeated requests for independent medical assistance , they had been refused such assistance . In some cases , police staff allegedly denied access to a doctor in order to obtain a confession or other statement from the injured detained persons concerned . Further , it appeared in a few cases of persons who had presented visible injuries that medical care had not been provided to them on the grounds that they had not specifically requested it . Such situations not only deprive detained persons of a safeguard which can play a significant role in the prevention of ill - treatment , but it may also have serious repercussions on the health of persons in police custody . Clearly , access to an independent doctor should not be left to the discretion of police officers .", "... CARDINAL . Control of police establishments by public prosecutors has been reinforced over DATE since the first ORG visit to GPE in DATE . Shortly after the post - election events in DATE , prosecutors paid visits to police detention facilities . The delegation was informed that they had received and processed a number of complaints of ill - treatment in the context of such inspections .", "However , most persons met by the delegation who had been detained at the time claimed that , before such visits , they had been warned by police staff not to make any complaints to the visiting prosecutors . Further , prosecutors were apparently accompanied by police staff and did not seek to have private interviews with detained persons .", "... CARDINAL . ... In the aftermath of the DATE events , a number of persons met by the delegation had been interviewed in private by members of the [ ORG ] while in detention . ... Further , DATE , on CARDINAL occasions , members of the ORG had reportedly not been able to carry out their tasks ; denial of access ( on CARDINAL and DATE ) , delays in access ( of TIME ) and refusal to allow them to consult custody registers were among the major problems encountered . Police officers met by the delegation excused the problems of access by a lack of information , in particular as regards the composition of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In short , the post - election period in DATE had been a litmus test of the ability of independent visiting bodies to carry out their functions effectively . However , the delegation \u2019s findings suggest that there had been serious shortcomings in their operation .", "... CARDINAL . The ORG recognises that the high number of cases possibly involving police ill - treatment in relation to the DATE events constituted a significant challenge for the prosecuting authorities in carrying out their task . However , this should have prompted them to adopt a more proactive and holistic approach , with a particular emphasis on establishing a timeline of the incidents , including all the police officers involved , and all the alleged victims , potential witnesses and outside professionals ( e.g. medical staff ) . Indeed , many complaints and other information indicative of ill - treatment consistently referred to the same incidents , at the same locations , with the same patterns of alleged ill - treatment and , possibly , the same police officers involved . It is clearly a flawed approach to carry out individual investigations into such cases while treating them as unrelated episodes and without proper co - ordination .", "... CARDINAL . In almost all the cases examined at the time of the visit , the action taken had still not led to the identification of the perpetrators of alleged ill - treatment and/or any officials who may have condoned or encouraged it . Prosecutors met by the delegation explained this situation by the impossibility in most cases to identify suspects because police officers were wearing balaclavas , or the fact that the position of the victims did not allow them to see the police officers allegedly inflicting blows . However , it clearly appeared during the DATE visit that no steps had been taken by the prosecuting authorities in a number of cases where victims indicated that they would recognise the police officers involved in the alleged ill - treatment ...", "Further , key information that could have led to the identification of potential suspects and witnesses among members of the ORG \u201c Fulger \u201d ( such as apprehension reports ) had not yet been examined in the context of investigations into alleged ill - treatment ; by contrast , such information was being reviewed by prosecutors investigating mass disorder and usurpation of power on DATE . It is also noteworthy that the responsibility of senior ORG officials and police officers was not being addressed by the prosecutors dealing with cases of alleged ill - treatment ; in the ORG \u2019s view , the fact that such an important issue was being dealt with by prosecutors investigating mass disorder and usurpation of power could seriously undermine the impartiality of any investigative action taken in this respect .", "CARDINAL . When investigating cases possibly involving ill - treatment , the prosecuting authorities do not have an obligation of result ; however , they are under an obligation to take appropriate investigative action . Efforts had generally been made by the prosecuting authorities to react to allegations of police ill - treatment in relation to the DATE events , even in the absence of a formal complaint , when this had been brought to their attention . However , the above findings suggest that in many cases the competent prosecutors had not taken all reasonable steps in good time to secure evidence and had failed to make genuine efforts to identify those responsible .", "It should also be stressed that many alleged victims interviewed by the delegation , including those who had not yet lodged official complaints , as well as their lawyers , expressed a general lack of confidence in the capability and determination of the prosecuting authorities , including military prosecutors , to carry out effective investigations into cases of police ill - treatment . In the ORG \u2019s view , if a police complaints mechanism is to enjoy public confidence , it should not only be independent but should be seen to be independent of the police .", "In their letter of CARDINAL DATE , the NORP authorities informed the ORG that , following the visit , the prosecuting authorities \u201c moved to other investigation tactics \u201d , placing a particular emphasis on the accountability of senior police officers for their actions or lack of action ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

[ The ] majority of these individuals were arrested on DATE .", "In addition , an analysis of various detention records and other data provided by the ORG authorities revealed that the arrest of CARDINAL people had not been reflected in the detention centre records . In a number of cases , the registers did not reflect that the detainee had been taken to hospital due to [ his or her ] injuries suffered .

ORG concluded that \u201c the simple presence of people in the perimeter of the [ relevant few ] streets and buildings amounted to \u2018 sufficient grounds\u2019 for arresting [ them ] and bringing them to the police stations . \u201d", "The ORG found that \u201c all the concerns expressed by international organisations , the media , NGOs and society as a whole concerning the inadequate and disproportionate actions of the police after the events of DATE have been fully justified . Most people were detained by the police arbitrarily , in the absence of any reasonable suspicion of having committed a crime ; the operative services of ORG have failed to identify the people who committed violent acts against their own colleagues from ORG ; the police committed ill - treatment and acts of torture against individuals held in detention and allowed serious violations of procedural rights guaranteed by the LAW ... \u201d", "IV .
