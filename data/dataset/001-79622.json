THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr J. Carroll , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant was questioned by the police and charged with various offences . He and CARDINAL other men were later tried in ORG at GPE on CARDINAL charges , predominantly of assault and drugs offences . The trial lasted from DATE to DATE . The ORG withdrew a number of charges at the close of the prosecution case , such that the applicant was ultimately convicted of CARDINAL charges of assault and robbery and CARDINAL of assault causing injury to a PERSON PERSON . He was sentenced on DATE to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The trial had been recorded by mechanical means .", "On or DATE , the applicant lodged an appeal against both conviction and sentence . Leave to appeal was refused by a single judge on DATE . By letter dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s representatives applied for review of that refusal .", "On DATE , the applicant was granted leave to appeal against sentence and limited leave to appeal against conviction on the charge of assault and robbery , identified for purposes of the proceedings as \u201c Charge CARDINAL . \u201d Charge CARDINAL read in material part as follows :", "\u201c [ the applicant did ] repeatedly punch and kick PERSON on the head , repeatedly threaten to slash and stab him , present a knife to him , attempt to cut off his finger with a knife or similar instrument , all to his injury . \u201d", "By letter dated DATE , it was indicated that leave had been granted to appeal against conviction on PERSON on the basis that \u201c there might be an arguable point as to the need for corroboration on the use of a knife . \u201d", "The applicant obtained legal aid for the instruction of senior and junior counsel on DATE . He thereafter sought to substantiate the factual basis of the appeal against conviction on PERSON . He sought authority ( in general terms ) to have transcribed the recording of counsel \u2019s submissions in support of the contention that there was no case to answer . He was granted legal aid to this effect on DATE and court authorisation on DATE ; he received the transcript on DATE . He obtained counsel \u2019s advice in DATE and , as a consequence , amended his Note of Appeal . The revised Note of Appeal lodged on DATE expanded his initial ground of appeal against conviction on PERSON as follows :", "\u201c That specifically in relation to charge CARDINAL , the trial judge misdirected himself in law and fact when he rejected the submission by counsel that there was insufficient corroboration to allow the jury to find the appellant guilty of attempting to cut off ORG witness PERSON \u2019s finger . PERSON there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict , they should have been directed that before they could do so in relation to the attempted cutting off of the ORG witness PERSON \u2019s finger they must find corroboration in the evidence before they could convict of this element of the charge . \u201d", "Further , the applicant sought transcripts of the evidence of certain witnesses to seek support for the revised grounds of appeal . This was because it appeared to the applicant and his representatives that the trial judge \u2019s record of the evidence was different to that of his agents . On DATE sanction was granted by the court for the funding of the transcription of the evidence of the relevant witnesses . At a hearing on DATE , the court allowed the revised grounds of appeal , ordered a supplementary report from the trial judge , and took note of the position on transcripts .", "The trial judge provided a supplementary report on DATE . The judge noted the attack on the element of charge CARDINAL relating to the \u201c attempt to cut off [ PERSON \u2019s ] finger with a knife or similar instrument , \u201d and continued :", "\u201c There is no suggestion now , nor was there then , that there was insufficient evidence for the remainder of [ charge CARDINAL ] ( of which whole charge the applicant was found unanimously guilty ) including in particular the allegation that the appellant , acting along with CARDINAL others , repeatedly threatened to slash and stab the complainer and presented a knife at him . This has significance ... for the question of corroboration . \u201d", "The trial judge noted the evidence of a Sergeant Scott to the effect that :", "\u201c the complainer sought to speak to him DATE on DATE and then told him informally what had happened , although apparently too scared to give a formal statement . At that stage the witness saw not only the injuries to the complainer \u2019s forehead and face , apparently consistent with the punching and kicking attack spoken to by the complainer , but also a cut to the complainer \u2019s pinkie .", "Standing the evidence of PERSON there was , it seemed to me , arguably enough evidence of the part of the assault in question . Further I took the view that if the jury believed the complainer as to the detailed account he gave ( including threats and the presentation of the knife ) there was no need for specific corroboration of the matter .", "...", "[ i]n this case , in circumstances in which it was accepted that there was sufficient evidence for the allegation of repeated threats to slash and stab the complainer and of presentation of the knife at him , and where the complainer accepted that the apparent attempt to cut off his finger was not carried through to any great extent , I did not think , leaving aside for the moment the evidence of PERSON , that any specific corroboration was needed . \u201d", "The trial judge also noted that , even if the appeal on this point was allowed , and a question was raised as to its effect upon the applicant \u2019s evidence , it would have made no difference to the sentence he imposed .", "ORG wrote to the applicant \u2019s representatives on DATE to ask whether the appeal was ready to proceed ; the applicant \u2019s representatives responded that they were unable to do so until they received the transcripts . On DATE , they were received . By letter dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s representatives wrote to the company contracted to provide the transcription requesting the evidence of a Mr O\u2019Reilly . By letter dated DATE the transcribers advised ORG Justiciary that it had proved impossible to transcribe his evidence due to his diction and the quality of the recording . This letter was passed to the applicant \u2019s representatives , who , on DATE , replied that counsel \u2019s view was that the lack of this transcript would put the appeal in severe difficulties and requesting to have the tape cleaned up .", "Technical attempts were made by specialists to recover the evidence of PERSON O\u2019Reilly . The applicant \u2019s representatives wrote to the transcribers on DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE . In the last letter they stated that the transcript was of \" critical importance to the appeal \" .", "On DATE , the transcribers finally advised that the defects could not be resolved , and that the transcript of PERSON O\u2019Reilly \u2019s evidence could not be provided .", "At a procedural hearing on DATE , fixed by the ORG , the court directed that the applicant had DATE to confirm if the appeal was to proceed .", "On DATE , the applicant tendered a new and additional ground of appeal , namely that there had been a failure by the court to conclude the appeal within a reasonable time in breach of the applicant \u2019s Article CARDINAL rights . This ground was supported by a chronology , in which it was recorded that \u201c On DATE , copy transcripts of the evidence were lodged with ORG and the appellant \u2019s agents awaited notification of a hearing on the appeal . \u201d The applicant accepted that the time taken to CARDINAL DATE was reasonable . However , he contended that , upon lodging the transcripts with ORG , \u201c it should have been clear to the authorities that this case was now pressing and that urgent steps should have been taken to secure a hearing at a time which would have accorded with a reasonable and proportionate time in which to conclude such a case . \u201d", "On DATE , at a procedural hearing , the court granted leave to appeal on this further ground .", "On DATE , the court directed that a hearing be assigned during the sitting of the appeal court on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant abandoned his appeal against conviction , stating that it was counsel \u2019s view that without the transcription of PERSON O\u2019Reilly \u2019s evidence the appeal against Charge CARDINAL in relation to the use of the knife on Mr PERSON \u2019s little finger could not be sustained . As the sitting on DATE concerned appeals against conviction , not sentence only appeals , no date was assigned on that occasion . A date was later fixed for DATE .", "On DATE , ORG of ORG of GPE the Article QUANTITY challenge and the appeal against sentence in DATE , and dismissed them both on DATE .", "ORG noted that the report of the trial judge showed that PERSON O\u2019Reilly \u2019s evidence was not relied upon to provide corroboration of the single feature of Charge CARDINAL that was the subject of challenge . Further , ORG considered that the chronology supplied on DATE by the applicant \u2019s representatives in support of the Article CARDINAL challenge was :", "\u201c neither comprehensive nor entirely accurate . In particular , the suggestion that as from DATE the appellant \u2019s agents were simply awaiting notification of an appeal diet can not be reconciled with the position presented in the later case and argument that appeal could not proceed without the transcripts , nor with the efforts made to recover O\u2019Reilly \u2019s evidence until DATE . \u201d", "ORG considered that the issue relating to corroboration had been \u201c fully ventilated \u201d by DATE , and that :", "\u201c [ ORG time was taken up by the fruitless search for support from some unspecified deficiency in the evidence . It is important to note that there is no suggestion that the transcribed evidence of the witnesses , on whom the trial judge \u2019s analysis of the assault on PERSON \u2019s little finger depended , failed in any way whatsoever to bear out the analysis in his reports . Delay in this case was due to the intransigent insistence of the appellant and his advisers in pursuit of the irrelevant .... \u201d", "ORG then considered the question of length by specific reference to LAW , in particular , the case of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . It considered that :", "\u201c at each stage in the prosecution of this appeal the appellant had the benefit of a prompt response from the ORG to applications made to it . The simple explanation of the major part of the time that has elapsed between conviction and the disposal of the appeal against sentence is the insistence of the appellant in an appeal against conviction that had to be abandoned as having no foundation . [ The applicant \u2019s representative \u2019s ] assertion that there was some absolute duty on the ORG to procure a speedy disposal of the appeal , whatever the position of the appellant , is clearly not supported by the NORP jurisprudence . The conduct of the appellant is a factor . Had the ORG intervened to require the appeal to be disposed of while the appellant continued to pursue his quest for transcripts , we have no doubt that that would have been the focus for complaint . ORG passed in this appeal because the court allowed the appellant the time he sought to pursue these matters . \u201d", "As regards the appeal against sentence , ORG found no basis to interfere with the trial judge \u2019s determination of the relative criminality of the applicant and PERSON , the central ground upon which the applicant maintained that the sentence imposed him had been excessive .", "In the meantime , the applicant had been released on parole licence on DATE , having served CARDINAL of his sentence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
