NORP The applicant , Mr ORG , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr M. Salmon , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their then Agent , Ms S. Ms S.

On unspecified dates DATE the applicant \u2019s father and A. sold QUANTITY . CARDINAL parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG recognised the joint ownership of a house erected on that plot of land : since the CARDINAL brothers had jointly erected the frame structure of the house , they owned it in equal shares . It further rejected ORG \u2019s argument that he was the sole owner of the plot of land as no relevant notary deed had been submitted to the court . On DATE ORG upheld the decision .", "CARDINAL . By a note of CARDINAL DATE the mortgage office certified that the property had been jointly purchased in DATE by the applicant \u2019s father and A. and that it was registered as co - owned .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the plot of land was nationalised .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG on ORG and Compensation of Properties ( \u201c the Commission \u201d ) recognised DATE \u2019s heirs property rights to the plot of land measuring CARDINAL : QUANTITY . m were to be restored ; compensation was to be provided for the remaining QUANTITY m and the remaining plot had been previously sold to third parties . The applicant \u2019s father \u2019s name did not appear on the decision .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant challenged the Commission decision before ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) arguing that A. and his father were co - owners in equal shares of the relevant plot of land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of ORG , in a letter addressed to the applicant , stated , inter alia , that the Commission had wrongly taken its decision given that the applicant \u2019s father and A. were co - owners .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following the remittal of the case , dismissed the applicant \u2019s civil action . Even though the plot of land had been jointly purchased by the applicant \u2019s father and A. in DATE , CARDINAL cadastre documents of DATE showed that the applicant \u2019s father and PERSON each owned a plot of land , so that A. was the sole owner of the relevant plot of land following the division of the property . Both PERSON and the applicant \u2019s father had paid taxes separately and had registered their titles in the civil registrar \u2019s office separately . As to the decision of CARDINAL DATE as upheld by ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG found that it did not change the status of separate property titles that ORG and the applicant \u2019s father had .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG , respectively , upheld the decision and rejected the applicant \u2019s appeals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a supervisory review request with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to refer the case to its ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decisions on the ground that they had been taken contrary to the law . The courts had not given reasons as to how the property had been voluntarily divided up between the applicant \u2019s father and A. No notary deed or other act , as required by law , had been submitted by A. \u2019s heirs to the courts . The fact that the applicant \u2019s father and PERSON had been registered separately in the civil registrar \u2019s office and that they were economically independent was not sufficient to conclude that the property had been divided or that its coownership had ceased to exist . Having regard to the fact that the property certificates submitted by the parties originated from different offices , ORG directed that only documents originating from the mortgage office ( zyrat e hipotek\u00ebs ) were to be relied upon . The courts had not taken into account the findings of the decision of DATE as upheld by ORG on DATE , which not only recognised the coownership to the house but also ruled that \u201c the siblings had jointly erected the frame structure of the house on the plot of land \u201d . It finally ordered the remittal of the case to ORG for a fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s action . It ruled that co - ownership could exist irrespective of the civil status of households . No document had been submitted to the effect that the relevant property had been divided between the parties . While the cadastre documents of DATE indicated that the applicant \u2019s father and ORG owned each a separate plot of land , this did not constitute evidence of the transfer of the property title . The lower courts had incorrectly disregarded the court decisions of DATE which recognised the co - ownership of the house and the plot of land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the ORG of Appeal decision of DATE and upheld the findings of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE . No arguments had been advanced about the continuation of co - ownership after DATE . Following the conduct of the agrarian reform , A. \u2019s heirs had proved that the co - ownership had terminated : the brothers had registered as separate owners of CARDINAL different plots of land , they had paid taxes and dues separately and their family status had been registered separately . According to the law in force , the division of property was made by oral accord and registered with the competent authority .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal arguing that ORG decisions of DATE and DATE were contradictory . He further complained that ORG bench had overstepped its powers by reassessing the evidence and re - examining the merits of his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in full bench , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It reasoned that the appeal concerned the interpretation of domestic law , which was outside its competence .", "CARDINAL .
