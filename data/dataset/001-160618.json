GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention;Procedure prescribed by law;Article 5-1-a - After conviction)", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Erik M\u00f8se;Khanlar Hajiyev;M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Mits;S\u00edofra O\u2019Leary", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has previous convictions for rape dating from DATE and for indecent assault combined with causing bodily harm by dangerous means dating from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of rape combined with the infliction of bodily injury . The judge incorporated a prison term arising from a previous conviction and sentenced him to a total of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Simultaneously , the court ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It held that the applicant was suffering from a disturbance in his sexual preference taking the form of sadism and found that the commission of further crimes was to be expected . The verdict of ORG was based mainly on the conclusions of a psychiatric expert opinion but also took into account the applicant \u2019s previous conviction for indecent assault in DATE . It also observed that the applicant had tried to subjugate several prostitutes whom he had been seeing in DATE . ORG found that this indicated an evolution in his behaviour . It noted that the applicant had refused psychiatric therapy so far and shared the expert \u2019s opinion that the applicant would not be able to resist his urge to humiliate and abuse women in order to satisfy his sexual drive . ORG concluded that similar crimes were to be expected and the applicant therefore represented a danger to the public .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE and placed in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention in psychiatric hospitals has been reviewed at regular intervals ( compare Articles CARDINALd and CARDINAL of LAW , see paragraphs DATE and DATE , below ) and has been extended DATE . In the course of the respective proceedings , the courts have requested DATE forensicpsychiatric expert opinions on the necessity of his detention in hospital . All expert opinions concluded that the applicant was likely to reoffend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered an initial expert opinion , affirming the diagnosis of antisocial behaviour as an adult and abuse of alcohol . However , the expert opinion did not diagnose sexual sadism . Referring to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders \u2012 which is published by ORG and offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders \u2012 it found that the necessary criteria were not met . It concluded that this diagnosis seemed rather unlikely but could not be absolutely excluded without an extensive and credible sexual anamnesis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by an external psychological expert who criticised in detail the diagnosis of sexual sadism during the trial , in particular the lack of information about the applicant \u2019s inner experiences during the onset of the disorder , its further development , and the failure to evaluate his previous offences . The expert concluded that it remained doubtful whether a diagnosis of sexual sadism could be made ( \u201c Es bleibt also weiterhin fraglich , inwieweit ein sexueller PERSON vorliegt \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a further expert opinion . Although it mentioned the presumptive diagnosis of sexual sadism , it found that this presumption was not tenable in view of the history and the personality structure of the applicant . Even assuming that the applicant might have a sadistic sexual disposition , he experienced this without suffering and had no desire to change . According to the verdict of the trial court , the applicant had probably fulfilled his sexual inclinations with prostitutes in order to avoid being charged with an offence . Neither the files nor his statements revealed the development of an addiction or of a pressing perverted imagination or of pathologic impulsiveness . There was no call for therapy as the applicant neither suffered from his behaviour nor desired to change it . The clinic therefore concluded that the applicant \u2019s committal to hospital had been erroneous .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE similar forensic psychiatric expert opinions were delivered by ORG . Although all of them also mentioned the presumptive diagnosis of sexual sadism , they confirmed the previous findings . All the expert opinions concluded that there were no indications for the diagnosis of sexual sadism apart from the facts contained in the verdict of the trial court . In each expert opinion the applicant was described as a classic instance of an erroneous hospital treatment order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant refused to be examined by an external psychiatric expert .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG allowed the re - opening of the criminal proceedings which had been terminated by the judgment of ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG appointed a new external psychiatric expert . The expert concluded that the applicant was suffering from sexual sadism , subject to the reservation that he had not examined the applicant in person but had based his evaluation on the medical files only . ORG subsequently dismissed the request to reopen the criminal proceedings . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this dismissal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to consider the applicant \u2019s related constitutional complaint without providing reasons ( file no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , where the applicant was detained , delivered an expert opinion on the necessity of the applicant \u2019s further detention in hospital . It made the diagnosis of a dissocial personality disorder , alcohol abuse and a presumptive diagnosis of sexual sadism . Although it found a high risk that the applicant would reoffend , it confirmed the prior assessment that the applicant represented a classic instance of an erroneous hospital treatment order . This conclusion was drawn from the fact that the applicant \u2019s behaviour during treatment never gave any grounds for diagnosing a mental disorder such as would have been expected from a person suffering from a psychiatric disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked the applicant to inform the court whether he agreed to being examined by the external expert PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant wrote to ORG and refused a medical examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard the applicant and his counsel in person as well as a psychological expert from ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to terminate the applicant \u2019s placement in hospital and refused to release him on probation as the requirements of LAW and CARDINAL of LAW were not met ( see paragraph DATE , below ) . It explained that detention in a psychiatric hospital could be terminated on the grounds of an erroneous treatment order only if it was established with certainty that the applicant was not suffering from a mental illness warranting his detention under LAW owing to a diminished criminal responsibility from the very beginning . In this context ORG observed that neither the statement by the psychological expert at the hearing nor the current and prior expert opinions had excluded the possibility that the applicant was suffering from sexual sadism , although this diagnosis had been found to be rather unlikely ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , above ) . Furthermore , the court took into account that the applicant had refused to provide credible and full information about his sexual history and had thus rendered a certain diagnosis impossible . It therefore held that a committal to hospital by mistake had not been established beyond doubt . For this reason alone , therefore , the conditions for application of LAW were not met . Lastly , ORG noted , but explicitly without basing its decision on this fact , that the expert opinion which had been delivered in the course of the re - opening proceedings of the criminal trial had confirmed the diagnosis of sadism .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG found that the applicant could not be released on probation as he had refused investigation of his problems relating to sexuality and violence . The evolution of the applicant \u2019s detention and his lack of awareness regarding his crimes rendered it very probable that he would re - offend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG upheld the decision of ORG . It observed that , for exceptional reasons , an examination of the applicant by an external psychiatric expert was not necessary . Such an expert report would have to be based on the files only , since the applicant had announced his refusal of any examination . Under these circumstances ORG found that no new conclusions could be expected from such an external expert opinion . Moreover , it found that the applicant \u2019s condition and dangerousness had not changed since his last examination as he had refused to undergo any therapy . ORG further rejected the applicant \u2019s allegation that ORG had reproached him for failing to undergo therapy , while the hospital considered him to be an erroneous admission . It held that in any event the root cause of the applicant \u2019s serious sexual crimes should be reappraised through therapy . In its view that would have been a requirement even if the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment . The applicant himself had to bear the consequences of his refusal to participate in any therapy as the hospital offered therapy in order to reappraise the causes of crime even for patients who had been placed in hospital erroneously .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for its consideration without giving any further reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to suspend the order for the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital and not to grant probation after obtaining an external expert opinion dated CARDINAL DATE and having heard the expert and the applicant \u2019s counsel . The expert , who had not examined the applicant in person due to his refusal to permit such examination , found that the applicant was suffering from a disturbance of his sexual preference in the form of sadism and that the commission of further crimes was to be expected . The applicant \u2019s appeal in this respect was dismissed by ORG . The proceedings before ORG are still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again decided not to suspend the order for the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital and not to grant probation after obtaining a written opinion from the ORG clinic in which the applicant has been detained and after hearing the applicant . The applicant \u2019s appeal in this respect was dismissed by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-a"]}
