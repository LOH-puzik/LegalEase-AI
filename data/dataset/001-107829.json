On DATE the President of the Land of GPE ( GPE ) appointed an administrator and indicated that the land , which had been sold under duress , fell within the scope of LAW ( Wiedergutmachungsgesetz ) of DATE . It was thus supposed to be returned to the former owners or to their heirs .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the restitution procedure was suspended , with a view to the amendment of LAW and to the systematic expropriation of the plots of land concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the administrator of the disputed property entered into a friendly settlement on behalf of the PERSON brothers with the widow and heir of PERSON , under which the latter would remain the owner of CARDINAL of the land and the PERSON brothers would obtain the remaining CARDINAL , whilst in return waiving any claims against PERSON", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the PERSON brothers challenged this friendly settlement , arguing that they had not been consulted .", "CARDINAL . After the death of PERSON , the CARDINAL of the property still owned by her was left to a community of heirs .", "CARDINAL . Under a notarially - registered agreement of DATE , CARDINAL of PERSON heirs sold an initial share in the joint property ( PERSON an PERSON ) to the applicant for MONEY ( ORG ) and a second share to another purchaser , PERSON , for the same amount . The agreement indicated that the applicant had been provided with a description of the events leading to the current property regime of the property in question ( \u201c wie es zu den momentanen Eigentumsverh\u00e4ltnissen gekommen ist \u201d ) and that this description covered the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was registered in the land register as a member of the community of joint owners .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL letters , of DATE and DATE , the heirs of the PERSON brothers sought the restitution of CARDINAL of the land in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the law on the resolution of outstanding property issues DATE LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber die GPE offener Verm\u00f6gensfragen - Verm\u00f6gensgesetz ) of CARDINAL DATE ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a notarially - registered agreement of CARDINAL DATE the heirs of the PERSON brothers sold CARDINAL of the disputed land for DM CARDINAL to Mrs T. The same agreement contained a clause indicating that the heirs of the PERSON brothers were also selling CARDINAL of the land for ORG CARDINAL under the condition precedent that they obtained its restitution ( the procedure was pending before the domestic authorities and courts \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant acquired a second share in joint ownership from PERSON , which was also registered in the land register on CARDINAL DATE . The ORG pointed out that the applicant had not provided evidence that he had paid for that acquisition , whereas the applicant indicated that the value of that second share had also amounted to ORG CARDINAL as stipulated in the initial agreement of DATE , and that he had acquired that share from PERSON in exchange for debts owed to him by the latter .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant alleged that , on account of the restitution of the disputed property , he had been unable to fulfil his undertakings under that agreement .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Amt f\u00fcr die PERSON ) of the town of GPE initially rejected the request by the heirs of the PERSON brothers , on the ground that the friendly settlement reached on DATE had ruled out any request for restitution . The heirs of the PERSON brothers challenged that decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG for ORG ) upheld their request and ordered the restitution of CARDINAL of the land . The ORG took the view that there was a presumption that the disputed land had been sold under duress in DATE , because the sale price had not been appropriate and it had not been established that the sale would have taken place without ORG \u201c rule \u201d . Moreover , restitution could not be ruled out , whether because of the friendly settlement reached in the former GPE under the pressure of forthcoming expropriations without the agreement of those concerned , or for any of the other reasons given in LAW , namely an acquisition in good faith at the time of the former GPE ( see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .

CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG , in all its aspects , relying on sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) taken together with CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see relevant domestic law and practice , LAW below ) . It explained that LAW had to be regarded as a law controlling the use of property within the meaning of the second paragraph of LAW No . CARDINAL , having the legitimate aim of ensuring reparation for the injustice committed against NORP citizens . Even supposing that the applicant had a possession within the meaning of that LAW , the relevant provisions of LAW had validly defined the scope of his property right ( zul\u00e4ssige LOC ) . He therefore had only a restricted right ( eingeschr\u00e4nkte PERSON ) . ORG concluded that restitution was not ruled out under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , because the applicant had not acquired title to its pecuniary value ( kein LOC ) and had acquired his share after the entry into force of LAW . Nor had he been able to dispose of ( verf\u00fcgen ) his property , and for that reason was simply registered in the land register as a member of the community of joint owners of the inherited estate .", "ORG did not give the applicant leave to appeal against that judgment or to lodge an application for review with ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision not to give him leave to lodge an application for review .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant filed a request for compensation under the Law of DATE on compensation in accordance with LAW ( Gesetz \u00fcber die Entsch\u00e4digung nach dem Verm\u00f6gensgesetz \u2013 Entsch\u00e4digungsgesetz \u2013 see relevant domestic law and practice , paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that procedure is still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW of DATE , which was also to be part of LAW ( Einigungsvertrag ) , came into force . Under LAW would remain in force in GPE after the reunification of the two GPE on DATE . The LAW \u2019s purpose was , in particular , to settle any conflicts relating to property on the territory of the GPE in a manner that was socially acceptable , in order to ensure long - term legal security in GPE .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that it is applicable to rights in respect of property that was expropriated at the time of the GPE and section CARDINAL ) provides that it also applicable to persons against whom proceedings were brought in GPE DATE and DATE on racist , political , religious or ideological grounds ( weltanschauliche GPE ) and who had consequently lost their property \u201c by forced sale , expropriation or other means \u201d . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW complement section CARDINAL .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that any property that became \u201c people \u2019s property \u201d will be returned on request unless excluded by the law . LAW ) provides that if a number of parties make a request for restitution concerning the same property , it is the party that was \u201c first \u201d injured which is thus entitled . That means that , as in the present case , when property was sold under duress during ORG period , then subsequently expropriated in the former GPE , the heirs of the original NORP owners have a priority right to restitution .", "Restitution is ruled out if it proves impossible in practice ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the Act ) or if the purchasers acquired the property in good faith DATE and DATE ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW ) . However , it is not excluded if , as in the present case , the acquisition took place after that date .", "Section PERSON ) , first sentence , of LAW provides that applications for restitution had to be lodged no later than DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the event of the property \u2019s restitution , section CARDINAL ) of LAW provides that consideration equivalent to the original sale price must be paid to the new purchasers . The conversion rate is DM CARDINAL for RM CARDINAL . In this connection , no distinction is made between the heirs of the initial purchaser in the National - Socialist era and a new purchaser , who , as in the present case , has more recently acquired joint - ownership shares from the community of heirs of the initial purchaser .", "Section CARDINALa(CARDINALb ) provides that the heirs of the initial purchaser or the new purchaser may also opt for the payment of compensation in accordance with LAW of DATE if the original sale price had been paid in reichsmarks ( RM ) in ORG era . The objective of this provision was to alleviate the effect of the devaluations resulting from CARDINAL changes of currency since that time . Only those persons who had acted in a manner contrary to the principles of humanity or who had abused their position in ORG era were to be excluded from the possibility of obtaining such compensation ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
