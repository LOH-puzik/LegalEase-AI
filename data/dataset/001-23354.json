THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and he lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr J. Mackenzie , a solicitor practising in PERSON - on - GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At the relevant time , the applicant was a Lance Corporal in ORG . On DATE he was arrested by the civilian police who alleged that he had been drunk and disorderly . He was taken by the police to his army barracks and handed over to the military authorities .", "On DATE he appeared before his commanding officer and was charged with drunkenness pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Army Act DATE ( an offence which carried a maximum potential sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ) .", "He subsequently appeared before that officer on CARDINAL and DATE and , on the latter date , he elected to be tried by court - martial as opposed to summary trial by his commanding officer . The commanding officer had the power to award a maximum of CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment on summary trial , although the Government submit that the commanding officer \u2019s sentence following a conviction for drunkenness would generally have been limited to a fine , a reprimand , \u201c a minor punishment \u201d or a reduction to the ranks .", "Having opted for trial by court - martial , on DATE the applicant \u2019s case was referred to a higher authority and , in turn , on CARDINAL DATE to ORG . On DATE this authority directed the applicant \u2019s trial by district court - martial .", "In DATE the district court - martial was fixed to begin in DATE . This trial date was postponed pending the outcome of an application by the applicant for leave to take judicial review proceedings concerning his legal aid . The judicial review application was heard in DATE and the court - martial was fixed for DATE , later moved to CARDINAL DATE at the applicant \u2019s request . The court - martial hearing was again re - fixed ( to allow DATE for the hearing ) for DATE . The applicant was legally represented .", "On that date and at the outset of the proceedings , the applicant applied for a stay of the proceedings claiming that the conduct of the prosecuting authorities amounted to an abuse of process . Having heard evidence over DATE , on DATE the Judge Advocate stayed the proceedings as an abuse of process . As to the meaning of abuse of process , he stated that :", "\u201c It is now clear law that the courts have a power to stay proceedings where the continuance of those proceedings against a defendant constitutes an abuse of the court \u2019s powers ... Put shortly , the court has a general and inherent power to protect its process from abuse . This power must include a power to safeguard an accused person from oppression or prejudice ... The power to stay proceedings for an abuse of process has been said to include a power to safeguard an accused person from oppression or prejudice ( PERSON ) , and has been described as a formidable safeguard , developed by the common law , to protect persons from being prosecuted in circumstances where it would be seriously unjust to do so ( Attorney - General of GPE and GPE v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL , PC ) . An abuse of process has been defined as \u201c something so unfair and wrong that the court should not allow a prosecutor to proceed with what is in all other respects a regular proceeding \u201d ( PERSON v. NORP [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. DATE , PC ) . \u201d", "The Judge Advocate found , in the first place , that the failure to disclose to the applicant video evidence of the incident leading to the applicant \u2019s arrest , when he appeared before his commanding officer on DATE , was a breach of the applicable rules of procedure of such magnitude as to render the proceedings void . Secondly , he found that , on the evidence , the applicant \u2019s election to be tried by court - martial had not been a free and valid one . As regards these CARDINAL matters the Judge Advocate concluded :", "\u201c True , there has been no illegality in the sense of a breach of the law , but there has been a very fundamental breach of the principles under which criminal justice is dispensed . True , [ the applicant ] has not had any other or more serious charge preferred against him , but he has had a long and no doubt anxious wait , undoubted expense and , more significantly , I could not guarantee that the court which has been ordered to try him would not punish him more severely than the [ commanding officer ] would have done if he was convicted .", "Furthermore , I can not ignore the collected impact of the conduct of [ the commanding and other officers ] , wittingly or unwittingly , in pressurising [ the applicant ] to accept the [ commanding officer \u2019s ] award and by inference his guilt . For DATE now the courts have fought strenuously to safeguard accused persons from being pressurised into pleading guilty and have rigorously excluded evidence obtained as a result of such pressure . These courts should not countenance service personnel being sent for trial as a result of such pressure . To do so would be to allow their process to be abused . It is for these reasons that I hold that the continuance of the proceedings against [ the applicant ] would be an abuse of process . \u201d", "Thirdly , the Judge Advocate found , as regards the fact that the prosecution had taken and served on the defence a statement from the applicant \u2019s defending officer :", "\u201c I accept that ... what happened in this case was no breach of legal privilege , if indeed , legal privilege attaches to a defending officer ... I accept that there was no substantial prejudice to the defence case . I accept that no one in the ORG Prosecuting Authority proper knew that [ he ] was the defending officer until much later ... I accept that identity would not have been an issue in the case . None of these things can have lessened the perception of [ the applicant ] as to the chances of justice from the military system when he became aware that his defending officer was to be called as a prosecution witness against him . It was an irregularity of such magnitude that in itself it justifies me in holding that the continuation of these proceedings would be an abuse of the process of this court . \u201d", "The Judge Advocate went on to recommend that the applicant \u2019s legal aid contributions and any other costs associated with the proceedings should be reimbursed to him .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings claiming damages against the civilian police and ORG for matters arising out of his arrest by the police and the conduct of the proceedings against him by the military authorities . The respective defences were filed in DATE . The proceedings against the police were later settled by the payment to the applicant of GBP CARDINAL in damages and costs . The current position as regards the proceedings against ORG is not known .", "All criminal courts , including courts - martial , have a wide common law jurisdiction to stay proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process . The application to stay proceedings is in the nature of a \u201c plea in bar \u201d , the more conventional \u201c pleas in bar \u201d being autrefois convict or autrefois acquit . A \u201c plea in bar \u201d operates to prevent a case proceeding to trial and , if raised , is ordinarily dealt with before the accused enters a plea to the charge .", "The ability of a trial judge to stay a criminal prosecution was first confirmed by ORG in the case of PERSON v. Director of Public Prosecutions [ DATE ] GPE CARDINAL . Lord PERSON acknowledged the ability of a criminal court \u201c to prevent a trial from taking place \u201d in the exercise of its \u201c residual discretion to prevent anything which savours of abuse of process \u201d ( at p. CARDINAL ) . In the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v. PERSON [ DATE ] DATE , Lord Salmon considered this discretion to be of \u201c great constitutional importance \u201d and a power which \u201c should be jealously preserved \u201d .", "Lord PERSON defined the discretion to stay proceedings as an abuse of process , in the case of Attorney - General of GPE and GPE v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL , as :", "\u201c ... a formidable safeguard to protect persons from being prosecuted in circumstances where it would be seriously unjust to do so \u201d .", "In PERSON R [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. DATE , Lord PERSON described an abuse of process as :", "\u201c ... something so unfair and wrong that the court should not allow a prosecutor to proceed with what is in all respects a regular proceeding \u201d .", "The broad basis of this jurisdiction was confirmed by ORG in NORP v. PERSON ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. DATE , where it was held that proceedings may be stayed not only where a fair trial is impossible , but also where it would be contrary to the public interest in the integrity of the criminal justice system that a trial should take place .", "The case law was summarised by ORG in PERSON DATE ] CARDINAL Cr . App . CARDINAL ( see Lord Justice PERSON , at p. CARDINALG-CARDINALA ) :", "\u201c The jurisdiction to stay can be exercised in many different circumstances . Nevertheless CARDINAL main strands can be detected in the authorities :", "( a ) NORP cases where the court concludes that the defendant can not receive a fair trial ;", "( b ) cases where the court concludes that it would be unfair for the defendant to be tried \u201d .", "Matters considered to constitute an abuse of process include :", "\u2013 unjustifiable delay which results in the defendant suffering serious prejudice to the extent that no fair trial can be held ;", "\u2013 the trial of a defendant after extensive and prejudicial pre - trial publicity ;", "\u2013 the trial of a defendant after the loss or destruction of relevant material by the prosecution ;", "\u2013 where it would be contrary to the public interest in the integrity of the criminal justice system that a trial should take place because the prosecution have been guilty of investigative impropriety ; and", "\u2013 where the prosecution have otherwise been guilty of manipulation or misuse of the process of the court .", "There is no right for the prosecution to appeal against an order for a stay of a ORG trial or court - martial proceedings on the ground of abuse of process . The intention behind such a stay is that there should not be a trial in the future .", "There is no possibility of lifting a stay where the stay has been granted on the grounds that , due to the unconscionable conduct of the prosecuting authorities and even though the accused could receive a fair trial , it would nonetheless be unfair for the accused to be tried . Such a case could not be re - opened since it would always be an abuse of process to try the accused .", "The applicant does not dispute the ORG \u2019s submission that there are no known cases where a stay made on the grounds of abuse of process has been lifted to allow a prosecution to continue or where the prosecution has even applied for such a stay to be lifted . In NORP v. ORG ex p. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , Lord Justice PERSON commented that a decision on an application to stay on grounds of abuse of process determines :", "\u201c ... whether there ever should be a trial ... [ A ] stay on grounds of abuse of process contemplates that there never will be a trial ... It matters not that there are circumstances in which a stay on grounds of abuse of process might be revoked or lifted : the crucial point is that such a stay -- a direction that there shall be no trial -- is intended to be final . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
