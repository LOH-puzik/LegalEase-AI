PORTUGAL", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Modesto Sequeira , is a NORP national born in DATE . He is currently being held at FAC ( GPE ) .", ".", "The applicant served a prison sentence in GPE DATE for drug trafficking . He returned to GPE on completion of his sentence but was placed in pre - trial detention in connection with other proceedings in DATE .", "During his detention in FAC , he met PERSON , who was allegedly linked to drug - trafficking circles . A. informed the applicant that he could supply him with transport , especially boats , should he decide to organise a drug - trafficking operation .", "Following his release in DATE , the applicant travelled to GPE , GPE and GPE , countries in which he claims to have had business dealings ( property sales and meat exports ) .", "The applicant returned to GPE in DATE . He then resumed contact with A. , who had been released in the meantime .", "According to the facts established by ORG in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see below ) , subsequent events were as follows .", "In DATE the applicant asked PERSON to find a boat so that he could import a substantial quantity of cocaine from GPE . The applicant and PERSON travelled to GPE DATE in order to finalise the details of the cocaine shipment .", "PERSON contacted ORG , the owner of a boat , with a view to arranging for the drugs to be transported to GPE . It emerges from the case file that C. had already collaborated on several occasions with the criminal - investigation department in drug - trafficking cases . He persuaded PERSON to collaborate with the police too . The applicant was unaware of this . The criminal - investigation department and the public prosecutor 's office were informed .", "A. introduced ORG to the applicant in DATE . The latter paid PERSON an unspecified sum of money as remuneration for his services .", "At DATE C. 's boat , on which A. and an undercover member of the criminal - investigation department were also present , took delivery of a consignment of drugs from another boat off the coast of GPE . C. then sailed the boat to the NORP port of PERSON , where the drugs were unloaded and stored in a warehouse .", "On DATE transported the drugs by car to a farm in ORG that the applicant had purchased in the meantime . The drugs were unloaded and stored in the farm . After A.

The court established the facts of the case primarily on the basis of statements by A. and C. and the members of the criminal - investigation department who had taken part in the operation . All of these witnesses appeared at the trial . The court also based its decision on documents found in the applicant 's possession , containing several names and telephone numbers and a list of sums of money . With regard to the applicant 's allegations that he had been the subject of incitement , the court emphasised that A. and C. had not acted as agents provocateurs but as undercover agents . According to the court , their activities had been confined to informing the criminal - investigation department of the operation 's progress and they had never incited the applicant to commit an offence that would not otherwise have been committed .", "The applicant appealed against this judgment to ORG . In a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's submission concerning PERSON 's and C. 's conduct . Referring to PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-IV , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , ORG emphasised that A. and C. had acted as undercover agents and not as agents provocateurs , and that the evidence in issue was therefore admissible . It did however quash the applicant 's conviction on the charge of criminal association and reduced his sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "The applicant appealed on points of law . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the submission concerning PERSON 's and C. 's conduct . Like the lower courts , ORG held that they had acted as undercover agents and not as agents provocateursnotably the undercover agents ' intervention , warranted a reduction of the applicant 's sentence to DATE imprisonment .", "The applicant then requested clarification ( aclara\u00e7\u00e3o ) of this judgment in respect of the distinction between undercover agents and agents provocateurs . However , ORG , in a judgment of DATE , dismissed this request , holding that there was nothing to be clarified .", "The prevention of drug trafficking is governed by Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , as amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "Article CARDINAL of this legislative decree provides that a criminal investigation agent or a third party acting under the supervision of the criminal - investigation department who , in the course of preliminary inquiries and without revealing his identity , accepts an offer for or transports narcotics or other psychotropic substances shall not be liable to prosecution in respect of such conduct . These persons ' actions require authorisation from the relevant judicial body , to which they must report .", "LAW states :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Evidence obtained through torture , the use of force or any kind of physical or psychological duress shall be invalid and inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Evidence obtained by any of the following means shall be deemed to have been obtained by physical or psychological duress even where the victim has consented thereto :", "( a ) ill - treatment , assault , any other method , hypnosis , cruelty or deceit that vitiates free will or freedom of choice ;", "...", "CARDINAL . Where evidence is obtained by means that constitute a serious criminal offence under LAW , it may be used only for the purpose of prosecuting those responsible for obtaining it in that way . \u201d", "PERSON , cited above , contains the following description of the current NORP case - law and legal theory in this matter ( p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE :", "\u201c Subject to certain conditions , ORG accepts the use of ' infiltrators ' in the fight against drug trafficking ( judgments of DATE , ORG no . CARDINAL , p.

The former is someone who confines himself to gathering information , whereas the latter is someone who actually incites people to commit a criminal offence . In GPE , under the law in force at the material time , legal experts regarded evidence obtained by ' undercover agents ' as admissible , but were more reserved about evidence obtained by ' agents provocateurs ' ( see , for example , PERSON , ORG as proibi\u00e7\u00f5es de prova em processo p\u00e8nal , ORG , DATE , pp .
