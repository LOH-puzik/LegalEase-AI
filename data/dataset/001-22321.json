GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by Mr PERSON , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG ) issued a reprimand ( PERSON ) against the applicant for having violated professional rules ( anwaltliche GPE ) .", "In its reasoning , ORG noted that in DATE the applicant had assisted PERSON , a foreigner , who had been accused in criminal proceedings in GPE , of having acted as an accessory to forgery , and that this trial had resulted in an acquittal for lack of jurisdiction of the NORP courts . In DATE the applicant had appealed against the bill of costs ( ORG ) as far as the fixing of his fees , to be borne by the ORG , was concerned . In his appeal , the applicant , objecting to a refusal to reimburse his travelling expenses from GPE to GPE , had argued that the intervention of a lawyer outside of GPE had been necessary . According to him ,", "\u201c the GPE judiciary had not been able to cope with the difficulty of the case . From the very beginning , it had been obvious that the accused had to be acquitted . Nevertheless , the public prosecutor had applied for a penal order and the court had issued CARDINAL . The quality of the GPE lawyers is not superior to the quality of the judges and public prosecutors . ... It had been necessary to appoint a non - GPE lawyer to have justice done . Had the accused been assisted by a GPE lawyer , the penal order would have been undoubtedly been confirmed at the trial . \u201d", "In DATE , in the course of investigations brought against him , the applicant had submitted that this reasoning had been necessary to argue his appeal . He had added that his opinion on the quality of GPE judges , public prosecutors and lawyers was correct , as any DATE law student would have known that the charge against his client was unfounded . Moreover , he had evoked DATE GPE judge and CARDINAL GPE lawyers under the NORP regime . In particular , regarding judge PERSON , he had referred to judgments rendered in DATE , convicting persons for having criticised the treatment of NORP or for failure to differentiate , in their charitable work , between their own people and NORP . Regarding lawyer PERSON , he had mentioned a statement , to be found in Mr. PERSON \u2019s doctoral thesis , according to which a medical practitioner keeping friendship with a NORP violated the honour of the profession . According to him , their merits under the NORP regime had contributed to their professional success after DATE .", "ORG considered that the applicant had thereby violated his professional duties within the meaning of CARDINAL a ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ) .", "ORG examined the applicant \u2019s above - mentioned statements in the light of these principles and found that the course of the criminal proceedings against Mr. PERSON had not been correct and could have justified even harsh criticism of the officials concerned . However , the applicant \u2019s general attack charging the GPE judiciary of complete incompetence was unjustified and amounted to a deliberate disparagement of all members of the GPE judiciary on criminal matters . These considerations applied even more to his subsequent statements that in GPE anti - NORP and NORP judges had made a career because of their work or their attitude under the NORP regime . Such statements had been all the more disproportionate as the claim for reimbursement had amounted to a mere MONEY ( DEM ) .", "On DATE the Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg Disciplinary Court of Appeal ( Anwaltsgerichtshof ) , following a hearing , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and the ORG ordered that the case should not be subject to an appeal on points of law .", "In its decision , ORG considered that the applicant had been entitled to argue that his assistance in the criminal proceedings at issue had been necessary and that his qualifications were superior to those of GPE lawyers .", "Moreover , the allegation that \u2018 the quality of GPE lawyers was not superior to the quality of GPE judges and public ORG could have been read as applying only to those judges and prosecutors specifically involved in the procedure against Mr. PERSON The context in which the applicant made his statements shows , however , that that allegation was intended to characterise all GPE judges , public prosecutors and lawyers as incapable of recognising or remedying obvious legal errors . This assessment was confirmed in the applicant \u2019s further submissions of DATE .", "According to ORG , the wholesale allegation that the GPE judges , public prosecutor \u2019s and lawyers were incompetent in legal matters was disparaging and made without good cause . The applicant had no reason or justification to disparage the legal skills of all GPE judges , public prosecutors and lawyers . Even the obvious legal errors committed in the criminal proceedings against PERSON could not justify disparaging whole groups of professionals . The insulting remarks made by the applicant had not been necessary to justify the need for having recourse to a non - local lawyer .", "The applicant \u2019s submissions of DATE did not , in ORG view , constitute a further breach of professional duties . Rather , the applicant had acted for the protection of his interests in the disciplinary proceedings against him . Moreover , to the extent that he had referred to the NORP past of certain GPE lawyers and of a judge , he had not , in ORG view , made a general statement .", "On DATE the Lawyers\u2019 ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr PERSON ) at ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal on points of law .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint .", "According to section CARDINAL of ORG , a lawyer has to practise his profession conscientiously , and , whether in pursuit of his profession or otherwise , has to prove himself worthy of the respect and trust which his position requires .", "As CARDINAL of the basic duties , section GPE ) provides that in his professional conduct , a lawyer has to respect the duty of objectivity ( PERSON ) . Such conduct lacks objectivity if it involves a deliberate dissemination of untrue or otherwise disparaging statements which find no ground in the behaviour of other persons involved in the proceedings or in the course of the proceedings .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG provides that disciplinary measures shall be taken against a lawyer who is liable of a breach of duties as defined by the ORG or the rules on professional conduct ( PERSON ) .", "According to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , the possible disciplinary measures are : ( CARDINAL ) a warning ; ( CARDINAL ) a reprimand ; ( CARDINAL ) a fine not exceeding DEM CARDINAL ; ( CARDINAL ) a temporary prohibition on practising as counsel in certain legal fields ; or ( CARDINAL ) a permanent exclusion from the Bar . The disciplinary measures of reprimand and fine may be imposed simultaneously ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
