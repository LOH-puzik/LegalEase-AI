De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was admitted to the Bar . She signed an oath \u201c to be faithful to GPE , to observe its LAW and laws , to honestly perform her duties as an advocate ( a lawyer who has been admitted to the Bar ( advokatas ) ) , to observe moral norms , citizen \u2019s rights and freedoms , and to protect professional secrets \u201d . DATE the applicant registered a law office in her name , and started practising law .", "CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s request her name was taken of the list of practising advocates on DATE . As noted by the civil courts afterwards , the applicant had acknowledged that her request had been made owing to the fact that a criminal case had been pending against her ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was found guilty of forgery of documents ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) and fraud ( LAW ) . The court established that while pursuing her professional practice , the applicant had on CARDINAL occasions falsely claimed in writing that she had provided legal services within the framework of the ORG - paid legal - aid scheme . In addition , the court found that the applicant had forged the signatures of pre - trial - investigation officers on the above documents , submitted them to court officials to receive payment and thereby obtained payment . The crimes she had committed fell into the category of minor intentional crimes ( nesunkus ty\u010dinis nusikaltimas ) , because the maximum possible sanction for them was DATE of deprivation of liberty ( LAW of LAW ) . In the applicant \u2019s case , as a sanction , she was ordered to pay a fine , which she did on DATE . Her conviction expired DATE after she had paid the fine , that is to say on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to readmit her to the Bar .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request , inter alia , on the grounds that the applicant did not have high moral character ( nepriekai\u0161tinga reputacija ) . Given that DATE and DATE had passed since the applicant \u2019s conviction , and taking into account the nature of the applicant \u2019s criminal offence \u2013 misappropriation of property for non - existent legal services \u2013 as well as the specifics of the professional practice of an advocate , it was reasonable to conclude that the applicant had not regained high moral character within such a short time frame , to meet the requirements set out in Articles QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the PERSON on the Bar ( see paragraph QUANTITY below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged this decision before ORG . On DATE the court heard the applicant \u2019s case . CARDINAL witnesses were questioned in court as to the applicant \u2019s reputation ; most of them testified to having known the applicant before DATE , when she had been working at ORG . The court partly annulled ORG decision and ordered the latter to reconsider the applicant \u2019s request to be readmitted to the Bar . The court noted that the applicant had been convicted of a minor intentional crime . On DATE when the applicant had submitted the request to be readmitted to the Bar , her conviction had expired . Consequently , and relying on LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG found that ORG had erred in finding that the applicant had not met the high - moral - character criterion .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed . It pointed out that the applicant was not of high moral character as she failed to meet the criteria listed in LAW Refusal to readmit the applicant to the Bar had been based on an evaluation of the nature of actions for which she had been convicted .", "CARDINAL . In her defence , the applicant submitted to the appellate court a character reference from a managing director of a private company , where the applicant had worked as marketing director . The reference stated that the applicant performed her duties well ; and that she was responsible and had a sense of initiative . As shown from the summary of her arguments by ORG , the applicant did not plead that reputation related restrictions on her practising law as an advocate had been more severe than those applied to other law - related professions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed ORG appeal and quashed the first - instance court \u2019s decision . As to the question of high moral character , ORG underlined that higher standards were applicable to advocates , as only persons of untainted reputation could participate in the justice system without discrediting it . Therefore , when evaluating an advocate \u2019s conduct it was not sufficient to have regard only to whether the person obeyed the law . It was also pertinent to see a person \u2019s behaviour in the context of the legal norms that regulate the ethics of the advocates\u2019 profession . In this connection LAW underlined that an advocate should observe legal and moral duties ( point CARDINAL . ) , should not discredit advocate \u2019s name , the oath he or she swore or the ideal of justice ( point CARDINAL . ) . An advocate also had duties set out in the LAW , the LAW on the Bar and LAW ( point DATE ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG concurred with the first - instance court \u2019s finding that the term of the applicant \u2019s conviction had expired and that therefore she could not be reproached under LAW ) of the LAW on the Bar . Nonetheless , taking into account the fact that she had committed the criminal offence in the course of her professional practice and that her professional practice had been aimed at committing crimes , of which there were CARDINAL counts , it was reasonable to conclude that the applicant \u2019s behaviour did not meet the criteria set out in DATE ) of the PERSON on the Bar . That the conviction had expired did not mean ipso facto that the applicant had regained an irreproachable reputation within the meaning of LAW ) of that PERSON . For the appellate court , insufficient time had passed from the date when the applicant had committed the crime to when she had asked ORG to readmit her to the Bar .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court also noted that a person could submit a request to be admitted to the Bar and to prove that he or she had regained high moral character . However , it was then for the court to establish , of its own motion , whether sufficient time had passed for a person \u2019s rehabilitation to be objectively validated . A person who claimed to have regained high moral character should bring clear and persuasive evidence that he or she had been following the ethical and disciplinary rules . It was then for the court to examine what the nature of the infringements of law was , what personal situation had led to the infringements being committed , and whether those factors still applied . In the present case , despite DATE having passed since the date the crime had been committed , there was still no sufficient basis to conclude that the applicant was of high moral character within the meaning of LAW ) of the PERSON on the Bar .", "CARDINAL . ORG lastly dismissed certain arguments by the applicant that the lower court had erred when interpreting some other legal norms unrelated to the matter of the applicant \u2019s reputation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . She raised a number of arguments about the Bar qualification exam and professional reputation , without maintaining that the criminal conviction had placed her in a worse situation than representatives of other law - related professions .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , and left the Court of Appeal decision unchanged . On the question of reputation , ORG noted its practice to the effect that no breach of law ( joks nusi\u017eengimas ) was too serious to unconditionally preclude an individual from ever asking to be reinstated to the Bar ( ORG referred to its earlier ruling in case no . CARDINALK-CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG then held that the expiry of a conviction for a minor intentional crime , as it was indicated in DATE ) of the PERSON on the Bar , was only one of the criteria when considering the question of a person \u2019s reputation . Moreover , LAW ) of that PERSON read that a person should meet the criteria of ethics applicable to advocates . Under point CARDINAL of the Code of Professional Ethics for Advocates , advocates were involved in the implementation of justice . The professional practice of an advocate required him or her to carry out his or her duties and obligations towards clients , the courts , the advocate \u2019s profession and society . Moreover , an advocate should never discredit the name of the profession , the oath he or she swore and the ideal of justice . On the facts of the applicant \u2019s case , ORG therefore had been correct in finding that the applicant had not proven that she had regained high moral character , in particular given the nature of the criminal acts she had committed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
