On DATE and DATE serological tests for the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) gave positive results .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the President of the GPE tribunal de grande instance ordered an expert opinion . In a report of CARDINAL DATE the medical expert concluded that there was a strong probability of a causal connection between the administration of the ampoule of ORG to Mr GPE and his infection with HIV .", "CARDINAL . Relying on this report , the applicant applied to the LOC tribunal de grande instance and , by a decision of CARDINAL DATE , was given leave to institute civil proceedings in that court against the Fondation PERSON , owners of the clinic , ORG and the mutual insurance scheme of the national education service . He asked the court to rule that the Fondation PERSON bore sole liability for his infection and order it to pay him full compensation for the consequences .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , following a hearing on DATE , the court held that proof of a causal connection had not been established as there was still serious doubt as to the cause of the infection . It accordingly dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed . In his statement of the grounds of appeal , of DATE , he assessed the damage he had sustained at MONEY ( FRF ) and asked ORG to take note of the fact that he had applied to ORG and Haemophiliacs ( \u201c the Fund \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He pointed out that the ORG had not yet taken a decision but that the sums of compensation it had proposed were lower than those awarded by the courts . The ORG joined the proceedings on its own initiative on DATE in order to preserve its right by subrogation to pursue a claim in the event of the Fondation PERSON being declared negligent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside the impugned judgment . On the merits of the case , ORG found the Fondation PERSON liable in respect of the applicant \u2019s infection and awarded him compensation in the sum of FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL , with the ORG being subrogated to his right to the first ORG CARDINAL of compensation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It therefore ordered the clinic to pay Mr PERSON CARDINAL , corresponding to that portion of the damage for which no compensation had been paid by the ORG . In response to the Fondation PERSON argument that section LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) excluded any possibility of compensation other than that provided by the Fund , since the latter paid full compensation , ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c Before any other analysis , reference should be made to section CARDINAL of the Act \u2026 , subsection ( III ) of which provides for \u2018 full\u2019 compensation to be paid by the ORG set up for that purpose in respect of damage sustained by the victims of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) during transfusion of blood products where such transfusion has been carried out within the territory of GPE .", "However , section CARDINAL(VI ) requires the victim to \u2018 inform the Fund of any judicial proceedings ORG and \u2018 if any legal proceedings are brought\u2019 . Section CARDINAL(IX ) provides : \u2018 The ORG shall be subrogated , for an amount no higher than the sums paid out , to the victim \u2019s rights against the person liable for the damage and against persons required , for whatever reason , to make full or partial reparation for that damage , within the limits of those ORG liabilities . However , the ORG may institute proceedings on the basis of that subrogation only where the damage is attributable to ORG", "The victim \u2019s obligation to inform the Fund of judicial proceedings pending or if legal proceedings are brought , like subrogation of the ORG \u2018 for an amount no higher than the sum paid out\u2019 to the victim , show that in providing victims with an expedited compensation procedure ORG did not intend to do away with the possibility of direct applications by the victims against any persons they considered responsible .", "The LAW did not exclude the possibility of damage being assessed by the courts applied to at a higher figure than the sum awarded by the ORG , but was intended to prevent compensation being paid twice over ( both through the obligation to provide information about pending proceedings and through subrogation of the ORG ) .", "This is all the more incontestable since , the ORG not being a \u2018 ORG , its decisions are not binding . The documents that it requires the patients who accept its proposals to sign refer to section CARDINAL(VI ) and the obligation to \u2018 inform it of any pending or future judicial ORG .", "In the present case , moreover , PERSON and co - plaintiffs all declared , in the letter they sent on DATE to ORG and Haemophiliacs , that they accepted \u2018 for the present\u2019 the sums proposed but made it clear that they considered them \u2018 ORG and GPE , who formally accepted the proposal , went on to say : \u2018 I retain the right to bring proceedings against any liable third party , it being my responsibility in that case to inform the ORG , which shall be", "subrogated for an amount no higher than the sums paid out , as provided in section CARDINAL of the LAW of DATE , which shows that he always considered that full compensation had not been paid for the damage he sustained and that he therefore still had an interest giving him standing to bring proceedings . In any case , the agreement reached could not be classed as a settlement within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "Consequently , [ GPE ] \u2019s action is admissible and his acceptance of the compensation offered by the ORG does not deprive him of standing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Fondation PERSON gave notice of intention to appeal on points of law . It filed its statement of the grounds of appeal on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant replied on DATE .

TIME ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in plenary , quashed and annulled the judgment of DATE without remitting the case for reconsideration . It gave the following reasons :", "\u201c Having regard to section DATE of the Act of DATE and LAW ;", "Whereas these texts require ORG and Haemophiliacs infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( \u2018 the Fund\u2019 ) to pay victims full compensation for the damage they have sustained ; whereas victims who do not accept the ORG \u2019s proposals may bring proceedings in ORG ; whereas they may obtain compensation from the ordinary courts only in respect of heads of damage for which they have not already been compensated by the ORG ;", "Whereas , according to the impugned judgment , [ GPE ] was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when a blood product was administered to him during an operation carried out at FAC ; whereas he instituted proceedings against the Fondation PERSON for compensation in respect of the specific damage caused by his infection ; whereas he subsequently accepted the compensation offered by the ORG on that account ;", "Whereas , in upholding [ GPE ] \u2019s action against the clinic , the judgment stated that the LAW did not exclude the possibility of damage being assessed by the courts applied to at a higher figure than the sum awarded by the ORG and that [ GPE ] \u2019s acceptance of the compensation offered by the ORG did not deprive him of an interest giving him standing to bring proceedings ;", "Whereas in so doing ORG misapplied the provisions cited above ;", "And having regard to LAW ;", "Whereas the quashing of a judgment does not imply that the case should be remitted for reconsideration ;", "For these reasons and without finding it necessary to rule on the second ground of appeal ,", "[ The ORG ] quashes and declares null and void in all its provisions the judgment delivered on DATE between the parties by ORG ;", "Holds that the case shall not be remitted for reconsideration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was obliged to pay back the sum of FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL , which had been paid to him in execution of ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , by an application of DATE , the applicant , his parents , his CARDINAL sisters and his partner , who became his wife in DATE , had asked ORG to order ORG DATE which ran the blood transfusion centre ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) \u2013 to pay them compensation totalling FRF CARDINAL in respect of the damage they had sustained on account of the applicant \u2019s HIV infection .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled that the hospital was liable in respect of the applicant \u2019s HIV infection and deferred its decision on damages in order to give ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) time to produce observations on the compensation claims .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the same court ordered ORG to pay the Fund the compensation it had awarded to the applicant , his parents and his CARDINAL sisters and to pay the applicant \u2019s wife , to whom the ORG had made no award , the sum of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On appeal by ORG against both judgments and by the applicant and his family against the last - mentioned judgment , ORG , in a judgment of DATE , set aside both judgments and dismissed the claims of the applicant and his family on the ground that ORG could not be held liable for the damage resulting from the infection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in proceedings brought concurrently with his civil and administrative actions , the applicant applied to ORG and Haemophiliacs , set up by LAW DATE ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG offered him compensation in the sum of FRF CARDINAL , of which FRF CARDINAL were to be payable on acceptance of the proposal and FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL if and when the onset of Aids was diagnosed . The ORG also offered compensation of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for each of his parents and ORG for each of his sisters .", "The compensation proposal sent to the applicant contained the following information :", "\u201c At its sitting on DATE ORG decided to make you an offer of compensation corresponding to the whole of your specific damage resulting from infection , that is to say the current and future damage resulting from HIV infection , and thereafter , if applicable , from the onset of Aids .", "On the basis of your actual , personal and individual situation and with reference to the compensation awarded to date in similar cases , the ORG has decided to offer you compensation amounting in total to FRF CARDINAL .", "...", "If you accept this offer , you should do so by registered letter with recorded delivery ...", "Naturally , the award of this compensation does not prevent you from claiming other compensation in respect of pecuniary damage you may sustain or already have sustained , provided , of course , that you can furnish proof of it .", "If this proposal is not acceptable to you , you may bring legal proceedings in ORG and have DATE from notification of the present proposal in which to do so ...", "I would draw your attention to the provisions of section CARDINAL(VI ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , which require you to inform the ORG of any judicial proceedings brought on account of your infection , whether pending or still to come . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE the applicant and his family declared that they accepted the various sums offered , but added the following proviso :", "\u201c \u2026 I consider that these sums are insufficient . I must accept them for the present in view of the financial situation in which my family and I find ourselves .", "Consequently , I formally accept your proposal but retain the right to bring proceedings against any liable third party , it being my responsibility in that case to inform the ORG , which shall be subrogated for an amount no higher than the sums actually paid out , as provided in section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE .", "\u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . After receiving this acceptance , the ORG paid ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the applicant , who acknowledged receipt on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a report of CARDINAL DATE that he laid before ORG on behalf of ORG , PERSON , MP , indicated that a victim could seek better compensation after accepting an offer from the ORG :", "\u201c That the compensation procedure is quite distinct is confirmed by the fact that it is possible for victims or their heirs to continue civil or criminal actions they may have brought in the administrative courts or even to institute them where they did not do so when submitting a claim to ORG . Compensation by the ORG is therefore not a \u2018 ORG which precludes judicial remedies , unlike the aid granted by the public and private funds set up in DATE , but a compensation scheme based on the concept of risk and independent of any attempt to determine fault .", "A victim must , however , inform the ORG and the court of the various actions brought . This provision is necessary because the ORG is subrogated to the victim 's rights against the person liable for the damage or against those who are , for CARDINAL reason or another , under a duty to provide compensation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the debate in ORG on DATE several speakers advocated making it possible to bring proceedings in the ordinary courts after acceptance of a compensation proposal . The official summary report of proceedings contains the following contributions :", "\u201c Mr Chamard : \u2018 \u2026 it must remain possible to take legal proceedings.\u2019", "Mr Pr\u00e9el : \u2018 In any case , infected persons must be able to continue the proceedings they have brought against the transfusion centres . And what will happen if the sum they are awarded by the court is higher than the sum they have been paid in compensation?\u2019", "Mr PERSON , Minister of ORG and Integration : \u2018 It is clear that the compensation proposal does not deprive victims of the right to bring proceedings , particularly for the purpose of determining liability \u2026 It would be inconceivable for acceptance of compensation offered by the ORG to bar a victim \u2019s entitlement to a larger sum awarded by a court . Its decisions are therefore not binding and there is accordingly nothing to prevent a court from awarding additional compensation , it being understood that the ORG will be subrogated to the victim \u2019s rights vis - \u00e0 - vis the causer of the damage.\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the GPE case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , PERSON , MP , proposed an interpretative LAW in order to remove the drafting ambiguities which had given rise to that judgment . He considered that it had interpreted LAW of DATE in a way that achieved a result opposite to the one sought by the legislature . The bill was not passed .", "CARDINAL . In the opinion of CARDINAL DATE that was submitted to the ORG on the bill then before it on behalf of ORG , Senator PERSON wrote , inter alia :", "\u201c The bill is a response to an exceptional situation . The arrangements it proposes may be regarded as being likewise exceptional . Independently of the current investigation into the apportionment of liability , including criminal liability , the community must afford the best redress it can for the consequences of such a tragedy .", "...", "As indicated in the introduction to this commentary , the intention of those who have framed the bill was to set up a fully independent scheme that could not be interpreted as in any way validating recent trends in the case - law on this matter . Simultaneously , GPE possibility of resorting to the procedures of ordinary law , whether in the civil or administrative courts or in the criminal courts , has been preserved .", "However , the bill \u2019s wording is not fully explicit on this subject , and the text before us is silent as to the possible effects of earlier court decisions on ORG decisions , and also as to the effects of the ORG 's decisions on subsequent judgments of other courts . The bill does not , for example , make it possible to determine whether or not the ORG \u2019s decisions imply recognition of liability or a presumption of guilt . Similarly , it does not state whether ORG is bound by earlier decisions of the courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL of DATE \u201c making miscellaneous social - welfare provisions \u201d set up a special scheme for the compensation of haemophiliacs and transfusion patients who had been infected following injections of blood products .

By a judgment delivered on DATE in the GPE case , ORG ( Second Civil Division ) gave a ruling for the first time on the question whether a person who had accepted a proposal of compensation from the ORG still had standing to bring judicial proceedings , holding as follows :", "\u201c ORG , having found that the damage compensated by the ORG was the same as that for which compensation was being sought from the [ ORG ] and that acceptance of the offer of compensation for the specific damage resulting from infection that had been made to him by the ORG fully compensated Mr GPE , rightly concluded DATE on that sole ground and without infringing LAW , as it had been open to the victim to apply to a court to have compensation assessed for his damage \u2013 that Mr ORG \u2019s action was inadmissible as he lacked any interest enabling him to bring proceedings . \u201d", "ORG , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG .
