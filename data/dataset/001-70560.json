It produces and sells beer under the brand name \u201c Budweiser \u201d in a number of countries around the world .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company applied to ORG ( PERSON ) to register \u201c Budweiser \u201d as a trade mark on the industrial - property register . The PERSON did not grant the application immediately because it was opposed by a company incorporated in GPE , PERSON , which had already registered \u201c Budweiser Bier \u201d as an appellation of origin .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant company , negotiations then took place between it and PERSON concerning the use of the \u201c Budweiser \u201d trade mark . As the parties could not come to an agreement , the applicant company applied to ORG on DATE for an order cancelling PERSON registration . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which became final , ORG granted that application on the ground that the product to which the registration referred , namely the beer known as \u201c Budweiser Bier \u201d , did not have the requiriste characteristics to be considered an appellation of origin or indication of source . The registration was therefore cancelled .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE , which was published on CARDINAL DATE , the ORG registered the \u201c Budweiser \u201d trade mark in the applicant company \u2019s name , despite a prior objection by PERSON . On DATE PERSON appealed to ORG against the PERSON \u2019s decision on the strength of an agreement between ORG and the NORP GPE for the protection of indications of source , appellations of origin and other geographical and similar designations ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) , which was signed in GPE on DATE and entered into force on DATE after publication in ORG . In accordance with the law , the applicant company was invited by the court to take part in the proceedings as an interested party .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG Instance dismissed the application . It found that the only intellectual property eligible for protection under NORP law was the appellation of origin \u201c Ceskebudejovicky Budvar \u201d , not the trade mark \u201c Budweiser \u201d . In addition , it found that there was no risk of confusion between that appellation of origin and the applicant company \u2019s trade mark , which the vast majority of consumers tended to identify as an NORP beer .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed against that decision to ORG . In a judgment of DATE , ORG overturned the impugned judgment and ordered the PERSON to refuse to register \u201c Budweiser \u201d as a trade mark , as it considered that such a registration would infringe LAW and , consequently , LAW CARDINAL ( j ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed on points of law to ORG , alleging inter alia that the impugned decision contravened the agreement of DATE on ORG ( \u201c the TRIPs Agreement \u201d ) , which establishes the rule that registration confers priority , and in particular LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of that agreement . The applicant company also alleged that , in any event , the protected appellation of origin \u201c PERSON \u201d did not correspond to the NORP expression \u201c Budweiser \u201d , so that LAW could not be used to challenge its application for registration . Even supposing , however , that the NORP expression \u201c Budweiser \u201d were an accurate translation of the NORP appellation of origin , the applicant argued that LAW applied only to translations between NORP and NORP , not into any other languages . It submitted , lastly , that a formal defect in LAW made it unconstitutional , as it had been adopted by the Government , not ORG , in breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW governing parliamentary sovereignty .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which came to the applicant company \u2019s knowledge on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law .", "With regard to ORG , ORG began by noting that the provision of that agreement relied on by the applicant company required it to have acted in good faith . However , the applicant company had not indicated in its application for registration any factual element that demonstrated its good faith . In any event , ORG noted that by virtue of DATE of ORG , it had not become binding under NORP law until DATE , that is to say after LAW had entered into force . ORG could not , therefore , take precedence over LAW .", "As regards the interpretation of LAW , ORG considered it undeniable that the CARDINAL contracting States had intended by that agreement to protect , through reciprocal arrangements , their respective national products , including in circumstances in which a translation of the names concerned was used . The appellation of origin \u201c PERSON \u201d , which translated into NORP as \u201c PERSON \u201d or \u201c NORP \u201d , indicated a product from the \u010cesk\u00e9 GPE region in GPE . It was therefore protected by LAW .", "Lastly , the procedure whereby the ORG had been adopted did not contravene Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , since it did not concern a sphere that was within the exclusive competence of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The agreement was signed in GPE in DATE and came into force on DATE .
