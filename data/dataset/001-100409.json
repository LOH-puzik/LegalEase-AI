He presented a detailed legal analysis of the case and an explanation why he considered that legal grounds for a cassation appeal did not obtain . He further an appeal , having been served with the judgment after the time - limit for its submission had already expired .", "CARDINAL . Legal aid can be granted under section CARDINAL read together with section CARDINAL of the Act on Procedure before ORG if a party to the proceedings demonstrates that he or she is unable to cover the relevant costs and the case has no prospects of success whatsoever . A decision on the request to grant legal aid can be issued either by the court or by an official from the court registry . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Act , a grant of legal aid covers exemption from court fees and the appointment of a qualified representative . A representative is assigned to the case by a subsequent decision of the local ORG or other relevant professional organisation .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Act on Procedure before ORG provides that a cassation appeal can be lodged against a judgment of the regional administrative court .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL , a cassation appeal should be prepared and lodged with the court by an advocate , legal counsel , a tax adviser or a patent agent . An appeal brought by a party him- or herself shall be rejected . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , the DATE time - limit for lodging a cassation appeal with ORG starts to run on DATE on which a judgment of ORG , together with its written grounds , has been served on the party concerned or his or her representative , if the party is legally represented .", "CARDINAL .

Under section CARDINAL , this step shall be performed simultaneously with the act of lodging the request for leave and within DATE from the removal of the impediment which had prevented the party from taking this step .", "CARDINAL . In a number of decisions the administrative courts have held that the running of the time - limit for lodging a cassation appeal is not affected in any way by a request for legal aid and its subsequent grant . The time - limit starts to run on the date when the party was served with the decision of the regional administrative court with its written grounds . They referred to what they considered to be the established case - law of ORG ( ORG decision , PERSON referred to as NSA \u2013 see decisions ORG , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , II OZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; II OZ CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ; ORG , ORG / Ol CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "In its decision no . II FZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ORG held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the timelimit by a legally - aided applicant could be admitted for examination .", "CARDINAL . When legal aid has been granted and the time - limit for the submission of a cassation appeal has already expired , it is open to the legally - aided party to submit the appeal together with a request for leave to appeal out of time made under sections DATE and CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Procedure before Administrative Courts ( e.g. ORG FZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE and ORG , I CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) . In certain cases the courts stated that such a request should be submitted within DATE from the date on which the lawyer obtained a power of attorney from the party , which date is considered as the date on which the impediment to lodging an appeal ceased to exist ( e.g. ORG , PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) , or from the date when the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file ( e.g. the ORG , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a number of its recent decisions ORG acknowledged the difficulties which legally - aided parties experienced in connection with lodging their cassation appeals against judgments of the first - instance administrative courts . It expressed the view that they should not be penalised for the fact that their requests for legal aid were not processed speedily enough . It analysed relevant case - law of the administrative courts and noted that the manner in which DATE limit for lodging cassation appeals was determined had led to divergent results . It held that it was necessary to determine that moment in a manner compatible with the effective access to the highest administrative court and equal for parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legal - aid scheme and by privately hired lawyers . The court held that the time - limit for a legally - aided party started to run only on DATE when a legal - aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal ; not when he or she was informed of having been assigned to the case . The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigorous and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal - aid system illusory . In any event , the cassation appeal had to be lodged within DATE from DATE on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legal - aid lawyer ( I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ; I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ; PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; II OZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ; I CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ; ORG of DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG issued a resolution in reply to a legal question whether a legalaid lawyer could refuse to lodge a cassation appeal in civil proceedings . It replied to the question in the affirmative , having noted that issues involved in the grant of legal aid concerned not only the proper administration of justice , but also touched on human rights , and the right of access to a court in particular . The mere fact that it was necessary for a cassation appeal to be lodged by a qualified representative was not open to criticism .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the notion of legal assistance could not be identified with a simple obligation of a lawyer to act in accordance with the client 's wishes . The role of a legalaid lawyer had rather to be understood as obliging him or her to provide legal advice to the party , including as to the prospects of success offered by a cassation appeal against a given judgment .", "CARDINAL . This resolution was summarised in detail in the ORG 's judgment in the case of ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG changed its previous position concerning the date on which the timelimit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run . It examined a particular situation where a legal - aid lawyer had refused to represent a convicted person for the purposes of cassation proceedings , finding that a cassation appeal would offer no prospects of success . It held that in such a situation the appellate court was obliged to instruct the defendant that the time - limit for lodging a cassation appeal started to run only on the date on which the defendant was served with the lawyer 's refusal and not on DATE when the judgment of the appellate court was served on the defendant himself . It stated that it was not open to doubt that a defendant faced with a legal - aid lawyer 's refusal had a right to take other measures to seek legal assistance necessary for an effective lodging of a cassation appeal ( III KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterated its position in a decision of DATE and in a number of similar decisions given in DATE . It observed that there had been certain discrepancies in the judicial practice as to the manner in which the time - limit in such situations was calculated , but the strand of the case - law launched by the decision given in DATE was both dominant and correct , and also accepted by doctrine as providing to defendants adequate procedural guarantees of access to ORG within a reasonable time - frame ( II KZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
