The applicants in the present case are the NORP - Catholic parish of ORG , a religious body created on DATE in PERSON , as well as some of its members , NORP nationals living in PERSON . Their names , year of birth and place of residence appear in the first appendix to this report . The applicant Mr PERSON acted as their representative .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Romanian Greek - Catholic Association was granted leave to intervene in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON , who at that time was the NORP priest of the PERSON parish , decided together with CARDINAL members of his parish , to join ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . DATE they were recognised as a parish by ORG GPE ( GPE PERSON GPE ) and PERSON PERSON was ordained priest of that parish . The applicant parish thus became legitimate under the applicable laws .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON local authorities refused to recognise the new parish , denied its members access to the village church and cemetery , and advised ORG PERSON ) to take appropriate action against PERSON . On DATE the local council reiterated its decision . On DATE they also refused to allow the NORP - Catholic parish to hold its religious gatherings in a deserted school building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON resigned from his previous position in ORG . He was defrocked DATE , and ORG sent a new NORP priest to the local parish .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged a request , by means of the urgent procedure ( ordonan\u0163\u0103 pre\u015feden\u0163ial\u0103 ) , concerning ownership of ORG . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered Mr PERSON to surrender the property belonging to ORG to the plaintiff and to stop using the village church and cemetery for NORP practices .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the ORG archdiocese to re - examine its decision to ordain PERSON as a NORP - Catholic priest in PERSON . They suggested that his withdrawal might facilitate the dialogue between the CARDINAL parishes in the community .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON local authorities transferred ownership of the cemetery to the NORP parish . On DATE they delivered the title deeds for the land to the NORP parish . However , on DATE in proceedings instituted by the PERSON local authorities against ORG , ORG declared the deeds null and void .", "CARDINAL . NORP Several members of ORG parish lodged a complaint against the local authorities and the NORP community with ORG . The council examined the administrative decision of DATE and noted that the plaintiffs had been denied access to the village church and cemetery . It concluded that the local authorities had breached the applicants\u2019 freedom of conscience and disregarded their religious autonomy . Consequently , the ORG issued a warning to the local authorities . It gave its decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The conflicts between the CARDINAL religious communities escalated . The NORP community prohibited the NORP - Catholics from entering the cemetery to bury their dead or honour their memory . According to the applicants , they suffered increased pressure to revert to Orthodoxy : they were asked to sign a declaration renouncing their ORG if they wanted the local authorities to deliver any official service ; they received unjustified fines ; some of them were threatened with dismissal from their jobs ; and the local school organised a public demonstration against ORG . CARDINAL individuals gave written statements that they had been misled by PERSON into changing their faith . Some people lodged criminal complaints against those who had allegedly threatened them in order to force them to revert to Orthodoxy . The NORP archdiocese intervened in their favour by engaging in a written exchange with the local authorities . It was , however , to no avail .", "CARDINAL . Several criminal complaints were also lodged by both parties to the conflict , mainly concerning incidents that occurred in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , using the urgent procedure , the applicant parish sought to compel the NORP parish to allow NORP - Catholics the right to use the village cemetery to bury their dead and for memorial services .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found in favour of the applicant parish . On DATE ORG upheld the decision , which thus became final . The courts held that the applicant parish had been recognised by ORG and was thus legally constituted . It reiterated that , according to LAW , as the village had CARDINAL cemetery , all individuals had to have access to the burial grounds , irrespective of their faith .", "CARDINAL . As the NORP continued to be denied access to the cemetery by the NORP community , the applicant parish sought the services of a bailiff . On DATE ORG issued an enforcement order concerning the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiff notified ORG and ORG of his intention to enforce the above decision and sought assistance from the police . On DATE a group of persons from PERSON and the neighbouring villages did not allow the applicants , the bailiff or the police to enter the cemetery . Not even the police intervention on behalf of the applicants was able to deter the opposing parish . According to the bailiff \u2019s report , the new NORP priest refused to assist him and the ORG of the village in the enforcement attempts or to talk with his followers . He claimed that he was engaged in other religious duties at that time . As the CARDINAL parties became violent , the bailiff stopped the proceedings in order to avoid any escalation .", "CARDINAL . The NORP parish objected to the enforcement proceedings and on CARDINAL DATE ORG temporarily suspended the enforcement order until a final ruling had been given on the objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the decision of DATE was enforceable until the litigation concerning ownership of the cemetery had been examined ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It nevertheless maintained the suspension of the enforcement order until a final ruling had been given on the objection . The decision became final on DATE , when ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE several members of the applicant parish ( see appendix CARDINAL below ) lodged an action against the NORP parish and the ORG seeking access to the cemetery to bury their dead and perform the relevant rituals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partially allowed the request . A final ruling in the case was given on DATE by ORG . The courts took note of the fact that the title deeds delivered to the NORP parish had been declared null and void . Using the same arguments as those advanced by ORG under the urgent procedure , the courts recognised the rights of the NORP - Catholic members of the community to be buried in the NORP - Catholic tradition . ORG further decided that persons who embraced the NORP - Catholic faith would not be allowed to perform NORP rituals for deceased members of their families who had been buried according to the NORP tradition . In so deciding , ORG considered that the person \u2019s own convictions at the time of death should be subsequently respected by the family in the choice of rites .", "CARDINAL . After communication of the application , the ORG sought information about the current situation in PERSON . The ORG Secretary for ORG approached PERSON , which informed him that NORP had free access to the cemetery and that in DATE the ORG parish had received CARDINAL NORP Lei from the ORG budget in order to build a church .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON mayor \u2019s office informed the Government that neither religious community was being obstructed from using the cemetery and that the police had recorded no incidents in DATE . Statements by the CARDINAL local priests were attached to the mayor \u2019s report . The NORP priest explained that the NORP - Catholic priest was allowed into the cemetery in order to bury the deceased members of his community , but accused him of performing NORP rituals for deceased NORP believers . PERSON declared that their access was still restricted and that pressure had been exerted on members of the NORP community to resign from their ORG and join ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the NORP priest lodged a criminal complaint against a NORP - Catholic believer who had buried her deceased parent in the village cemetery according to NORP rites . The prosecutor decided not to prosecute , reiterating that the NORP - Catholic believers had a right , which had been recognised by a court order , to use the cemetery ; the prosecutor also noted that no damage had been done to the neighbouring graves belonging to NORP families . Another burial took place in DATE and allegations of police brutality against NORP believers in the aftermath of the religious service were dismissed as unfounded by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the PERSON local authorities have recently decided to create a new cemetery for all faiths .", "CARDINAL .
