The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He was a partner in a commercial partnership , a banking and stockbroking firm called PERSON I / S ( hereafter \u201c the Partnership \u201d ) . In addition to the applicant , the Partnership had CARDINAL other partners : VL , ORG , ORG , and CARDINAL private limited companies , namely Hugo PERSON A / S and PERSON A / S. Subsequently , in legal proceedings it was established that a further partner , ORG , had not formally resigned from the Partnership and therefore was also to be considered a partner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , due to financial difficulties , proceedings were initiated before ORG ( ORG under S\u00f8- og ORG ) concerning the Partnership and the partners for suspension of payments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided to discontinue the suspension of payments . At the same time , having heard CARDINAL bankruptcy petitions against the applicant , who did not object to the claim that the bankruptcy conditions had been met , ORG commenced bankruptcy proceedings against his estate . A trustee in bankruptcy was appointed to sort out the estate and to settle the accounts and the applicant was divested of the right to administer or to deal with his assets .", "CARDINAL . ORG formally commenced the examination of claims on CARDINAL DATE , but found that it was appropriate to wait until the claims against the Partnership had been lodged and examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , bankruptcy proceedings commenced against the Partnership and by DATE bankruptcy notices regarding all the copartners had been issued as well . The ORG \u2019s assets , including the individual ORG assets , were estimated at MONEY ( ORG ) , while its liabilities were estimated at ORG CARDINAL . The Partnership estate was closed on DATE with distribution of dividends .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime , as regards the applicant \u2019s bankruptcy estate , in the period DATE various court sessions were held with a view to determining the applicant \u2019s assets and considering creditor claims .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a new trustee was appointed . Court hearings were held in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the trustee held several meetings with the applicant and the partners in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . During DATE and DATE it appears that no court hearings as such were held . Nevertheless ORG and the trustee regularly examined claims in this period .", "CARDINAL . In a report of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG stated , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s estate could not be dealt with until the closure of the Partnership estate .", "CARDINAL . Court sessions were held on DATE , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE . On DATE , ORG adjourned the proceedings pending the preparation of accounts .", "CARDINAL . In a report of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG stated that full coverage for the Partnership creditors was expected in connection with the closing of the ORG estates . He was therefore endeavouring to obtain a compulsory composition so that the bankruptcy proceedings could be finalised pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW . The accounts of the applicant \u2019s bankruptcy estate could not be prepared , however , until formal accounts were available in the estates of the co - partners PERSON , CHN and FVM . At the relevant time , those accounts were being prepared , but could not be completed until , inter alia , the outcome of proceedings initiated by ORG against PERSON ORG in bankruptcy was known . The latter proceedings were finalised in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the trustee informed ORG that the draft accounts and report had been prepared and sent to the applicant for his comments . On DATE the trustee reminded the applicant that his comments were awaited .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a hearing was held at ORG during which a representative for the applicant stated that before the accounts could be approved , the applicant needed to examine certain matters in detail . Accordingly , ORG decided to postpone the approval of the accounts . Moreover , it appointed a lawyer as counsel for the applicant to help him with the matters raised .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of DATE to the creditors , the ORG stated that the approval could not be given pending the review of various matters by the applicant \u2019s counsel and clarification of the applicant \u2019s tax affairs .", "CARDINAL . By DATE the bankruptcy proceedings against the other partners of the Partnership were terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE having received several reminders , the applicant \u2019s counsel replied as to the matters that needed to be examined and he recommended that resources be applied to seek a settlement with both the creditors of the bankruptcy estate and the tax authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG requested that ORG schedule another meeting of creditors to close the estate . He referred to the fact that no objections had been filed against the accounts and that the applicant \u2019s dispute with the tax authorities did not affect the assets available for distribution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG declared that the estate would be closed .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on CARDINAL DATE , ORG approved the accounts of the applicant \u2019s bankruptcy estate . Thereafter , the proceedings were adjourned pending the preparation of draft distribution accounts to be presented at a meeting of creditors on DATE . On DATE , due to lack of agreement between the ORG and ORG , the proceedings were adjourned . Another hearing was held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the draft distribution accounts , preferential claims would be fully covered . Moreover , an amount of approximately ORG CARDINAL remained for distribution to so - called section CARDINAL claims ( section CARDINAL of LAW , which included deferred claims for interest ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a distribution on account was made in respect of the ordinary claims . During the period between DATE and DATE an amount of DKK MONEY was made available to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Before the final deadline for notifying claims in the estate , which ORG fixed at DATE , CARDINAL Partnership creditors lodged claims for interest in the estate . The applicant \u2019s counsel negotiated with the creditors with a view to reaching a settlement on the claims for interest , but in vain .", "CARDINAL . Thus , on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE hearings were held at ORG . On the latter date the deferred claims for interest were examined . The creditors , who appeared before the court , objected to the trustee \u2019s recommendation concerning the calculation of the claims for interest , and the parties therefore concluded a litigation agreement on the filing of a pleading to ORG by DATE at the latest .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicant objected to the trustee \u2019s recommendation concerning certain claims . He and the ORG therefore concluded a litigation agreement to select CARDINAL or more suitable lead cases .", "CARDINAL . The examination of the other claims , which were not objected to by the creditors , but contested by the applicant , was adjourned pending the outcome of the lead cases . CARDINAL creditors then issued a writ against the bankruptcy estate , and the applicant intervened as a third party .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG passed judgment in the CARDINAL lead cases , and at a meeting of creditors on CARDINAL DATE the creditors declared that they did not wish to appeal against the judgments unless the applicant did so . The applicant subsequently appealed against the judgments to the High Court of Eastern GPE ( PERSON ) , hereafter the High ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG invited the applicant and the creditors to consider whether the estate could be closed under section CARDINAL of LAW by setting aside funds to cover the contested claims pursuant to section CARDINAL . According to the former provision , the estate could be finalised and the surplus assets handed over to the debtor if the creditors had obtained full payment . The latter provision , however , provided for the possibility of finalising the estate even though there were disputed claims , if an amount equal to those claims had been set aside . At the relevant time it was not legally possible to combine section CARDINAL and section CARDINAL , unless the parties agreed to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at a hearing at ORG , the trustee recommended that final distribution accounts be prepared in respect of the deferred claims comprised by section CARDINAL of LAW , which were not the subject of the pending appeal proceedings . In respect of the disputed claims , the distribution could be postponed until after the closing of the estate , as provided for by section CARDINAL of LAW . ORG approved this recommendation and scheduled a meeting of creditors .", "CARDINAL . At the scheduled meeting of creditors , which took place on DATE , the applicant objected to ORG closing the estate . In support thereof he argued that \u201c the length of the proceedings had been unreasonable [ anyway ] and that therefore the closing of the estate ought to await [ also ] the outcome of the appeal proceedings before the High ORG \u201d . Despite the applicant \u2019s objection , ORG decided to approve the accounts and to make contributions in respect of the claims , which were not the subject of the pending appeal proceedings . It was also decided to make an amount of DKK CARDINAL,CARDINAL available to the applicant pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , then applicable . Finally , the estate was finalised by setting aside the remaining funds to cover the disputed claims .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the finalisation of the estate in accordance with section CARDINAL to ORG , which found against him on DATE . It appears that the applicant failed to request leave to appeal against this decision to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the appeal proceedings concerning the disputed deferred claims for interest , ORG passed judgment against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a meeting of creditors to produce additional distribution accounts concerning the disputed deferred claims for interest . However , since the applicant had requested that ORG ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) grant him leave to appeal to ORG , ORG adjourned the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG informed the parties that the applicant would be granted leave to appeal against the judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG passed judgment finding against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , concluding that all creditors had been satisfied , ORG closed the estate and approved the handing over of the remaining assets of the estate , minus the costs of administration of the estate , to the applicant pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG the applicant submitted that on numerous occasions , in vain , he had requested that the bankruptcy proceedings be expedited . This was disputed by the Government .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON ) invited the applicant to raise his complaints about the length of the bankruptcy proceedings before the court , where the case was pending .", "LAW ( GPE ) , LAW no .
