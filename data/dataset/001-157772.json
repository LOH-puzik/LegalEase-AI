As stated in the announcement , the strike was to begin at TIME on DATE at the workplace and would continue until the applicant union \u2019s demands were met . As stated in the decision to strike , the applicant union undertook to negotiate with the employer before and during the strike , in order to ensure that the workers\u2019 demands were acceded to in a friendly manner . It was also stated that if an agreement was reached between the applicant union and the employer it would be regarded as a collective agreement of the employer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant union and the employer reached an agreement for a PERCENT pay rise and the payment of a CARDINAL - off bonus for production workers . According to the agreement , the strike action was suspended ( \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0458\u043a\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0430\u0442 ) and the negotiations were to continue after termination of the \u201c campaign \u201d ( apparently a production stage in the factory ) .", "CARDINAL . In the light of legislative amendments in DATE introducing gross salaries , on DATE the applicant union asked for the pay rise stipulated in the agreement to be incorporated in the workers\u2019 gross salaries . The same request was made regarding travel and food allowances ( \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\u0446\u0438 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437 ) .", "CARDINAL . As established in the subsequent civil proceedings ( see below ) , the employer responded on DATE , saying that it had fulfilled the wage - related obligations set out in the agreement of CARDINAL DATE , and that the negotiations on the collective agreement would continue . It also offered PERCENT pay rise for production workers .", "CARDINAL . The applicant union and the employer then exchanged letters in which they stated their positions regarding the contentious issues . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the employer set out CARDINAL proposals concerning pay increases , and indicated that the negotiations regarding the collective agreement would continue .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant union made a final request ( a PERCENT salary increase for production workers and incorporation of the food allowance in the gross salary ) and asked the employer to state its position by TIME , under the threat of resorting to other statutory measures .", "CARDINAL . In another letter dispatched DATE by registered mail ( which the employer received on DATE ) the applicant union informed the employer :", "\u201c ... since you refuse to settle the wage dispute , we hereby inform you that the strike action will resume at TIME on DATE in the factory . We emphasise that we are ready to negotiate both now and during the strike in order to find a solution ( that is acceptable for both parties ) ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the employer formulated CARDINAL proposals regarding a pay rise for production and/or all workers and travel and food allowances , and requested that the applicant union reply by DATE . The employer stated that its proposals corresponded to its financial capacity at the time . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant union refused the employer \u2019s offer but expressed its willingness to continue negotiating . In reply , the employer informed the applicant union that by going on strike on CARDINAL DATE it had violated the provisional agreement of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the employer brought a civil action against the applicant union , asking the courts to declare the strike announced on DATE unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ( \u201c the first - instance court \u201d ) allowed the employer \u2019s action and declared the strike announced on DATE unlawful . The court held that the strike had not been announced within the time - limits specified in LAW for ORG ( \u201c the sector collective agreement \u201d ) , which was binding on the applicant union . Since the applicant union , by submissions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , had made new requests that had not been included in the agreement of CARDINAL DATE , the court found that the applicant union had gone on strike in contravention of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d , see paragraph DATE below ) according to which a strike could not begin before any out - of - court settlement proceedings had been brought to an end .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed an appeal by the applicant union and set aside the lower court \u2019s judgment . It instructed the first - instance court to establish whether the employer had signed the sector collective agreement , which in the court \u2019s opinion was the determining factor as to the applicability of that collective agreement to the dispute between the parties . The lower court was also instructed to establish whether at the material time the negotiations were still pending , and if so whether , in the light of its subsequent requests , the applicant union had been obliged to announce the strike of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court dismissed the employer \u2019s action . Relying on section CARDINAL of the LAW , it held that the applicant union had gone on strike on the basis of its decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which had not been set aside ( \u0432\u043e\u043d \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430 ) . With that decision , the applicant union had informed the employer about the reasons for the strike and the place and time of the strike . The agreement reached between the parties on DATE had been provisional and had concerned only part of the applicant union \u2019s demands ( concerning a pay rise for production workers ) . The employer had started implementing the agreement of CARDINAL DATE up to the point when the legislative amendments introducing gross salaries entered into force in DATE . In view of the applicant union \u2019s requests post - dating the agreement , the court concluded that negotiations between the parties had been pending and that the applicant union had not been required to announce the strike of DATE . The court also found that the strike could not be regarded as a new strike , but was rather a continuation of the strike announced on DATE . That negotiations were ongoing was supported by the fact that after the parties had reached the agreement of CARDINAL DATE both strikers and non - strikers were regularly at work and production had continued ( \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 , \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 ) . The court also established that the employer was at the time neither a member of ORG ( \u0417\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0447\u0438 ) nor a signatory to the sector collective agreement ( the latter accordingly was not binding on the employer at the time ) . In such circumstances , the court ruled that the strike had been in compliance with the LAW , pursuant to which the right to strike could not be restricted because of the requirement for mediation .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the employer , on DATE ORG overturned the first - instance court \u2019s judgment and declared the strike announced on DATE unlawful . The court held that :", "\u201c The court considers that after the agreement ( of DATE ) had been concluded and the [ employer ] had satisfied part of [ the applicant \u2019s ] requests , negotiations were still pending , which is not disputed between the parties . In view of the above - cited provision ( section CARDINAL of the Act ) , the requirement for mediation can not restrict the right to strike if such a requirement is specified by this law or before the end of any out - of - court settlement proceedings agreed upon by the parties .", "This court considers that the strike of CARDINAL DATE is unlawful because mediation and negotiations ... are still pending . ( The applicant union ) submitted new requests that had not been specified in the agreement [ of CARDINAL DATE ] ... [ The applicant union ] , without giving any reply , refused the new proposals made [ by the employer ] and continued the strike , despite the employer \u2019s willingness to fulfil the requests that were not part of the agreement . Instead of considering the CARDINAL proposals made by the employer and providing an explanation for refusing each of them , [ the applicant union ] unilaterally informed the employer on DATE that the strike would continue . This means that while the negotiations were pending it went unilaterally into a new strike , in contravention of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "In view of the foregoing , the court allows [ the employer \u2019s ] appeal ... and prohibits ( \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 ) the [ the applicant union \u2019s ] strike announced on DATE as contrary to LAW , all the more so since the negotiating team of [ the applicant union ] suggested to [ the employer ] , with the notification of CARDINAL DATE , that negotiations should continue . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the employer claimed compensation for pecuniary loss allegedly sustained as a result of the strike by the applicant union which had lasted from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . The applicant union denied that the employer had sustained any damage , alleging that workers who had gone on strike had been replaced . In such circumstances , there had been no adverse effects and \u201c the campaign had ended successfully \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the observations on the admissibility and merits of the application , the Government informed that on CARDINAL DATE the first - instance court allowed the employer \u2019s claim and ordered the applicant union , under section CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to pay MONEY ( ORG ) with interest in respect of \u201c pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful strike held DATE and DATE . \u201d The court relied on an expert report , according to which there had been \u201c CARDINAL campaigns for the production of raw sugar \u201d during the strike , and the employer had sustained damage in view of increased energy costs . In the absence of an appeal by the applicant union , this judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant union submitted a list of CARDINAL employees who were members of the applicant union and who had been dismissed from work owing to their participation in the strike . In this connection , it submitted court judgments in which the dismissal of an employee had been confirmed at the first and second levels of jurisdiction .
