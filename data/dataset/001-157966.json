The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . She originates from GPE and is a NORP Orthodox Christian . In DATE she started a relationship with a NORP man , PERSON , who lived in GPE , and in DATE they married in GPE . Subsequently , the applicant was first granted a temporary residence permit in GPE until DATE and then , in DATE , she was granted a permanent residence permit . The applicant moved to GPE in DATE and , on DATE , she and PERSON had a son , X.", "CARDINAL . Due to a suspected infection , X remained in hospital for DATE following his birth before he was discharged in good health . On DATE the applicant and PERSON took X to hospital where it was revealed that he had bruises on his genitals . The family was allowed to return home after X had been examined . On DATE X \u2019s condition worsened and he suffered from cramps . The applicant and PERSON again took him to hospital . X suffered extensive bleeding in the brain and a chief physician at the hospital suspected that he had been severely ill - treated . X was kept in hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a physician filed a report on suspected child abuse with the social services and , on the same date , ORG ( arbetsmarknads- och familjen\u00e4mnden , hereafter ORG ) in PERSON decided , under section CARDINAL of the Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons ( NORP med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga , TIME ; hereafter the \u201c DATE LAW ) , to take X into immediate compulsory public care on a provisional basis . The decision was executed on that DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE PERSON confirmed the decision of ORG . It appears that the applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG applied to ORG for a care order in respect of X. The applicant and PERSON , who were represented by legal counsel , opposed the measure while X \u2019s legal representative agreed that it would be in the child \u2019s best interest to be placed in compulsory public care .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG , after having held an oral hearing , granted a care order in respect of X. The court noted that , according to a medical certificate submitted by a chief physician , X had bruises on his genitals , probably injuries from being squeezed . Bleeding in the brain and a red spot on the left side of the chest strongly suggested that X had been gripped tightly and violently shaken and suffered from \u201c shaken baby syndrome \u201d . X had severe brain injuries and would probably suffer lifelong mental and physical disabilities . The court found that X \u2019s injuries had occurred while he had been in his GPE care . Thus , in the court \u2019s opinion , it did not matter who had actually caused the injuries but it sufficed to state that the parents had failed to protect X from being injured . The court concluded that the parents had shown a serious lack of ability to care for their son . The judgment had immediate effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It held that neither the oral statements made before it , nor anyreached by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( H\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , X was transferred from the hospital to an evaluation and treatment home ( utrednings- och behandlingshem ) together with the applicant and PERSON The main responsibility of that home was to secure GPE \u2019s protection . It also had the tasks of evaluating the GPE ability to care for X , of providing the parents with such abilities if needed and of supporting the parents in their crisis situation . The staff at the home found , after the family had been there for DATE , that the applicant had shown good ability to satisfy X \u2019s basic physical needs , take care of his practical needs and had been constantly present for him . However , she had shown considerable flaws in her emotional interaction with X and it was said , among other things , that she had not been able to separate her need for consolation and emotional care from X \u2019s feelings and needs . Her attitude towards PERSON was described as if she objectified him rather than regarded him as an individual in his own right , which in the report was described as highly worrying . It was further noted that she did not accept PERSON \u2019s injuries and that she did not talk at all about his future disabilities . As regards PERSON , the staff at the home noted inter alia that he had been absent to a great extent due to his work commitments .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a criminal investigation concerning suspected child abuse in respect of the applicant and PERSON was discontinued since it was impossible to prove that either of them had committed the abuse .", "CARDINAL . In DATE X was placed in a family home ( familjehem ) consisting of a NORP married couple .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant twice reported B. to the police , claiming he had threatened to kill her and her family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to terminate the public care . She insisted that she had never ill - treated X nor witnessed anyone else doing so . She had had no reason to suspect that X risked ill - treatment at home . Moreover , she submitted that she and PERSON had divorced and that , through an interim decision , she had been granted sole custody of X while PERSON had limited visiting rights . Furthermore , she had completed her studies in NORP for immigrants and was planning to find work .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered an investigation into the family \u2019s situation which was completed on DATE . The purpose was to investigate and analyse whether X should remain in public care . The social services spoke with the applicant and PERSON , visited the family home and gathered relevant information for the case . Once finalised , the investigation report stated , inter alia , that according to a medical certificate issued by Professor O.F. , a specialist on \u201c shaken baby syndrome \u201d , PERSON was suffering from that syndrome . It was also stressed that PERSON \u2019s life had been in danger when he had been shaken , that he had suffered lasting brain injuries and would need care for the rest of his life . It was further noted that X had suffered injuries to his genitals . Moreover , it was stressed that it was the social services\u2019 responsibility to ensure X \u2019s safety and that , regardless of which parent had caused PERSON \u2019s injuries , the other parent had failed to protect him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to terminate the public care . In its decision ORG referred to the findings of the investigation report .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG and requested that the care order be terminated . She maintained that there was no need to keep X in public care as she was fully capable of caring for her own child . She further criticised the medical certificates that had been submitted in the case and contested the assumption that X suffered from \u201c shaken baby syndrome \u201d . Instead she claimed that ORG \u2019s injuries had been caused by malpractice of personnel at the hospital where he had been treated . She further argued that ORG human rights were being violated since he was not allowed to speak his native language and practise his religion . She also complained about the proceedings before ORG , which she considered to be flawed .", "CARDINAL . ORG contested the applicant \u2019s claims , stressing that X \u2019s life had been in danger and that he had suffered lasting brain injuries while in his GPE care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request to obtain an opinion from ORG of ORG ( Socialstyrelsens R\u00e4ttsliga r\u00e5d ) . According to ORG , there was no reason to obtain such an opinion .", "CARDINAL . Both parties submitted documentary evidence . The applicant submitted , inter alia , a medical certificate of her own , stating that X likely suffered from a severe brain injury , probably anoxic brain injury ( injury to the brain due to a lack of oxygen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing in the case , where the applicant insisted that she had not in any way ill - treated X. Nor had she seen that X had been harmed by PERSON or any other person . According to her , there was nothing to suggest any flaws in her parental abilities and she maintained that GPE \u2019s injuries had been caused by malpractice at the hospital . ORG stated that it could not rule out the possibility that X had been ill - treated at home . It further stressed that the submitted medical certificates showed that someone had shaken X , causing him severe injuries . X \u2019s legal representative agreed that it would be in his best interest to remain in public care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . Firstly , it found that there had been no flaws in ORG handling of the case which could affect the court \u2019s assessment . The court then noted that the applicant had contested the physicians\u2019 conclusions and , moreover , that she had submitted a medical certificate of her own . However , the court considered that the applicant \u2019s reasoning in this regard was based on speculation and accusations which , in all essential parts , were unsubstantiated . It held that the medical certificate submitted by the applicant did not in any way contradict those previously submitted . Thus , nothing had emerged that would lead the court to reassess the circumstances that had led to the initial decision to take X into public care . Furthermore , the court found that the changes to the applicant \u2019s life ( the divorce and obtaining sole custody of X ) were not sufficient to have a decisive effect on the outcome of the proceedings . It also stressed that it was important that X continue to bond with his family home parents . Furthermore , the court took into consideration that X had been subjected to severe ill - treatment while in his GPE care and that the circumstances surrounding the incident had not been clarified . Thus , the compulsory public care order should remain in place .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , maintaining her request for an opinion from ORG . The applicant also reiterated her criticism of the conclusions given in the medical certificates and , again , questioned the assumption that X suffered from \u201c shaken baby syndrome \u201d . She further maintained that ORG \u2019s injuries had been caused by malpractice at the hospital . The applicant also questioned the family home \u2019s ability to care for her son .", "CARDINAL . ORG and X \u2019s legal representative both contested the applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request for an opinion from ORG . The opinion was submitted to the court on DATE . It referred to a certificate by the scientific advisor ORG , a physician specialised in medical radiology , which stated , inter alia , that X \u2019s injuries had been caused by severe violence and that his injuries corresponded exactly to \u201c shaken baby syndrome \u201d . The injuries could not have been caused by illness or complications related to an illness nor through a minor accident such as a fall from a changing table or similar . The injuries could not have been a consequence of an injury during delivery either . Thus , ORG wholly agreed with the assessments previously made by Professor PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing where the applicant stated that she had started to question her earlier position that ORG \u2019s injuries had not been caused by ill - treatment in their home . Although she had not actually witnessed anyone harming X , she said that the only person , apart from herself , who could have done so was B. On DATE they had taken X to the hospital , B. had been in a bad temper . On DATE B. had taken care of X while she had been in the bathroom preparing a bath for X , and from the bathroom she had heard X cry and had gone to see what was the matter . B. had then told her to leave the room and after she had done so the baby had become quiet and PERSON had left the apartment . Just shortly after this and while undressing X , she had noticed that something was wrong with him and that he was having trouble breathing . B. had threatened her and told her that she would be expelled from GPE if she were to tell anyone what had happened . She also told the court that PERSON had often been irritated when PERSON cried and that he had had a tendency to \u201c explode \u201d . The applicant further stated that her life was stable , she spoke NORP , had an apartment and work , and she would do everything to ensure that X received the care and treatment he needed .", "CARDINAL . ORG maintained that X would be exposed to danger if he were to be left in the applicant \u2019s care . X \u2019s legal representative contested the applicant \u2019s claims and pointed out that , although it had not been clarified who had caused PERSON \u2019s injuries , it must be presumed that it was one of the parents . Although she found no reason to question that , with help , the applicant would be able to care for her son , she considered that he was in need of protection until it had been established who had caused his injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . From the outset , it noted that the primary consideration was the best interests of the child . The court then observed that X needed extensive care and great responsibility was therefore placed on the custodian in terms of understanding X \u2019s needs . Thus , the court considered it encouraging that the applicant had now accepted the conclusions in the medical certificate concerning X \u2019s state of health and the cause of his injuries . In addition , the court considered that the applicant \u2019s life situation had improved since the decision to take LAW into public care . Of decisive importance to the court was , however , whether ORG needs could be met by the applicant . In this context , the court noted that it had still not been clarified who had caused his injuries . The court further considered that , in the light of the applicant \u2019s statement before the court , her previous behaviour was difficult to understand . Although the court acknowledged the applicant \u2019s exposed situation at the time of QUANTITY \u2019s injuries , it nevertheless stressed that the conditions in the family had led to serious deficiencies in LOC care , causing him life - threatening injuries and lifelong disabilities . The court concluded that there was still a clear risk of impairment to X \u2019s health and development if the public care were to be terminated .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal by the applicant , ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in proceedings regarding custody of X between the applicant and PERSON , ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) repealed its provisional decision of CARDINAL DATE to grant sole custody of GPE to the applicant and decided that the parents should have joint custody . It appears that the applicant and PERSON had agreed that they needed to cooperate on questions relating to X \u2019s future situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE ORG decided that the public care should continue . As far as is known to the ORG , the applicant did not appeal against these decisions .", "CARDINAL . Following the granting of the public care order , the applicant \u2019s contact rights to visit X were regularly examined by the domestic authorities . During X \u2019s DATE in the family home , the applicant and B. visited him CARDINAL times per week . Subsequently , the applicant and B. visited him once DATE . During the visits , an interpreter and a support person were present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided to reduce the GPE contact rights to once DATE since the visits had had a clearly negative effect on PERSON \u2019s mental state . The applicant did not agree with the changes and appealed against the decision to ORG . On DATE the court dismissed the appeal . The applicant did not lodge a further appeal with the appellate courts . In DATE the contact rights were extended to TIME once every month , as X was feeling better . However , on DATE ORG decided again to reduce the GPE contact rights to TIME every month , since X had been affected negatively during and after the visits .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision , maintaining that she had not in any way ill - treated X and that she wanted to care for him . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , after having held an oral hearing , upheld the ORG \u2019s decision . The court observed that X had reacted negatively during the visits and held that , due to his great need of care and treatment for his disabilities , it was important for him to be in a stable and calm environment and be allowed to bond with his family home parents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG which , after having held an oral hearing , rejected the appeal on DATE . The court noted that ORG intended to film the visits and subsequently , with the help of ORG ( Barn- och ungdomspsykiatrin ) , analyse the results . Having regard to this , and the observations made by ORG during the visits , the court held that the contact restrictions should remain . The applicant did not appeal against the decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE , the applicant requested that X be placed in another family home since she considered that the current family home couple did not care sufficiently well for her son . She also added that she considered it to be X \u2019s right to be placed in a NORP family . In DATE , after having carried out an investigation , ORG rejected the request on the ground that it would not be in PERSON \u2019s best interest to be moved to another family home and that his needs were best met by remaining where he was . The applicant does not appear to have appealed against this decision to the administrative courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the applicant would be allowed to speak NORP to X during the visits .", "CARDINAL . Following the filming of the applicant and X during TIME , in a report dated DATE , the company , which had been assigned by ORG to carry out the filming and analysing the emotional interplay between the applicant and PERSON , stated that the applicant had shown sensitivity towards X and that they had shown a genuinely good interplay . It was further noted that the applicant had the necessary abilities to support X in his future development . The report concluded that it was of great importance for X to be allowed to see his mother much more often . It was also recommended that the visits take place without the presence of the family home parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the contact rights of the applicant and B. were extended to TIME once every month . It was also considered that the meetings functioned without a support person present . According to the Government , this arrangement was to remain in place until DATE and the applicant had not requested any changes to it . Moreover , a meeting between the applicant , the family home and ORG , scheduled for DATE , was cancelled upon request by both the applicant and the family home , as they had already agreed on the remaining visits for DATE . The ORG has not been informed whether any subsequent changes to the time , form or frequency of the visits have taken place .", "CARDINAL .
