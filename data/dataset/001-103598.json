The ORG notes ORG submission that the author 's counsel was provided with a number of official police reports on the case prior to his application for leave to appeal , without specifying their content and relevance to the verdict . ORG , however , observes that these reports could not have provided guidance as to the motivation of the first instance court in convicting the author of a criminal offence , nor indication on what particular evidence the court had relied . The ORG recalls its established practice that in appellate proceedings guarantees of a fair trial are to be observed , including the right to have adequate facilities for the preparation of his defence . In the circumstances of the instant case , the ORG does not consider that the reports provided , in the absence of a motivated judgment , a trial transcript or even a list of the evidence used , constituted adequate facilities for the preparation of the author 's defence .", "CARDINAL The ORG further notes that , according to ORG , the President of ORG denied leave to appeal with the motivation that a hearing of the appeal was not in the interests of the proper administration of justice and that counsel 's contentions were not supported in law . ORG considers this motivation inadequate and insufficient in order to satisfy the conditions of article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW , which require a review by a higher tribunal of the conviction and the sentence . Such review , in the frame of a decision regarding a leave to appeal , must be examined on its merits , taking into consideration on the one hand the evidence presented before the first instance judge , and on the other hand the conduct of the trial on the basis of the legal provisions applicable to the case in question .", "CARDINAL Accordingly , in these specific circumstances , the ORG finds that the right to appeal of the author under article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW has been violated , due to failure of ORG to provide adequate facilities for the preparation of his defence and conditions for a genuine review of his case by a higher tribunal .", "CARDINAL .
