SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , the late Sigvard PERSON , was a NORP national , born in DATE and was living in GPE . Following his death on DATE , his widow , PERSON , declared that she wished to pursue the application on his behalf . He is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The Government are represented by PERSON of ORG , as Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was son of the late NORP King PERSON . By descent he was born a prince . On DATE the applicant , without the consent of the King , entered into marriage with a woman who was not of royal descent . For this reason , on DATE , the applicant \u2019s father , the then Crown Prince Regent PERSON , decided on the ORG \u2019s behalf :", "\u201c By entering into marriage without the King \u2019s consent and with the daughter of a foreign private person , His Majesty , The Duke of Uppland , in accordance with LAW and LAW , has forfeited his own , his children \u2019s and his ORG right of succession to the throne . Moreover , he has forfeited the titles and the privileges , which until now he has enjoyed in his capacity as a hereditary prince \u201d .", "The members of the Government cabinet expressed their agreement with the above decision and agreed with the ORG \u2019s decision that \u201c PERSON for the future may use the family name PERSON \u201d . It has ever since been the understanding of the NORP Kings that the applicant thereby lost his right to the title of prince and he has been treated accordingly in ORG Officials and ORG respectively .", "Since DATE the applicant , in several petitions to the present King of GPE , King PERSON , requested that his hereditary prince title be reaffirmed by the King . The applicant supplied some information about exchanges from DATE between his lawyer at the time and the PERSON of the Realm ( riksmarskalken ) . This included an extract from a letter of DATE from the PERSON stating that \u201c the King had not found grounds for revising the interpretations and application of his predecessor \u2019s decision in the matter . Thus , ORG considers that it had finalised its examination of the case \u201d .", "The most recent petition to the King , dated DATE , was rejected on DATE . PERSON referred to earlier exchanges in the course of which it had been stated that the King was not prepared to carry out a revision or amendment to his predecessor \u2019s decision in the matter . In so far as the King and ORG were concerned , no changes would be made in respect of applicable titles .", "Under NORP law , these refusals can not form the subject of an appeal .", "According to the applicant , he suffered various inconveniences as a result of the removal of his prince title and the subsequent refusals to restore his title .", "At the material time ( DATE ) , LAW read as follows .", "\" No prince of ORG , be he crown prince , hereditary prince or prince , may marry without the ORG knowledge and consent . In the event that this should occur , he has forfeited his hereditary right to the realm for his own part , that of his children and descendants . \"", "A similar provision was contained in LAW , which provided that the same applied if a prince , with or without the knowledge and consent of the King , married a commoner ( \u201c a private man \u2019s daughter \u201d ) of NORP or foreign origin .", "Following a reform in DATE , section CARDINAL was amended to require the King to hear the Government cabinet before consenting to the marriage of a prince . At the same time , the reference to a commoner of foreign origin was abolished , while that to a commoner of NORP origin was retained . According to the respondent Government , the reason was that , after the First World War , the number of ruling sovereigns and royal houses and other families of equal status had been reduced .", "According to information supplied by the ORG , the main features of the domestic law pertaining to the acquisition and loss of a name remained unchanged throughout the relevant period . In DATE the legal provisions concerning names were brought together in CARDINAL statute , the DATE LAW ( namnlagen ) , later replaced by LAW . Under these rules , surnames were acquired at birth and could be lost only in limited circumstances , for example if it were established in paternity proceedings that a certain man was not the father of a person carrying his surname or where the person concerned was not entitled to acquire the surname in the first place or had acquired a surname that caused inconvenience to another person on account of a risk of confusion . The right to carry a first name that had been registered or approved could not be revoked .", "Although there was no definition of the concept of name under NORP law , it was considered that designations other than names fell outside that concept , as they were not deemed to constitute means of personal identification . This was the case of terms that indicated a profession - for example teacher , lawyer or military , or occupational position - such as professor , judge or commander , and likewise indications of rank or title , such as assistant professor , district court judge or captain . Such designations were not afforded the legal protection applicable to names . There was no domestic legal provision regulating the use of the titles of prince and princess nor any legal protection of those titles ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
