It found that DATE after his release from prison the applicant , together with an accomplice , had injured and robbed an acquaintance of his and had forced the victim , a homosexual , to sign a borrower \u2019s note . Moreover , he had injured and attempted to kill his victim DATE when he learned that the latter had reported the robbery to the police . Having regard to a report submitted by expert NORP , the court found that the applicant suffered from a pathological mental disorder , with the result that his criminal responsibility was diminished ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of dangerous assault , sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his subsequent placement in a psychiatric hospital under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant had injured a prison guard by throwing a heavy metal box at his head and stabbing him with a screwdriver after having been reprimanded . As confirmed by expert NORP , the applicant suffered from a serious pathological mental disorder , with the result that his criminal responsibility was diminished .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on appeal , convicted the applicant of assault of a disabled fellow prisoner following a discussion as to whether or not the cell window should remain open . Incorporating the sentence imposed by the judgment of ORG of DATE , it sentenced him to a cumulative sentence of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Moreover , it upheld the order for the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital . In the proceedings , an expert found that there were no longer any signs that the applicant suffered from a pathological brain disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of attempted murder and robbery and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It further ordered his placement in preventive detention ( GPE ) under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . It found that when the conditions of his detention in the psychiatric hospital where he had been detained since DATE had been relaxed , the applicant had on DATE robbed and attempted to murder a woman who had volunteered to spend DATE with him in a city away from the hospital . Having regard to the report of a neurological and psychiatric expert , PERSON , the court found that the applicant still suffered from a serious mental disorder which could , however , no longer be qualified as pathological and did not have to be treated medically . He therefore had not acted with diminished criminal responsibility and the preconditions for his placement in a psychiatric hospital under LAW were no longer met . However , he had a strong propensity to commit offences which seriously damaged his GPE physical integrity . It was to be expected that he would commit further spontaneous acts of violence and he was dangerous to the public . Therefore , his preventive detention was necessary .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant , having served his full prison sentence , has been in preventive detention in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to suspend on probation the applicant \u2019s preventive detention and his placement in a psychiatric hospital . It relied on a report submitted by expert M .- I. , who had concluded that the applicant was likely to commit offences as a result of his propensity to reoffend within the meaning of LAW , whereas it was not very probable that he would commit offences as a result of his psychiatric condition within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant took advantage of a day release to abscond , but gave himself up to the police on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to suspend on probation the applicant \u2019s preventive detention and his placement in a psychiatric hospital , as it had previously done on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . It took into consideration the fact that in the meantime the applicant , who at that time associated himself with skinheads , had assaulted and broken the nose of a fellow prisoner and had grossly insulted the governor of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s requests to suspend on probation his preventive detention as ordered by that court on DATE and his placement in a psychiatric hospital as ordered by it on DATE . Applying LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it declared that no request for review of this decision would be admissible within a DATE period .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the applicant \u2019s previous convictions and his conduct in prison , ORG found that it could not be expected that the applicant , if released , would not commit further serious offences ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court had heard evidence from the applicant , who was represented by officially appointed counsel , in person . It had further consulted PERSON and the PERSON public prosecutor \u2019s office , both of which had recommended not suspending on probation the orders for the applicant \u2019s detention . It also agreed with the report submitted by an external expert in forensic psychiatry , PERSON The expert had taken the view that the applicant , who had a narcissistic personality and a total lack of empathy , but could not be regarded as suffering from a psychopathic disorder , needed to be observed for DATE before it could be assumed that he was no longer dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that it was ordering the applicant \u2019s preventive detention also for the period after DATE , when ( after a period during which the applicant had escaped from detention had been deducted ) he would have served DATE in preventive detention . There were no constitutional obstacles to such a decision . According to the court , the applicant \u2019s continued preventive detention was authorised by LAW as amended in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) of LAW to LAW , as amended in DATE , the LAW in question had been declared applicable also to prisoners whose preventive detention had been ordered prior to the change in the law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG had refused to admit a constitutional complaint in which the change in the law had indirectly been at issue . In view of the gravity of the applicant \u2019s criminal past and possible future offences his continued preventive detention was not disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . As to the order for the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital , his request was premature as he was neither currently detained nor about to be detained in a psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG , amending the decision of ORG in this respect , quashed the order of DATE for the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital . Upholding the remainder of ORG decision , it decided not to suspend on probation the applicant \u2019s preventive detention as ordered by ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , and ordered his continued detention also after the expiry of DATE of detention on DATE . It confirmed that a request for review of the decision would not be admissible within DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal found that the order for the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital was devoid of purpose . Having regard to the expert reports submitted to the criminal courts since DATE and a new report by expert PERSON requested by the court itself , it was clear that the applicant no longer suffered from a serious mental disorder which should be qualified as pathological .", "CARDINAL . As to the preventive detention of the applicant , who was represented by counsel , ORG , endorsing the reasons given by ORG , found that the applicant \u2019s dangerousness necessitated his continued detention . In view of the offences he had committed and could be expected to commit on release , his continued detention was proportionate . No material change in the circumstances decisive for his detention was to be expected within DATE ( LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , Article CARDINAL CARDINAL of LAW , as amended in DATE , was constitutional . The court conceded that at the time when the applicant \u2019s preventive detention was ordered , it would have ceased after DATE of detention at the latest . However , LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) authorised a retrospective worsening of the applicant \u2019s situation as far as measures of correction and prevention such as preventive detention were concerned . Such measures were not classified as penalties , but as preventive measures , and were therefore not prohibited under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as retrospective criminal provisions .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , the applicant \u2019s continued preventive detention did not infringe the prohibition in principle of retrospective provisions enshrined in the rule of law . Weighty public - interest grounds , namely the protection of the public from dangerous offenders , justified the adoption of such retrospective provisions by the legislator in the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a complaint with ORG against the decisions ordering his continued preventive detention even on completion of the tenyear period . He claimed , in particular , that these decisions were based on Article CARDINAL of LAW , as amended in DATE , under the terms of which the duration of a convicted person \u2019s first period of preventive detention could be extended retrospectively from a maximum period of DATE to an unlimited period of time . Accordingly , this provision violated the prohibition of retrospective punishment under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the prohibition of retrospective legislation enshrined in the rule of law , the principle of proportionality and his right to liberty under LAW , second sentence , of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Moreover , the impugned provision entailed his being refused any relaxation in his conditions of detention which would allow him to obtain a positive finding to the effect that he was no longer dangerous to the public . As a consequence , it entailed lifelong imprisonment without any prospect of release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG , having held a hearing at which it also consulted psychiatric experts and several prison governors , dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) as ill - founded . In its thoroughly reasoned leading judgment ( running to CARDINAL pages ) , it held that Article CARDINAL of LAW , read in conjunction with LAW ) of LAW to LAW , as amended in DATE , was compatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that preventive detention based on Article CARDINAL of LAW restricted the right to liberty as protected by LAW in a proportionate manner .", "CARDINAL . The court stressed that the longer a person was held in preventive detention , the stricter became the requirements concerning the proportionality of the deprivation of liberty . However , Article CARDINAL of LAW took into account the increased importance of the right to liberty after DATE in custody . It set a higher standard with respect to the legal interest under threat ( protecting only threats to the GPE physical or mental integrity ) and the proof of the applicant \u2019s dangerousness ( requiring a duly substantiated report by an experienced external psychiatric expert ) . It also made termination of detention the rule and extension the exception , to be used as a measure of last resort . Moreover , the procedural provisions on preventive detention ( Articles CARDINALc \u00a7 CARDINAL , GPE CARDINAL QUANTITY of LAW ) provided for regular review to determine whether the person \u2019s detention could be suspended or terminated . Due to the special significance which the relaxation of detention conditions had for the prognosis of future dangerousness , the court responsible for the execution of the sentence was not permitted to accept without sufficient reason a refusal by the prison authorities to relax detention conditions as a possible precursor to the termination of a detainee \u2019s preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . Preventive detention did not serve to avenge past offences but to prevent future ones . Therefore , the ORG had to ensure that a detainee was able to have his or her detention conditions improved to the full extent compatible with prison requirements .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held that Article CARDINAL of LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW ) of LAW to LAW , did not violate LAW . The absolute ban on the retrospective application of criminal laws imposed by that Article did not cover the measures of correction and prevention , such as preventive detention , provided for in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Interpreting the notions of \u201c punished \u201d and \u201c punishable act \u201d in LAW , ORG found that the LAW applied only to ORG measures which expressed sovereign censure of illegal and culpable conduct and involved the imposition of a penalty to compensate for guilt . Having regard to the genesis of LAW and the purpose of LAW , it did not apply to other ORG measures interfering with a person \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , LAW did not extend to measures of correction and prevention , which had always been understood as differing from penalties under LAW twin - track system of penalties and measures of correction and prevention . The fact that a measure was connected with unlawful conduct or entailed considerable interference with the right to liberty was not enough . Unlike a penalty , preventive detention was not aimed at punishing criminal guilt , but was a purely preventive measure aimed at protecting the public from a dangerous offender . Therefore , preventive detention was not covered by LAW , even though it was directly connected with the qualifying offence .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further held , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL on this issue , that the abolition of the maximum period of detention where preventive detention was ordered for the first time , and the application of the relevant provision ( Article CARDINAL of LAW read in conjunction with LAW ) of LAW to LAW ) to criminals who had been placed in preventive detention prior to its enactment and entry into force and who had not yet fully served their sentences , were in conformity with the protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a ORG governed by the rule of law ( LAW read in conjunction with LAW of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The court stressed that Article CARDINAL of LAW as amended did not retrospectively alter the legal consequences attaching to the offence as fixed in the final judgment of the sentencing court . It had always been the courts responsible for the execution of sentences which had jurisdiction to decide whether and for how long a convicted person was held in preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention as laid down in the old version of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Criminal Code gave detainees reason to expect release when DATE had elapsed . However , pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the DATE maximum duration of preventive detention , like all other measures of correction and prevention , had been subject from the outset to changes in the law .", "CARDINAL . Weighing the interests involved , ORG concluded that the legislator \u2019s duty to protect members of the public against interference with their life , health and sexual integrity outweighed the detainee \u2019s reliance on the continued application of the DATE limit . As Article CARDINAL of LAW was framed as an exception to the rule and in the light of the procedural guarantees which attached to it , its retrospective application was not disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court further found that a person \u2019s human dignity as enshrined in LAW did not impose a constitutional requirement that there be a fixed maximum period for a convicted person \u2019s preventive detention . The person \u2019s dignity was not violated even by a long period of preventive detention if this was necessary owing to the continued danger which he or she posed . However , the aim of preventive detention had to be to rehabilitate detainees and to lay the foundations for a responsible life outside prison . Human dignity required laws and enforcement programmes which gave detainees real prospects of regaining their freedom .", "CARDINAL . Preventive detention in its present form met these requirements . The courts responsible for the execution of sentences had , in particular , to examine before the end of a convicted person \u2019s prison term ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) and subsequently at least DATE ( LAW CARDINAL of LAW ) whether the measure could be suspended . If DATE had been spent in preventive detention , they declared the measure terminated under Article QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW if no specific dangers remained . In practice , persons in preventive detention were released after having spent a certain length of time in prison .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG found that the prohibition on being removed from the jurisdiction of the lawful judge , as guaranteed by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . In FAC , persons in preventive detention like the applicant are placed in a separate building from prisoners serving their sentence . They have certain privileges compared with convicted offenders serving their sentence . For instance , they have the right to wear and wash their own clothes and have more pocket money . They can practise sport in a separate sports room and may stay outside in the yard for TIME every day . They may equip their more comfortable cells with additional furniture and equipment and have longer visiting TIME .", "CARDINAL . As to measures aimed at reintegration into society , persons held in preventive detention in FAC , like those detained in other prisons , are offered a DATE discussion group which proposes ideas for recreational activities and for structuring DATE life . Furthermore , there are individual discussions to improve the detainee \u2019s integration into the group and a residential group DATE aimed , inter alia , at motivating detainees to accept the treatment on offer . Where it is considered appropriate , detainees are offered individual therapy sessions with an external therapist or group therapy in the socio - therapeutic facility of another prison . The detainee may also request a consultation with the psychologist or social worker in charge in order to deal with crisis situations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has been receiving therapy since he was placed in preventive detention . Since DATE he has had therapy sessions with a psychologist in FAC . From DATE he also had regular individual therapy sessions with an external psychologist . At that point , the therapy was considered to have been completed and no longer necessary . In addition , the applicant has been examined by psychiatrists at regular intervals in order to evaluate his dangerousness and to permit relaxation of the prison regime as appropriate . As to relaxation of the conditions of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention , he is currently granted short periods of leave under escort ( PERSON ) a few times per year . He also receives regular visits ( on average CARDINAL times per month ) from his fianc\u00e9e , to whom he has been engaged since DATE . He has been working , with a short interruption , in prison and is currently working in the prison \u2019s metal workshop , with net earnings of CARDINAL to CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) per month .", "CARDINAL . According to a psychiatric expert report and an additional psychological report drawn up in DATE , the applicant had made important steps towards reintegration into society , in particular by turning away from his criminal identity , which he had developed since his childhood , and by trying to think before acting . His new relationship with his fianc\u00e9e could be seen as a further positive development and would also improve his social circumstances in the event of his release from prison . However , this trend had not yet stabilised and a lack of loyalty and empathy towards others as well as a dangerous impulsiveness , which had manifested itself again when the applicant had punched a fellow detainee in the face following a dispute concerning a baking tin in DATE , persisted . The expert recommended maintaining and cautiously extending the current measures to relax the conditions of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . The German Criminal Code distinguishes between penalties ( GPE ) and socalled measures of correction and prevention ( Ma\u00dfregeln der Besserung und GPE ) to deal with unlawful acts . This twin - track system of sanctions , the introduction of which had been considered and discussed since DATE , was incorporated into LAW by the PERSON on dealing with dangerous habitual offenders and on measures of correction and prevention ( PERSON gegen gef\u00e4hrliche PERSON und \u00fcber Ma\u00dfregeln der PERSON ) of DATE . The rules on preventive detention remained in force , essentially unchanged , after DATE and underwent several reforms enacted by the legislator from DATE onwards .", "CARDINAL . Penalties ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) consist mainly of prison sentences and fines . The penalty is fixed according to the defendant \u2019s guilt ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Measures of correction and prevention ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) consist mainly of placement in a psychiatric hospital ( LAW ) or a detoxification facility ( LAW ) or in preventive detention ( LAW ) . The purpose of these measures is to rehabilitate dangerous offenders or to protect the public from them . They may be ordered for offenders in addition to their punishment ( compare Articles CARDINAL et seq . ) . They must , however , be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by , or to be expected from , the defendants as well as to their dangerousness ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The temporal applicability of provisions of the Criminal Code depends on whether they relate to penalties or measures of correction and prevention . The penalty is determined by the law which is in force at the time of the act ( LAW ) ; if the law in force on completion of the act is amended before the court \u2019s judgment , the more lenient law applies ( LAW ) . On the other hand , decisions on measures of correction and prevention are based on the law in force at the time of the decision unless the law provides otherwise ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The sentencing court may , at the time of the offender \u2019s conviction , order his preventive detention under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public ( see LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALc of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which are not executed immediately after the judgment ordering them becomes final . Paragraph CARDINAL of the LAW provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention , the court responsible for the execution of sentences ( that is , a special ORG composed of CARDINAL professional judges ; see sections ORG and CARDINAL ) of LAW ) must review , before completion of the prison term , whether the person \u2019s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective . If that is not the case , it suspends on probation the execution of the preventive detention order ; supervision of the person \u2019s conduct ( GPE ) commences with suspension .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the applicant \u2019s offence and his conviction , Article CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , was worded as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Detention in a detoxification facility may not exceed DATE and the first period of preventive detention may not exceed DATE . ...", "CARDINAL . NORP If there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time - limit has not yet expired , the court shall suspend further execution of the detention order on probation as soon as there are justifiable reasons for testing whether the detainee can be released without committing further unlawful acts .

Pursuant to LAW , the legislature is bound by the constitutional order , the executive and the judiciary by law and justice .", "CARDINAL . According to the well - established case - law of ORG , LAW read in conjunction with LAW of LAW protects legitimate expectations in a ORG governed by the rule of law . A law may be retrospective in the sense that , while its legal effects are not produced until it is published , its definition covers events \u201c set in motion \u201d before it is published ( so - called unechte PERSON ; see the decisions of ORG in the compendium of decisions of ORG ) , vol . DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , CARDINAL , and vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . and CARDINAL et seq . ) . In respect of retrospective laws in that sense , the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations are not given overall priority over the intention of the legislator to change the existing legal order in response to changing circumstances . The legislator may enact such retrospective laws if the importance of the purpose of the legislation for the common good outweighs the importance of the interest in protecting legitimate expectations ( see the judgment of ORG in the instant case , pp . DATE , with many references to its case - law ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , no one may be removed from the jurisdiction of the lawful judge .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , an act may be punished only if the fact of its being punishable was determined by law before the act was committed .", "CARDINAL . The ( Federal ) Execution of Sentences Act ( Strafvollzugsgesetz ) lays down rules for the execution of sentences of imprisonment in prisons and for the execution of measures of correction and prevention depriving the persons concerned of their liberty ( see section CARDINAL of the Act ) . Its provisions were applicable in all ORG until DATE ; since then , the ORG have had the power to legislate on these issues . In so far as they have already made use of this power , the provisions laid down by the L\u00e4nder on the execution of preventive detention orders do not differ significantly from those laid down in LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act deals with the purpose of the execution of sentences of imprisonment . During the execution of a sentence of imprisonment the detainee should become capable henceforth of leading a socially responsible life without committing offences ( purpose of execution ; first sentence ) . The execution of the sentence of imprisonment is also aimed at protecting the public from further offences ( second sentence ) .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW contain special rules for the execution of preventive detention orders . Section CARDINAL provides that persons held in preventive detention shall be detained in secure conditions for the protection of the public ( first sentence ) . They are to be given assistance in readjusting to life outside prison ( second sentence ) . Unless stipulated otherwise ( in sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the said Act ) , the provisions concerning the execution of prison sentences shall apply mutatis mutandis to preventive detention ( section CARDINAL of that Act ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , the equipment of the institutions in which persons are held in preventive detention , notably detention cells , and particular measures to promote their welfare , must be designed to help detainees to organise their life in the institution in a reasonable manner and to protect them from damage caused by a lengthy deprivation of liberty . Their personal needs are to be taken into account as far as possible . Section CARDINAL of the said LAW provides that detainees may wear their own clothes and use their own linen and bedding , unless this is prohibited for security reasons and provided they see to their cleaning , repair and regular changing at their own expense . Moreover , under section CARDINAL of the said Act , detainees are allowed to occupy themselves against payment if this serves the objective of imparting , maintaining or promoting skills needed for paid employment after their release .

According to the information and material before the ORG , the member ORG have chosen different ways of shielding the public from convicted offenders who acted with full criminal responsibility at the time of the offence ( as did the applicant at the relevant time ) and who risk committing further serious offences on release from detention and therefore present a danger to the public .", "CARDINAL . Apart from GPE , CARDINAL seven other Convention States have adopted systems of preventive detention in respect of convicted offenders who are not considered to be of unsound mind , in other words , who acted with full criminal responsibility when committing their offence(s ) , and who are considered dangerous to the public as they are liable to reoffend . These include GPE ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . and CARDINAL et seq . of LAW , and ORG CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) , GPE ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) , GPE ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) , GPE ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . and CARDINAL of LAW and Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) , GPE ( see PERSON . of FAC ) , GPE ( see Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of GPE ) and GPE ( see Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) . Preventive detention in these GPE is ordered , as a rule , by the sentencing courts and is generally executed after the persons concerned have served their prison sentences ( with the exception of GPE , where preventive detention is ordered instead of a prison sentence ) . The GPE dangerousness is reviewed on a periodic basis and they are released on probation if they are no longer dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . As to the place and duration of the placement , persons subject to preventive detention are placed in special institutions in GPE ( see LAW ) , GPE ( see LAW ) , GPE ( see PERSON . of FAC ) , GPE ( see LAW of LAW ) and GPE ( see LAW ) . Even though NORP law also stipulates that preventive detention is to be served in special institutions ( compare Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) , it appears that in practice these institutions no longer exist and that the persons concerned are kept in ordinary prisons under a special detention regime . Dangerous offenders in preventive detention in GPE are also kept in ordinary prisons under a special detention regime . In GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ( see the express provisions of LAW ) and GPE , the applicable provisions do not fix a maximum duration of preventive detention .

As regards the temporal applicability of the provisions on preventive detention , it is to be noted that , according to the wording of the applicable provisions in some of the GPE concerned , they may be applied retrospectively . Thus , pursuant to LAW , a decision on preventive measures is to be based on the law in force at the time of their execution , and pursuant to LAW of LAW , these decisions are to be based on the law in force at the time of the decision ordering the security measure . Under LAW of LAW , the question whether an offence is to be punished by preventive detention is decided by applying the law in force at the time of the judgment in the criminal proceedings . FAC likewise does not prohibit the retrospective application of preventive measures . By contrast , retrospective application appears to be prohibited in respect of preventive detention measures pursuant to Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL et seq . of both the NORP and ORG and under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . In many other GPE , there is no system of preventive detention and offenders\u2019 dangerousness is taken into account both in the determination and in the execution of their sentence . On the one hand , prison sentences are increased in the light of offenders\u2019 dangerousness , notably in cases of recidivism . In this respect it is to be noted that , unlike the courts in the majority of GPE , the sentencing courts in GPE expressly distinguish between the punitive and the preventive part of a life sentence . The retributive or tariff period is fixed to reflect the punishment of the offender . Once the retributive part of the sentence has been served , a prisoner is considered as being in custody serving the preventive part of his sentence and may be released on probation if he poses no threat to society ( see , inter alia , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE and CARDINAL of ORG . On the other hand , offenders\u2019 dangerousness generally has an influence both on their conditions of detention and on their chances of benefiting from a reduction of their sentence or from release on probation .", "CARDINAL . As regards the distinction between penalties and preventive measures in GPE and the consequences drawn from the qualification of the sanction in question , it must be noted that the same type of measure may be qualified as an additional penalty in CARDINAL ORG and as a preventive measure in another . Thus , the supervision of a person \u2019s conduct after release , for example , is an additional penalty under ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL et seq . of LAW and a preventive measure under LAW and CARDINAL of the NORP LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , GPE DATE on post - sentence preventive detention and diminished criminal responsibility due to mental deficiency ( PERSON relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9tention de s\u00fbret\u00e9 et \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration d\u2019irresponsabilit\u00e9 p\u00e9nale pour cause de trouble mental ) has introduced preventive detention into LANGUAGE law . Under Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW Code of Criminal Procedure , this measure may be ordered against particularly dangerous offenders who pose a high risk of recidivism because they suffer from a serious personality disorder . ORG , in its decision of DATE ( no . PERCENT , ORG ) of DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , found that such preventive detention , which was not based on the guilt of the person convicted but was designed to prevent persons from reoffending , could not be qualified as a penalty ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of the decision ) . To that extent , it thus took the same view as ORG in respect of preventive detention under NORP law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) . Nevertheless , in view of its custodial nature , the time it may last , the fact that it is indefinitely renewable and the fact that it is ordered after conviction by a court , ORG considered that post - sentence preventive detention could not be ordered retrospectively against persons convicted of offences committed prior to the publication of LAW ( \u00a7 CARDINAL of the decision ) . In this respect , it came to a different conclusion than ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and also paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "DATE . ORG Commissioner for Human Rights , Mr PERSON , stated the following in his report on his visit to GPE from CARDINAL to CARDINAL and from DATE ( CommDH(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) regarding the issue of what he referred to as \u201c secured custody \u201d ( GPE ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . During the visit , the Commissioner discussed the issue of secured custody with several ORG authorities , judges and medical experts . The Commissioner is aware of the public pressure judges and medical experts are exposed to when they make decisions regarding the release of a person who might recommit a serious crime . It is impossible to predict with full certainty whether a person will actually reoffend . Psychiatrists regularly assess the behaviour of an imprisoned person who might act differently outside the prison . In addition , it is difficult to foresee all the conditions that wait for the offender outside the prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Commissioner calls for an extremely considerate application of secured custody . Alternative measures should also be considered before recourse to secured custody is taken . The Commissioner is concerned about the rising number of people deprived of their liberty under secured custody . He encourages the NORP authorities to commission independent studies on the implementation of secured custody in order to evaluate the measure in terms of protecting the general public and its impact on the detained individual .", "...", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the Commissioner was informed that persons kept under secured custody regularly experience a loss of future perspective and give up on themselves . This would appear to call for the provision of psychological or psychiatric care . The medical opinion may occasionally be divided on the efficacy of care provided to persons kept under secured custody , yet the possibility of their eventual rehabilitation and release should not be excluded . Accordingly , people held under secured custody should receive adequate medical treatment or other care that addresses their specific situation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its report to ORG on its visit to GPE from DATE to DATE ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL of DATE ) , ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) made the following findings in respect of ORG \u201d ( GPE ) in FAC :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Material conditions in the unit were of a good or even very good standard , with several particularly positive elements : well equipped single rooms with sanitary annexes ; a light and reasonably spacious communal environment ; a small kitchen with equipment for inmates to prepare hot drinks and light snacks , and an area where washing , drying and ironing could be done .", "CARDINAL . In principle , inmates had access to the same activities as ordinary prisoners ( in terms of work , education , etc . ) . In addition , in accordance with the relevant legislation , inmates benefited from a number of special privileges . In particular , cell doors remained open throughout DATE , and inmates were granted additional entitlements for visits ( TIME instead of TIME ) , outdoor exercise ( TIME instead of TIME on non - working days ) , the supply of parcels ( CARDINAL rather than DATE ) and pocket money ( if there was no work ) . It is also noteworthy that all inmates had unrestricted access to the telephone .", "CARDINAL . In theory , at least , the unit offered opportunities for a positive custodial living environment . However , not all inmates were capable of making the best of these opportunities , which was not surprising if CARDINAL takes into account that , according to medical staff , most if not all of the inmates were suffering from multiple personality disorders . The vast majority of inmates were completely demotivated , with CARDINAL taking any outdoor exercise , CARDINAL working full - time and CARDINAL part - time . CARDINAL inmates were offered work , but were not willing to take part in it . Thus , the vast majority of inmates was idling away their time alone in their cells , occupying themselves with watching TV or playing video games .", "Even among those inmates who apparently assumed and coped with the responsibility for their DATE lives on the unit , the sense was that the activities were strategies to pass time , without any real purpose . As might be expected , this appeared to be related to their indefinite GPE . Several inmates interviewed expressed a clear sense that they would never get out and one stated that the only thing he could do was prepare himself to die .", "CARDINAL . According to the prison administration , staff worked according to special treatment criteria , the aim being the individual \u2019s release from placement in GPE ; the focus was to minimise the risk to the general public , as well as to deal with the physical and psychological effects of long - term custody . Yet , the delegation observed that in practice , staff ( including the social worker ) were conspicuous by their absence in this unit , thereby keeping staff - inmate contacts to a minimum .", "...", "CARDINAL . Even for the other inmates who were apparently coping better with their situation , the lack of staff engagement on the unit was not justifiable . Allowing inmates responsibility and a degree of independence does not imply that staff should leave them to their own devices . The duty of care can not be ignored , particularly in relation to such a special group of inmates . The delegation gained the distinct impression that the staff themselves were not clear as to how to approach their work with these inmates . As well as empowering inmates to take charge of their lives in custody , there is a need for ongoing support to deal with indefinite detention , as well as to address the legacy of serious past histories of aberrant behaviour and apparent psychological problems . Psychological care and support appeared to be seriously inadequate ; the ORG recommends that immediate steps be taken to remedy this shortcoming .", "CARDINAL . The difficult question of how to implement in practice a humane and coherent policy regarding the treatment of persons placed in GPE needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency at the highest level . Working with this group of inmates is bound to be one of the hardest challenges facing prison staff .", "Due to the potentially indefinite stay for the small ( but growing ) number of inmates held under GPE , there needs to be a particularly clear vision of the objectives in this unit and of how those objectives can be realistically achieved . The approach requires a high level of care involving a team of multi - disciplinary staff , intensive work with inmates on an individual basis ( via promptly - prepared individualised plans ) , within a coherent framework for progression towards release , which should be a real option . The system should also allow for the maintenance of family contacts , when appropriate .", "The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities institute an immediate review of the approach to GPE at FAC and , if appropriate , in other establishments in GPE accommodating persons subject to GPE , in the light of the above remarks . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
