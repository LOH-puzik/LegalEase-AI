THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON Fours Walderode , was a NORP and NORP national . He was born in DATE and died on DATE . On DATE the applicant 's widow , PERSON , took her late husband 's place in the proceedings before the ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant 's stepmother and his CARDINAL stepbrothers , all NORP nationals , owned real estate in former GPE . In DATE the property was confiscated under Presidential Decrees nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which entered into force on DATE and DATE respectively .", "The applicant 's stepmother died in DATE leaving her real estate to the applicant , and conferring the succession rights of her deceased sons on the applicant . She had never acquired NORP citizenship .", "The applicant left GPE in DATE , thereby forfeiting his NORP citizenship , and returned in DATE . He was granted NORP citizenship in DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a claim for restitution of the property confiscated from his stepmother and stepbrothers under Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and which had been sold by his father before the Second World War . He referred to LAW of DATE , claiming that he had inherited the property .", "On DATE the GPE nad ORG , referring to the documentary evidence , dismissed his claim on the ground that his stepmother and stepbrothers had not been loyal to the NORP State during the NORP occupation and had not acquired NORP citizenship after the Second World War . It found , with reference to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , that the applicant was not the owner of the property , as his stepmother and stepbrothers had not satisfied the requirements for restitution , and that the applicant 's claim in respect of his father 's former property fell outside the scope of the restitution legislation .", "On DATE ORG , having assessed a substantial amount of documentary evidence and having heard the parties to the dispute , upheld ORG decision . It stated , inter alia , that LAW of DATE an heir acquired an estate only upon its distribution ; thus the dates of the acquisition of the estate and the death of a testator were different . In fact , from the death of a testator until the time of distribution of the estate , the property was to be regarded as hereditas iacens . According to the court , real estate could be lawfully confiscated in the period between the death of the testator and the time of acceptance of the estate by an heir . The court held that the property at issue had been confiscated ex lege by Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL from the applicant 's stepbrothers , NORP nationals , after they had died but whilst they had still been the notional owners of the estate . As the original owners , including the applicant 's stepmother , had not reacquired NORP citizenship as provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , the applicant could not be considered to be entitled to restitution .", "On DATE ORG dismissed a constitutional appeal by the applicant as unsubstantiated , stating in particular that , under LAW of DATE , which had been applicable at the relevant time , an heir acquired the estate upon its distribution . In the present case the time of acquisition of the estate and the death of the testator did not fall within the same period . In order to transfer the estate to an heir , special proceedings before the national courts had to be instituted of the court 's own motion . If such proceedings were not instituted , the estate was hereditas iacens until delivery of a court judgment . Heirs who wished to acquire the estate had to submit an application within the framework of those proceedings . The estate was considered to remain in the possession of the testator until acquired by an heir . The court observed that , in the present case , the confiscation had taken place when the applicant 's stepbrothers died . However , the estate had not yet been administered by the national authorities and , therefore , the applicant had not acquired the property at issue . Moreover , as the stepbrothers had not been entitled to claim restitution of the property under LAW , and since the applicant 's stepmother had been of NORP origin and had never acquired NORP citizenship , the applicant himself was not entitled to claim restitution pursuant to LAW .", "( a ) In DATE the applicant instituted inheritance proceedings in GPE in respect of the property claimed in the above restitution proceedings . On DATE CARDINAL certificates of succession were issued to the effect that the applicant was the universal heir of his stepbrothers .", "( b ) On DATE the relevant NORP authority issued a document certifying that the applicant 's stepbrothers had not served in the ORG .", "( c ) The applicant was the owner of real estate in ORG . This was confiscated from him under Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . In DATE the former local authority acknowledged the confiscation and granted him leave to appeal to ORG .", "( d ) On DATE ORG , considering the applicant 's communication ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) concerning the ORG real estate , held that LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , had been violated by GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
