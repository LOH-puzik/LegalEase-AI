{"ITEMID": "001-22793", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "COLLINS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in ORG . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , counsel practising in GPE , and PERSON , a solicitor practising in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant , now aged DATE , is microcephalic , has spasticity to her lower limbs and is autistic . She has limited verbal skills and has been assessed as having the mental age of CARDINAL and a half years .", "From DATE , she was resident in a longstay hospital for the mentally handicapped . In DATE , she was moved to live in ORG , a purpose built complex of CARDINAL bungalows and communal facilities for severely disabled adults which forms a unit within the grounds of ORG , ORG . At the time of her move , the applicants and others who were also moved at this time were promised a \u201c home for life \u201d at ORG .", "In DATE , ORG ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) issued proposals for consultation which would result in the provision at ORG ceasing and the site being used for CARDINAL assessment / treatment and forensic beds . It was envisaged that the current residents would be transferred to social care in the community by DATE .", "During the period of consultation , the applicant \u2019s parents wrote to the ORG complaining of this intention to renege on its promise to provide a home for life for the applicant at ORG . The applicant \u2019s parents took the view , as later set out in their judicial review application , that the applicant would be adversely affected by the change to her routine and environment and that the applicant was adamant that she wished to remain in ORG .", "On DATE , the ORG considered the outcome of the consultation process , whose proposals had been supported by ORG but opposed by the ORG carers . While they agreed to proposals to transfer provision for the residents to \u201c ORG \u201d they deferred a decision about the future use of the site and sought legal advice concerning the \u201c home for life \u201d promises allegedly made to the residents . It was acknowledged by the ORG , in face of the consistent statements by the families of PERSON residents , that there was a possibility that such had been given to some of the residents .", "The ORG were given advice by solicitors that :", "\u201c The view is that \u2018 home for life\u2019 does not necessarily mean a \u2018 home for life\u2019 at a particular hospital or place of residence ; rather a \u2018 home for life\u2019 by reference to the needs of those individuals being met appropriately . Their need at the time that any decision is made to transfer them to other accommodation must be taken into account as must their own wishes . \u201d", "On DATE , the ORG took the decision to stop the provision of long term care beds at PERSON and to transfer the future care of the residents to ORG , with due regard to working closely with the users of the services , their relatives and carers in the shape and design of new services to replace those long term care beds .", "The applicant took judicial proceedings through her mother and litigation friend , alleging inter alia that the ORG had failed to respect the promise made to the applicant of a home for life at ORG , that the ORG had failed to assess her needs prior to deciding to move her and failed to give rational reasons for the decision to resile from the promise .", "In his judgment of DATE , the Deputy High Court judge rejected all the applicant \u2019s arguments . He found that the decision reflected the government policy which was to encourage the removal of persons with learning disabilities away from long term care in institutions , particularly where there was no need for the use of health resources , since the view was being taken that it would benefit the individual by promoting their independence , choice and civil rights . The decision was not taken on an erroneous view that all persons in institutional care had to be moved but was based on an assessment of the personal circumstances of the residents in this case . The judge was also satisfied that the authority did properly take into account the strong preference of the applicant and her family that she should continue to live at PERSON . While the ORG regarded this as a weighty factor , they nonetheless concluded that it would be very much in the interests of the applicant to move into the community as she had no health needs requiring a hospital setting and her autonomy and progress would be enhanced by the move . He referred to the evidence of the consultant psychiatrist , according to whom previous patients moved into community homes had made impressive progress in health , behaviour , social skills and communication , and to his opinion that such a move would have a positive impact . He considered that there was no failure in assessment of the applicant \u2019s situation as the consultant psychiatrist and the ORG were entitled to rely on their experience of the applicant to conclude that she would be able to adjust well to a move with adequate support without seeking a specific psychological assessment of the impact of the change . As regarded the giving of the promise of \u201c a home for life \u201d , the judge found that the local health authority \u2019s approach had accorded with legal requirements of giving due consideration to the promise - they had quite properly taken legal advice on the point \u2013 and that they had been entitled to decide to move the applicant in light of their conclusion that she would benefit positively from the move . He concluded :", "\u201c For similar reasons , I am satisfied that the assessment ... of the benefits to [ the applicant ] of moving her out of ORG care and the [ ORG \u2019s ] decision to act on those views , mean that the interference with [ the applicant \u2019s ] right to respect for her home is justified under LAW . The [ ORG ] are entitled to a degree of deference in relation to such a decision and I can not say that their decision is a breach of LAW , in the particular circumstances of [ the applicant \u2019s ] case , having regard , again , as I have mentioned , to the fact that moving [ the applicant ] will promote other aspects of her rights as a citizen in the community . \u201d", "The applicant applied for permission to appeal against this decision . A single judge of ORG refused permission finding that the judge had reached the right decision for the right reasons . ORG refused the renewed application on DATE , finding that the judge had taken into account all relevant matters and that his approach to the issues could not be faulted ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
