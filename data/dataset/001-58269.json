The applicants , CARDINAL sisters and a brother , own a farmhouse and adjoining land , which they use for agricultural purposes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as part of the implementation of the general development plan adopted pursuant to Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , GPE ( \" the Municipality \" ) issued an order , under an expedited procedure , for the possession of the applicants ' land , which was located in a zone intended for the construction of low - cost and social housing ( \" edilizia economica e popolare \" ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE took physical possession of the land , aided by the police . On DATE ORG issued an expropriation order .", "CARDINAL . From the outset the applicants challenged the lawfulness of the measures taken by the authorities ; they brought several actions in the administrative courts and in the ordinary civil courts .", "A. Action for possession in the ordinary civil courts", "CARDINAL . On DATE they applied to ORG ( pretore ) seeking the restitution of their land on the ground that the order for possession under the expedited procedure of CARDINAL DATE had been executed after the expiry of the statutory time - limit ( DATE ) .", "By an interim decision of DATE , the ORG found for the applicants . GPE did not comply with the decision .", "On DATE the ORG reversed its earlier interim decision because in the meantime the expropriation order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had legalised the occupation of the land . It ruled nevertheless that the taking of possession of the land on DATE had been unlawful and amounted to an act of theft . It ordered the Municipality to pay compensation for the damage sustained by the applicants on this account .", "CARDINAL . GPE contested its liability to pay compensation and , on DATE , appealed to ORG , which , on DATE , upheld the impugned decision . The text of the judgment was deposited in the registry on CARDINAL DATE .", "", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the CARDINAL cooperatives responsible for carrying out the building work ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had brought an action against the applicants seeking compensation for the damage deriving from the delay to the property development scheme caused by the proceedings brought by the applicants .", "B.

Following the joinder of these different proceedings , the ORG quashed , on DATE , the various administrative measures - including the expropriation order - , but found that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the lawfulness of the taking of possession of the applicants ' land on DATE ; it took the view that this question was a matter for the ordinary courts . The text of its decision was deposited in the registry on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The LOC appealed to the PERSON , which , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited in the registry on CARDINAL DATE , upheld the ORG 's decision .", "C. Enforcement proceedings", "CARDINAL . In the administrative courts", "CARDINAL . As the Municipality failed to comply with the latter decision , the applicants instituted proceedings in the Consiglio di Stato .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Consiglio di Stato found that it lacked jurisdiction and remitted the case to ORG .", "On DATE the applicants applied to the ORG , which , on DATE , found partly in their favour , holding in substance that the annulment by the PERSON of the contested expropriation measures had the effect of imposing a duty on the GPE to return immediately the part of the land that it had occupied on which no buildings had been erected , namely QUANTITY . It accordingly ordered that the land in question be returned", "to the applicants within DATE . In respect of the remaining parcels of land , on which residential accommodation had been built in the meantime , the ORG held that it had no jurisdiction to order enforcement , because even before the annulment of the expropriation , the GPE had transferred the land in question to CARDINAL building ORG . As a result physical possession of the property had passed to the members of the CARDINAL cooperatives . As the latter were private citizens , neither the GPE nor the ORG was empowered to make any order whatsoever in regard to enforcement .

They also claimed compensation for the damage sustained .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on CARDINAL DATE judgment was reserved . On CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the notice served on the Municipality invalid on the ground that although the ORG judgment had quashed the measures adopted in connection with the expropriation , it was not automatically enforceable . At the same time the court partly allowed the applicants ' cross - action in so far as it related to compensation for damage and the restitution of the land .", "CARDINAL . By a writ served on CARDINAL DATE , the GPE appealed .", "On DATE judgment was reserved . On DATE ORG partly set aside the impugned decision pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \" the DATE Law \" - the socalled \" PERSON \" ) . This law , which came into force on DATE , gave legislative force to a principle laid down by ORG ( in plenary session ) in its judgment no .

On DATE ORG adjourned the hearing to a later date .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited in the registry on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appeal court had correctly applied the DATE Law in the case before it because the applicants had not yet obtained a final decision ordering GPE to return the land which had been built on .", "CARDINAL . In addition , on DATE , in connection with the proceedings instituted by the ORG in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ORG raised , on the applicants ' motion , an objection based on the unconstitutional nature of section CARDINAL of the DATE Law .

On DATE ORG , finding that the GPE alone was liable for the occupation and the resulting damage , awarded the applicants MONEY less the MONEY ( reassessed at CARDINAL to take account of monetary depreciation ) paid by the defendant as an advance in DATE . They were also awarded MONEY for lawyers ' fees and expenses . The judgment was deposited in the registry on CARDINAL DATE . It was declared enforceable on DATE and was served on GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the sums in question should be paid to the applicants . The first sum plus statutory interest up to the probable date of payment ( DATE ) totalled MONEY .", "CARDINAL .
