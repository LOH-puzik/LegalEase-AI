In DATE ORG won the parliamentary elections .

It appears that UV \u2019s proposal was not followed up .", "CARDINAL . On DATE UV brought a civil action against the ORG , challenging the change of CEO on the ground that it was contrary to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG brought its own action against UV , seeking the annulment of the contract of DATE by which the company had been created ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The grounds relied upon by the ORG were , inter alia , that the documents of incorporation were not in conformity with Government decisions and that the applicant did not have legal capacity to be a partner in the company .", "CARDINAL . UV contested the ORG \u2019s action , arguing , inter alia , that it had legal capacity and that , under LAW , companies with foreign investments were not bound by Government decisions but exclusively by laws enacted by ORG .

UV appealed against the judgment , but its appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . No new reasons were given by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The decision of ORG of DATE became final and shortly thereafter the company was reorganised and reregistered as a ORG - owned airline company called ORG .

UV also stated that if the money was not paid , it would take all the necessary measures up to sequestration of ORG aircraft on NORP territory .", "CARDINAL .

It found , inter alia , that UV had invested MONEY in the statutory fund of the company , representing PERCENT of the capital , which , at the date of the examination by ORG , was entirely paid up by UV . The decision of ORG was published in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied to UV \u2019s letter of DATE indicating that since it was not the beneficiary of the investment , it could not pay .", "CARDINAL . Since ORG of immovable property was refusing to reregister some of the assets of the former NORP company in the name of the reorganised ORG - owned company on the ground of lack of clarity of the judgment of DATE , the ORG made a request to ORG , on DATE , asking it to clarify the judgment in that respect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE UV addressed a similar request to ORG asking , inter alia , for clarification of the reason for ordering an audit and accounting control once the size of the investment was known to the parties . It also asked who was to carry out the control and whether it should be a national , international , governmental or non - governmental organisation . It finally asked about the time - limit for carrying out the control and explanation of the phrase in the judgment \u201c with the participation of UV \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s request and ordered that the assets be reregistered in its name . At the same time , referring to UV \u2019s request , the court argued that the operative part of the judgment was clear enough as concerned the restitution of UV \u2019s investment and that since the court had not been presented [ during the proceedings ] with evidence establishing the exact amount , an audit control was ordered so that its amount could be established and repaid to UV .", "CARDINAL . After the communication of this case to the Government , on DATE , the ORG wrote to UV proposing to hold a meeting within DATE in order to agree upon the method of enforcement of the judgment of DATE . In particular , it stressed that it was necessary to agree upon the audit company to be employed , the costs of the audit and the questions to be put to the auditor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE UV \u2019s representative replied that he was ready to meet the ORG \u2019s representatives and that he was available on any date except CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a meeting between the representatives of the ORG , ORG and UV took place and it was agreed that the first CARDINAL would formulate questions to be put to the auditor and send them to UV for comments . UV \u2019s representative expressed his disagreement with the proposal of the other parties that the company should contribute to the costs of the audit control . He argued that , according to the judgment , the audit control was to be carried out by the Government , ORG and the ORG , while UV was only to \u201c participate \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG wrote to ORG asking it to clarify the judgment of DATE , namely to clarify who was to organise the audit and accounting control and what was the required extent of involvement of the ORG , ORG , the ORG and UV . The ORG also asked for clarification as to which company was to carry out the control , what the questions to be put to it were and who was to pay for the audit control . It appears that ORG never examined this request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE UV \u2019s representative received from the ORG a set of questions to be put to the auditor . The questions raised such issues as ORG financial state at the time of its reorganisation into a NORP company , its financial evolution , the impact on the company of the contract for the purchase of ORG aeroplanes , the manner in which UV \u2019s investment was used , the company \u2019s financial state at the date when the contract of association was declared null and void and the amount which should be restituted to UV . The ORG also proposed that the audit control be carried out by ORG and that the costs of the control should be divided between all the parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE UV \u2019s representative wrote back to the ORG and argued that the questions proposed were not consistent with the operative part of the judgment of DATE and with the decision of CARDINAL DATE , since DATE according to them \u2013 the audit control was intended to establish the amount of money invested by UV in order to refund it , but not such issues as the impact of the contracts concluded by the company during its existence . He also argued that the financial evolution of the company was irrelevant for the purpose of putting the parties \u201c in the same position as they had been prior to the conclusion of the contract \u201d . UV proposed CARDINAL questions which , in its view , were consistent with the operative part of the judgment of DATE and which raised such issues as finding out the exact amount of UV \u2019s investment and of the default interest due to UV for the inability to use it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG invited the representative of UV to another meeting to be held on DATE . The representative declined the invitation , however , on the ground that he was busy on that date . He asked the ORG to notify him of meetings DATE in advance .", "DATE . On DATE the ORG lodged an application with ORG asking it to amend the wording of its judgment of DATE and arguing that the operative part differed from that pronounced orally on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s application and amended the operative part ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , as suggested by the ORG , by deleting the words \u201c audit \u201d and \u201c with the participation of \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vice - President of ORG wrote to ORG informing him , inter alia , that if UV possessed evidence to establish the amount of its investment then , in order to recover the money , it should have given the evidence to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a meeting was held between the representatives of the ORG , the ORG , UV , ORG and the ORG - owned company ORG at which the representatives of the ORG insisted on the same questions as proposed to UV on DATE . Moreover , this time they proposed that the audit control be carried out by ORG under the control of ORG . UV \u2019s representative agreed with the questions but expressed concerns about the independence of the auditor proposed by the representatives of the ORG . Finally , UV \u2019s representative agreed with the proposed auditor , subject to the request to have sight of all the documents which were to be given to it .", "CARDINAL . It appears that UV was not sent the documents submitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the latter drew up a \u201c technical - scientific \u201d report . Initially the report was to be signed by the Minister of ORG , as ordered by the Prime Minister of GPE . However , the Minister of Justice wrote to the Prime Minister expressing her view that the applicant company could contest the independence and the impartiality of ORG on the ground that it was subordinated to ORG . She expressed the view that the report would be more credible if signed by the experts who had drafted it but not by her . Her proposal was accepted and the report was signed by the experts .", "CARDINAL . The conclusion of the report was , inter alia , that UV had invested ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in ORG , but since that money had been paid as an advance to the NORP aircraft manufacturer , it could be repaid to UV only after ORG had recovered it or when the Embraer aeroplanes were delivered to ORG . Moreover , the report stated that the money invested by UV had not been used by ORG in its business activity , so UV could not lay claim to any part of the profit gained during DATE and could not be held liable for any part of the losses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision concerning the creation of the statutory fund of the NORP - German Airline Company Air Moldova . It found , inter alia , that some documents had been destroyed in accordance with the law , while others were contradictory , and decided to remit the materials to ORG for investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG wrote to ORG and asked again for clarification of the manner of enforcement of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued again an explanatory judgment in which it explained that the parties should recover all the assets and moneys with which they had participated in the company and that any profit obtained by the company during its existence should be divided among them in accordance with the percentage of their participation .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , after the case was declared admissible by the ORG , the parties agreed to contract a foreign audit company for the purpose of determining the amount due to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government and the applicant company signed an agreement with ORG . The parties agreed to accept without any reserves the results of the report which was due by DATE . According to its mandate , ORG was to determine the amounts to be refunded to the founders in proportion to their shareholdings as at DATE and in accordance with ORG and the pertinent court decisions . The mandate did not provide for the conversion of the amounts to a particular currency and for the calculation of any interest on the amounts due .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a report in which it determined that the applicant company had invested ORG in the share capital of the company and that the part of the profit to which it was entitled amounted to MDL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) as at DATE . It appears from the parties\u2019 submissions that they both accepted the report without any reservations . Nonetheless , in view of the diverging opinions concerning the interest due , the applicant company has not been refunded to date .", "CARDINAL .
