ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression-{general} (Article 10-1 - Freedom to impart information)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Guido Raimondi;Kristina Pardalos;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is the editor of a local online newspaper in the province of GPE . The other CARDINAL applicants are journalists working for the newspaper .", "CARDINAL . In the course of their activities , the applicants used radio equipment to access frequencies used by the police or the carabinieri . This enabled them to learn of any communications transmitted in that way , so that they could arrive quickly on the scene when wishing to report on specific incidents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants listened in on a conversation during which the ORG carabinieri operations centre decided to send a patrol to a location where , according to anonymous sources , weapons had been stored illegally .", "CARDINAL . The carabinieri accordingly went to the location mentioned , and the second and third applicants arrived on the scene immediately afterwards .", "CARDINAL . Having obtained a search warrant , the carabinieri searched the applicants\u2019 car , finding CARDINAL frequency - modulation transmitter / receivers that were capable of intercepting police radio communications .", "CARDINAL . The carabinieri then went to the CARDINAL ORG editorial office and seized CARDINAL fixed radio receivers , which were tuned to the frequencies used by the carabinieri . Other frequencies used by police operations centres were stored in the GPE memory .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were instituted against the first and second applicants for illegally installing equipment designed to intercept communications between law - enforcement agencies\u2019 operations centres and patrols ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL bis and CARDINAL bis of LAW ) . The third applicant was charged with accessing the aforementioned communications ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL bis of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG acquitted the applicants . It held that the relevant Articles of the Criminal Code were to be interpreted in the light of DATE LAW , which only protected communications of a confidential nature .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the radio device used by the law - enforcement agencies was unable to ensure the confidentiality of the information it transmitted . Accordingly , the interception of the communications in question did not constitute an offence . Moreover , the possession and use of radio receivers were not prohibited as such .", "CARDINAL . The GPE principal public prosecutor and the GPE public prosecutor appealed . They argued that ORG interpretation was inconsistent with ORG case - law in such matters ( citing in particular judgment no . DATE of DATE ) and that the communications in issue were clearly confidential , bearing in mind the aims of ensuring public safety and protecting public order . In addition , the communications concerned the initial investigations following the commission of an offence . They were therefore subject to a confidentiality requirement pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP The confidential nature of the communications was also obvious from the fact that the carabinieri used coded language for communications concerning the location and the type of intervention , clearly seeking to ensure that no third parties had knowledge of the information being exchanged . In addition , the radiofrequencies involved had been exclusively assigned to operations centres by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in order to listen in on the conversations , the applicants had had to purchase special radio equipment , as ordinary equipment could not be used for this purpose . On the other hand , the fact that such devices were freely available on the market did not justify their use for intercepting conversations between law - enforcement officers .", "CARDINAL . In addition , in accordance with Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as in force at the material time , devices of this kind were intended to be purchased by amateur radio operators but could not be used to intercept police radiofrequencies . Lastly , ORG decree of CARDINAL DATE had expressly prohibited amateur radio operators from intercepting communications which they were not entitled to receive .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the first and second applicants guilty and sentenced them to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The third applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . ORG suspended the applicants\u2019 sentences .", "CARDINAL . It observed that LAW , as amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , had extended the scope of criminal responsibility to cover all remote data transmission , thus including the interception of conversations between the law - enforcement agencies\u2019 operations centres and patrols .", "CARDINAL . Such communications were , moreover , clearly confidential . Reiterating all the arguments put forward by the GPE and GPE public prosecutors , particularly regarding the aims of ensuring public safety and protecting public order , ORG held that LAW was also at issue in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG . They contended that the communications in question had been transmitted on unencrypted frequencies and thus could not be treated as confidential . Furthermore , they had been acting in a professional capacity as journalists , and their actions were therefore justified under LAW and in terms of freedom of the press .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG found against the applicants , upholding ORG position as to the confidential nature of the communications and reiterating that this interpretation was consistent with its own approach in similar cases , particularly in judgments no . CARDINAL of DATE and no . DATE of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Addressing the applicants\u2019 argument concerning freedom of the press , ORG stated that the right to impart information , which they had relied on , might have prevailed over the public interests protected by criminal law in a case of alleged defamation . However , that right could not take precedence in a case concerning the illegal interception of communications between law - enforcement officers .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
