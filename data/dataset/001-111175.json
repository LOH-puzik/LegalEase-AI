FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing;Public hearing)", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;George Nicolaou;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . The applicant company has its seat also in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicants organised in DATE an ice fishing competition for which the entrance fee was QUANTITY . This was the seventh time that the competition had been organised by the applicants . They had rented in DATE a lake , into which they had put CARDINAL marked salmon . CARDINAL of them weighed QUANTITY , QUANTITY , QUANTITY and QUANTITY . The winners of the competition were those CARDINAL men and QUANTITY women who caught the most fish . In addition , anybody who caught a marked salmon would win a prize according to its weight . The fisher of the QUANTITY salmon would win MONEY , the fisher of a QUANTITY salmon would receive a gift certificate worth MONEY , the fisher of a QUANTITY salmon a gift certificate for QUANTITY and the fisher of a QUANTITY salmon a gift certificate of CARDINAL . Each participant could buy only one entrance ticket and was allowed to use CARDINAL rod and hook .", "CARDINAL . The ice fishing competition was a mass event in which CARDINAL persons participated . Of the CARDINAL marked salmon , CARDINAL were caught . The following gift certificates were given away : CARDINAL gift certificates , CARDINAL CARDINAL,CARDINAL-euro gift certificates and CARDINAL CARDINAL-euro gift certificates .", "CARDINAL . When the previous fishing competition had been organised in DATE , ORG had asked the applicant company to clarify the nature of the competition . It had concluded in DATE that the competition was to be considered partly as a lottery , within the meaning of LAW ( arpajaislaki , lotterilagen ) , in that the fishers of marked salmon would be given separate prizes . This interpretation was sent for information to the county administrative board ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninhallitus , l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) and the local police department . The fishing competition in DATE did not have any legal consequences for the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The preparations for the DATE event started in DATE and they involved a large number of local persons , including the police . ORG Interior again asked the applicant company to clarify the nature of the competition . On DATE the Ministry concluded that the event might constitute a lottery within the meaning of LAW . This view was communicated to the local police and the leading county police officials . The applicants duly informed the police about the event well in advance . The police never prohibited the event even though they had the right to do so if organising an event was illegal .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings were brought against the applicants in DATE . The public prosecutor brought charges against the first applicant , inter alia , for having organised , in connection with an ice fishing competition , a lottery without a proper permit because the outcome of the fishing competition was partly based on luck . Moreover , the public prosecutor asked that the profit gained from the offence committed by the applicant company be forfeited to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) , after having held an oral hearing , dismissed all charges against the first applicant as well the forfeiture request against the applicant company . The court found that the lottery had been illegal , but the fact that the provisions in question had not been clear , that similar events had been organised before and that the authorities had not prevented the event from taking place , led the court to conclude that the first applicant \u2019s misinterpretation of the law was excusable .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , reiterating his charges and requesting that an oral hearing be held . He requested that CARDINAL civil servants from ORG be heard about the role of ORG in general as well as in the present case , including the question of intent and the applicants\u2019 reactions to the ORG \u2019s queries and guidelines . As to the forfeiture , an oral hearing was needed in order to assess evidence and the amount of profit gained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants also lodged an appeal in respect of the costs and expenses and requested that an oral hearing be held . They wanted CARDINAL witnesses to be heard about the nature , content and organisation of the ice fishing competition . As to the forfeiture , they proposed to hear the applicant company \u2019s financial manager about the financial outcome of the competition . If no oral hearing was held , the applicants were to be given a possibility to submit further comments .", "CARDINAL . Both parties were given an opportunity to comment on the other party \u2019s letter of appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , inter alia , rejected the request for an oral hearing and sentenced the first applicant to DATE - fines ( CARDINAL ) in respect of the breach of lottery provisions . As to the oral hearing , the court found that the facts and their background were undisputed , the written correspondence between ORG and the applicants had already been included in ORG judgment and the role of ORG as the supervisory and expert organ in lottery legislation matters had become apparent from LAW . It was thus clearly not necessary to hold an oral hearing . Nor did the forfeiture require an oral hearing to be held . It was not necessary to provide the public prosecutor or the applicants with an opportunity to submit further comments . As to the merits , the court found that catching a marked fish was more due to luck than to the participants\u2019 skills . Even a beginner could have caught a winning fish . The ice fishing competition thus fulfilled the criteria of a lottery within the meaning of LAW . The provisions of LAW were not especially difficult to understand and the first applicant had been well aware of the manner in which they were interpreted by ORG . As it could not be deemed that the first applicant had misinterpreted the law in an excusable manner , he was found guilty of a lottery offence . According to the court , the proper sanction , bearing in mind the first applicant \u2019s guilt and the damaging effect of the offence , was thus DATE - fines . The court estimated that the profit gained from the offence was QUANTITY and ordered its forfeiture .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , requesting that an oral hearing be held or that the case be referred back to ORG for an oral hearing . They claimed , inter alia , that it had come as a complete surprise to them that ORG had not organised an oral hearing nor provided them with an opportunity to submit further observations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the first applicant leave to appeal . The question of granting leave to appeal to the applicant company was postponed to be dealt with together with the merits of the first applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the case could have been decided by ORG without holding an oral hearing and for the same reason there was no need to hold an oral hearing in ORG . As to the merits , the court confirmed that the ice fishing competition was to be regarded as a lottery within the meaning of LAW and that it had taken place without a permit . Bearing in mind the ORG \u2019s interpretation , the provisions of LAW were not especially difficult to understand . The first applicant could thus not be deemed to have misinterpreted the law in an excusable manner . The court upheld DATE - fines imposed but reduced the amount of each day - fine so that the DATE - fines imposed amounted in total to MONEY . As to the applicant company , the court refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , LAW , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ; as amended by the Act no .
