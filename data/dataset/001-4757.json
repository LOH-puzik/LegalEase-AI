On DATE the court \u201c required \u201d the prison administration to request a criminal court to order the applicant \u2019s conditional release .", "This was done on DATE and on DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s conditional release because of his model behaviour in prison .

The media alleged inter alia that the applicant had not paid the compensation ordered by the trial courts .", "On DATE the Chief Prosecutor of GPE applied to ORG for leave to appeal out of time against the applicant \u2019s conditional release . The prosecutor asserted that the DATE time - limit had not been observed for important reasons . He stated that the prosecutor who had been present before the court on DATE had not informed ORG about the applicant \u2019s conditional release , and that on DATE the Chief Prosecutor of ORG had been in GPE on mission ; therefore no appeal could be lodged in time .", "On DATE the ORG reinstated the time - limit by reference to LAW , finding that the prosecution had missed the time - limit for \u201c important reasons \u201d .

The court dismissed his applications .", "On DATE ORG upheld the prosecution \u2019s appeal and quashed the conditional release order on the basis of LAW . ORG found inter alia that the applicant had not paid the CARDINAL LTL in damages ordered at his trial . The court noted that the prosecutor , who had been present before ORG on DATE , had not submitted this information , thereby misleading the first instance court . The appellate court held that domestic law did not oblige the prison administration to recommend the conditional release of a detainee . The decision of CARDINAL DATE was final .", "On DATE a civil chamber of ORG , upon a cassation petition of the Acting President of ORG , quashed the decision of DATE , finding that ORG could not \u201c require \u201d the prison administration to request the applicant \u2019s release on licence .
