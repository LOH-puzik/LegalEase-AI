ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a GPE national , born in DATE and currently residing in GPE .", "", "A.", "In DATE the applicant opened a clothes shop in GPE and in DATE she engaged a certain PERSON as a trainee sales assistant . In DATE PERSON was employed as a full time shop assistant .", "In DATE the applicant informed PERSON that she no longer required her services as she had sold the shop and was moving to GPE . The applicant left GPE on DATE . She returned to GPE on CARDINAL occasions , in DATE , DATE and DATE .", "On DATE PERSON summoned the applicant to appear before ORG . She claimed , inter alia , that the training contract was null and void and that she was entitled to a higher severance payment . PERSON requested the bailiff to serve the summons at the applicant \u2019s address in GPE . As the applicant was absent , the bailiff , acting in accordance with LAW ( hereinafter referred to as the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , left a notice on her letterbox and sent her a registered letter , informing her that a copy of the summons had been deposited at ORG registry .", "A number of witnesses were heard before FAC on CARDINAL and DATE . Neither the applicant nor her lawyer took part in these hearings .", "In a judgment of DATE , filed with the registry on DATE , the PERSON accepted PERSON claim and ordered the applicant to pay to her former employee the total sum of CARDINAL ORG ( CARDINAL ORG ) . This judgment was served on the applicant on DATE at her address in GPE in accordance with Rule CARDINAL of the ORG .", "The applicant took cognisance of this judgment only on DATE , when she was on holiday in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , challenging the lawfulness of the serving of the summons and of the first - instance judgment . She alleged , inter alia , that as she had moved to GPE in DATE , the summons should have been served on her at her address in GPE . In this respect , the applicant requested the examination of a number of witnesses who could testify that PERSON knew her new address and telephone number in GPE . Observing that she had been unaware of the action brought against her and had taken cognisance of the Magistrate \u2019s judgment only on DATE , the applicant requested ORG to declare that the first - instance proceedings were null and void .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG held that the first - instance decision had became final on DATE and rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as being out of time . It observed that , as appeared from the certificates issued by ORG and ORG , at the relevant time and at least until DATE the applicant had her official address in GPE . Even assuming that PERSON was aware that the applicant had left ORG , nothing suggested that this moving had a definitive character . As the applicant \u2019s name was still written on the letterbox placed in front of her house , the serving of the summons and of the ORG judgment was valid and lawful .", "On an unspecified date , the applicant appealed on points of law , reiterating the objections raised before ORG . In a memorial of DATE , she recalled that the competent authorities had refused to hear the witnesses who could have testified that she had sold her business and that PERSON knew her address and telephone number in GPE .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , filed with the registry on DATE , ORG , considering that the lower court \u2019s decision was logical and well - reasoned , rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . It recalled that a person was presumed to reside in the place of his or her official residence and that this presumption could be overruled only by very substantial elements . The relevant parts of this judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ... the allegations of the applicant , aimed at obtaining a declaration that the serving ex LAW ORG was null and void , are based on CARDINAL assertions :", "a. that PERSON moved to GPE ;", "b. that this moving had a definitive character ;", "c. that it is up to PERSON to show that her moving was not definitive ...", "ORG just considered the fact that the applicant \u2019s residence was still in GPE , via PERSON no . CARDINAL , as this was evident not only from the bell and the letterbox , but also from the documents issued by ORG and ORG . The applicant \u2019s official address after her ( alleged ) moving remained unchanged ...", "Even assuming that there had been a moving , it is not clear why it should be up to PERSON to prove that this moving \u201c was not definitive \u201d . The objection has been raised by PERSON GPE . It is up to her to prove the facts on which her objection is based ... \u201d .", "ORG noted that PERSON did not produce any relevant document proving her moving to GPE , then continued as follows :", "\u201c In her appeal , PERSON requested ORG to examine a number of witnesses who should have testified that PERSON was aware of her moving to GPE ... On this point , the ORG shares ORG finding that \u201c even assuming that [ PERSON ] was aware that PERSON had left GPE ... this does not mean that she should have inferred that this moving was a definitive one ... \u201d . ORG reasoning is clear : CARDINAL facts should be proved , the moving and its definitive character . This second element has not been proved and could not have been proved by the witnesses sought by the applicant ... This confirms that ... no moving has been proved , neither temporary , nor definitive . Therefore , the serving of the summons and of the first - instance judgment is lawful and the decision of ORG has now become final ... \u201d", "B. Relevant national law", "Article CARDINAL of the ORG reads as follows : \u201c If the actual delivery of the act is not possible because of the absence , lack of capacity or refusal of the persons indicated in LAW [ the consignee , a member of his or her family , a person charged of his or her house or business ] , the bailiff deposits a copy of the act to be served at ORG ... , puts a notice ... on the front door of the consignee \u2019s house or office and informs him or her by means of a registered letter \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
