The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in GPE GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and claimed asylum . The asylum claim was refused but he was granted exceptional leave to remain until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of offences of rape and indecency with a child and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG issued the applicant with a decision to make a deportation order and on DATE he issued an authority for detention until the making of a deportation order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision to make a deportation order and made a fresh claim for asylum . The appeal was unsuccessful and his appeal rights were exhausted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was interviewed by probation officers who found that he was not suitable for parole . During his time in prison he had received CARDINAL charges relating to offences against prison discipline . CARDINAL of these offences involved fighting . Moreover , he was assessed as presenting a high risk of sexual offending and a medium risk of general offending on release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s release became automatic . However , he remained in detention pursuant to the authority issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG issued a deportation order which included a paragraph authorising the applicant \u2019s detention until his deportation . The order was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had claimed to be a member of the ORG tribe , which comes from GPE , an autonomous region in north - west GPE . He further claimed that his parents were born in GPE , the capital of GPE , although it was accepted that he was born in GPE , in south - central GPE . Consequently , the authorities initially sought to return the applicant to NORP . However , in order to secure the agreement of the NORP authorities to the return of a PERSON to their territory , detailed information about clan - history was required . This was normally done through the provision of bio - data , but this was often difficult to obtain as it required the co - operation of the Somalilander . Consequently , few PERSON were returned to PERSON at this time . As the applicant did not co - operate with the provision of bio - data , the Government decided that it would be preferable to remove him to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the last carrier willing to take \u201c enforced returns \u201d to GPE withdrew , with the consequence that it was no longer possible for the Government to remove people without their consent . The carriers were , however , willing to carry those who had signed a disclaimer confirming that they were returning voluntarily . In DATE the applicant refused a formal request to sign such a disclaimer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an application for bail was refused by the Chief Immigration Officer .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant made further representations for asylum . In DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG refused to treat those representations as a fresh claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was again refused bail . In the course of the hearing , however , the immigration judge was wrongly informed that enforced removals to GPE would be possible in the foreseeable future .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government concluded an agreement with ORG which made enforced removals to GPE possible . The first enforced removal to GPE took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted permission to apply for judicial review of the decision to detain him but an application for interim relief in the form of an order that he be released from detention was refused .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was issued with removal directions set for DATE . He sought leave to apply for judicial review of the removal directions and the directions were cancelled pending a decision on that application .", "CARDINAL . The application for judicial review of the decision to detain the applicant was considered by Mr Justice PERSON in a judgment handed down on DATE . The judge reiterated the principles established by domestic case - law , most notably in the case of R v Governor of ORG , ex parte ORG PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL : first , that the Secretary of ORG for ORG could only detain a person that he intended to deport for what amounted to a reasonable period in all the circumstances ; and secondly , that if , before the expiry of a reasonable period , it became apparent that the Secretary of ORG would not be able to effect deportation within a reasonable period , he should not seek to exercise the power of detention .", "CARDINAL . The judge first considered the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention up until DATE . He was satisfied that from DATE to DATE the Secretary of ORG had exercised comparative diligence to overcome the obstacles and remove the applicant . In particular , he noted that the applicant could not have been removed DATE and DATE because his asylum and deportation appeals were still pending , and DATE and DATE he could not be removed because no deportation order had been served . When considered alongside the objections to bail ( the risk of re - offending and the risk of absconding ) , he held that on balance the continued detention of the applicant up to DATE was lawful .", "CARDINAL . NORP The period of detention from DATE , which was the date of the applicant \u2019s first review following his refusal to return voluntarily , to DATE was found to be unlawful because of its length , the impossibility during that period of achieving removal , and the misleading statements which had misled decision - makers both inside and outside ORG .", "CARDINAL . The judge held that the applicant \u2019s detention after DATE was lawful as once again there was a prospect of immediate removal .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the Secretary of ORG were granted leave to appeal to ORG . The Secretary of ORG contended that the application for judicial review ought to have been dismissed , while the applicant submitted that his continued detention after DATE should have been held to be unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment handed down on DATE , ORG allowed the appeal by the Secretary of ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court held that the period of detention DATE and DATE was lawful because the applicant could have returned to GPE voluntarily . Moreover , the risk of the applicant reoffending was high , which was a worrying prospect in view of the nature of his previous offence . The court held that it was wrong in principle to offset those factors against the applicant \u2019s concerns about returning to GPE as his removal had already been held not to be in breach of LAW or Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was refused permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG issued a decision refusing to revoke the deportation order . An Immigration Judge allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal . On DATE ORG ordered reconsideration of the Immigration Judge \u2019s decision . The reconsideration hearing took place on DATE . The ORG held that the Immigration Judge had materially erred in law and ordered that the case be reheard . The rehearing took place on DATE and , in a determination promulgated on DATE , the ORG dismissed the appeal . The applicant was granted permission to appeal to ORG on DATE . In a judgment dated DATE ORG allowed the appeal , finding that the applicant would be at risk of ill - treatment which reached the threshold required by LAW if he were to be removed to GPE . However , on DATE ORG allowed the appeal by the Secretary of ORG for ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was issued with removal directions to GPE . The removal was to take place on DATE . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant interim measures under LAW to prevent his removal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remains in immigration detention pending removal . On DATE ORG had ordered that he be released from detention on bail . He was released DATE but was re - detained on DATE after breaching his bail conditions .", "CARDINAL . The present application is only concerned with the first period of detention , which ended shortly after DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the applicant \u2019s detention from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , reviews were carried out in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG introduced a \u201c secret \u201d policy creating a presumption in favour of the detention of ORG pending their deportation . The policy , which was not disclosed until DATE and was not formally published until DATE , constituted a \u201c near blanket ban \u201d on release . During this period , the Secretary of ORG \u2019s published policy on the detention of ORG stated that there was a presumption in favour of release . The lawfulness of this policy was considered by ORG in the cases of PERSON and ORG v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL , below ) .", "CARDINAL . The power to detain a person against whom a decision has been taken to make a deportation order is contained in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL to LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which provides :", "\u201c Where notice has been given to a person in accordance with regulations under section CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act CARDINAL ( notice of decision ) of a decision to make a deportation order against him , and he is not detained in pursuance of the sentence or order of a court , he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of ORG pending the making of the deportation order . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The power to detain an individual in respect of whom a deportation order is in force is contained in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of Schedule CARDINAL to LAW . It provides :", "\u201c Where a deportation order is in force against any person , he may be detained under the authority of the Secretary of ORG pending his removal or departure from GPE ( and if already detained by virtue of sub - paragraph ( CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) above when the order is made , shall continue to be detained unless [ he is released on bail or ] the Secretary of ORG directs otherwise ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . There are , however , limitations on the power to detain . CARDINAL distinct principles emerge from the guidance given in R v Governor of ORG , ex parte ORG PERSON [ DATE ] WLR CARDINAL :", "\u201c i. The Secretary of ORG must intend to deport the person and can only use the power to detain for that purpose ;", "ii . The deportee may only be detained for a period that is reasonable in all the circumstances ;", "iii . If , before the expiry of the reasonable period , it becomes apparent that the Secretary of ORG will not be able to effect deportation within that reasonable period , he should not seek to exercise the power of detention ;", "iv . The Secretary of ORG should act with reasonable diligence and expedition to effect removal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON and ORG v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG , ORG briefly considered the ORG PERSON principles . In his leading judgment , which was accepted by the majority of the court , Lord PERSON found that in assessing the reasonableness of the length of the period of detention , the risk of re - offending would be a relevant factor . In this regard , he noted that if a person re - offended , there was a risk that he would abscond either to evade arrest or , if he was arrested and prosecuted , that he would receive a custodial sentence . Either way , his re - offending would impede his deportation . He also considered that the pursuit of legal challenges by ORG could be relevant . However , he considered the weight to be given to the time spent on appeals to be fact - sensitive . In this regard , he noted that much more weight should be given to detention during a period when the detained person was pursuing a meritorious appeal than to detention during a period when he was pursuing a hopeless one .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON further noted that while it was common ground that the refusal to return voluntarily was relevant to the assessment of the reasonableness of the period of detention because a risk of absconding could be inferred from the refusal , he warned against the danger of drawing such an inference in every case . On the contrary , he considered it necessary to distinguish between cases where the return to the country of origin was possible and cases where it was not . Where return was not possible for reasons extraneous to the person detained , the fact that he was not willing to return voluntarily could not be held against him since his refusal had no causal effect . If return was possible , but the detained person was not willing to go , it would be necessary to consider whether or not he had issued proceedings challenging his deportation . If he had done so , it would be entirely reasonable that he should remain in the GPE pending the determination of those proceedings , unless they were an abuse of process , and his refusal to return voluntarily would be irrelevant . If there were no outstanding legal challenges , the refusal to return voluntarily should not be seen as a trump card which enabled the Secretary of ORG to continue to detain until deportation could be effected , otherwise the refusal would justify as reasonable any period of detention , however long .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the same case of GPE and ORG was called upon to consider the lawfulness of detention which was effected pursuant to the unpublished policy which was inconsistent with the Secretary of ORG \u2019s published policy ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicants in that case were ORG detained pursuant to the \u201c secret \u201d policy creating a presumption in favour of detention pending deportation , while at all material times the published policy indicated that there was a presumption in favour of release . The question of whether the applicants were lawfully detained divided the court , which concluded , by a narrow margin , that the unpublished policy applied to the applicants was unlawful . As a consequence , they were unlawfully detained and their civil claims in false imprisonment had to succeed . However , as the court found that the power to detain would have been exercised even if the lawful , published policy had been applied , it concluded DATE once again by a narrow majority \u2013 that the applicants should receive only nominal damages .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON and Lord PERSON dissented , preferring to find that the applicants\u2019 detention was not unlawful because they would have been detained even if the published policy had been applied .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of the document formerly referred to as ORG provided that detention had to be reviewed DATE and written reasons for maintaining detention had to be provided DATE . In the case of PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG , the applicant had been detained pending the making of a deportation order for DATE . There was no question of a breach of the ORG PERSON principles ( see paragraph DATE above ) but nevertheless the applicant alleged that his detention had been unlawful as it had not been subject to regular reviews as required by the Secretary of ORG \u2019s published policy . ORG concluded by a majority that it was the Secretary of ORG \u2019s duty to give effect to his published policy if that policy was sufficiently closely related to the authority to detain . In the present case , the court found that this test was met and that the applicant \u2019s detention was unlawful . However , in view of the fact that the applicant would have remained in detention even if the reviews had taken place , the court considered it likely that he would only be entitled to nominal damages ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-f"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
