By the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s claim in its entirety .

In doing so , it stated that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and the decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL had not yet been enforced since the applicant \u2019s title had not been registered and the constructions had not been demolished . ORG went on to state that the non - enforcement of the above - mentioned judicial acts was in violation of LAW No . CARDINAL in that the applicant \u2019s right to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions was being violated by the illegal occupation of his property by PERSON without the applicant \u2019s permission .

However , each time PERSON has failed to comply with these decisions , for which failure the bailiffs have each time imposed a fine . It appears that she has also failed to pay the fines .", "CARDINAL . In DATE enforcement activities were postponed on the grounds that various measures applied in respect of PERSON had been ineffective in view of the fact that the ORG needed to suspend the proceedings in order to conclude a contract with a construction company , given the absence of technical equipment necessary for conducting the compulsory construction works . It appears that at some point the proceedings were resumed .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE the Minister of ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the GPE division of ORG had justified the non - registration of the applicant \u2019s title in respect of his property by pointing to the fact that the constructions situated therein had not been demolished because the ORG did not have the appropriate technical equipment and workforce at its disposal .", "CARDINAL . It appears that until DATE other measures were initiated by the ORG , such as obliging the GPE division of ORG to perform the registration of the applicant \u2019s title , in accordance with the judgments in his favour , and setting new time - limits for PERSON to comply with her obligations .
