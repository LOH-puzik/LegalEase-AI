On DATE the DATE Amendment to the DATE LAW entered into force ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of robbery by ORG and sentenced to DATE in prison . He began serving his sentence on DATE and completed it on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Criminal Code came into force ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted by ORG of having paid with a bad cheque and of fraudulent use of a bank card in the period DATE and DATE . He was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The judgment became final on DATE . The applicant started to serve the sentence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of murder committed together with another person on DATE . He was sentenced to DATE in prison , the maximum penalty provided for under the CARDINAL Criminal Code applicable at the time at which the offence was committed . The conviction was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE and became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG to have the CARDINAL prison terms joined in an overall sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by means of a judgment , joined the CARDINAL above - mentioned prison sentences , including the one for robbery which the applicant had already completed , in an overall sentence . Applying LAW as applicable before the introduction of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , the court noted that the applicant should have had an overall sentence imposed on him as the conditions under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had been met but the provision had not been applied in his case . While acknowledging that LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW applied to the case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG sentenced the applicant to an overall term of DATE imprisonment . In its reasoning , it noted that the principle of the rule of law required , inter alia , that criminal - law provisions be drafted in a clear and precise manner in order to avoid sentences being imposed arbitrarily . It went on to note that the legislation applicable to the present case was unclear , ambiguous and deficient for the following reasons . Although the maximum sentence applicable under LAW had been DATE imprisonment and the rules on combining multiple sentences in an overall sentence , enshrined in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW , provided that the overall sentence must exceed each of the individual sentences , these same rules prescribed a maximum sentence of DATE . The court took the view that the legislature had not intended to enact legislation enabling those offenders who had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment for CARDINAL of the offences for which they subsequently had had their sentences joined to benefit from an overall sentence that would have been DATE lower than the highest individual sentence to which the offender had been sentenced . In support of its view , ORG pointed out that LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had provided that in cases where an offender had been due to serve DATE imprisonment along with sentences for other offences , the overall sentence would have consisted only of that term . Therefore , ORG considered that the legislature had made an obvious error in LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW , which had , however , been rectified in the meantime by LAW . The court found that the latter made the rules on the determination of an overall sentence certain , clear and complete and that \u201c [ o]nly the so amended provisions therefore prevent[ed ] arbitrary sanctioning of criminal offenders for multiple criminal offences as required by the principle of legality \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment , arguing that ORG decision lacked a legal basis and was in breach of the principle of the rule of law and the principle nullum crimen et nulla poena sine lege . He also claimed that the primary method of interpreting legal texts should be semantic interpretation . It was only where that method proved unsatisfactory in determining how a certain rule should be applied that other methods of interpretation should be applied . Lastly , the applicant agreed with ORG that the provision in question could be regarded as unclear , ambiguous and deficient , but pointed out that any possible ambiguities or deficiencies should not be interpreted to his detriment .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the appeal lodged by the applicant and upheld the first - instance judgment , reiterating the lower court \u2019s reasoning . In the Higher Court \u2019s opinion , ORG had correctly assessed that the legislature had not intended to permit individuals convicted of several offences from benefiting from a lower maximum term of imprisonment than they would have had to serve if they had been convicted of CARDINAL of those offences . According to ORG , such an interpretation would lead to a situation \u201c defying the law as well as common sense \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to ORG for the protection of legality ( an extraordinary legal remedy ) , reiterating his arguments . He also argued that the rule of law was a principle which should not be applied at the ORG discretion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG by its judgment I ORG rejected the application for the protection of legality , disagreeing with the applicant that semantic interpretation should take precedence over all other methods of legal interpretation . ORG referred to ORG judgment , pointing out that the latter court \u2019s reasoning evidently showed that the historical interpretation of the rule on combining multiple sentences also had to be taken into account in assessing the aim of the legislature in enacting the provision at issue . That method of interpretation entailed the examination of not only the provision in its original form , as relied on by the applicant , but also the subsequent amendment , which showed the true aim of the provision . In addition , ORG relied on the systematic interpretation of the rule in question , emphasising that it could not be interpreted entirely separately from the provisions prescribing that individual prison sentences for various criminal offences must be combined to form an overall sentence . Since under the un - amended DATE LAW a prison sentence could be imposed for a term not shorter than DATE and not longer than DATE , it was not logical that an overall sentence combining several prison terms , CARDINAL of which was for DATE , could be DATE lower than the highest individual prison sentence imposed . According to ORG , the rules on multiple offences were aimed not at reducing the general maximum prison sentence , but at ensuring that the overall length of several sentences did not exceed the general maximum prison sentence , which in the applicant \u2019s case was DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint , reiterating that the imposition of an overall sentence of DATE imprisonment contravened LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , which clearly provided that such a sentence could not exceed DATE . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , the purpose of the provision at issue could be drawn from interpreting it semantically and no additional means of interpretation were therefore required in order to understand the legislature \u2019s intention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint , finding that it did not concern an important constitutional question or entail a violation of human rights with serious consequences for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of another murder committed on an undefined date between CARDINAL June and DATE . For that murder he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , but a new overall sentence of DATE was imposed . The latter overall sentence covered the previous overall sentence imposed by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , another sentence of DATE imprisonment , which in the meantime had been imposed on him following a conviction for yet another criminal offence , and the DATE imprisonment imposed by that last judgment of DATE . An appeal and an application for the protection of legality by the applicant were dismissed , the latter by ORG on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["7-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
