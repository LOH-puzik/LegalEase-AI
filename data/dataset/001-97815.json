The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the car of which the applicant is the registered keeper was recorded by police officers using a radar speed detector travelling at a speed of CARDINAL k.p.h . , thus exceeding the speed limit of CARDINAL k.p.h .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Graz - Umgebung District Authority ( Bezirkshauptmannschaft ) ordered the applicant to disclose within DATE the full name and address of the person who had been driving his car at the material time . The order referred to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Motor Vehicles Act ( GPE ) as its legal basis . The applicant did not reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Graz - Umgebung District Authority issued a provisional penal order ( Strafverf\u00fcgung ) . Relying on sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of FAC , it sentenced the applicant to pay a fine of CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) with DATE imprisonment in default for speeding . In addition , relying on sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW , it sentenced the applicant to pay a fine of LAW with DATE imprisonment in default for failure to comply with the order of DATE to disclose the driver 's identity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection against this decision . On DATE he filed submissions stating that he had not been driving his car but that he refused to disclose the driver 's identity as he considered this obligation to be at variance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the Graz - Umgebung District Authority heard evidence from the police officer who had initiated the proceedings for speeding . On DATE the statement of the police officer , who had confirmed that the radar detector , which had been duly calibrated , had measured a speed of CARDINAL k.p.h . and that he had recorded the number of the car , was communicated to the applicant and he was requested to submit his defence in respect of the speeding offence . At the same time he was informed that the proceedings for failure to disclose the identity of the driver had been discontinued .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , maintained his defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Graz - Umgebung District Authority dismissed the applicant 's objection and issued a penal order ( Strafverf\u00fcgung ) in which it convicted him of speeding and imposed a fine of ORG CARDINAL with DATE imprisonment in default . It also ordered him to pay procedural costs in the amount of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The authority noted that the applicant had refused to disclose who had driven his car on DATE when it had been recorded exceeding the speed limit . The authority therefore concluded that he had himself been the driver . It observed that this presumption was based on the case - law of ORG , which had considered that in a case in which the registered keeper of a car did not disclose the driver 's identity and did not submit any exculpating evidence in his defence , the authority could reasonably conclude that the keeper himself had been the driver .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungssenat ) . He maintained that the obligation to disclose the identity of the driver pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was incompatible with LAW , as was the drawing of inferences from the mere fact that he had refused to disclose the driver 's identity . In this connection the applicant referred to PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ) . In addition , he reiterated that he had not been driving his car on CARDINAL DATE and had not even been in GPE at the relevant time . He further asserted that his car had been used regularly by a number of persons but that he had not kept any records and was therefore not in a position to provide the required information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It dispensed with a hearing by virtue of section CARDINALe(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG reasoning reads as follows :", "\u201c In accordance with the principle of establishment of the facts of the authorities ' own motion for the purposes of LAW ( ORG ) , the material truth must be ascertained ; in this regard the authorities are not bound by the facts submitted by the parties , but must establish the true facts by taking the necessary evidence . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG the authorities must assess freely , giving careful consideration to the results of the investigation , whether or not a given fact is to be accepted as proven . On the basis of the principle that the court controls the conduct of the proceedings , articulated in section CARDINAL of the ORG , the obligation to establish the facts lies with the authorities ; this does not , however , dispense the party from the obligation to contribute to the establishment of the relevant facts . The obligation on the accused in criminal proceedings to cooperate means that he is not merely responsible for contesting the specific evidence against him , without submitting equally specific statements in reply and adducing the relevant evidence ... Nor can the appellant in the present case be released from this obligation by relying on LAW . On the contrary , the fact of refusing to name the driver of the vehicle amounts to an infringement of the obligation to cooperate as set forth above . Hence , merely asserting that he was not driving the vehicle registered in his name at the scene of the offence and at the material time runs counter to the appellant 's obligation to contribute to the establishment of the relevant facts .", "In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG the authorities therefore presume that the appellant himself was the driver . His statements are to be regarded as an attempt to justify his conduct . It has not been established during the proceedings , nor has the applicant seriously asserted in substance , that he could not have contributed to the establishment of the facts without incriminating himself and could not have been expected to do so .", "The offence with which the appellant was charged is therefore to be regarded as subjectively and objectively proven and imputable to him . His appeal submissions concerning LAW are unfounded in relation to the offence with which he was charged . \u201d", "Turning to the fixing of the sentence , ORG noted that the applicant had been charged with exceeding the speed limit substantially , by CARDINAL k.p.h . As excessive speed on motorways was often the reason for serious or very serious traffic accidents , the imposition of a fine of ORG CARDINAL had been appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ) . Referring to PERSON ( cited above ) , he asserted that he had been convicted solely on account of the fact that he had made use of his right to remain silent . ORG had not been in possession of any evidence to indicate that he was the driver . Moreover , it had disregarded his defence that he had not been in GPE at the material time and was unable to provide the name of the driver as he had not kept any records . These procedural deficiencies were aggravated by the fact that ORG had failed to hold a hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declined to examine the applicant 's complaint for lack of prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to examine the applicant 's complaint by virtue of section CARDINALa of LAW , since the amount of the penalty did not exceed LAW and no important legal issue was at stake .", "CARDINAL .
