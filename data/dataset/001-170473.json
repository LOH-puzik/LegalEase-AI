He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON Krankl , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the father of PERSON , and PERSON , all of whom were born in wedlock in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was living with his wife and his children in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the applicant \u2019s minor children , represented by ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG und Familie ) , ORG ( PERSON ) issued on DATE an interim injunction for the duration of DATE ordering the applicant to leave the joint household and the immediate surroundings of the family \u2019s apartment , prohibiting him from returning to the apartment and contacting his wife and children , ordering him to avoid any meetings with them , and banning him from the children \u2019s kindergarten .", "CARDINAL . Having heard the children \u2019s mother , the applicant and a social worker , the ORG noted that the children \u2019s mother had alleged repeated sexual abuse by the applicant in respect of his eldest daughter ( then DATE ) and had testified that she had found skin abrasions on her daughter and that on CARDINAL occasion her genital area had been smeared with blood . The applicant had denied any misconduct . ORG also took into account the findings of an initial examination of the applicant \u2019s eldest daughter by a clinical psychologist at a children \u2019s hospital in GPE . The girl had told the psychologist that she had suffered severe abuse at the hands of her father and had illustrated graphically what she had meant using anatomically correct puppets . ORG found the girl \u2019s mother \u2019s testimony in respect of the events clear , credible and trustworthy . Overall , the seemingly substantiated allegations of extensive sexual abuse by the applicant indicated a real risk for the children \u2019s wellbeing . The child had been taken into psychological care . Since the children and their mother had a need to be provided with housing , the court ordered the applicant to leave the joint apartment . The applicant did not lodge an appeal against this decision . Therefore , it became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife brought an action for divorce .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the children , at the time represented by their mother , lodged a request for the extension of the interim injunction ; the ORG , referring to the case file and to the pending criminal investigation in respect of the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on DATE granted that request and extended the interim injunction until the conclusion of the divorce proceedings . The applicant did not lodge an appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the request for an interim injunction against the applicant , ORG filed criminal information with ORG that was based on information supplied by the children \u2019s mother and the report of the psychologist ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant was indicted on charges of sexual abuse of minors and abuse of a relationship of authority by ORG . The child , represented by a lawyer , took part in the criminal proceedings as a private party ( Privatbeteiligter ) . On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) acquitted the applicant of the charges of sexual abuse of minors and abuse of a relationship of authority . It found that the witnesses heard in the course of the oral hearing had not been able to verify the suspicions . Furthermore , a psychological expert , ordered by the court to examine the applicant \u2019s daughter , had stated that the child \u2019s ability to recount past events or experiences was not sufficiently developed . Therefore , the criminal court declined to hear the child , even with the assistance of an expert . Because of the lack of evidence , the criminal court could not determine the relevant facts in regard to the accusations . The applicant was acquitted , having been given the benefit of doubt . This decision became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , referring to his acquittal , lodged a request with ORG for the lifting of the interim injunction . However , on DATE , the ORG refused that request . It found that a request under section CARDINAL of LAW to lift an interim injunction ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) could only be successful if the need to protect the legitimate interests of the person concerned had ended . This would be the case if the circumstances which had made the granting of the decision necessary had changed . However , ORG had acquitted the applicant , pursuant to LAW , hereinafter , the CCP \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , only because the applicant \u2019s guilt could not be established by a criminal court . However , the applicant had supported his request solely by referring to his acquittal and had not tried to demonstrate to ORG why and how any risk to the children had ceased to exist . Therefore , there was no reason to lift the interim injunction .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON - the \u201c ORG \u201d ) on DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , finding that \u2013 contrary to the applicant \u2019s belief \u2013 his acquittal in the criminal proceedings was not in and of itself sufficient to substantiate the absence of the perceived risk that had served as the basis for the interim injunction . ORG noted that an acquittal rendered by the criminal courts had no binding effect on the civil courts . In and of itself , the applicant \u2019s reference to his acquittal was not sufficient to prove that the basis for believing that the applicant \u2019s children were at risk had ceased to exist . ORG upheld ORG finding that the objective of the interim injunction DATE namely to secure the well - being of the children \u2013 had not become redundant , referring again to the fact that the acquittal had only resulted from the application of the in dubio pro reo principle , and that there still existed a suspicion of sexual abuse ; this sufficed to justify the assumption that there continued to be a risk to the wellbeing of the child . Furthermore , the applicant had based his appeal only on the alleged binding force of the acquittal and had not submitted any facts why the risk would have ceased to exist by a change in the situation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) dismissed that appeal . Referring to its own jurisprudence it upheld the reasoning of the lower courts that whether an interim injunction could be lifted depended on whether the need to afford protection had ceased to exist in the light of a change in circumstances ; a change concerning only the evidence provided could not be automatically understood as constituting such a reason . The question of whether the applicant \u2019s acquittal had changed the level of risk in respect of the right of the child to physical safety had to be answered in the negative . The assessment of evidence in the criminal proceedings had to be considered as fresh evidence in the civil proceedings but did not as such constitute a reason for lifting the interim injunction . If , after assessing the fresh evidence , the suspicion of abuse persisted , the level of risk could not be deemed to have changed .", "CARDINAL . ORG also confirmed that an acquittal on criminal charges had no binding effect on the civil courts . As regards those of the applicant \u2019s arguments that were based on LAW , it referred to ORG PERSON case - law , in particular the judgment in GPE v. GPE ( no . DATE ) , but distinguished that case from the present one : in GPE , the ORG had assumed a link between the criminal responsibility of the accused and the right to compensation for detention to such a degree that the decisions on the latter issue could be regarded as a consequence and , to some extent , the concomitant of the decision on the former ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . However , in the present case such a link was missing with regard to the civil jurisdiction because ( i ) the criminal proceedings concerned a public law claim , and ( ii ) the accused \u2019s opponent was the ORG . The victim of the criminal act in question was not a party to the proceedings and in general , the criminal courts did not rule on ORG claims for damages . A binding effect of an acquittal on civil courts would constitute a violation of the principle of equality of arms LAW of the victim if he or she tried to lodge subsequently a claim for damages before the civil courts . The distinction between civil and criminal matters resulted from the different subjects dealt with . The binding effect of a conviction was justified by the fact that in such a case a criminal court had established the accused \u2019s responsibility and guilt . However , in the case of an acquittal , the establishment of the facts remained open . To then prevent the victim from pursuing a possible civil claim would represent a violation of the victim \u2019s fundamental rights . In the instant case , the acquittal could therefore only serve as an indication of a diminution of the risk for the children , but no more .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the divorce proceedings were concluded with final effect . On CARDINAL DATE the ORG refused a request for the extension of the interim measure and lifted it .", "CARDINAL . In addition to his request for the interim injunction to be lifted , the applicant on DATE lodged a request with ORG for regular contacts to be arranged between himself and his CARDINAL children at ORG ; alternatively , he requested the provisional arrangement of a weekly visiting right , to be exercised at the parent - child - meeting point ( NORP - Kind - Treff ) of ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . For the purpose of being able to assess the situation , ORG ordered a report from the ORG and ORG on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE \u2013 the Youth and ORG having failed to deliver such a report \u2013 the court urged it to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted the report , stating in its conclusion that contact between the children and their father was very important , but that , in view of the problematic overall situation , the visits should take place in the protected environment of ORG . The mother had initially opposed the idea of the applicant having contact with the children , but had then stated that she could agree to accompanied visits in a protected environment and in her presence . The applicant had referred to his acquittal and stated his desire to reestablish a relationship with his children . The social worker confirmed that the children were living in a safe and healthy environment with their mother , but also referred to the importance of a relationship between the children and their father . Regular contact every fortnight would offer the children a good opportunity to become re - acquainted with their father and was thus considered positively by the social worker . On DATE the report of the Youth and ORG arrived at the court and was subsequently served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In a hearing before the ORG on DATE , the applicant and the children \u2019s mother agreed on a preliminary settlement with the following provisions : preliminary sole custody for the CARDINAL minor children was granted to the children \u2019s mother . The applicant was granted the right to regular accompanied contact \u2013 normally DATE for TIME on the premises of ORG . The visits were also attended by the children \u2019s mother and a social worker from the ORG . Because of this agreement , the proceedings in respect of contact rights were suspended pending a final decision in the divorce proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his former wife agreed before ORG on the staying of the proceedings in respect of custody , contact rights and alimony ( PERSON ) . The applicant informed the ORG that since DATE he and his former wife had agreed amicably on arrangements for the applicant \u2019s contact with his CARDINAL children . The applicant , in the meantime , had moved to GPE and travelled to GPE during the school holidays in order to see his children .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , a victim of a criminal offence could join criminal proceedings as a private party ( PERSON ) only with regard to his or her civil claims . Such a private party was , inter alia , entitled to have access to the various case files from the pre - trial stage onwards , had to be summoned to the hearings , and could submit evidence to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG provided as follows :", "\u201c The accused shall be acquitted by judgment of the court :", "...", "CARDINAL . where the court finds that the act that gave rise to the prosecution is not an offence under the law or that the alleged offence has not been made out or that it has not been established that the accused committed the act of which he is accused or that circumstances exist which deprive the act in question of its criminal character or that the continuation of the prosecution is ruled out on grounds other than those set out in DATE and CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the event of an acquittal , a private party was not entitled to a remedy in criminal proceedings . Under LAW ORG the criminal court had to refer such a private party to the civil courts in respect of his or her claim for damages if the accused had been acquitted ( PERSON auf den Zivilrechtsweg ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( GPE ) provided that civil courts , when deciding a case which had previously been submitted to a criminal court , were bound by the facts established by a criminal court in the event that that court had found the accused guilty . This provision was found to be contrary to LAW ( decision of CARDINAL DATE , no . GCARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . ORG stated that a criminal conviction to be binding on a civil court was arbitrary and therefore contrary to LAW . Therefore , ORG set aside the provision .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , no . CARDINAL Ob CARDINAL , ORG found , after conducting a comprehensive analysis of the legal arguments raised in national and international academic debate , that , even in the absence of an explicit provision stipulating the binding effect of criminal convictions , a convicted person must accept his conviction by a criminal court as an established fact and shall not be entitled to argue before a civil court that he did not commit the offence of which he was convicted . Therefore , a conviction by a criminal court should have a binding effect with regard to the convicted person , so that nobody might argue that the facts differed from the ones already established and which had been the basis for that criminal conviction .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE , no . CARDINAL Ob CARDINAL/CARDINALa , ORG confirmed the principles outlined in its decision of DATE and elaborated on the question of whether civil courts should be bound by the findings of a criminal court when proceedings heard by that criminal court had ended with an acquittal . It found that because of the weak position the ORG granted to a private party in criminal proceedings , it would violate the victim \u2019s rights under LAW if the outcome of criminal proceedings were to have a binding effect on civil law proceedings ( that is to say if civil courts were to be bound by the findings of a criminal court ) . For example , a private party had no remedy against the acquittal of an accused . Moreover , under LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the criminal court had to refer a private party to the civil courts in respect of his or her claim for damages if the accused was not convicted . This provision would be meaningless if the victim of an offence were to be referred to the civil courts in respect of his claim for damages but had to accept the finality of the acquittal in the subsequent civil proceedings . Therefore , an acquittal in criminal proceedings could have no binding effect in civil law proceedings dealing with the same circumstances .", "CARDINAL . In the following decisions , ORG further developed its case - law on this question and found that neither the ending of criminal proceedings by preliminary settlement ( Diversion , decision of DATE , no . CARDINAL Ob DATE ) nor by final closure of the case by ORG ( Verfahrenseinstellung , DATE , no . CARDINAL ObA CARDINAL/CARDINALp ) had a binding effect regarding the facts of the case on civil law proceedings and that the civil courts had to establish anew all the facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . Interim injunctions for the purpose of the prevention of violence within the family were a civil law matter under NORP law , as laid down in LAW ( Exekutionsordnung ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since provisional legal protection had to be provided without delay , the prerequisites for ordering an injunction needed only to be certified ( bescheinigen ) , which meant to show predominant probability but they did not need to be proved beyond reasonable doubt ( beweisen ) . The degree of plausibility of the circumstances supporting a request for an injunction was thus less strict than in the criminal proceedings . It was sufficient for the party requesting the injunction to submit details of the circumstances from which the existence of the alleged risk could reasonably be assumed ( section CARDINAL of LAW , in connection with LAW ) . Under section CARDINAL of LAW certain parts of the provisions of LAW ( such as the provisions dealing with the parties , the oral hearing or the finding of facts ) were applicable if LAW did not provide otherwise . Persons affected by an interim injunction had the right to lodge an appeal ( PERSON , see LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINALb \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided as follows :", "\u201c The court is required to act upon a request [ lodged ] by a near relative ( naher Angeh\u00f6riger ) of a person who launches or threatens to launch a physical attack or displays conduct severely affecting the psychological health of the near relative , thus making further cohabitation unbearable for the relative . In such a case , the court must", "CARDINAL . order that person to leave the common flat and its immediate surroundings , and", "CARDINAL . prevent that person from returning to the flat and its immediate surroundings , if the flat serves the near relative \u2019s urgent need of accommodation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under paragraph CARDINAL of this provision , a court could also prohibit such a person from staying in clearly defined areas and order him or her to avoid meeting and coming into contact with the near relative unless this would have run counter to the serious interests of the person .", "CARDINAL . Under paragraph CARDINAL of this provision , such an interim injunction was not limited to proceedings for divorce or the annulment of a marriage ; however , in respect of proceedings that did not concern divorce or annulment such an interim injunction could not exceed a total duration of DATE . The institution of such divorce proceedings or proceedings for the annulment of a marriage was a prerequisite for an extension beyond the above - mentioned DATE limit .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW listed the following conditions for the amendment or lifting of an interim injunction :", "\u201c CARDINAL . if the order exceeds the scope that is necessary to secure the interests of the person in whose favour the order was granted ;", "CARDINAL . Given that there were remedies ( Widerspruch , PERSON ) by which to contest a decision within the proceedings for granting an interim injunction , the amendment or lifting of an interim or \u201c final \u201d injunction under section CARDINAL of LAW could not be requested on the basis of a claim that the interim injunction had been issued unlawfully ( decisions of ORG of DATE , no . CARDINAL Ob CARDINAL/CARDINAL t , and of DATE , no . CARDINAL Ob CARDINAL/CARDINAL t ) . Moreover , because the aim of an interim injunction was not to examine a past but to pre - empt a future risk , a review ex post facto of the proceedings in respect of the granting of an interim injunction was not possible ( ORG decisions of DATE , no .
