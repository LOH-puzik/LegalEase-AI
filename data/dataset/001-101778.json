He was represented before the Court by Mr L. Cholewa , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant was convicted of the \u201c dissemination of false information \u201d , punishable on the basis of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the socalled \u201c small criminal code \u201d ( ma\u0142y kodeks karny ) , a decree adopted on DATE , and was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant had prepared and distributed leaflets in which he stated that GPE was dominated by GPE and that this state of affairs was unacceptable .", "He subsequently served DATE of his sentence .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an application under section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the Law of DATE on the annulment of convictions of persons persecuted for activities aimed at achieving independence for GPE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) with ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) , seeking to have his conviction declared null and void .", "On DATE ORG refused to grant his request , having regard to the fact that the CARDINAL Act only provided a legal basis for quashing judgments given prior to DATE , when the worst period of political repression ended , whereas the judgment in the applicant \u2019s case had been given in DATE .", "In DATE the ORG brought , on the applicant \u2019s behalf , a cassation appeal against the judgment given in DATE before ORG . The ORG argued that the judgment was in breach of the substantive provision forming the basis upon which the applicant had been convicted and sentenced . It was obvious that his conduct , consisting of disseminating leaflets criticising GPE domination of GPE by placing them on walls in different places in his town , had not fulfilled the requirements of criminal conduct penalised by LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the \u201c small criminal code \u201d .", "It was further argued that the acts committed by the accused had been motivated by his profound hostility towards the communist system and the communist authorities and should have been seen as acts of political opposition . They had been very irritating to the authorities , but this had not rendered them criminal . The courts had failed to establish that the leaflets had amounted to incitement to crime or violence , or that they had contained any praise of criminal acts . Furthermore , the courts had failed to indicate any concrete interests of the NORP ORG which could have been endangered by the leaflets . Moreover , it was unreasonable to consider that the view expressed about GPE \u2019s domination by GPE had been untrue , as it had been obvious at that time that this had indeed been the case . Hence , it was impossible to find that disseminating such a view amounted to \u201c disseminating untrue information \u201d . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the ORG \u2019s appeal , essentially sharing his views . It acquitted the applicant of the original offence , having found that he had not disseminated any \u201c false information \u201d but rather his legitimate views about the political system in place in DATE , and also held that he had not incited to violence or any unlawful acts . Consequently , it held that the applicant had not committed the criminal offence of which he had been convicted .", "Subsequently , the applicant instituted proceedings for compensation for detention which had lacked a legal basis , on the basis of LAW of LAW Code of Criminal Procedure .", "On DATE ORG awarded him compensation of MONEY ( ORG ) . The amount awarded was comprised of ORG CARDINAL for nonpecuniary damage ( zado\u015b\u0107uczynienie ) caused by suffering and loss of life prospects occasioned by his deprivation of liberty , and ORG CARDINAL for pecuniary damage ( odszkodowanie ) . The court calculated the latter by taking the applicant \u2019s salary at the time of his arrest , multiplying it for the entire period of his deprivation of liberty and subtracting the average living costs which had been borne during that period by the ORG .", "The applicant appealed , challenging the method of calculation of the pecuniary damages and the amount of non - pecuniary damages . As to the former , he submitted that the method by which it had been calculated had defied equity and justice . The court had calculated it , essentially , by assessing the salary which the applicant could have been paid throughout the time of his imprisonment and by subsequently subtracting from it normal living costs during that time . The court had observed that the applicant had not been obliged to pay his living costs throughout this period because the ORG had borne them . This method , in the applicant \u2019s view , had entirely overlooked the essential aspects of compensation , namely indemnifying a wronged person and making good pecuniary damage inflicted by the manifestly unjustified and politically - motivated imprisonment imposed by the communist regime . The practice adopted by the courts of reducing awards of pecuniary damage due to victims of past political oppression reduced to nought the possibility for people who had been persecuted in the past for their political activities or ideas to obtain just satisfaction for their suffering at the hands of an oppressive political system .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal , finding that the method of calculation of pecuniary damages had been consistent with judicial practice as it stood at that time .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a cassation appeal against the above - mentioned judgment , essentially reiterating the arguments which he had submitted to the appellate court .", "On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal as manifestly illfounded , using a short formula normally used in such cases .", "The PERSON of DATE on annulment of convictions of persons persecuted for activities aimed at achieving independence for GPE ( Ustawa o uznaniu za niewa\u017cne orzecze\u0144 wydanych wobec os\u00f3b represjonowanych za dzia\u0142alno\u015b\u0107 na rzecz niepodleg\u0142ego bytu PERSON \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) sets out rules concerning the conditions under which certain politically - motivated convictions rendered from DATE to CARDINAL DATE can be declared null and void , and also provides for the ORG \u2019s civil liability for such convictions . LAW paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE LAW provides , insofar as relevant :", "\u201c Convictions or other decisions rendered by the NORP judicial , prosecuting or extra - judicial authorities during the period ... lasting from DATE to DATE shall be declared null and void if the offence with or of which the person concerned was charged or convicted related to activities undertaken by him or her with the aim of achieving independence for GPE , or if the decision in question was taken on the grounds that he had engaged in activity . The same applies to persons convicted of resisting the collectivisation of farm land and compulsory contributions of foodstuffs . \u201d", "Under LAW , a regional court or , in cases concerning military offences , a regional military court , is competent to deal with requests lodged under LAW CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . Section QUANTITY states , insofar as relevant :", "CARDINAL . A party entitled to file an application under LAW paragraph CARDINAL shall be entitled to appeal against a decision on whether or not the original decision should be declared null and void .", "According to section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL in fine of this PERSON , a decision declaring the original conviction null and void shall be tantamount to a verdict of acquittal . If such a conviction is declared null and void , a victim of repression is entitled , under section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of this PERSON , to compensation from ORG for his wrongful conviction .", "LAW of LAW , entitled \u201c Compensation for unjustified conviction , pre - trial detention or arrest \u201d , stipulates that the ORG is liable for wrongful convictions or for unjustifiably depriving an individual of his liberty . LAW provides , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . An accused who , as a result of the reopening of the criminal proceedings against him or of lodging a cassation appeal , has been acquitted or resentenced under a more lenient substantive provision , shall be entitled to compensation from ORG for the pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage which he has suffered in consequence of having served the whole or a part of the sentence imposed on him .", "...", "CARDINAL . The entitlement to compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage shall also arise in the event of manifestly unjustified arrest or pre - trial detention . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . This article provides that compensation shall be paid to a victim of a miscarriage of justice , on certain conditions .", "First , the person concerned has to have been convicted of a criminal offence by a final decision and to have suffered punishment as a result of such conviction . According to the definition contained in the explanatory report of ORG on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments , a decision is final \u201c if , according to the traditional expression , it has acquired the force of res iudicata . This is the case when it is irrevocable , that is to say when no further ordinary remedies are available or when the parties have exhausted such remedies or have permitted the time - limit to expire without availing themselves of them \u201d . It follows therefore that a judgment by default is not considered as final as long as the domestic law allows the proceedings to be taken up again . Likewise , this article does not apply in cases where the charge is dismissed or the accused person is acquitted either by the court of first instance or , on appeal , by a higher tribunal . If , however , in CARDINAL of the States in which such a possibility is provided for , the person has been granted leave to appeal after the normal time of appealing has expired , and his conviction is then reversed on appeal , then subject to the other conditions of the article , in particular the conditions described in paragraph CARDINAL below , the article may apply .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the article applies only where the person \u2019s conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned , in either case on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice - that is , some serious failure in the judicial process involving grave prejudice to the convicted person . Therefore , there is no requirement under the article to pay compensation if the conviction has been reversed or a pardon has been granted on some other ground . Nor does the article seek to lay down any rules as to the nature of the procedure to be applied to establish a miscarriage of justice . This is a matter for the domestic law or practice of the ORG concerned . The words \u201c or he has been pardoned \u201d have been included because under some systems of law pardon , rather than legal proceedings leading to the reversal of a conviction , may in certain cases be the appropriate remedy after there has been a final decision .", "CARDINAL . Finally , there is no right to compensation under this provision if it can be shown that the non - disclosure of the unknown fact in time was wholly or partly attributable to the person convicted .", "CARDINAL . In all cases in which these preconditions are satisfied , compensation is payable \u201c according to the law or the practice of the ORG concerned \u201d . This does not mean that no compensation is payable if the law or practice makes no provision for such compensation . It means that the law or practice of the ORG should provide for the payment of compensation in all cases to which the article applies . The intention is that GPE would be obliged to compensate persons only in clear cases of miscarriage of justice , in the sense that there would be acknowledgement that the person concerned was clearly innocent . The article is not intended to give a right of compensation where all the preconditions are not satisfied , for example , where an appellate court had quashed a conviction because it had discovered some fact which introduced a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused and which had been overlooked by the trial judge . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
