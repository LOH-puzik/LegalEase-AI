ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Guido Raimondi;Ledi Bianku;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Pauliine Koskelo;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is a journalist . On DATE , he published in the DATE magazine ORG article whose title was \u201c Heinous agreement between the ORG and ORG \u201d ( \u201c PERSON scellerato tra mafia e Forza GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The article in question stated that DATE a secret agreement was supposedly reached between an NORP political party , ORG , and ORG . The applicant reported that CARDINAL of the most important political figures within the party , Mr GPE , was suspected of having promised the adoption of more lenient legislative measures favourable to individuals accused of membership of mafia - type criminal organisations , as well as the adoption of other measures beneficial to their economic interests , in exchange for votes from the areas under ORG control .", "CARDINAL . In the article in question , the applicant contended that the existence of such a secret and illegal agreement had been revealed to colonel NORP of the carabinieri by PERSON , a prominent member of ORG who had close connections with some of the most influential figures within the criminal organisation .", "CARDINAL . In his article the applicant alleged that colonel NORP and PERSON had met a number of times from DATE onwards , and that the former persuaded the latter to become a pentito ( a former mafioso who has decided to cooperate with the authorities ) . In DATE , PERSON finally became a pentito and entered the witness protection programme . In this connection , he met with a carabinieri general and the anti - ORG prosecutors at the headquarters of the Raggruppamento Operativo Speciale ( ORG ) in GPE . Following that meeting , a first official interrogation was scheduled by the prosecutors . However PERSON was assassinated before it could take place .", "CARDINAL . The article went on to report that colonel NORP had been questioned by the prosecutors of ORG in DATE , in a set of related proceedings . Colonel PERSON gave an account of the above events and his statements were officially recorded on DATE in the context of the latter proceedings . The magazine article suggested that , in subsequent DATE , colonel NORP had been questioned on other occasions by the ORG prosecutors and that his statements had been recorded . In drafting the impugned article , the applicant had relied largely on these statements .", "CARDINAL . The applicant mentioned that criminal proceedings had been instituted against Mr GPE for aiding and abetting a mafia - type organisation from the outside ( concorso esterno ) , mostly in relation to the events described above .", "CARDINAL . The article continued by providing an account of a meeting that took place in DATE in the office of PERSON ( a lawyer and politician active within ORG ) involving Mr T. , Mr D.U. , colonel NORP , and a co - accused of Mr GPE In the meeting , ORG allegedly sought to persuade colonel NORP to modify his testimony in the above - mentioned trial ( see above paragraph CARDINAL) and to withhold the fact that Mr I. had told colonel NORP about the involvement of Mr GPE in the negotiations between ORG and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Quoting part of a sentence extracted from the recorded statements made by colonel NORP to the ORG prosecutors , the applicant concluded his article by suggesting that another prominent figure of ORG Mr P. \u2013 had been physically present on the premises when the meeting occurred . The quotation in question reads as follows :", "\u201c On that occasion , as on others , PERSON was also present in the chambers of Mr T. \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date following publication of the article , PERSON pressed charges against the applicant ( as well as against the editor in chief of the magazine ) for defamation through the press ( diffamazione a mezzo stampa ) . He alleged that , by quoting the above - cited statement , the applicant had implied that PERSON was actively involved in the meeting described ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . PERSON further argued that such an allegation , which he claimed was false , had damaged his reputation , due to the illegal purpose of the meeting in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the GPE ORG delivered its judgment . The court first noted that , by placing the sentence MONEY , the applicant generated in the reader the understanding that it was an accurate representation of colonel PERSON \u2019s recorded statement . However , ORG also noted that the statement had not been quoted in its entirety . The complete statement , as replicated by ORG in its judgment , reads as follows :", "\u201c On that occasion , as on others , PERSON was also present in the chambers of PERSON P. \u2019s presence was , however , due to other reasons , linked to their common political activity and he was not present when the position of Mr D.U. in his criminal proceedings was discussed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , read in conjunction with the rest of the article , the incomplete quotation acquired a clearly defamatory character . ORG further noted that this way of mentioning the fact that Mr P. was present on the LOC was \u201c unequivocally insinuating \u201d ( \u201c indubbiamente insinuante \u201d ) , thereby generating in the reader a suspicion as regards the role played by PERSON and suggesting that he was involved in the above - mentioned meeting .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the applicant could not rely on his right to impart information ( diritto di cronaca ) as a justification for his conduct . ORG reiterated that the application of such a right is dependent on the precondition that the imparted information is accurate . Based on the above arguments , ORG found that the information conveyed was not correct and that it accordingly lacked the requirement of veracity .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that the applicant \u2019s conduct had breached his duty , as a journalist , to disseminate accurate and fair information , and that he had done so despite being aware of the harm that he would cause to PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG found the applicant guilty of defamation through the press and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ( enforcement suspended ) , payment of a fine of CARDINAL ( ORG ) , payment of CARDINAL ORG in compensation ( to be paid , jointly , with the magazine \u2019s editor in chief ) , and to bear PERSON courts costs . The ORG ordered that the conviction should not appear on his criminal record .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant lodged an appeal against his conviction . He claimed that the impugned article had not been defamatory of PERSON , and that quoting the whole of colonel NORP \u2019s statement had been unnecessary . He further contested the penalty imposed .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the reasoning of ORG . In particular it reaffirmed that the contested passage in the article had clearly been of a defamatory nature , and that the applicant \u2019s conduct had been deliberate . It added that the applicant should either have refrained from mentioning PERSON at all or should have quoted colonel ORG \u2019s statement in its entirety in order to give an accurate account of the facts as related by the original source . The fact that the applicant chose to refer to PERSON presence without quoting the statement in its entirety proved his malicious intent .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal thus reaffirmed the applicant \u2019s criminal liability . However , it found the penalty imposed by the ORG excessive , as regards the suspended prison sentence , and therefore replaced it with payment of a fine of CARDINAL ORG . In all other respects it upheld the sentence imposed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal on points of law with ORG , claiming that ORG judgment had lacked adequate and logical reasoning .", "CARDINAL . ORG declared the appeal inadmissible in its judgment of DATE , finding that the reasons put forward by both ORG and ORG were sound and sufficient ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
