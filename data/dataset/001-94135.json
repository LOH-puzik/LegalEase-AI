The ORG 's failure to apply Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL amounted to \u201c a manifest error of law \u201d ( evidente errore di diritto ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant appealed .

In the alternative , he requested a reduction of his sentence .", "CARDINAL . As there were now CARDINAL appeals , at CARDINAL different levels of jurisdiction , ORG appeal on points of law was changed to an appeal on both facts and law and ORG was declared to have jurisdiction to hear the case ( LAW ORG ) .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of DATE , deposited with the registry on DATE , ORG sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . It observed that before the entry into force of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG had been interpreted to mean that life imprisonment was to be replaced by a term of DATE , whether or not it was to be accompanied by daytime isolation on account of an accumulation of offences with the most serious one .

NORP However , Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE had entered into force on DATE of the ORG 's decision .

CARDINAL the applicant could have withdrawn his request to be tried under the summary procedure and have stood trial under the ordinary procedure . As he had not done so , the first - instance decision ought to have taken account of the change in the rules on penalties which had taken place in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law . He argued in the first place that the appeal proceedings should be declared null and void because he had not been able to participate , as defendant , in the appeal hearing on DATE . In his second and third grounds of appeal the applicant asserted that the trial courts had not given sufficient reasons either for ruling that he had intended to commit murder or for their finding that he knew what he was doing and had acted intentionally when committing the offences . Lastly , he contested the finding of an aggravating circumstance ( that he had acted for futile reasons ) and complained of the refusal to grant him extenuating circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted further grounds of appeal . He contended that a fresh expert opinion should have been produced on his mental state at the time when the offences were committed and presented new arguments on the question of aggravating and extenuating circumstances . Lastly , he submitted that the penalty deemed to be applicable in his case ( life imprisonment with isolation ) was excessive .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment deposited with its registry on DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal on the ground of a factual error ( Article CARDINALa of the ORG ) . He asserted in the first place that the domestic courts ' finding that he could have been taken to the appeal hearing by an ordinary means of transport and did not need an ambulance had been the result of an erroneous reading of the documents in the file . In addition , his absence , as the defendant , from that hearing had breached LAW . The applicant further alleged that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on him following the changes made by LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , and thus through a retrospective criminal - law provision , had breached LAW and the principles of fair trial . He submitted that his waiver of procedural safeguards as a result of electing to stand trial under the summary procedure had not been compensated for by the reduction of his sentence promised by the ORG at the time when he made that choice . Lastly , he maintained that life imprisonment was an inhuman and degrading punishment and as such contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , deposited with its registry on DATE , ORG declared the applicant 's extraordinary appeal inadmissible .

The relevant passages of the judgment ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Setting aside the applicability of Article CARDINAL of ORG to the failure to publish DATE accounts , it should be noted that , under LAW , which sets out the principle that the more lenient penalty should be applied retroactively , the new ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code ought to be applied even if they entered into force only after the commission of the acts underlying the prosecutions brought in the cases in the main proceedings .", "CARDINAL . It must be pointed out in this regard that , according to settled case - law , fundamental rights form an integral part of the general principles of law , the observance of which the ORG ensures . For that purpose , the ORG draws inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the Member GPE and from the guidelines supplied by international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the Member GPE have collaborated or to which they are signatories ( see , inter alia , Case C CARDINAL/CARDINAL Schmidberger [ DATE ] ECR I DATE , paragraph CARDINAL and the case - law there cited , and Joined Cases C CARDINAL/CARDINAL and C CARDINAL/CARDINAL Booker Aquaculture and ORG [ DATE ] ECR I DATE , paragraph CARDINAL and the case - law there cited ) .", "DATE . The principle of the retroactive application of the more lenient penalty forms part of the constitutional traditions common to the Member GPE .", "CARDINAL . It follows that this principle must be regarded as forming part of the general principles of Community law which national courts must respect when applying the national legislation adopted for the purpose of implementing Community law and , more particularly in the present cases , the directives on company law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The principles affirmed by ORG were repeated in a judgment of ORG of ORG given on DATE ( dismissal of appeal no . DATE ) . The relevant passages of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ... in any event the general principles of Community law take precedence over national law . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG observed that the principle of the retroactive application of the more lenient penalty forms part of the constitutional traditions common to the member GPE and it follows that the said principle must be considered one of the general principles of Community law which national courts must comply with when applying the national law adopted with a view to implementing Community law ( DATE and CARDINAL of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) . In the present case , consequently , it was in breach of that principle taking precedence over national law that ORG sentenced [ the accused ] on the basis of a national law adopted with a view to implementing Community law , having unlawfully disregarded the principle of the retroactive application of the more lenient penalty .", "... LAW provides , without any exception , that where , subsequent to the commission of an offence , the law provides for the application of a more lenient penalty , the offender must be given the benefit thereof . That text takes precedence over NORP law by virtue of LAW . It follows that ORG could not disregard the new more lenient law on the sole ground that the later law had expressly excluded any retroactive effect in contravention of the principle laid down by the text referred to above . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the terms of LAW ,", "\u201c In the event of a change in the law applicable to a given case prior to a final judgement , the law more favourable to the person being investigated , prosecuted or convicted shall apply . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , given in the PERSON case ( no . IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-A ) , ORG of the ORG held that the principle of the applicability of the more lenient criminal law ( lex mitior ) applied to its statute . The relevant parts of the judgment ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG first considered whether the principle of lex mitior had been applicable in the former GPE and whether it was part of the law of ORG and then addressed the question of whether the lex mitior principle was applicable in the present case .", "CARDINAL . NORP The contentious part of LAW is the finding of ORG that \u201c the principle of lex mitior applies only to cases in which the commission of a criminal offence and the subsequent imposition of a penalty took place within one and the same jurisdiction \u201d and that , because this ORG exercises a different jurisdiction from the national jurisdiction in which the crimes were committed , the principle does not apply . ORG notes that the question of the applicability of the principle is not one of jurisdiction , but rather CARDINAL of whether differing criminal laws are relevant and applicable to the law governing the sentencing consideration of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The principle of lex mitior is understood to mean that , if the law relevant to the offence of the accused has been amended , the less severe law should be applied . It is an inherent element of this principle that the relevant law must be binding upon the court . Accused persons can only benefit from the more lenient sentence if the law is binding , since they only have a protected legal position when the sentencing range must be applied to them . The principle of lex mitior is thus only applicable if a law that binds ORG is subsequently changed to a more favourable law by which ORG is also obliged to abide .", "CARDINAL . ORG is clearly bound by its own LAW , and thus to the sentencing range of a term up to and including the remainder of the convicted person 's life as provided for in LAW ) of the Rules and LAW . ORG notes that there has not been a change in the laws of ORG regarding sentencing ranges .", "CARDINAL . The sentencing range in the former GPE would be restricted to a fixed term of imprisonment . ORG notes that , since the establishment of ORG , an accused before it can receive a maximum sentence that is not limited to a fixed term of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG , however , reiterates its finding that ORG , having primacy , is not bound by the law or sentencing practice of the former GPE . It has merely to take it into consideration . Allowing the principle of lex mitior to be applied to sentences of ORG on the basis of changes in the laws of the former GPE would mean that GPE former GPE have the power to undermine the sentencing discretion of ORG judges . In passing a national law setting low maximum penalties for the crimes mentioned in LAW to CARDINAL of ORG statute , GPE could then prevent their citizens from being properly sentenced by this ORG . This is not compatible with ORG primacy enshrined in Article CARDINAL ) of the ORG and its overall mandate .", "CARDINAL . In sum , properly understood , lex mitior applies to the Statute of the International Tribunal . Accordingly , if ever the sentencing powers conferred by the Statute were to be amended , ORG would have to apply the less severe penalty . So far as concerns the requirement of Article CARDINAL ) that \u201c the Trial Chambers shall have recourse to the general practice regarding prison sentences in the courts of the former GPE \u201d , these words have to be construed in accordance with the principles of interpretation applicable to the Statute of which they form part . So construed , they refer to any pertinent laws of the former GPE which were in force at the time of commission of the crime in question ; subsequent changes in those laws are not imported .", "CARDINAL .
