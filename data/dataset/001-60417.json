On DATE an examiner employed by ORG ( NORP valodas inspekcija ) , part of ORG , went to the applicant 's place of work and examined her orally to assess her knowledge of NORP . As the applicant had not been notified of the visit , the examiner approached her while she was conducting negotiations with her business associates .", "Having informed the applicant of her intention to verify the level of her competence in NORP , the examiner struck up a conversation with her in that language .

The examiner asked the applicant to write an essay in NORP . The applicant agreed to do so and began to write .

Consequently , ORG had complied with the requirements of the LAW by deciding to register the list on which the applicant 's name appeared .
