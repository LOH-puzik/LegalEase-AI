FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr PERSON lives in GPE , where he used to run a business in his own name , \" Les Techniques du Son \" , at the same time as being the de facto manager of the limited company PERSON . This state of affairs continued until the CARDINAL undertakings were compulsorily wound up , on DATE for the latter and CARDINAL DATE for the former .", "CARDINAL . On an application by the trustee representing the interests of PERSON \u2019s creditors ( le syndic de la liquidation ) , ORG decided on DATE to apply to Mr Pardo Article CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and ordered him to pay MONEY as a contribution to the deficiency in the assets .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , on DATE , and the trustee , on DATE , filed appeals . On DATE Mr PERSON lodged his final submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge responsible for preparing the case declared the investigation closed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the Aix - en - Provence Court of Appeal to revoke that decision and to stay the proceedings pending the conclusion of proceedings brought against him for criminal bankruptcy .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , at the hearing on DATE record of which was produced before the ORG by the Government - his lawyer confined his pleadings to the request for a stay of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment in open court on DATE without having held another hearing .", "It first rejected the applicant \u2019s request on the ground that there was no link between the criminal proceedings and the legal issues raised by the application of the above - mentioned LAW . It considered that , whatever the outcome of the criminal trial , it would not have any bearing on the question of the applicant \u2019s liability qua manager of the company .", "On the merits , ORG noted , inter alia , like the NORP court , that the company had aimed to conquer the telecommunications market without having the financial resources to put this ambition into effect and that the applicant had devoted considerable energy to obtaining bank loans , and had unrealistically and imprudently adopted a course of action which had been bound to aggravate the situation and increase the deficit . It took the view that the applicant had been at fault in blindly pursuing a fanciful objective without the slightest hope of redressing the situation ; it confirmed the decision requiring him to make good part of the deficit in the company \u2019s assets . ORG also ordered PERSON brother and sister to pay respectively MONEY as a contribution to the debts ; it found that they too bore responsibility , whereas the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had exonerated them .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to the First President of ORG PERSON criticised this judgment . He explained that at the hearing on DATE his lawyer \" had requested that the proceedings be stayed , on which request ... the President of the CARDINALth ORG had agreed to deliberate , even envisaging the possibility that , if necessary , DATE would subsequently be set aside to hear the case again and to take argument on the merits \" . On this account he asked the First President to accord him an interview .", "The First President replied in a letter of CARDINAL DATE that there had been no irregularity in the proceedings and that , in any event , the interview sought by PERSON was not appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then obtained the testimony of lawyers who had been present at the hearing of DATE .", "His lawyer , PERSON , wrote to him on DATE certifying that the President had stated that the case would be adjourned either to DATE , if the request for a stay was granted , or to a date in the near future when it would be the only case on the list in view of the number of documents to be examined . According to the lawyer , the court had had before it only his CARDINAL sets of final submissions , whereas the file of his pleadings had comprised CARDINAL folders QUANTITY thick . PERSON , the counsel for one of the other directors of the company , also implicated in the case , confirmed , in his reply dated DATE to a letter which ORG had sent to him on DATE , a copy of which the applicant was , however , unable to produce , that the hearing in issue had indeed followed the course described by the applicant \u2019s lawyer in his letter .", "Another lawyer , PERSON , who was not present when the cases were called but who had been due to plead for the applicant , confirmed by a letter of DATE that on DATE , at TIME , his client had telephoned him to advise him against attending as the case was going to be adjourned .", "The applicant twice asked to be sent documents relating to the hearing ( record and list of cases ) , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON filed an appeal on points of law . He complained that ORG had not answered his submissions on the merits of the case ; in addition , he alleged a violation of the rights of the defence inasmuch as the hearing had dealt exclusively with the request for a stay of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . It found that , in the light of the statements made on the merits of the case and without disregarding the rights of the defence , ORG had , in assessing the part of the company \u2019s liabilities to be borne by the management , replied to the submissions put forward ; the CARDINAL grounds for appeal were therefore not founded .", "CARDINAL .
