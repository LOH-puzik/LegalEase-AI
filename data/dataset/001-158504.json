The arrest warrant reads , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c In view of the above , it is essential to question the suspect and thus assess the application of other preventive measures in addition to providing information on identity and residence [ termo de identidade e resid\u00eancia ] . Having regard to the strong grounds that exist regarding the commission of the acts described , which are crimes allowing for the application of pre - trial detention , and taking into account that , in the present case , there is a risk of absconding , a risk of continuing the criminal activity and obstructing the investigation ...
