FRANCE and GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON ( GPE ) . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE ( GPE ) .", "On DATE the applicant married a NORP national . The marriage produced a son and a daughter , born in DATE and DATE respectively . The applicant and his wife have been living apart since DATE .", "On DATE proceedings for the award of parental responsibility were instituted in ORG ( ORG ) .", "On DATE ORG provisionally granted the applicant the right to determine the children \u2019s place of residence while their parents lived apart .", "At a hearing in FAC on DATE the children \u2019s mother stated that she had no intention of unlawfully leaving GPE with the children .", "On DATE ORG consequently revoked its decision of DATE and restored the joint exercise of parental responsibility .", "On DATE , without the applicant \u2019s knowledge and against his wishes , the children \u2019s mother removed them from the family home in order to settle with them at her GPE home in FAC ( GPE ) .", "On DATE ORG again granted the applicant the right to determine the children \u2019s place of residence and ordered their mother to return them .", "On DATE ORG ruled that the mother \u2019s removal of the children to a different country had been wrongful within the meaning of LAW of DATE on ORG .", "On DATE the applicant had the children abducted in GPE and brought back to him in GPE .", "On DATE ORG decided to stay the custody proceedings pending the final decision on an application by the mother for the children \u2019s return .", "On DATE ORG dismissed an application by the mother for recognition of an order made on DATE by a NORP court ( the PERSON tribunal de grande instance ) and for the return of the children . The mother appealed against that decision .", "On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) ordered the return of the children to their mother on the basis of LAW of DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal ( ORG ) and applied for a stay of execution of the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , allowed the application for a stay of execution , thereby provisionally maintaining the applicant \u2019s home as the children \u2019s place of residence .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case to ORG . It held that the children should have been represented by a guardian in the appeal proceedings . Furthermore , ORG had failed to consider the interests of the children in the light of paragraph CARDINAL ( b ) , and of paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL taken together , of LAW DATE . In ORG view , ordering successive removals of children when first one and then the other parent applied for their return ran counter to the aims of that LAW if the children \u2019s return placed them in an intolerable situation , unless the court concerned found that there were particular facts justifying their return in spite of the risks entailed by a further removal .", "On DATE ORG appointed an expert to assess the state of both GPE relations with the children , with a view in particular to determining which parent should be awarded custody . ORG also appointed a lawyer of ORG to protect the children \u2019s interests .", "On DATE the expert submitted his report . In it he concluded that both parents were capable of bringing up the children , although he stressed the good relationship between the applicant and his children . As regards the children \u2019s place of residence , the expert considered that the desire expressed by the applicant \u2019s son to stay with his father could be explained by the fact that the applicant had influenced his son and undermined his image of his mother , thereby provoking a conflict of loyalties . It had emerged from exploratory discussions , however , that the son had pleasant memories of his stay in GPE , had made friends through leisure activities such as judo , and had got on well with his maternal grandparents . His grandfather had apparently once kicked him , but it had transpired that he had only been teasing him and had not caused any harm . The expert observed that there were significant differences between the GPE respective approaches to bringing up their children . The mother took great care to set limits for the children , while the applicant adopted a more liberal attitude towards them , especially towards his son , who was used to having his every whim satisfied . The expert considered that such an approach could have a negative effect in the long term , as the son might become intolerant of frustration and might experience problems . In the expert \u2019s opinion , the children \u2019s mother was in a better position to ensure their well - being because she did not work , and if she was ever temporarily unable to look after them , they could be looked after , supervised and supported by the members of her family , whom they had known for a long time . Where young children were concerned , an arrangement of that kind was more beneficial than employing someone to look after them . Having regard , on the one hand , to the applicant \u2019s age and approach to child - raising , and , on the other hand , to the fact that the children \u2019s mother , who did not have a job , was able to devote herself entirely and exclusively to them , the expert expressed the view that the children should be returned to their mother . He considered that DATE they had previously spent with her \u2013 a subjectively long period for DATE had enabled them to settle into those new surroundings .", "On DATE ORG decided to confer on ORG ( PERSON ) the right to determine the children \u2019s place of residence pending its ruling on the merits . ORG subsequently recommended that the children should live with their father .", "On DATE the expert followed up his report with comments on objections submitted by the applicant .", "On CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE the applicant challenged the president of the relevant division of ORG , another judge of that court and a judge of ORG for bias . He accused ORG judges of failing to take sufficient account of ORG decision by failing to draw a distinction between the application for transfer of residence under LAW DATE and the assessment of the children \u2019s interests , the latter task being the responsibility of the judges who had to determine the interim measures to be taken in respect of the children after the separation of their parents . He further argued that the judges in question had contravened the principle of impartiality to his disadvantage by describing his attitude as uncooperative . Their bias was also evident , in his submission , from the questions they had put to the expert , from their refusal to allow his requests for an adjournment and for a say in the choice of expert , from the delay in serving judicial decisions and from the fact that a \u201c wanted \u201d notice had been issued on account of his failure to attend a hearing .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the challenges as unfounded .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a stay of execution of ORG decision if it ruled in favour of returning the children to their mother in GPE , pending ORG decision on the matter .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , allowed the application .", "On DATE , having heard evidence from the parents , the children and the expert , ORG ordered the return of the children to their mother at her home in GPE , the ORG of their habitual residence for the purposes of LAW of DATE . It held that the children \u2019s return to their mother was justified under LAW DATE as their removal to GPE by their father had been wrongful within the meaning of LAW . Under that provision , the removal of a child was to be considered wrongful where it was in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , either jointly or alone , under the law of the State in which the child had been habitually resident immediately before the removal , and where at the time of removal those rights were actually being exercised . ORG observed that the CARDINAL children had been habitually resident in GPE before being removed to GPE on DATE . At the time of the removal they had been resident in GPE for DATE . They had been living with their mother in a flat in their GPE house in GPE . They had adapted well to their new surroundings . As a rule , a stay of DATE was sufficient for a place of residence to be considered habitual . The fact that the mother had taken the children to GPE against their father \u2019s wishes did not preclude her home in GPE being established as their habitual residence . In general , it was important for children to adapt to living conditions in their new place of residence , and that had occurred in the instant case . ORG added that contact between the parents remained desirable , and they would have to abate their mutual distrust .", "In accordance with LAW DATE , ORG took account of the order issued by the PERSON tribunal de grande instance on DATE in determining whether there had been a wrongful removal , although it did not avail itself of the specific procedures for recognition of that decision , which had ordered the joint exercise of parental responsibility by both parents . ORG further held that the conditions laid down in LAW ( b ) of LAW DATE were not satisfied in the instant case . By virtue of that provision , the judicial authority of the requested ORG was not bound to order the return of children if the person opposing that measure established that there was a grave risk that the child \u2019s return would expose him or her to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place him or her in an intolerable situation .", "On the basis of the report drawn up by the expert it had appointed and the statements made by the expert at the hearing , ORG , in accordance with the wishes of the children \u2019s lawyer , concluded that the return of the children to their mother would be in their interests . It considered that there was no need to order a second expert opinion , since the applicant \u2019s criticisms had merely referred to scientific theories without casting doubt on the expert \u2019s findings , which , in its view , were clear , consistent and well - founded .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , decided not to entertain a constitutional appeal lodged by the applicant against that decision .", "On DATE the mother brought the CARDINAL children back to GPE .", "On DATE the children \u2019s mother instituted divorce proceedings in the PERSON tribunal de grande instance .", "On DATE the family - affairs judge of that court authorised her to live apart from her husband , together with her children , at her home in GPE .", "On DATE ORG and the applicant applied to the LOC tribunal de grande instance , requesting it to order the immediate return of the children to their home in GPE , pursuant to LAW DATE . The applicant further requested that ORG decision of DATE , provisionally granting the applicant the right to determine where the children should live , be declared enforceable or , at the least , recognised in GPE .", "On DATE the family - affairs judge of the PERSON tribunal de grande instance refused to order the return of the children to GPE . Although he considered the mother \u2019s removal of the children to have been wrongful , he stated that returning the children to GPE would entail a grave risk for them and would in any case place them in an intolerable situation within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW . Referring to the case - law of ORG , to the effect that a grave risk or an intolerable situation could also result from a further change in the children \u2019s living conditions , the judge concluded that both the separation of the children from their mother and the separation of the brother and sister from each other would cause an immediate risk of psychological harm , and that the sudden return of the children to GPE would place them in an intolerable situation , regard being had to their tender age ( CARDINAL being DATE and the other CARDINAL ) . That situation would be aggravated by the crisis which the couple were undergoing and by the total lack of certainty as to the length of the mother \u2019s separation from her children .", "The applicant appealed against that decision .", "On DATE the family - affairs judge of the PERSON tribunal de grande instance issued an order pronouncing the failure of the conciliation process in the divorce proceedings . He decided that parental responsibility should be exercised jointly by the CARDINAL parents and that the children should be habitually resident with their mother , and granted the father access and staying access , specifying that those rights would not become enforceable until the date on which the order pronouncing the failure of the conciliation process was declared enforceable in GPE .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the order of DATE . Noting that a grave risk of harm or of an intolerable situation within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW of DATE cited as justification for retaining children who had been removed \u2013 might be entailed by a further change in the children \u2019s living conditions , ORG confirmed that separating a CARDINAL - and - a - half - year - old child from her mother and a brother and sister from each other would cause an immediate risk of psychological harm , and that the sudden return of the children to GPE would place them in an intolerable situation in view of their tender age . It further noted that the mother , who did not work , had always looked after the QUANTITY children \u2019s everyday needs since their birth and that their return to GPE would entail the end of that state of affairs , especially as the mother \u2019s highly precarious financial situation gave reason to fear that she would be unable to make regular use of the access and staying access to which she would be entitled . ORG declared inadmissible the applicant \u2019s application to have the NORP court \u2019s decision of DATE ( provisionally granting him the right to determine where the CARDINAL children should live ) recognised or declared enforceable . It also held that that application was ill - founded .", "The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment within the statutory period of DATE . He argued in particular that , on the basis of LAW of DATE , the judge should have acted swiftly to end the patently illegal situation resulting from the children \u2019s wrongful removal and could only have refused their immediate return if they faced a grave risk , the assessment of which was quite distinct from the assessment of the children \u2019s best interests with regard to a custody measure . In basing its decision on the children \u2019s interest in staying with their mother , ORG had , in the applicant \u2019s submission , acted as a court of first instance and exceeded its jurisdiction , in breach of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of LAW of DATE .", "The applicant further submitted that the immediate return of a wrongfully removed child , even CARDINAL of tender age , to live with his lawful father in the same conditions as had existed before the wrongful removal could not in any circumstances be regarded as constituting an intolerable situation within the meaning of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant had the children abducted in GPE and brought back to him in GPE . The PERSON investigating judge subsequently began a criminal investigation in respect of the applicant for abduction of a minor by a gang and criminal conspiracy .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law .", "On DATE the children \u2019s mother applied to have the father \u2019s access and staying access revoked as a result of the children \u2019s abduction .", "In an order of DATE the PERSON tribunal de grande instance suspended the applicant \u2019s access and staying access in respect of his daughter during DATE and granted him access and staying access in respect of his son .", "It appears from the file that , notwithstanding the order of DATE , the CARDINAL children spent DATE of their DATE at their father \u2019s home .", "On DATE the applicant learned from his son that the children \u2019s mother was planning to move to GPE , where she had found a job .", "On an unspecified date the applicant applied to the PERSON tribunal de grande instance to have the children \u2019s place of residence transferred to his home in GPE . He argued that their mother did not have sufficient time available to ensure the children \u2019s day - to - day upbringing and to give them the care and attention they needed .", "On DATE the PERSON tribunal de grande instance dismissed that application . It pointed out that the children \u2019s return to GPE had been ordered by ORG in the light of the various findings set out in the expert \u2019s psychological report . It observed that the mother \u2019s physical availability , which had been taken into account at the time , had not been the sole factor determining where the children should live . After the applicant had abducted the children , their mother had been unable to see them for DATE as a result of his unreasonable attitude . In that context , the children had suffered severe psychological trauma . Since they had returned to their mother , she had found a job , a fact for which she could not be reproached . Although she was now in employment , she had managed , like any other working woman , to organise her children \u2019s everyday lives satisfactorily ; the children appeared to be thriving in her company . They attended schools not far from their home and their mother worked in the same area . There was nothing in the file to indicate that the mother \u2019s new circumstances were detrimental to the children or were responsible for the son \u2019s difficulties at school or the daughter \u2019s psychological problems . Those problems had existed before and were the consequence not of the mother \u2019s personal situation but of the conflict between the parents , which was still extremely intense . Noting , however , that since DATE the family situation had calmed down considerably , the court granted the applicant access and staying access in respect of both children , subject to the conditions laid down in the order of DATE pronouncing the failure of the conciliation process . It also set the amount of maintenance and the applicant \u2019s contribution to his children \u2019s upkeep and education .", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The objects of the present Convention are :", "( a ) to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any ORG ; and", "( b ) to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of CARDINAL ORG are effectively respected in GPE . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where :", "( a ) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , an institution or any other body , either jointly or alone , under the law of the ORG in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention ; and", "( b ) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised , either jointly or alone , or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention . \u201d", "The rights of custody mentioned in sub - paragraph ( a ) above may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision , or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that ORG . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of LAW and , at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of ORG where the child is , a period of DATE has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention , the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith .", "The judicial or administrative authority , even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of DATE referred to in the preceding paragraph , shall also order the return of the child , unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment .", "Where the judicial or administrative authority in the requested ORG has reason to believe that the child has been taken to another ORG , it may stay the proceedings or dismiss the application for the return of the child . \u201d", "LAW", "\u201c Notwithstanding the provisions of DATE , the judicial or administrative authority of the requested ORG is not bound to order the return of the child if the person , institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that :", "( a ) the person , institution or other body having the care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention , or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention ; or", "( b ) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation .", "The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views .", "In considering the circumstances referred to in this LAW , the judicial and administrative authorities shall take into account the information relating to the social background of the child provided by ORG or other competent authority of the child \u2019s habitual residence . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c A decision under this Convention concerning the return of the child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
