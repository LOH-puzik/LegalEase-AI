If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed in the course of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of DATE on the prosecution of civil servants , which restricts the public prosecutor \u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect \u2019s status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the local administrative councils .
