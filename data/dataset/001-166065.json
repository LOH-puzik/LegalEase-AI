The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the DATE newspaper GPE list published CARDINAL articles in which the applicant accused his neighbour , a certain Mr GPE , of \u201c stealing \u201d his house and orchard .", "CARDINAL . In the ensuing CARDINAL sets of criminal proceedings instituted by GPE by way of private prosecution , the applicant was found guilty of CARDINAL counts of defamation ( kleveta ) . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) fined the applicant CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) and ordered him to pay GPE HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the costs of the proceedings . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , amended by ORG PERSON \u2013 hereinafter \u201c the GPE \u201d ) on DATE , ORG judicially admonished ( sudska opomena ) the applicant and ordered him to pay GPE HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL in costs .", "CARDINAL . NORP In subsequent civil defamation proceedings which GPE instituted against the applicant , the civil courts also found in favour of the plaintiff and awarded him damages . By a judgment of DATE , amended by ORG on DATE , ORG ordered the applicant to pay ORG as compensation for non - pecuniary damage , together with statutory default interest and HRK CARDINAL in costs .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , another set of civil proceedings between the same parties had also ended unfavourably for the applicant . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action to declare an in - court settlement between him and GPE of DATE null and void , and ordered him to pay the defendant HRK CARDINAL in costs .", "CARDINAL . Since the applicant did not pay the sums stipulated above ( hereinafter \u201c the debt \u201d ) on time , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE GPE instituted CARDINAL sets of enforcement proceedings in ORG , seeking enforcement against the applicant \u2019s immovable property , specifically his share in the house and surrounding land he owned with his wife . The property in question consisted of the house , a yard and arable land ( fields ) measuring CARDINAL , QUANTITY respectively ( hereinafter \u201c the property \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively the court issued CARDINAL writs of execution ( rje\u0161enja o ovrsi ) ordering the seizure and sale of the applicant \u2019s share in the property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG dismissed appeals lodged by the applicant and upheld the writs .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG joined the CARDINAL sets of enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE the court , on the basis of information provided by the tax authorities , determined that the value of the applicant \u2019s share in the property was HRK CARDINAL . The applicant did not attend the hearing even though he had been duly notified .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE the court ordered the sale of the applicant \u2019s share in the property ( zaklju\u010dak o prodaji , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and scheduled a public auction for DATE at which , in accordance with the law , the property ( or share of it ) could not be sold for CARDINAL of its value ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The auction was not attended by any interested buyers . The applicant , however , submitted a certificate confirming that on DATE he had paid HRK CARDINAL of the debt , and promised to pay the rest by New Year .", "CARDINAL . Since he did not do so , on DATE PERSON asked the court to schedule a second public auction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted another certificate confirming that on DATE he had paid HRK CARDINAL of the debt , and asked the court not to schedule a second auction because he would gradually pay the rest of the debt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON reiterated his request for a second auction and stated that , by repeatedly promising to gradually pay the debt within self - imposed deadlines he did not observe , the applicant was merely protracting the enforcement proceedings which had thus far lasted DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court scheduled the second public auction for CARDINAL DATE at which , in accordance with the law , the property ( or share of it ) could not be sold for CARDINAL of its value ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At the second auction only GPE offered to buy the applicant \u2019s share in the property , for HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . This was the minimum price allowed by law and corresponded to CARDINAL of its value . The applicant \u2019s representative asked the court to postpone the auction and promised that the applicant would pay the rest of the debt within DATE . The court refused this request and issued a decision declaring that GPE had \u201c satisfied the conditions to be awarded [ the share in ] the property \u201d . It also specified that the decision actually awarding him the share in the property ( rje\u0161enje o dosudi , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) would be delivered at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant paid HRK CARDINAL of the debt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he informed the court that earlier that day he had paid a further HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , and had thereby settled the debt of HRK CARDINAL in full ( consisting of the principal amount of HRK ORG and HRK CARDINAL of statutory default interest ) . What remained to be paid were the costs of the enforcement proceedings . He therefore asked the court to discontinue the enforcement and issue a decision specifying those costs , which he promised to pay immediately .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE GPE confirmed that on DATE the applicant had paid the debt in full , but had not covered the costs of the enforcement proceedings . He thus asked the court to issue a decision on costs , and the award decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court delivered its award decision ( rje\u0161enje o dosudi , see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It specified that the property would be surrendered ( transferred ) to GPE after he deposited the purchase price , within DATE of the decision becoming final . The court found the fact that the applicant had paid the debt in full on CARDINAL DATE irrelevant , since the decision on the sale of the applicant \u2019s share in the property to GPE had been adopted earlier , on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It noted however that the fact that the applicant had paid off the debt would be taken into account when distributing the proceeds of sale ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In particular , the court held as follows :", "\u201c Given that the property was sold on DATE at the second public auction when it was established that the bidder GPE had made the best bid and had offered [ to pay ] HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , and thereby met the conditions to be awarded the property , the court adopted [ the present ] award decision ... regardless of the fact that the enforcement debtor on CARDINAL DATE settled the debt in respect of the principal amount and the interest . When settling the enforcement creditor \u2019s claim , the court will deliver a distribution decision whereby it will take into account the fact that the enforcement debtor had settled the debt in respect of the principal amount and the interest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision . He argued that he had settled the debt in DATE before the court had issued the contested award decision . In that sense GPE \u201c had got it both ways \u201d as he had both been paid the debt and acquired the share in the property . There had been no reason to sell his share in the property to pay the same debt . He further stated that he would also have covered the costs of the enforcement proceedings that remained due if the court had issued a decision specifying the amount , which it had not done .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the contested decision , which thereby became final . It held that the necessary conditions for selling the applicant \u2019s share in the property to GPE had already been met on DATE . The fact that he had later paid off the debt had no bearing on the validity of the sale . In particular , that court held as follows :", "\u201c Having regard to the fact that on DATE the second public auction was held at which the enforcement creditor appeared as a bidder and made the best ( the only ) bid , and given that after the auction the court established that the enforcement creditor had offered the highest price and had met the conditions to be awarded the property in accordance with section CARDINAL ) of LAW , the first - instance court was , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of [ that ] Act , entitled ( and obliged to ) adopt the contested [ award ] decision ...", "The fact that the enforcement debtor after the [ second public ] auction , on CARDINAL DATE settled the creditor \u2019s claim in full is of no relevance for the validity of the contested decision , regardless of the unjustified ( time ) gap between the auction and the adoption of the impugned decision . [ That is because ] at the auction of CARDINAL DATE , which was held in line with the [ relevant ] provisions of LAW , it was established that the enforcement creditor offered the highest price and that he met the conditions to be awarded the property . [ Therefore ] the events that occurred subsequently can not call into question the award of the property , nor can the said event constitute grounds for discontinuation of enforcement under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG decision , alleging a violation of his constitutional right to fair procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE informed the court that he had deposited the purchase price , and submitted proof thereof .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE ( zaklju\u010dak o predaji , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ORG surrendered ( transferred ) the applicant \u2019s share in the property to GPE On DATE the court \u2019s land registry department recorded him in the land register as co - owner of the property instead of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint of CARDINAL DATE inadmissible ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It held that the contested decision was not open to constitutional review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a distribution decision ( rje\u0161enje o namirenju , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , distributing the HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL deposited with the court by GPE for the applicant \u2019s share in the property . The court specified the costs of the enforcement proceedings , which were incumbent on the applicant , as HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , and returned that amount to GPE The remaining HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL was paid to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant against that decision . On DATE lodged a constitutional complaint against the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG declared that constitutional complaint inadmissible , holding that the contested decision was not open to constitutional review .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG declared the enforcement completed . An appeal by the applicant against that decision was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE instituted non - contentious proceedings in ORG against the applicant \u2019s wife by lodging a petition for partition of co - ownership . Since the property could not be physically divided , he sought a partition by sale , whereby the proceeds would be distributed to the co - owners .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant \u2019s wife opposed the partition , by a decision of DATE the court discontinued the non - contentious proceedings and instructed GPE to institute separate civil proceedings against her to that end .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE brought a civil action against the applicant \u2019s wife as instructed , in the same municipal court . He sought a partition of co - ownership in the same way as in his petition of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ruled for the plaintiff and ordered a partition by sale and distribution of the proceeds to the co - owners . It also ordered the applicant \u2019s wife to pay the plaintiff HRK CARDINAL in costs .", "CARDINAL . She appealed and the proceedings are currently pending before the second - instance court .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE GPE , had also instituted another set of civil proceedings before ORG against the applicant , seeking payment of rent for the use of the property . He explained that the applicant had remained living in the house even after he acquired the applicant \u2019s share . As a co - owner he was thus entitled to seek from the applicant CARDINAL of the rent under which the house could be rented out .
