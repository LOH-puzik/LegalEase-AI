The applicant \u2019s appeal against that order was rejected by ORG on DATE , in the presence of his lawyer .", "On DATE the ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody until DATE on the same grounds , i.e. , for fear that the applicant might commit new crimes or obstruct the investigation . Both the applicant and his lawyer were present .", "His appeal against the extension order was rejected on DATE , the applicant \u2019s defence counsel being present .", "On DATE the term of the applicant \u2019s remand was extended until CARDINAL September CARDINAL by ORG on the same grounds as before , the applicant and his lawyer being present . The applicant appealed , requesting the variation of his remand . He pleaded not guilty and alleged that there was no fear of him absconding since he had a family and a permanent place of residence . The appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE , in the presence of the applicant \u2019s defence counsel . The court considered that the grounds for his detention persisted .", "On DATE the ORG authorised the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE , in the presence of the applicant and his lawyer . The court briefly noted that the applicant \u201c was accused of having committed serious offences , hence there was a reason to believe that he may commit new crimes if released . \u201d On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision , his representative being present . The appellate court noted , inter alia , that the applicant was suspected of heading a criminal organisation , thereby justifying the fear of his committing fresh crimes and influencing witnesses .", "On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE . While the court emphasised the necessity to expedite the investigation of the case , it considered that continued detention was justified by the fear that the applicant might abscond and commit fresh crimes . The applicant and his defence counsel were present . The applicant \u2019s appeal against that order was dismissed by ORG on DATE , his lawyer being present .", "During DATE , in the context of several other sets of criminal proceedings , the applicant was charged with attempted aggravated murder , the destruction of property by organising explosions , forming a criminal organisation , and false reporting of a crime . Those charges were subsequently added to the original proceedings against the applicant .", "On DATE the ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE for fear of his absconding and committing new offences .

He was indicted on CARDINAL counts , including attempted murder , extortion , involvement in a criminal association , the destruction or property and the illegal acquisition of explosives . CARDINAL other co - accused were indicted with the applicant ; CARDINAL witnesses were identified , and the case materials comprised CARDINAL volumes .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the prolongation of his detention on remand .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing in the presence of the applicant and his defence counsel and decided further to extend the applicant \u2019s remand in custody until DATE , for fear of his absconding , committing new crimes and obstructing the investigation . The court mentioned the gravity of the charges against the applicant and the strength of the evidence in the case file to justify that fear . The applicant appealed , claiming that the evidence against him was not sufficient to warrant his prolonged detention . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal in the presence of his lawyer .", "On DATE ORG held a directions hearing in the presence of the applicant \u2019s defence counsel , whereby it decided to return the case to the investigators . On the same occasion , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to vary the remand measure .", "On DATE the ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody until DATE on the same grounds as before . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal against the order in the presence of counsel .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE , returning the case to ORG for trial . On the same occasion , the court extended the term of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE , noting that the grounds for the continued detention on remand persisted .

The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , but it was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody until DATE for fear of his obstructing the investigation and committing fresh crimes . The court noted the applicant \u2019s criminal record , the gravity of the charges against him and the strength of the evidence in the case file to justify that fear . The applicant and his representative were present at the hearing .", "On DATE the ORG committed the applicant for trial .", "On the same date ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE on the same grounds . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing . The applicant \u2019s appeal against that order was dismissed by ORG on DATE . ORG observed that the trial of the case had been prolonged , but noted that the delay was not imputable to the trial court .", "On DATE the ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody until DATE on the same grounds , the applicant \u2019s lawyer being present . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the order was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE a prosecutor confirmed a bill of indictment in another criminal case whereby the applicant was charged on CARDINAL counts , including causing grievous bodily harm , theft and extortion . CARDINAL other persons were indicted with the applicant . CARDINAL victims and QUANTITY witnesses were identified . On DATE the ORG committed the applicant for trial in that case .", "On DATE the ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE on the same grounds , in the presence of his lawyer . The applicant appealed , requesting his release on bail . He claimed that his detention was unjustified since he could live with his family . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the extension order . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was present at the hearing .", "On DATE the ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE , the applicant \u2019s defence counsel being present . The court referred to the strength of the evidence in the case file and the fear that the applicant might commit new crimes and obstruct the investigation by influencing the witnesses .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against the above order was dismissed - in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer - by ORG on DATE . The court took into account the fact that the applicant had been detained on remand for a considerable period of time , but noted that this was justified by the complexity and volume of the case ( numerous charges against CARDINAL co - accused and a case file in CARDINAL volumes ) . ORG did not find any indication of procrastination in the proceedings . It noted that the examination of the case had been delayed due to objective circumstances . In particular , several hearings had been adjourned due to the failure of the witnesses or defence lawyers to appear before the court . The co - defendants had requested the adjournment of the trial on several occasions . The court finally observed that the applicant had submitted no serious reason that would prompt it to vary the remand measure .", "On DATE the CARDINAL cases against the applicant were joined , and the prosecution presented a new set of charges . These included creating a criminal organisation , the illegal acquisition of explosives , extortion , the destruction of property in dangerous ways , causing serious bodily harm and the attempted murder of several people . These charges covered CARDINAL episodes which took place at different times .", "On DATE the ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody until DATE on the same grounds as before . ORG also noted the fact of the applicant having denied his guilt amongst the reasons justifying the fear of his absconding , obstructing the investigation and committing fresh crimes . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was present at the hearing .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision , his lawyer being present . While ORG acknowledged that the length of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand had been somewhat prolonged , it considered the length to be justified in view of the complexity of the case , the gravity and number of charges against the applicant , and the strength of the evidence in the case file . ORG noted that the investigation and trial had been adjourned a number of times for the purpose of satisfying various procedural requests of the defendants and their lawyers to investigate or re - evaluate evidence . In addition , witnesses , complainants and the defendants\u2019 lawyers had failed to attend certain court hearings . At the same time , the appellate court eliminated from the reasoning of ORG decision of DATE the reference to the applicant denying his guilt as an element justifying his remand in custody . In this connection the ORG emphasised that taking account of such an element could unlawfully prejudge the assessment by a trial judge of the merits of the charges against the applicant . ORG underlined that the reasons for detention must pertain solely to the need to ensure the attendance of a person at trial , and that remand in custody could not be authorised on the ground of any premature assessment of the evidence against the defendant or his plea in regard to the charges .", "ORG further observed that the applicant had submitted no valid reasons to prompt varying his remand , all his requests for release being motivated exclusively by the alleged lack of evidence , and there being no element in the applicant \u2019s appeals to allay the fear that he might abscond , obstruct the investigation or commit fresh crimes . ORG reiterated in this respect that it was not its function to rule on the merits of the charges against the applicant when deciding the question of his remand . The appellate court concluded that the likelihood of the applicant absconding , obstructing the investigation or committing fresh crimes persisted regardless of the relatively lengthy period of his remand in custody .", "On DATE the ORG extended the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody until DATE , again for fear of his absconding , obstructing the investigation and committing new crimes . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was present at the hearing .", "On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts , including attempted murder , causing grievous bodily harm , involvement in a criminal association , the destruction of property and theft . He was acquitted on CARDINAL other counts . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment , including the time already spent in detention on remand . He was also fined in the amount of LTL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) , and confiscation of his property was ordered . The judgment was CARDINAL pages long , and CARDINAL other persons were convicted with the applicant . The court heard CARDINAL victims and QUANTITY witnesses .", "In response to the applicant \u2019s complaint about the length of the proceedings , the court noted that , while they were somewhat protracted , the essence of the applicant \u2019s right to be tried within a reasonable time was not breached . ORG observed that the length of the proceedings had been largely determined by the conduct of the co - accused and their lawyers . In particular , CARDINAL hearings had to be adjourned due to the failure of defence lawyers ( including the applicant \u2019s representative ) to appear before the court , or their inability to take part in the proceedings due to illness . CARDINAL more hearings had been adjourned because of the GPE illness , the change of lawyers , or the refusal of the defendants to participate in the trial .", "The applicant appealed , complaining that the case against him had been fabricated , that the charges had been imprecise and had been changed a number of times , that he had not been given access to the case file , that his defence rights had been breached , that the trial court had refused to call certain witnesses , that the judges had been biased , and that certain other irregularities had rendered the trial unfair . The applicant also complained about the length of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG amended the judgment , acquitting the applicant on a number of counts , including attempted murder , involvement in a criminal association and theft , on the grounds that the evidence supporting his guilt was contradictory . The prosecution for false reporting of a crime was discontinued as time - barred . The applicant \u2019s conviction for causing grievous bodily harm , extortion and destruction of property was upheld . The sentence was accordingly reduced to DATE imprisonment , including the period that the applicant had already spent in custody ( as of DATE ) . The court also ordered confiscation of the applicant \u2019s property in the amount of LTL CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) .", "While ORG acknowledged that some delays in the proceedings had been imputable to the authorities - namely , the delays which had occurred because of the changes in the composition of the trial court - it considered that the applicant \u2019s right to \u201c trial within a reasonable time \u201d was not breached . Nor did it find any other irregularities which could have rendered the proceedings \u201c unfair \u201d as alleged by the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant was released on licence .", "The applicant \u2019s cassation appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . ORG found no indication of unfairness in the proceedings or a breach of the applicant \u2019s procedural rights .", "On DATE the applicant brought before ORG an action against ORG , claiming pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages for his being infected with Hepatitis C during his stay in the remand prison . On DATE the court disallowed his action for want of jurisdiction . The court observed that the applicant should have brought the claim before ORG , pursuant to the relevant procedural provisions .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE the applicant brought an action before ORG , claiming pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages from ORG in relation to his Hepatitis C infection . On DATE the court disallowed the action by reason of the applicant \u2019s failure to comply with the relevant procedural requirements , namely , to state his factual and legal claims in a clear manner . The court gave the applicant time until DATE to amend the action . On DATE the applicant submitted a fresh action . However , it was disallowed by ORG on DATE on the same grounds . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE .", "The prison doctors confirmed that the applicant was infected with Hepatitis C and prescribed appropriate treatment . The applicant \u2019s condition was further monitored throughout DATE .", "The provisions of LAW ( ORG proceso kodeksas ) , in force until DATE , provided as follows :", "\u201c Detention on remand shall be used only ... in cases where a statutory penalty of DATE imprisonment is envisaged . ...", "The grounds for the detention on remand shall be specified .
