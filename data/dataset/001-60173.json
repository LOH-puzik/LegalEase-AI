The applicant company is the publisher of a newspaper ( GPE ) with its registered office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , as well as on CARDINAL and DATE May and DATE , the applicant company published , in its NORP regional edition ( PERSON ) , articles on the financial situation of a certain Mr PERSON who , at that time , was employed as a teacher and , at the same time , was a member of ORG ( PERSON ) and ORG . The articles commented on these professional tasks and , in harsh terms , alleged that he received CARDINAL salaries unlawfully as , according to NORP law , he was not entitled to a teacher \u2019s salary during his membership of ORG . He was , inter alia , referred to as someone unjustly enriching himself . These articles were accompanied by photographs of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON applied for an injunction under LAW ) to ORG against the applicant company . He requested that the applicant company be ordered to refrain from publishing his picture in connection with statements describing him as somebody who received his salaries unlawfully and who benefited from unlawful privileges . Furthermore , he requested an order for the publication of the judgment in the applicant company \u2019s newspaper , indicating the grant of damages and the injunction ( einstweilige GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed a statement of defence ( Klagebeantwortung ) in which it argued , inter alia , that the publication of the impugned articles had been justified under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted an interim injunction . It found the measure justified because the plaintiff \u2019s interest in prohibiting the publication of his photograph outweighed the applicant company \u2019s interest in the publication of the illustrated articles , in particular as the publication of the pictures per se had no special information value ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the permanent injunction prohibiting the applicant company from publishing the plaintiff \u2019s picture in connection with the above mentioned or similar articles . It dismissed the remainder of the action . The court found that LAW prohibited publishing a person \u2019s picture if the publication violated that person \u2019s legitimate interests . When considering such interests , account had to be taken of whether the person concerned was known to the public , because the publication of the photographs of unknown persons made it possible to identify them later . The court found that PERSON face was not generally known , despite his membership of ORG . Therefore , his legitimate interests had been infringed by creating the possibility of identifying him . The applicant company was of course entitled to report on the plaintiff \u2019s activities and financial situation , but there was no legitimate interest in publishing his picture as it had , per se , no information value . Furthermore , it was irrelevant for this specific question whether the content of the articles was true or false .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed . It argued that the court had erred when it found that the plaintiff \u2019s interests outweighed the applicant company \u2019s interests , as the public in GPE , who had elected PERSON , were interested in his sources of revenue . Therefore the court should have also taken evidence \u2013 as had been offered by the applicant company DATE in order to prove the truth of the articles . Furthermore , the plaintiff was known to the public as he was NORP and had participated in several events during the election campaign there . Thus it was incorrect that Mr PERSON \u2019s face was unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal . It found that the publication of the pictures together with the articles had been unnecessary . In any case , the information value of the pictures could not outweigh Mr PERSON \u2019s interests . It also confirmed the legal opinion of ORG that , for the purposes of Section CARDINAL of LAW , it was irrelevant whether or not the publication contained true information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared inadmissible the applicant company \u2019s extraordinary appeal on points of law ( au\u00dferordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) . It confirmed the findings of ORG , observed that the publication of the plaintiff \u2019s pictures had no additional information value , and therefore concluded that it had been unnecessary . On DATE this decision was served upon counsel for the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly , nor in any way made accessible to the public , where injury would be caused to the legitimate interests of the persons concerned or , in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication , those of a close relative . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
