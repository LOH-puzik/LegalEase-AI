Mr PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) was born in DATE and Mr PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) was born in DATE . They live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , who are brothers , were arrested in GPE by the local police following a request from the GPE authorities . They were suspected of membership of a criminal organisation and of murdering , or attempting to murder , a number of persons in GPE ( see PERSON v. GPE , nos . CARDINAL and DATE , DATE DATE for more details in respect of other persons accused of membership of the same criminal group ) . All CARDINAL of the other persons on trial with the applicants made self - incriminating statements during the pre - trial investigation , and fully accepted their guilt in committing the crimes with which they had been charged . All ( with CARDINAL exception , a former police officer ) retracted these statements at a later stage , claiming that they had been tortured in order to extract those statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were examined by a doctor , who found bruising around their eyes , a bruise on the knee of the first applicant , a reddish area on the chest of the second applicant and marks left by handcuffs on each of the applicants\u2019 wrists . The applicants explained that these injuries had been caused during their arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they were handed over to the NORP police and flown to GPE , where they were detained in the PERSON police inspectorate from TIME According to a document signed by both the NORP and GPE authorities , no complaints or other issues were raised by either the applicants or the GPE authorities .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , they were ill - treated throughout TIME of CARDINAL November CARDINAL and TIME DATE by PERSON V. GPE , the investigator from ORG in ORG responsible for investigating exceptional cases , and by officers PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON from the PERSON police inspectorate . The officers put gas masks on them and suspended them for TIME on a metal bar with their hands tied behind their backs ( a method known as \u201c swallow \u201d ( \u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430 ) , and somewhat similar to \u201c NORP hanging \u201d ) . While in that position , the applicants were hit with rubber sticks on their bodies and the soles of their feet and weights were hung around their necks . From time to time the flow of air through the gas mask was stopped until they fainted .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE an ambulance was called to give emergency medical aid to the first applicant . The doctors found bruises on his face and head , and diagnosed him as suffering from contusion of the soft tissues on his face , head trauma and possible post - traumatic encephalopathy ( a second - degree emergency ) . They also noted that \u201c because he is very dangerous , the police have not authorised [ the applicant \u2019s ] admission to a hospital \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants asked to see a lawyer . On DATE at CARDINAL p.m. the applicants were briefly allowed to meet their lawyers , in the presence of the investigator and police officers , whose presence effectively excluded the possibility of giving proper legal advice . Observing signs of ill - treatment and having spoken to their clients in the presence of the investigator , the lawyers requested a medical examination of their clients .", "CARDINAL . Medical examinations of both applicants were carried out on DATE at their ORG request , in the presence of the investigators . The medical expert found that the first applicant had bruises to his eyes and the head , circular irritations on the wrists and QUANTITY oval bruises on one hand , and injuries to the soles of both feet . In response to a specific question , the expert stated that the injuries had been caused DATE and could have been caused on DATE . After signing and sealing the report , the expert added a note , according to which the first applicant \u2019s injuries were considered \u201c minor body injuries \u201d . In the case of the second applicant , the expert found bruises on the face , chest , ribs , the soles of the feet , circular irritations on the wrists and CARDINAL oval bruises covered with crusts on his hand . The expert also noted that the injuries could have been caused on DATE and were considered to be minor injuries .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , a number of the injuries found by the expert were not mentioned in the medical report drawn up in GPE on DATE , prior to the applicants\u2019 transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL . During their interrogation on DATE both applicants denied involvement in any crime . Although their lawyers obtained permission from PERSON , the deputy Commissioner of the PERSON police inspectorate , to meet their clients as of DATE , the authorisation was not signed until DATE and the authorities refused to allow the applicants to meet their lawyers before that date . Mr PERSON was frequently unavailable , but was allegedly the only person who could authorise a meeting between the lawyers and the applicants . As a result , the lawyers could not meet their clients for DATE to give them proper legal advice ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a court ordered that the applicants be remanded in custody for DATE . During that hearing they both denied having committed any crime . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General rejected the first applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s challenge to the investigator , finding that the latter had given the lawyer proper permission to meet his client and had allowed the medical emergency team to see the accused , and that no translator had been requested or was necessary .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submit that , no longer able to resist ill - treatment , they signed self - incriminating statements on CARDINAL and DATE . Only then were they again allowed to see their lawyers on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the first applicant , during the meeting of DATE , he could not speak privately with his lawyer but was immediately interrogated in his presence and in the presence of both the investigator and an officer of the NORP police inspectorate . The police officer present in the room was not initially mentioned in TIME of the interviews . The Government disputed these circumstances , stating that the confidentiality of the meetings had been observed . TIME of the interview with the first applicant on DATE included a statement by the lawyer , according to which a request to have a private discussion with his lawyer before the interview had been refused and an \u201c operative agent \u201d , who was not an investigator , was present . His presence was , in the lawyer \u2019s view , intended to subject the applicant to psychological pressure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s lawyer complained to ORG , invoking Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , stating that his client was being ill - treated in order to obtain confessions from him , and that the rights of the defence were being seriously violated by the failure to allow him to meet his client . He alleged that investigator ORG had told him that he could meet his client only after the first interview . The lawyer added that during the interview of DATE his client whispered to him and indicated , using signs , that he had been ill - treated again and nodded towards a police officer ( Mr PERSON ) , who was present at the interview . He queried the participation of the police officer in the interrogation process since that was the prerogative of the investigator alone .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyer suggested that the police officer was there in order to ill - treat his client and put psychological pressure on him . After noting the presence of the police officer in TIME of the interview , the investigator wrote a note stating that the officer had been included in the investigating team and thus could question the applicant . The lawyer submits that at the beginning of the investigation he was not given a list of all the persons included in the investigating team , as required by LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The lawyer also alleged that threats were made against him personally ( to the effect that a criminal case would be fabricated against him and that he would be arrested ) following his challenge to the investigator and his comments on the various procedural irregularities . Investigator PERSON and officer PERSON shouted at him and threatened him in the presence of his client . Having seen how they treated his lawyer , the first applicant was even more afraid and asked the lawyer to stop arguing , since he would be ill - treated again as a result .", "CARDINAL . The investigator stated that the first applicant had signed a confession on DATE but refused to show this to his lawyer . His client \u2019s request to speak in private with his lawyer was rejected in an abrupt manner .", "CARDINAL . A similar complaint on behalf of the second applicant was addressed to the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office on DATE . On DATE prosecutor ORG asked the PERSON Police Commissioner to allow the ORG access to the applicants . On DATE he informed CARDINAL of the lawyers that \u201c certain of the complaints \u201d had been found to be partially well - founded and had formed the grounds for making submissions to ORG , ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the investigations department of ORG , Mr \u015e. \u015etogrea , replied to the first applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE , that no violation of procedure had been established and that the first applicant had not personally made any complaints . He did not annex a copy of the decision in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s lawyer complained to the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office , stating that his client had been detained since DATE in police cells in the PERSON police inspectorate , rather than in a remand centre of ORG , as required by LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In further letters of CARDINAL and DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyers requested their clients\u2019 transfer to the remand centre of ORG in PERSON ( also known as \u201c prison no . CARDINAL \u201d ) . They referred to the lack of necessary facilities for meeting their clients in the LOC of the police cells in the PERSON police inspectorate and to the applicants\u2019 medical condition , which could not be treated in their current place of detention . They submitted that , according to the regulations , an individual \u2019s detention in the police cells of the PERSON police inspectorate could not last for DATE . On DATE the lawyers were informed that their clients would shortly be transferred to prison no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE judge PERSON from ORG informed the LAW that during the examination of the first applicant \u2019s appeal against the court decision of DATE to remand him in custody , the court had found that the first applicant \u2019s right to meet with his lawyer had been violated by officers of the PERSON police commissariat . He asked the Commissioner to take measures to prevent similar conduct in the future .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant asked ORG to have his arm examined by a doctor since , he alleged , he had lost all movement in it as a result of ill - treatment by the police on DATE . He never received a reply . On DATE his lawyer asked ORG to reply to his client \u2019s request of DATE . He was informed , by a letter of DATE , that his client had been sent a reply on DATE in which it was explained that any complaints were to be addressed directly to the trial court following the submission of the case to that court . In addition , a medical examination of the second applicant had been carried out . In reply , the lawyer requested confirmation from the court to which his client \u2019s complaint had been forwarded , as well as the outgoing number of the letter addressed to him , since he had not received any letter dated DATE . In addition , no medical examination of his client had been carried out following his complaint of DATE . The lawyer considered inadequate a further reply from the Prosecutor General dated CARDINAL DATE and he requested detailed answers to his questions . It is not clear whether he received an answer .", "CARDINAL . During the examination of the case by ORG in DATE the applicants also complained about their ill - treatment . The court forwarded their complaint to ORG . No action appears to have been taken on the basis of that complaint .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants informed the administration of prison no . CARDINAL in GPE about their fear of reprisals by a group of detainees in that prison . The applicants asked to be transferred to prison CARDINAL . They were transferred to that prison on DATE , and did not inform the administration of any threat received or otherwise alert the authorities to any danger to their lives or health in that prison . On DATE the applicants were severely beaten by other detainees from their own brigade . They claim that for dubious reasons the security personnel were absent from their posts and thus did not intervene , and that the metal gates separating their block from other blocks were left unlocked , in violation of the rules . According to several reports submitted by the Government , during their free time detainees could either remain in their cells or visit common areas within their brigade \u2019s premises . There were therefore no metal gates or other barriers between inmates from the same group of cells and there could not be \u201c forced entry \u201d into the applicants\u2019 cell . The applicants had declared that the injuries had been self - inflicted while practising martial arts , and had refused to make any written statement .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants were taken to a hospital and were then transferred to prison no . CARDINAL . According to the Government , the prison administration gave the applicants the option of requesting detention in separate LOC from the other detainees , in order to protect them from a possible future attack , but they refused . They were placed in an increased security cell , but were free to visit common areas . On DATE they allegedly went to a meeting in a common area organised by another detainee . The meeting ended with a fight , as a result of which the applicants were again severely beaten by other detainees . The applicants claim that the security personnel disappeared for TIME during the event . They were again taken to hospital with serious injuries , and later transferred to another prison . According to the applicants , no serious investigation into these CARDINAL assaults has taken place and none of the attackers has been identified and punished . According to the Government , CARDINAL organisers of the meeting were identified and a criminal investigation was opened into the event . The applicants never complained about either of the attacks and refused to make statements to the administration against the detainees who had attacked them . The various investigations opened into the events of DATE ended on CARDINAL May , DATE and DATE respectively , finding that the applicants had refused to avail themselves of additional measures of protection offered to them by the prison administration , fearing that such measures would diminish their reputation in the criminal world . The administration of the CARDINAL prisons in which the attacks had taken place took measures to reinforce security , in order to minimise the risk of similar acts in the future .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to ORG DATE the first applicant complained that he had not received the specialised medical treatment which he required , on account of the absence of the necessary medical equipment . He also claimed that his transfer to prison no . CARDINAL in GPE on DATE had been premature , in that he had not yet recovered from the last assault on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as a first - instance court , found all CARDINAL suspects guilty . Each applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The court found that each applicant had been involved in CARDINAL different criminal acts ( murder and attempted murder ) , typically assisting others to commit the crimes ( driving getaway cars , supplying weapons and uniforms , etc . ) . Each applicant was a member of the criminal organisation and was guilty of illegal possession of weapons .", "CARDINAL . The evidence on which the court based its judgment was , in each case , the declarations of the CARDINAL co - accused , declarations by surviving victims or their relatives , statements of witnesses and expert reports .", "CARDINAL . In the court \u2019s opinion , the declarations of the co - accused were consistent and the fact that they had all subsequently withdrawn their statements , alleging that they had been obtained by ill - treatment , was merely an attempt to avoid responsibility . The court emphasised the dates on which each of the accused had made confessions in the presence of their lawyers ; some of these confessions had been recorded on film . This excluded any possibility that the statements had been made as a result of ill - treatment , given also that no evidence of ill - treatment had been adduced . The court referred to a medical report of DATE ( before the ORG arrest and apparently drawn up in respect of some of the other accused ) in which no signs of ill - treatment had been found .", "CARDINAL . The surviving victims and their relatives , as well as witnesses , testified as to the manner in which the crimes had been committed , or described having sold cars to \u201c unknown persons \u201d or having seen such unknown persons carry out the crimes . None of them declared that they had seen any of the co - accused at the scene of the crimes .", "CARDINAL . The expert reports determined the manner in which the crimes had been committed and the types of weapons used .", "CARDINAL . In the attempted murder of Mr PERSON and others a weapon was used which was subsequently found during a search conducted on DATE in an apartment rented by the second applicant . Further weapons were found in that apartment , including automatic rifle ammunition which was identical to some of the cartridges found at the scene of the murder of PERSON ORG and Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In addition , a mobile telephone operator submitted a list of all incoming and outgoing calls made from a telephone belonging to the first applicant ( which , the trial court stated without any further detail , had also been used by the second applicant ) . During the preparation of the murder of PERSON on DATE , this telephone had been frequently used to contact several of the co - accused .", "CARDINAL . Two witnesses confirmed that unknown persons had come to them DATE and had purchased CARDINAL sets of dark uniforms . These were later used during the murder of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal in cassation against the judgment of ORG , the applicants submitted the following .", "CARDINAL . GPE , CARDINAL of the alleged masterminds of most of the crimes attributed to the criminal organisation of which the applicants were allegedly members , declared in court that he had committed some of the crimes he was charged with , but that the applicants had not participated in any of them . He claimed that he had been forced to make declarations against the applicants as a result of ill - treatment . According to the applicants , even the declarations made by ORG during the investigation were contradictory , since he had claimed to have seen one of the applicants in CARDINAL different places at the same time . In his statement , another co - accused ( S. ) declared that he was not sure whether he had seen the second applicant in the getaway car and then replied to the lawyer \u2019s direct question that he had not seen him at the crime scene . However , the trial court had merely stated that PERSON confirmed the second applicant \u2019s participation in the crime .", "CARDINAL . Despite the court \u2019s statement that there was no evidence of ill - treatment , substantial evidence confirming ill - treatment had been submitted to the court in the form of medical reports and complaints .", "CARDINAL . The court had paid no attention to the complaints regarding the violation of the rights of the defence , notably the lack of access to their lawyers during the period when they had been ill - treated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor had declared that all charges against the applicants were withdrawn due to a lack of evidence of their guilt . However , on DATE he radically changed his position and requested the court to find them guilty , although no new evidence had been added to the file . This contradictory behaviour confirmed , in the applicants\u2019 view , that the prosecution itself was not convinced of their involvement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor had requested and obtained the suspension of the trial and the re - opening of the investigation , having shown the judge a letter from ORG . None of the co - accused or their lawyers was shown the contents of that letter , despite their requests to that effect .", "CARDINAL . During the hearings in court , CARDINAL of the co - accused declared that the applicants had nothing to do with the crimes and that they had made their statements as a result of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . In their address to ORG the applicants added that neither of them had been informed of his right not to make statements incriminating the other , since the law entitled them not to testify against close relatives .", "DATE . During the reconstruction of events officers had committed serious violations of procedure , as was clear from the video recording of the event : they had asked leading questions and even given their own answers to them , and had then shown the accused where to go , where to stop , etc . The second applicant was not involved in any reconstruction of events .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the charges against the applicants ( conspiracy to commit murder and murder of PERSON ) were not brought against them until DATE , during the court hearing , and those charges had been based only on statements made by CARDINAL of the co - accused on DATE . However , the author of those statements declared that he had refused to cooperate in the conspiracy and that he was unaware of any tangible actions or plan by the applicants to commit the murder .", "CARDINAL . In addition , although the prosecution claimed that the second applicant rented the apartment from ORG after seeing her advertisement in newspaper ORG , no such advertisement had appeared in that newspaper and ORG stated in court that she had not placed such an advertisement . She declared that she knew the second applicant and allowed him to use her apartment in DATE . In DATE she agreed with the second applicant to give the keys of the apartment to O. Thereafter the applicants left for GPE . During the investigation she had to make false statements under pressure from the investigators . The applicant argued that he could not be held responsible for what happened in the apartment after he transmitted the key and left for GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had made CARDINAL self - incriminating statements , CARDINAL of which were dated DATE . The CARDINAL others had not been dated , nor properly registered as evidence , yet they formed part of the evidence on which the court had based its judgment .", "CARDINAL . The video recording of the reconstruction of events with one of the co - accused ( PERSON ) clearly showed one of the police officers wearing sunglasses which later appeared on PERSON In court PERSON declared that he had been ill - treated in the police car in order to testify as instructed . He was then told what to say and how to proceed and was made to wear the sunglasses in order to disguise signs of ill - treatment . He testified in court that he had not known the applicants and that the police and investigators had shown him their pictures .", "CARDINAL . In restating the various violations of their rights and their illtreatment , the applicants invoked the LAW and the LAW . They stated that all their complaints had been examined superficially and that all the evidence against them had been obtained through violent and unlawful means .", "CARDINAL . ORG reviewed the findings of ORG and found that that court had adopted a lawful judgment . In particular , it found that the lower court had not based its judgment only on the statements by the co - accused , but also on other evidence , although the confessions were the basis for the applicants\u2019 convictions .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court cited the relevant parts of the declarations made by the co - accused , including the applicants , and emphasised that in each case the statements were made in the presence of lawyers and were often recorded on film , which depicted no signs of ill - treatment or undue influence . The court noted that the first applicant had made statements at the interview of DATE and that the second applicant made statements at the interviews of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court also found that \u201c [ ORG is not true that the statements were made under the influence of unlawful methods by the police . During the hearing the court has verified these arguments and they have not been confirmed \u201d .", "ORG dismissed the ORG appeal in cassation .", "CARDINAL .
