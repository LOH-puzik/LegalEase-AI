FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Mikko Puumalainen;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney;Yonko Grozev", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The applicant company has its seat in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is a journalist for a DATE magazine , ORG , which is published by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively the NORP national public service broadcasting company broadcast CARDINAL TV documentaries in its ORG series which concerned mould - infested houses and the protection of forests . They were made by several reporters , including PERSON who was the complainant at the origin of criminal proceedings that were subsequently brought against the first applicant ( \u201c the complainant \u201d ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE the first applicant criticised on CARDINAL separate internet discussion sites , namely on the \u201c LOC site maintained by ORG ( ORG liitto , Gr\u00f6na f\u00f6rbundet ) and the \u201c Journalism \u201d site maintained by ORG , the manner in which these CARDINAL documentaries had been made . He wrote , inter alia , that :", "\u201c [ The complainant ] is a fanatic warrior of the faith for whom facts are just in the way . He has indisputably been caught at cold , intentional lying . \u201d", "\u201c [ The complainant ] in fact claimed that the house was healthy but that CARDINAL cheating company doing mould inspections had managed to find some insignificant mould spots because of which a completely unnecessary court case was initiated . ... Contrary to [ the complainant \u2019s ] assurances , ORG \u2019s former house was rotten . ... [ The complainant ] must have known that . He is thus lying cold - bloodedly and intentionally . ... He thus knew that [ the expert ] lied but he let it happen . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant published a CARDINAL - page article in ORG magazine , which is CARDINAL of the biggest nationwide family magazines in GPE , on similar lines . The article had been approved by a lawyer before publication . The article included passages such as :", "\u201c [ The complainant ] claimed that PERCENT of the NORP forest area was already protected and that conservationists demanded that CARDINAL of the forest area in LOC should be preserved . These figures are fabricated ....", "ORG thus said in [ the documentary ] the complete opposite of what her research showed and what was stated in her grant application . When I interviewed [ the complainant ] , he admitted that he had known about the grant and the DATE research . Still he accepted ORG clearly groundless testimony in the documentary . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG magazine published a CARDINAL - page reply in which the reporters who had made the documentaries in question replied to the first applicant \u2019s criticism . In response to this reply , the magazine published a page - long counter - reply by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the complainant reported the matter to the police , asking them to investigate whether the first applicant was guilty of defamation when he called him a liar in his writings . By letter dated DATE the complainant presented his claim for damages against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant company and the first applicant submitted their replies to the police . On DATE the first applicant was questioned by the police for the first time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor pressed charges in ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) against the first applicant for defamation . The complainant concurred with the charges brought by the public prosecutor . The compensation claim presented by him previously on DATE was joined to the criminal charges . The applicants claimed that ORG was not the appropriate court because the forum norms had changed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found in an interlocutory decision that it was a competent court to decide the case . Even though the article in question had been written and the decision on its publication had been taken in GPE , the magazine had been printed and the consequences of the article had arisen in GPE . As the internet articles concerned the same matter , the court was competent to examine them too .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed all charges against the first applicant and the compensation claim directed against the applicants . It found first of all that all the articles should be considered as CARDINAL matter because they concerned the same topic , irrespective of whether they had been published on internet or in the magazine . Both the first applicant and the complainant had had grounds for their views and they had not said anything that was clearly untrue . The documentaries made by the complainant had provoked public discussion , but they had also provoked harsh criticism on account of the manner in which they were presented . Therefore the threshold for acceptable criticism of the complainant and of his documentaries was higher than usual . As there had been insinuations in the documentaries that some of the expert opinions had been false , the first applicant was allowed to use similar wording vis - \u00e0 - vis the complainant .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the complainant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) . ORG held oral hearings on CARDINAL and DATE and on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the first applicant of defamation and sentenced him to DATE - fines , totalling CARDINAL ( ORG ) . He was ordered to pay LAW interest in damages to the complainant . The applicant company was ordered , together with the first applicant , to pay ORG CARDINAL plus interest in damages to the complainant as well as his costs and expenses of ORG CARDINAL , plus interest , in total . The court found first of all that ORG had been the competent court in the matter . As to the merits , ORG mentioned LAW and the principles expressed therein as well as adverting to the ORG \u2019s case - law and legal literature on LAW . With reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law , it recalled that even if everyone was guaranteed freedom of expression , it was not permitted to defame others or to disseminate false information on anybody . In this respect a journalist had the same responsibility as others . ORG then found that it had not been proved that the complainant had disseminated wrong information in the documentaries in the manner recounted by the first applicant , except for the misleading information given in the context of the reportage on mould - infested houses which the complainant had failed to rectify . It appeared also from the witness statements that different statistical information existed as far as the conserved forest area in GPE was concerned , such that it could not be said that the figures given by the complainant had been fabricated . The first applicant had thus imparted false information on the complainant and these accusations had been serious . The first applicant had not therefore had strong reasons or probable cause to hold his own accusations to be true . The fact that freedom of expression was guaranteed under LAW as well as under LAW together with the fact that the complainant was also a journalist and that the first applicant had been able to give grounds for his own opinion in the media , did not entitle the first applicant to impart the above - mentioned false information . Nor did the first applicant have the right to call the complainant a liar . On these grounds the first applicant was found guilty of defamation .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , claiming that all facts had been correct in the article published in ORG magazine . Moreover , during the oral hearing in ORG , the applicants had not been allowed to put questions to the opposing party \u2019s witnesses , whereas the opposing party had been able to question their witnesses . Also the evidence provided by the applicants had not been adequately taken into account by ORG and the proceedings had taken place in the wrong forum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
