The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the city of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hereinafter ORG ) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for abuse of power and forgery of official documents . The prosecution \u2019s case was that the applicant , while acting in his capacity as a private notary , had fraudulently certified a title and real - estate transactions using invalid registration forms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a search warrant in respect of the applicant \u2019s office . The search was carried out DATE . According to the record drawn up on this occasion , the authorities seized at the office notary stamps and documents , a number of accounting records and a metal strong - box . The latter was opened on DATE at the LOC of ORG . The relevant record stated that there had been found , inter alia , personal items belonging to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator from ORG closed the applicant \u2019s case given the lack of any corpus delicti .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the acting ORG overruled the investigator \u2019s decision , as it had been proved that the applicant had committed the imputed offence , but ordered the discontinuation of proceedings due to the insignificance of the offence . The applicant challenged this finding , claiming that he had not committed any offence . On DATE the Desniansky ORG of Chernigiv ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG , in the course of supervisory proceedings , quashed the decision of ORG and remitted the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG ruling of DATE and ordered a further pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator terminated the criminal proceedings on substantially the same grounds as in the DATE ruling . On DATE ORG quashed this decision and ordered further inquiries in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal case was closed due to the insignificance of the offence which had been committed . The applicant \u2019s complaint against this ruling was rejected on DATE by ORG as being unsubstantiated . In particular , the court indicated that the applicant \u2019s guilt had been proved by the evidence collected in the course of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of Appeal ( hereafter \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) quashed the decision of DATE as the local court had failed to specify the evidence in support of its opinion as to the applicant \u2019s guilt . The case was remitted for a fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint against the ruling of DATE . The court indicated that the investigation case file contained sufficient evidence to establish that the applicant had forged a certain notary document and wittingly carried out an invalid notarial action . However , having regard to the insignificance of the offence , further criminal prosecution was impractical . As regards the applicant \u2019s submissions concerning the inadmissibility of the evidence obtained by the search of his office , the court found that such complaints could be raised during the trial on the merits and considered itself incompetent to examine them in the course of the proceedings before it .", "On DATE ORG upheld this decision . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal under the cassation procedure .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG ( hereafter \u201c the Novozavodsky Court \u201d ) granted this claim .

In particular , it established that in breach of LAW ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) the investigator , being well aware of the applicant \u2019s whereabouts ( at that time he was undergoing hospital treatment ) , had failed to serve the search warrant on him . Moreover , contrary to LAW ORG , the authorities , instead of collecting the evidence relating to the criminal case , had seized all the official documents and certain personal items in the applicant \u2019s office . This had effectively denied the applicant the possibility of performing his professional duties until DATE , when the relevant documents and items were returned to him . The court awarded the applicant ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in material and UAH CARDINAL,CARDINAL in moral damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on an appeal by ORG , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case for fresh consideration because the legal basis for the decision ( namely the termination of the criminal proceedings on \u201c exonerative \u201d grounds ) had ceased to exist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s claim and rejected it as being unsubstantiated .

On DATE ORG stayed the appeal proceedings until the determination of the applicant \u2019s complaint against the ruling of ORG of DATE ( i.e. the grounds for the termination of his criminal case ) . On DATE the appeal proceedings were renewed and the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE was rejected .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant instituted proceedings in ORG against ORG and its GPE for defamation . The applicant alleged that , during ORG hearing on DATE , the Principal had made CARDINAL statements about him which were libellous and abusive , including CARDINAL rudely questioning his mental health . The applicant demanded apologies and compensation for moral damage .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s main arguments was that he had never suffered any mental health problems . He adduced to this effect a certificate supposedly issued by a psychiatric hospital , attesting that the applicant had never been treated there .", "CARDINAL . The case of the defence was that the Principal had never uttered the obscenities attributed to him by the applicant . However , they challenged the authenticity of the above certificate and asked the court to verify the applicant \u2019s assertions . On DATE this application was granted and the Chernigiv Regional Psycho - Neurological Hospital was requested to provide information as to whether the applicant had undergone any psychiatric treatment . On DATE the hospital submitted to the court a certificate to the effect that for DATE the applicant had been registered as suffering from a certain mental illness and underwent in - patient treatment in different psychiatric establishments .

This information was read out by a judge at CARDINAL of the subsequent hearings ; however , no reference to this evidence was made in the final judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim as unsubstantiated . The court found , inter alia , that the applicant had failed to prove that the defendant had made any remarks about his sanity .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , challenging , inter alia , the lawfulness of the court \u2019s request for information about his mental state .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment in substance . On DATE the court issued a separate ruling to the effect that the first instance court \u2019s request for information concerning the applicant \u2019s mental health from the public hospital was contrary to Article CARDINAL of the LAW , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE and LAW . In particular , it was indicated that information about a person \u2019s mental health was confidential , and its collection , retention , use and dissemination fell under a special regime . Moreover , the court held that the requested evidence had no relevance to the case .", "Summing up the above considerations , ORG found that the judges of the lower courts lacked training in the field of confidential data protection and notified LOC for Judicial Studies about the need to remedy this lacuna in their training programme .", "CARDINAL .
