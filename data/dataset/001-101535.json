They are the members of CARDINAL family .", "The applicants were represented by Mr PERSON and Ms GPE GPE , lawyers practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE Mr H.Ts . bought a car in GPE on behalf of ORG , who financed the purchase . After obtaining NORP export license plates for the vehicle and an export transportation permit on DATE Mr H.Ts . drove the car to GPE . Both of the aforesaid documents indicated ORG as the owner of the vehicle .", "It is unclear when PERSON . and the car entered GPE .", "On DATE the car was stolen from a parking lot in GPE .", "On DATE Mr H.Ts . reported the car as stolen and a preliminary investigation was opened on DATE against an unknown perpetrator . It was suspended on DATE as the identity of the perpetrator could not be established .", "In the meantime , on DATE the police in the town of GPE found the car abandoned in a local parking lot . It had NORP license plates which were found to have been stolen from another vehicle . The authorities did not check the car 's engine and chassis numbers in the database of stolen vehicles and thus did not make the connection that it was the same car that had been stolen in GPE on DATE .", "The vehicle remained with the LOC police for over a year . On DATE the LOC police asked ORG what to do with it . As a result , the car was delivered to ORG on DATE in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "On an unspecified date ORG declared the vehicle ORG property as a result of it having been abandoned . Also on an unspecified date it entered the vehicle in a public auction run by ORG .", "PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) participated in the public auction of DATE and purchased the car . On DATE he entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the vehicle with ORG . He paid CARDINAL old NORP levs ( MONEY ) to ORG on DATE and obtained the car registration documents from the PERSON district public prosecutor 's office on DATE .", "On an unspecified date Mr LOC . informed the public prosecutor 's office that the first applicant was driving his car and sought its assistance to retrieve it . As proof of ownership he presented the authorities with the transportation permit and the NORP car purchase agreement .", "In response , on DATE the GPE district public prosecutor 's office reopened the preliminary investigation into the theft of the car , ordered that it be seized from its current registered owner , the first applicant , and be held as material evidence at the police station .", "On DATE the PERSON traffic police seized the car from the first applicant , who filed a complaint on DATE with the GPE district public prosecutor 's office .", "In spite of the aforesaid complaint of the first applicant , on DATE the GPE district public prosecutor 's office concluded that there was no dispute in respect of the ownership of the vehicle and ordered that it be returned to Mr H.Ts , whom it considered to be the owner of the vehicle on the basis of the NORP car purchase agreement and the transportation permit . On an unspecified date the first applicant appealed against this decision to the higher standing public prosecutor 's office .", "The car was handed over to Mr LOC . on an unspecified date .", "In a decision of DATE the GPE regional public prosecutor 's office quashed as unlawful the decision of DATE of the GPE district public prosecutor 's office . It found that in view of the first applicant 's complaint of DATE a dispute in respect of the ownership of the vehicle had clearly arisen which precluded the possibility to hand over the vehicle to Mr GPE . The GPE regional public prosecutor 's office therefore ordered that the car be seized from Mr PERSON . and that it be held for safekeeping by the police . It also invited the first applicant to initiate civil proceedings in respect of his ownership claim to the vehicle . Both the first applicant and Mr LOC . appealed against this decision .", "Separately , the first applicant complained on DATE to ORG about the seizure of the car and the actions of the public prosecutor 's office . In its reply of DATE ORG informed the first applicant that they could not act on his complaint and stated that it considered the actions of ORG to have been lawful .", "In a decision of DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE of the GPE regional public prosecutor 's office . It considered that Mr PERSON . was the \u201c unquestionable initial owner \u201d of the vehicle and that the police had erroneously handed the car over to the customs authorities . Thus , it found that the \u201c owner of the car \u201d , Mr LOC . , had been wrongly denied possession of it and that it should be returned to him while the other claimant \u2013 the first applicant DATE should prove his ownership rights in court . Accordingly , ORG ordered that the car be handed over , once again , to Mr LOC . , who was to undertake not to sell it until the preliminary investigation had been concluded .", "On an unspecified date the car was entrusted to Mr LOC . for safekeeping .", "In response to a separate request from the first applicant that the evidence in the preliminary investigation \u2013 the vehicle DATE be handed over to him , on DATE ORG ruled a second time on the decision of the GPE regional public prosecutor 's office of DATE . It dismissed the first applicant 's request , but found that there was a clear dispute over the ownership of the vehicle and ordered that in accordance with LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) the car remain with the authorities until the property dispute had been resolved in the civil courts , where the CARDINAL parties needed to make their respective claims . ORG also criticized the actions of the LOC police and the customs office for having sold the vehicle to the first applicant instead of promptly returning it to its \u201c owner \u201d \u2013 Mr H.Ts .", "In a further decision of DATE ORG ruled on an appeal filed by the first applicant in the context of the preliminary investigation into the theft of the car . It dismissed it and upheld the decision to hand over the vehicle to Mr LOC . as it considered him to be the \u201c initial owner \u201d of the vehicle because he had purchased and imported it from GPE . It further noted that as the first applicant also laid claim to the car , he should prove his case in court , which was the only competent body that could adjudicate on the matter .", "On an unspecified date the first applicant complained to ORG about the contradictory decisions of his ORG and DATE .", "In a decision of DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE and quashed the CARDINAL from DATE because the latter had been issued in response to an appeal on which ORG had already ruled . Nevertheless , he also reasoned that Mr H.Ts . had been the right person to return the car to as it had been stolen from him . ORG further noted that the first applicant should initiate proceedings in the civil courts in respect of the ownership of the car .", "On an unspecified date the first applicant complained once again to ORG about the seizure of the car . In its reply dated DATE ORG informed him that it could not act on his complaint because the customs authorities had acted within their competences by taking charge of the vehicle under section CARDINAL of LAW and then selling it at a public auction to him .", "In response to a further appeal by the first applicant in the context of the preliminary investigation into the theft of the car , on CARDINAL DATE the supreme cassation public prosecutor 's office instructed the GPE city public prosecutor 's office to take immediate action to continue the investigation , which had stalled in DATE . It also ordered the latter to investigate the first applicant 's allegations that Mr LOC . had presented forged ownership documents in respect of the vehicle .", "In a decision of DATE the supreme cassation public prosecutor 's office ruled on a further appeal by the first applicant . This time it found in his favour and revoked the decision of ORG of DATE , which had found the seizure of the car and its handing over to Mr H.Ts to have been lawful . The supreme cassation public prosecutor 's office also found that it had been unlawful to hand over the vehicle to the latter because he was clearly not , and never had been , the owner , because both the NORP car purchase agreement and the transportation permit identified him as being only the transporter , while PERSON was indicated as being the vehicle 's owner in both of those documents . However , as ORG had never filed a complaint that her car had been stolen it was considered necessary that she be questioned . Therefore , the supreme cassation public prosecutor 's office ordered that the car be seized and noted that when a dispute of ownership arises the individuals involved should refer the matter for resolution by the civil courts .", "A police order was issued on DATE to seize the car but the police were unable to find Mr LOC . or the vehicle . Therefore , on DATE the car was declared stolen .", "On DATE ORG informed the GPE public prosecutor 's office that it had been unable to find the car or PERSON LOC .", "The first applicant continued petitioning the authorities to find the car .", "In letters of DATE and DATE the supreme cassation public prosecutor 's office informed him that the authorities were continuing their search for the car .", "On DATE the Chief of ORG in GPE informed the first applicant that they were continuing their search .", "On DATE the first applicant filed a further petition with the supreme cassation public prosecutor 's office . In a reply dated DATE the latter informed him that it had been unlawful to hand over the car to Mr H.Ts . as he was not its owner . However , it considered that the owner was PERSON It also considered that the public prosecutor 's office carried no liability for the failure of the LOC police to check the vehicle 's chassis and engine numbers and noted that it \u201c had not sold [ the first applicant ] anything \u201d and had not received any of the money he had paid for the vehicle . The supreme cassation public prosecutor 's office also noted that it was not the body which could rule on who held title to the car and expressed reservations in respect of a possible property dispute with ORG", "Thereafter , the authorities continued looking for the car and Mr H.Ts . , but without any apparent success .", "LAW of DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) required all persons to immediately inform the customs authorities if they found a vehicle belonging to a foreign national who had left the country . If the vehicle was not claimed within DATE it was considered abandoned and became ORG property ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Abandoned vehicles held by the customs authorities were to be sold within DATE of becoming ORG property ( section CARDINAL of the Regulation for Implementing LAW ) .", "LAW was replaced in DATE by a new act of the same name .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW , as in force at the relevant time , provided that a buyer who acted in good faith in purchasing movable property against consideration from a non - owner obtained clear title to the said property . However , the former owner of stolen or lost movable property had the right to claim it from a buyer acting in good faith within DATE of the date of the theft or loss . This possibility did not exist if the buyer had purchased the property from a ORG or municipal enterprise .", "The relevant provisions of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the Code \u201d ) have been summarised in the case of GPE and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "The relevant provisions of the ORG and ORG of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and LAW , as well as the pertinent practice of the domestic courts during the relevant period have been summarised in the case of ORG ( cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "As part of their submissions , the applicants presented copies of the judgments in a case brought by an individual under LAW ORG which was appealed all the way to ORG ( \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043d\u0430 ORG \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 NORP \u0433. , GPE \u0433.\u043e. ) . In that case the public prosecutor 's office had seized a car purchased by the claimant from a third party as it had previously been stolen from another individual . In reaching their decisions the domestic courts noted the restrictive interpretation of the ORG in respect of the liability of the ORG under LAW . As the case related to decisions and actions of the investigation and prosecution authorities , it thus fell to be examined only under the said section , which , however , did not provide for liability in such instances . Therefore , the domestic courts rejected the action , but in doing so they also noted that the claimant had failed to appeal against the decisions of the investigation and prosecution authorities and had not initiated a property dispute ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
