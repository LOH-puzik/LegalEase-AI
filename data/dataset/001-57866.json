Mr PERSON , a NORP national , lives at PERSON , near GPE , and practises as a lawyer ( abogado ) in GPE .", "CARDINAL . After setting up his practice in DATE , he regularly placed notices advertising it in the \" miscellaneous advertisements \" pages of several GPE newspapers and the ORG ( \" ORG \" ) . He also wrote to various companies offering his services .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( ORG del Col.legi d\u2019Advocats ) brought disciplinary proceedings against him CARDINAL times on this account , and in DATE and DATE these led to the imposition of penalties , namely CARDINAL reprimands and CARDINAL warnings . The applicant lodged internal appeals against these penalties but did not apply to the competent courts .", "CARDINAL . From DATE notices giving details of the applicant \u2019s legal practice were published in the newsletter of the PERSON and ORG . They took up CARDINAL of a page and gave the applicant \u2019s name , with the title \" lawyer \" ( letrado ) , and his office address and telephone number .", "CARDINAL . ORG brought further disciplinary proceedings against Mr PERSON on this account . On DATE he again received a written warning for disregarding the ban on professional advertising ( LAW no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , laying down the Statute of the Bar - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an internal appeal by the applicant , ORG ( ORG general de la ORG ) upheld the penalty imposed . Referring to LAW as amplified in the relevant rules of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE below ) , it held that , given their nature , the notices in question went beyond the defined limits . It also pointed out that the applicant had recently incurred other disciplinary penalties for the same reason , and these had to be taken into consideration when ruling on the appeal .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON then applied to ORG . He argued in particular that the purpose of his notice was to inform the public and that the warning infringed LAW , which guaranteed the right to freedom of expression . He also alleged that the principle that only a statute could define offences and lay down penalties had been contravened because the provisions which prohibited advertising by members of the Bar and attached disciplinary penalties were regulatory in nature .", "The court dismissed his application on CARDINAL DATE , holding that the notice in question was a vehicle for advertising and not simply an announcement of information . It appeared beside similar announcements by a driving school and an old people \u2019s home and went beyond the limits laid down in the Bar \u2019s rules , which allowed notices only to announce the setting up of a practice or a change of address ; this was not the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by Mr PERSON and at the same time refused to refer the case to ORG on grounds of unconstitutionality .", "It rejected the ground of appeal based on disregard of the principle that only a statute could define offences and lay down penalties . It did so by reference to the case - law of ORG , according to which LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) makes it permissible for statute law to provide that the rules governing professional associations and the practice of the professions may be laid down by means of regulations . It held that LAW did not protect advertising as a fundamental right , because advertising was not a matter of expressing thoughts , ideas or opinions but of announcing the existence of a profit - making business activity .", "Moreover , the ban on professional advertising by members of the Bar had legitimate aims , namely to uphold free competition and to protect clients\u2019 interests . In such a case the right in question could be subject to restrictions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then lodged an appeal ( recurso de amparo ) with ORG . He again maintained that it was contrary to the principle of statutory definition of offences and prescription of penalties enshrined in the LAW to lay down administrative penalties by means of a decree , and that since the notice set out genuine information , i.e. his name , address and telephone number , the penalty imposed contravened LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible .", "It held that the penalty complained of did not infringe the fundamental right to communicate genuine information . The aim of the advertising was connected with the \" carrying on of a commercial , industrial , craft or professional activity \" ; it consisted in \" directly or indirectly promoting the conclusion of contracts relating to movable or immovable property , services , rights or obligations \" , whereas the purpose of the fundamental right defined in LAW para . CARDINAL ( d ) was to enable citizens to \" form their beliefs by weighing different or even diametrically opposed opinions and thus taking part in the discussion of public affairs \" . The ban on advertising professional services did not infringe the fundamental right in question .", "CARDINAL . LAW guarantees the right to freedom of expression :", "\" CARDINAL .
