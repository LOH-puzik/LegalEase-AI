The applicant , who is a NORP national of NORP origin , was born in DATE and lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant moved to GPE in CARDINAL . He was in employment for DATE and consequently was affiliated to the general social security scheme . The relevant law governing it did not exclude the participation of foreign nationals in the general social security scheme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his wife , who is a NORP national , jointly bought a farm . They took possession of it on DATE . At about that time the applicant terminated his employment and decided to make his living from the farm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the GPE branch of ORG ( PERSON ) to admit him to the farmers ' social security scheme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE his request was refused on the ground that he was not a NORP national , a condition stipulated in ORG of DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ; ustawa o ubezpieczeniu spo\u0142ecznym rolnik\u00f3w ) . As a result , the applicant did not have social security cover in the event of sickness , occupational injury and invalidity . In addition , he could not pay contributions towards his old - age pension .", "CARDINAL . In a decision given on DATE , the applicant 's wife was admitted to the farmers ' scheme .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision given in his case . He submitted that as a self - employed farmer he was exposed to the risk of work - related accidents . Furthermore , he argued that since he had acquired the farm he had terminated his previous employment and that the farm was intended to provide for his livelihood . The applicant also submitted that when previously employed he had been covered by the general social security scheme despite his foreign nationality . As a result of the refusal , he could not pay his social security contributions , so the relevant time would not be taken into account when calculating his future retirement pension .", "CARDINAL . He also submitted that he had been informed about an obligation to join the scheme by way of a clause in the notarial deed whereby he had acquired the farm . In addition , the applicant stated that he had been living in GPE for DATE and that he had had a permanent residence permit for DATE . He also referred to his NORP origin and his willingness to pay the relevant contributions to the scheme .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal , finding that the applicant could not be admitted to the farmers ' social security scheme as he did not have NORP nationality . On the other hand , it observed that in the event of a serious occupational injury the applicant could be granted a CARDINAL - off compensation payment as provided in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW . As regards access to health services , ORG noted that the applicant , as a foreign national permanently residing in GPE , would be provided with such access by a law which was to come into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment . He submitted that the refusal to admit him to the social security scheme for farmers on the basis of his nationality was discriminatory . He alleged a breach of the principle of equality , relying on the LAW and LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It found that the applicant could not base his claim for admission to the farmers ' social security scheme on the LAW as the latter provided in LAW for statutory limitations on the rights of aliens . Similarly , ORG held that the DATE bilateral treaty concluded between GPE and GPE in matters of social security was applicable exclusively to employees . The applicant 's claim based on the ORG was also dismissed . ORG noted that LAW ORG included a provision on the right of everyone to social security . However , it held that the provisions of the LAW were not self - executing and left GPE a margin of discretion as to the manner of their implementation in domestic law .", "CARDINAL .

Additionally , it observed that LAW provided that the right to social security was guaranteed only to NORP nationals .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested the President of ORG to admit him to the farmers ' scheme as an exception to the existing rules .

That rule was applicable to farmers , their spouses and members of their household .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant petitioned the ORG . On DATE the ORG wrote to the Minister of Agriculture , stating that discrimination on the ground of nationality in respect of the provision of social security to farmers was questionable in view of the obligations specified in the ORG .

Those amendments would enable farmers of foreign nationality having permanent residence status in GPE to join the farmers ' scheme . It was envisaged that the amendments would enter into force on DATE . The applicant was informed of this by the ORG . However , the amendments were not enacted .", "CARDINAL .
