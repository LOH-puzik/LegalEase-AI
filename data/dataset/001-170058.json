The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The first applicant currently lives in GPE . The third applicant left GPE for GPE on DATE . His current whereabouts are unknown . The second applicant died on DATE . According to the ORG representative , the second applicant died of a \u201c natural cause \u201d . No further details were given in this regard . The ORG was not informed of anyone wishing to pursue the application on his behalf .", "CARDINAL . The following is a summary of the events that led the applicants to seek asylum outside their countries of origin , as submitted by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is an NORP . When he was DATE he was forcibly recruited to the army in GPE . After having served for DATE he deserted and left for GPE . In the meantime , his father went missing after he had been arrested by the NORP authorities for having complained about the first applicant \u2019s forcible military service . The first applicant believed that his father had been tortured and murdered by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was a NORP . Initially , he left GPE for GPE together with his family . After the outbreak of armed conflict between GPE and GPE , the second applicant \u2019s family moved back to GPE , though the second applicant remained in GPE as he feared persecution for his religion and forcible military service in GPE . As he could have been expelled by the NORP authorities to GPE , the second applicant left for GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants stayed in GPE illegally for DATE . In that country both applicants were repeatedly arrested by the authorities allegedly in connection with the armed conflict between GPE and GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant left GPE for GPE in DATE for unspecified reasons . DATE he was employed by an NORP transport company operating in GPE .

The third applicant \u2019s identity card issued by the NORP authorities was retained by his former employer . Thus the third applicant remained in GPE illegally and was at risk of possible deportation by the PERSON authorities to his country of origin , GPE , where he risked persecution \u201c as a traitor to the GPE political regime \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not comment on those submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , with the intention of seeking asylum in any country other than GPE or their countries of origin , the applicants covertly boarded a commercial vessel flying the flag of GPE . The vessel was leaving the port of GPE and heading for GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicants were discovered by the vessel crew . The vessel \u2019s owner and insurer were informed accordingly .", "CARDINAL . When the vessel was passing through LOC , the insurer tried to arrange with the NORP authorities that the applicants could disembark in GPE , but the authorities refused the request .", "CARDINAL . Following the vessel \u2019s arrival in GPE on CARDINAL DATE the NORP authorities and a representative of ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in GPE met with the applicants on board the vessel . The applicants were not allowed to disembark . Their allegations of persecution in their home countries written in the NORP and NORP languages were passed by the vessel \u2019s insurer to the representative of the ORG office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the vessel left ORG in the direction of the port of GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , sometime before the vessel anchored in the port of GPE , a non - governmental organisation \u201c Faith , Hope , Love \u201d , which at the time was based in ORG and assisted refugees and asylumseekers under a contract with the ORG , contacted the head of ORG in LOC of GPE informing him that there were CARDINAL nationals of GPE and a national of GPE on board the vessel and that , according to the ORG , they might require international protection . The organisation requested leave for their lawyer , PERSON , to meet with the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NORP border guards embarked the vessel and met with the applicants . According to information provided by the Government , the applicants did not submit any requests to the border guards .", "CARDINAL . Later on DATE , PERSON went to GPE port to see the applicants . She was allowed to embark the vessel and meet with the applicants . She discussed their situation with them and informed them of the asylum procedures in GPE . The discussion was in LANGUAGE in the presence of CARDINAL border guards and CARDINAL port security officers . As only the first applicant could speak LANGUAGE , he interpreted the discussion into NORP , which the other CARDINAL applicants could understand .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , during the discussion they expressed the wish to seek asylum in GPE and started filling in asylum applications with the help of CARDINAL of the border guards who had knowledge of LANGUAGE . That border guard was an official interpreter at ORG . However , sometime later the border guards stated that they could not accept the asylum applications from the applicants , as the applicants were on board a vessel flying the flag of a foreign ORG . Such applications had to be submitted to the vessel \u2019s captain . On the same grounds the border guards refused to allow the applicants to disembark . The border guards asked PERSON to leave the vessel . Allegedly , PERSON was not given sufficient time and interpretation facilities to provide assistance to the applicants in respect of their asylum claims .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , during that meeting the applicants did not submit applications for asylum ; nor did they express a wish to do so . As the applicants had no identity documents , the head of the border - guard unit decided to refuse them leave to enter GPE . No copy of that decision was provided to the ORG . The ORG submitted copies of reports drawn up by the border guards who had been present at that meeting , which indicated that the meeting had lasted for TIME and that the applicants had stated that they needed time to decide whether they wished to request asylum in GPE . PERSON left the vessel without raising any complaints . The head of the border - guard unit stated in her report that she had explained to the applicants that \u201c in the circumstances the border guards had not been able to accept asylum applications from them \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , allegedly having been misled by the vessel \u2019s captain who was acting on the instructions of the NORP border guards , signed type - written statements in LANGUAGE , according to which they had boarded the vessel with the aim of reaching GPE \u201c in search of better living conditions \u201d and that they did not \u201c need the status of refugee , addition[al ] [ or ] temporary protection in GPE \u201d . In a letter he sent to the ORG on DATE , the captain stated that the abovementioned type - written statements had been prepared and brought on board by NORP border guards on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicants themselves had asked the captain to help them to prepare the above - mentioned type - written statements . The Government relied on the captain \u2019s statements obtained on DATE when he had been questioned by the migration authorities . In particular , the captain stated that he and the first applicant had prepared the statements and had given them to the other applicants to sign .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , acting on the applicants\u2019 behalf , lodged with the ORG a request for interim measures to be imposed under LAW . She stated that the applicants risked removal to GPE , for which the vessel was scheduled to depart on DATE . In their submissions before the ORG , the Government did not contest this statement . PERSON further argued that in GPE asylum - seekers were granted no form of protection and were exposed to the risk of being repatriated . According to her , there was a real risk that the authorities of GPE would forcibly return the applicants to their countries of origin where they would be subjected to ill - treatment . She essentially requested the ORG to indicate to the Government of GPE that the applicants should be allowed to leave the vessel and should be granted access to a lawyer and to the asylum procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the border guards accompanied by an officer from ORG embarked the vessel and met with the applicants . According to the Government , it was during that meeting that the applicants requested asylum in GPE . They were allowed to disembark and to cross the State border .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were questioned by the migration authorities concerning their asylum applications . According to the applicants , during the questioning they were not provided with adequate translation or any explanation of the relevant regulations . Nor were they provided with legal assistance .", "CARDINAL . The parties have not informed the ORG about the outcome of the applicants\u2019 asylum applications lodged in DATE ; nor have they provided any further details as regards their examination by the migration authorities .", "CARDINAL . It appears from their submissions that in DATE the applicants lodged new asylum applications with the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( the \u201c ORDMS \u201d ) rejected the third applicant \u2019s asylum application , finding that it was manifestly ill - founded . The third applicant did not challenge that decision on appeal . On DATE he decided to leave GPE for GPE . The ORG helped him to organise the travel arrangements . The ORG representative did not provide any further information as regards the third applicant , as since the third applicant \u2019s departure from GPE the representative has lost contact with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORDMS refused the second applicant \u2019s application , finding that his submissions were contradictory and did not concern a situation in which refugee status or complementary protection could be granted . He appealed to ORG . The proceedings were eventually terminated as the second applicant died on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORDMS refused the first applicant \u2019s application , principally for the same reasons as in the case of the second applicant . The first applicant appealed to ORG , which has not yet decided on the matter ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
