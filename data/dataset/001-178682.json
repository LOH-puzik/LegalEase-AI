From DATE he was also classed as a disability pensioner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE L. attempted to commit suicide by taking a large number of pills that had been prescribed for him and the applicant . The applicant called an ambulance . L. was diagnosed with intoxication and taken to Hospital Y. An extract from L. \u2019s medical file ( haiguslugu ) contains a reference that after admission to hospital he had intermittently expressed suicidal thoughts . Owing to a lack of space L. was initially placed in the intensive care unit of the renal department . On DATE he was transferred from the renal department to the intensive care unit of the department of internal medicine , located on the twelfth floor of the hospital . L. committed suicide on DATE by jumping out of the window .", "CARDINAL . Hospital staff immediately notified the police and the officer who responded to the call wrote up a report . According to the report , documents were drawn up on site , the deceased was photographed and the body was sent for an autopsy , and the doctor on duty gave a statement . The report stated that the doctor had noted that the windows on the twelfth floor did not have locks , and that CARDINAL nurses on duty had been dealing with another patient in a neighbouring room at the time of the incident . The report also noted that patients were not restrained and kept in their beds in the intensive care unit , as that was considered too extreme a measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested an explanation from the hospital as to why , in particular , the safety of CARDINAL , who had been a suicidal patient , had not been ensured and why he had not been sent to a psychiatric clinic . According to the reply of DATE , victims of poisoning were usually taken to that particular hospital as they needed special supervision and care . That had been the case with PERSON , who had been under regular supervision . However , hospital staff had not been with the patient at all times . The reply referred to the fact that symptoms of poisoning usually took DATE to go away . Patients then had a psychiatric consultation and were transferred for inpatient treatment at a psychiatric clinic or were referred for outpatient care .", "CARDINAL . An autopsy was performed on L. on DATE . The death certificate ( arstlik surmateatis ) stated that he had died from injuries to his internal organs and that he had fractures of the skull and skeletal bones and trauma to the head , torso and limbs .

ORG heard the applicant and examined the medical documentation concerning L. It also had an expert opinion of CARDINAL of its members at its disposal . ORG gave its opinion on DATE . It found that the psychiatric treatment PERSON had received had been in compliance with standard medical practice , and that there had been no link between his previous psychiatric treatment and the attempted suicide on DATE . PERSON in the renal and internal medicine departments had been justified as he had been in need of medical supervision . His suicidal tendencies had been properly assessed upon his admission to hospital on DATE . However , the supervision he had been under had been insufficient and the technical characteristics of the building \u2013 the fact that the windows could not be closed to prevent people jumping out DATE had also served as factors contributing to his suicide . ORG recommended that Hospital Y implement a procedure for the supervision of suicidal patients and train its staff accordingly . It recommended the use of technical solutions to minimise the risk of suicide , such as monitoring equipment in the rooms and windows with shatterproof glass that could not be opened . ORG noted that its assessment created no legal rights or obligations but that it could be used as evidence in civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an offence report with the local prosecutor \u2019s office . The prosecutor analysed CARDINAL potential offences \u2013 manslaughter , manslaughter by negligence and placing a person in danger . However , by a letter of CARDINAL DATE he refused to institute criminal proceedings on the grounds that the elements of a criminal offence were lacking . According to the prosecutor , there was no reference to the fact that someone might have assisted L. in jumping out of the window . The prosecutor also noted that hospital personnel were responsible for protecting the life and health of their patients ( a so - called duty of care , garandikohustus ) , but he considered that hospital personnel could not objectively be expected to constantly monitor patients or that patients should be tied to their beds or placed in windowless rooms with the door locked . With regard to the offence of placing a person in danger , the prosecutor considered that the height of the hospital and the existence of a window in the hospital room had not , as such , been dangerous , but they had become a threat in the light of PERSON \u2019s own self - harming activity . Hence , it had not been the medical personnel who had placed L. in danger , rather he had created the danger himself .", "CARDINAL .

ORG considered that it had been correct to take PERSON to the regional hospital , Y , where it had been possible to treat him for poisoning , which would not have been possible in a psychiatric clinic .

If an exception could not be made , the applicant requested that she be granted legal aid and given more time to draw up a request to that effect .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG declined to examine the appeal since it had not been lodged by a lawyer and there were no grounds for making an exception to that requirement . The court of appeal also rejected the application for more time for lodging a request for legal aid , noting that no reasons had been advanced for the applicant \u2019s failure to submit supporting documents in time to prove her lack of means . In addition , the court of appeal noted that the applicant \u2019s prospects of success in the appeal were negligible . The refusal to institute criminal proceedings and the decision of ORG had contained detailed reasons as to why there were no grounds to initiate criminal proceedings . The conclusion that the hospital staff had not committed any criminal offence had been well - founded .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then asked ORG ( NORP ) to grant her legal aid to lodge an appeal against the court of appeal \u2019s decision . An appeal to ORG also had to be lodged by a lawyer . By a decision of DATE ORG refused to grant legal aid .
