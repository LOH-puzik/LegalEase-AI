The investigator furthermore noted that these statements did not suggest anything in respect of mens rea , in particular whether there was any sexual intent in ORG \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s alleged actions in relation to the child , or whether they had been aware of the fact that the child had been observing them during the alleged instances of sexual intercourse .", "CARDINAL .

In comparing the applicant \u2019s flat and the flat where ORG was then living , the court found that both flats were located in GPE and offered appropriate conditions for the residence of the child . In that regard the court referred to the report of the local guardianship office , which stated that both parents provided adequate residential conditions for the child . As to the income of the parents , the father was employed and received a salary ; the mother was a student but worked unofficially and had been abroad to earn money . Both parents had positive reference letters and the child had an equal attitude towards both of them .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant \u2019s allegation that the mother was negligent with the child and that she might have exercised physical violence against the child : in contrast to the results of the medical examination of DATE documenting the injuries on the child \u2019s body ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the staff of the PERSON child - minding centre had signed a certificate stating that on DATE the child had had no injuries ; furthermore , the police had refused to institute criminal investigation in respect of the child \u2019s injuries ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court concluded that there was no link between ORG \u2019s attitude towards the child and the latter \u2019s injuries .", "CARDINAL . Relying on LAW on the Rights of the LAW Article CARDINAL of LAW , the court found that the facts did not disclose any exceptional circumstances which could justify the separation of the child from her mother . Consequently , it determined that the child should reside with her mother .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision , arguing that the firstinstance court had breached substantive and procedural provisions of domestic legislation and international law . He submitted that in determining the place of the child \u2019s residence the court should have been guided by the principle of the best interests of the child . The applicant insisted that on DATE PERSON had secretly moved with the child from the flat and destroyed the stability of the child \u2019s everyday life . The court had failed to properly examine the allegations that ORG had behaved violently towards the child and the possibility that the child had been the target of sexual abuse during the period when she had lived apart from her father with her mother . The applicant emphasised that on DATE he had lawfully taken the child back to his flat since the child had previously been permanently living in his flat and he had never given any consent for ORG to change the child \u2019s place of residence . In his opinion , the court had paid no attention to the fact that the child had been attached to the paternal grandparents and that her separation from them would be detrimental to her interests . Furthermore , the respective financial capacity of the applicant and PERSON , as well as the residential conditions , had not been properly assessed . Important pieces of evidence had not been included in the case file and part of the evidence had been assessed wrongly DATE namely , the certificate issued by the PERSON child - minding centre regarding the child \u2019s good state of health was a fabricated document that had been discredited by the forensic medical expert report of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of the first - instance court . ORG found that the allegations of child abduction , sexual abuse and physical violence had been groundless . As to the child \u2019s attachment to the paternal grandparents , ORG considered that the parents played a more important role in the upbringing of the child . Overall , the findings of the first - instance court had been lawful and reasonable .", "CARDINAL .
