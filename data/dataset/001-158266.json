The trial court relied in particular on the search and seizure records and photographs depicting the accused GPE holding the same type of handgun as had been used for the murders . On the basis of the witness statements and the recording of a nearby video - surveillance camera , the trial court concluded that the applicant and the other co - accused had come to PERSON \u2019s flat on the critical date . Furthermore , the ballistics reports and the crime - scene reports indicated that the details of the statements of the applicant and his co - accused were accurate , and the course of the events was ascertained on the basis of the fire , ballistics and toxicology reports and the DNA report . The trial court also found that the statements of the accused as to the manner in which the murders had been carried out were supported by the autopsy report , the evidence of the pathologist provided at the trial , the crime - scene report and the witness statements about the gunshots that had been heard in PERSON \u2019s flat . Furthermore , as to the arson charge , the trial court examined the material from the crime - scene investigation and the evidence from the fire expert report , as well as medical records and damage reports submitted by the victims , and the statements of a number of residents in the building where the fire had occurred .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s questioning by the police and the request made by the defence to hear evidence from the lawyer PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , ORG noted :", "\u201c The first accused PERSON confessed to the criminal offences of robbery , aggravated murder of GPE , GPE and GPE ... exactly as is stated in the operative part of this judgment , in front of the police and in the presence of a defence lawyer . He later tried to contest that statement , claiming that he had not hired the lawyer PERSON , that he had told the police officers that he wanted PERSON as his lawyer , that at the time he had been taken to the police station he had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs and so on . However , this defence is not acceptable . The written record of arrest shows that the first accused PERSON was arrested on DATE at TIME at FAC , and the lawyer [ M.]R. , in favour of whom the first accused PERSON signed the power of attorney , came to the police station on DATE at TIME The written record of the questioning of the then suspect PERSON shows that PERSON was informed at TIME and that the questioning started at TIME Besides the officers of ORG , a typist and the defence lawyer of the then suspect PERSON , GPE Attorney was also present during the questioning . The introductory part of the written record [ indicates ] that the then suspect PERSON clearly stated that he had chosen and authorised PERSON to act as his defence lawyer and had consulted with him , after which he decided to give his statement . The written record is properly signed by the persons present . The first accused PERSON had read the written record before signing it . Thus , the above shows without doubt that the contentions of the first accused PERSON that he had not hired PERSON as his lawyer are unfounded . During the trial , at the request of PERSON defence , a handwriting expert gave her opinion about the signature of PERSON on the written record of his questioning by the police . The expert opinion proved beyond any doubt that the contested signature was that of PERSON . The panel accepts such findings in their entirety ; the findings were further explained at a hearing by the expert PERSON . PERSON Her findings were given in an objective , impartial and professional manner . Therefore , the questioning of the first accused PERSON by the police was carried out in compliance with the provisions of LAW .", "...", "The request made by [ PERSON ] defence to call the lawyer PERSON as a witness ... was dismissed as irrelevant , since the documents from the case file do not reveal that there was any extraction of a confession by the police , but only [ record ] the time at which the lawyer [ PERSON came [ to the police station ] , whereupon the questioning of [ PERSON ] in the presence of the lawyer for whom he had signed a power of attorney started ... Nobody , including [ PERSON ] defence lawyer who was present during the police questioning \u2013 [ M.]R. \u2013 has alleged any unlawful extraction of a confession and there is no indication of this in the record of the statement given by PERSON , [ who ] at the time [ was ] only a suspect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the first - instance judgment with ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . He complained , inter alia , that the conviction had been based on his confession to the police , which had not been given in the presence of a lawyer of his own choosing , namely ORG , but in the presence of a lawyer , PERSON , who had been offered to him by the police . The applicant also referred to the request for the removal of the GPE State Attorney and all his deputies lodged by ORG DATE , highlighting the part of that request which stated that he had been denied food during his detention in police custody . The relevant part of the applicant \u2019s appeal reads :", "\u201c The statement given by the first accused to the police was unlawfully obtained , for the following reasons . When the first accused was brought to ORG his defence rights were seriously infringed . However , during the trial this infringement was ignored . On DATE , the first accused \u2019s mother and then also his now late father hired PERSON as his defence lawyer before the police , after he had been arrested . However , PERSON was not allowed access to the accused , and subsequently informed the relevant authorities thereof , but they ignored this . PERSON therefore lodged an action in ORG in respect of an unlawful act , as well as a request for the removal of the GPE State Attorney and all his deputies . In that request he alleged that the first accused had not been given any food by the police from DATE at TIME , when he had been brought to FAC , until he had agreed to be represented by the lawyer PERSON on DATE at TIME so as to give a self - incriminating statement , which was in violation of LAW of LAW . Because of that the defence asked for the lawyer PERSON to be examined [ at the trial ] since he had knowledge about the questioning of the first accused by the police . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded . As regards his complaints concerning his statement to the police , that court noted :", "\u201c ... The lawfulness of [ the statement given to the police ] was not put in doubt by the appellant \u2019s complaints that ORG was not his lawyer and that his lawyer was PERSON , who had been hired by his father and mother on DATE , or by the appellant \u2019s complaints that he had been denied food in the period TIME on DATE and TIME on DATE until he had agreed to hire ORG as his lawyer , since according to the record of his arrest ( pages ... ) , the appellant was arrested at CARDINAL TIME on DATE and the lawyer PERSON arrived [ at the police station ] at TIME on DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a further appeal against the appeal court \u2019s judgment with ORG on DATE , reiterating his previous arguments . The relevant part of the appeal reads :", "\u201c The first accused has to comment on the conclusions of the appeal court that the allegation that food was denied to him from TIME on DATE until he agreed to be represented by the lawyer PERSON at TIME on DATE had no bearing on the lawfulness of the evidence [ the record of his questioning ] because the written record of his arrest showed that he had been arrested on DATE at TIME and that the lawyer PERSON had arrived on DATE at TIME The Record of Attendance DATE , which is in the case file , shows that the first accused was brought to the police station on DATE at TIME and was kept there . He was arrested DATE , as found by the first - instance court . However , it is not true that the lawyer PERSON came to the police station at TIME : he came at TIME , which shows that the allegations of the first accused are true . That fact could have been verified by the evidence of the lawyer PERSON , who represented the first accused during the investigation ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as the court of final appeal , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded . That court pointed out that the record of the applicant \u2019s statement suggested that he had chosen PERSON to represent him during police questioning and that ORG had provided him with adequate legal advice . ORG also noted that there was nothing in the case file to indicate that the applicant had been ill - treated or forced to confess . The relevant part of the judgment reads :", "\u201c The appellant erroneously argues that the first - instance court committed a grave breach of criminal procedure , contrary to LAW , in basing his conviction on the defence he gave to the police in the presence of a defence lawyer , which [ in the appellant \u2019s view ] constitutes unlawfully obtained evidence for the purposes of LAW , and that the record of his questioning as a suspect by the police ( in the presence of a defence lawyer ) should thus have been excluded from the case file . In so doing , the appellant challenges the reasoning of the second - instance judgment to the effect that the lawfulness of the evidence was not affected by the appellant \u2019s arguments that during his apprehension and arrest he had not been given food until he had agreed to be represented by ORG These arguments of the appellant were refuted by the second - instance court on the basis of all the formally established information contained in the record of [ his ] questioning in the presence of a lawyer on DATE .", "This third - instance court notes that [ the complaint ] regarding the question of the presence of a lawyer [ during the questioning ] , as a legal requirement for the lawfulness of evidence obtained in this way during the police investigation , relates to CARDINAL objections . The first objection concerns the restriction of access to the lawyer of [ the defendant \u2019s ] own choosing , and the second objection relates to the pressure exerted on the suspect through the denial of food ( LAW ) , which , according to the appeal , eventually made him accept legal representation by the lawyer imposed on him , PERSON , although his parents had already engaged the services of the lawyer PERSON on TIME DATE .", "It is to be noted that during the police criminal investigation , a number of persons with a background of drug abuse , and with links to the victim PERSON , were arrested , in particular from the neighbourhood of ORG , and it was in the course of this action that the accused PERSON was also apprehended . Only when a probable cause was established that the accused could have been the perpetrator of the offences at issue was he arrested on DATE at TIME", "At the same time the father of the accused , who was in GPE whereas the accused \u2019s mother was in GPE , was informed [ of the arrest ] by the police at TIME , which shows that from that moment the father of the accused ( after a telephone conversation with his mother ) could have engaged the services of a lawyer for the accused , for which he would most certainly have needed some time . In such circumstances , this third - instance court finds that the parents of the accused could not already have signed a power of attorney for the lawyer of the accused \u2019s choice by CARDINAL p.m. on DATE in question .", "The other information from the record of the accused \u2019s arrest and from the record of his questioning by the police shows that on DATE , as is indicated by the record of the arrest , the accused was brought to ORG , and , as is apparent from the record of PERSON questioning by the police , the defence lawyer PERSON was informed at TIME and came to the police station at TIME The questioning itself commenced at TIME and ended at TIME , with a break TIME and TIME", "It should be emphasised that in the introductory part of the record [ of his questioning ] the suspect PERSON expressly stated that he had chosen PERSON as his defence lawyer and had signed the power of attorney in favour of him , and the record of the questioning shows that the defence lawyer had TIME for consultation with the suspect before the questioning , in which time he was able to advise him of his rights .", "Thus , the relevant fact which follows from the formal procedural action described in the record of the suspect \u2019s questioning is that the chosen lawyer came TIME before the questioning commenced , and in the consultation with [ the suspect ] before the questioning he was able to give [ the suspect ] genuine legal advice as his chosen lawyer .", "It should also be noted that the essence of the suspect \u2019s right to have a lawyer present during his questioning by the police lies in the necessity for legal protection of his rights , which is why the beginning , conduct and end of this formal [ procedural ] action is fully registered in the record [ of the questioning ] .", "This is why all arguments to the contrary , as set out in the appeal against the second - instance judgment , and particularly those relating to the need to question the lawyer PERSON as the second concurrent lawyer of [ the suspect \u2019s ] choosing , have no support in the content of the formal record of the suspect \u2019s questioning of DATE , because the record contains formally registered information about the contact with the chosen lawyer , the time when the chosen lawyer came into ORG , the time when the questioning of the suspect commenced , the period in which a short break took place , and the time when the procedural action finished , all of which was confirmed by the suspect and the defence lawyer of his choosing by signing the record without any objections as to its content .", "However , irrespective of the fact that the defence of the accused in the context of police questioning formally satisfied the requirements of LAW , the general thrust of the defence , as well as the substance of the defence as regards particular acts , and the confession , were provided voluntarily by the suspect , and his chosen lawyer was most certainly unable to have any influence on this , which at the same time rules out the possibility of any mental pressure being exerted on the suspect , as well as his subsequent arguments about the lawyer having been imposed on him during the police investigation . On the contrary , the suspect \u2019s defence rights were fully secured , as required LAW and LAW .", "There is therefore no breach of LAW in conjunction with LAW . The refusal of the request to have the record of the suspect \u2019s questioning by the police in the presence of a lawyer of his choosing excluded from the case file as unlawfully obtained evidence does not constitute a breach of his defence rights because the record of the suspect \u2019s questioning by the police clearly and undoubtedly shows that the lawyer who was present [ during the questioning ] was the lawyer of the suspect \u2019s free choice , and this also follows from the signed power of attorney in favour of the lawyer in question , who protected the suspect \u2019s rights during the questioning . Accordingly , the refusal of the defence \u2019s request did not have any bearing on the lawfulness and correctness of the judgment . At the same time , it was not necessary to question the new chosen lawyer as a witness and , for the reasons set out above , the facts of the case were not insufficiently or erroneously established , as was argued in the defendant \u2019s appeal against the second - instance judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) on DATE . He complained , inter alia , that he had been ill - treated while in police custody and that he had been forced to confess . He also complained that he had been denied the chance to have a lawyer of his own choosing conduct his defence . He reiterated his arguments from his previous appeals and added :", "\u201c It is also important to stress that at the session of ORG as the court of third instance , held on DATE , the defence indicated that the applicant had been brought to the police station at TIME on DATE , and that that fact was shown in the Record of Attendance DATE , which was in the case file . The defence asked the panel [ of ORG ] to have a look at that record . However , after a brief examination of the case file it was established that the document in question could not be found , and that it would be looked at later . However , the judgment of ORG , acting as a third - instance court , shows that the document had [ still ] not been found ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint . ORG , endorsing the reasoning of ORG , noted that the proceedings as a whole had been fair and that there was no evidence in the case file that the applicant had been ill - treated while in police custody ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
