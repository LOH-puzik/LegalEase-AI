NORP In their capacity as a lawyer and a law firm , the applicants had been retained by ORG , a public limited company ( soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme ) , to assist and represent it during audit operations conducted into its affairs for DATE to DATE as a result of an audit notice of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to the provisions of Article L. CARDINAL B of the Code of Tax Procedure , the tax authorities applied to the President of the NORP tribunal de grande instance to authorise a search and seizure operation to be carried out in the context of the audit of ORG , with a view to obtaining accounting , legal and corporate documents supporting certain declarations , on account of suspected fraudulent activities ( price mark - ups and uninvoiced or fictitious transactions ) .", "CARDINAL . By a warrant of the same date the President authorised the tax inspectors , assisted by senior police officers , to carry out the searches and seizures required in order to discover evidence of the alleged activities at certain sites where documents or data carriers connected with the suspected fraud might be found , in particular at the applicants\u2019 place of business , since they had been retained to assist and represent ORG and were therefore assumed to be in possession of documents evidencing the suspected fraud on the part of their client .", "CARDINAL . The judge authorised CARDINAL search , setting DATE as the time limit for the search and DATE as the time - limit for the submission of a report on the operations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , simultaneous searches were conducted at the locations indicated in the warrant issued by the President of the GPE tribunal de grande instance . The operations carried out at the applicants\u2019 place of business by CARDINAL tax inspectors took place TIME and TIME , in the presence of the first applicant , the chairman of ORG and a senior police officer . On that occasion , the first applicant was given a copy of the warrant of DATE .", "CARDINAL . A record of the search and seizure operations and an inventory were drawn up and signed by those present . CARDINAL documents were seized . They included handwritten notes and a document with a comment in the first applicant \u2019s handwriting , in respect of which the chairman of ORG expressly pointed out that these were the lawyer \u2019s personal documents and were accordingly protected by the rule of absolute professional secrecy and could not be seized . The first applicant protested at the way in which the search had been carried out and made a number of observations which were logged in the record . He was given a copy of the record and the documents seized .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law within the statutory time - limit of DATE . In their pleadings in support of the appeal , they raised CARDINAL grounds alleging that the searches and seizures had been unlawful . They stated in particular , relying on professional secrecy and the rights of the defence , that documents sent by a client to that client \u2019s lawyer and correspondence between them could not be seized where the search was not aimed at establishing proof that the lawyer in question had been involved in the offence . They also complained that the search warrant issued by the President of the tribunal de grande instance had failed to mention specifically that the presence of the chairman of ORG or his or her representative was compulsory during the operations .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal . As to the failure to refer specifically to the presence of the chairman of ORG , the court stated that the search warrant did not have to determine the measures required for professional secrecy to be observed , any breaches thereof being examined in the context of the review of the lawfulness of the operations and not the review of the lawfulness of the warrant . As regards the seizure of the documents at issue , ORG considered that the professional secrecy of lawyers did not constitute an obstacle to searches of their LOC and seizure of any documents in their possession being authorised , in so far as the judge had found that the information provided by the applicant authority contained sufficient evidence for the suspicion mentioned in the warrant .", "CARDINAL .

As regards the second condition , it should be stated that the requirement as to the position and status as an independent lawyer , which must be fulfilled by the legal adviser from whom the written communications which may be protected emanate , is based on a conception of the lawyer \u2019s role as collaborating in the administration of justice by the courts and as being required to provide , in full independence , and in the over - riding interests of that cause , such legal assistance as the client needs .
