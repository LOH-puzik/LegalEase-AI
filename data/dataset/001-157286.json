De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently in the specialised hospital centre ( CHS ) of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was CARDINAL , went to the workplace of GPE , who had been his girlfriend and who had told him , following threats and violence on his part , that she no longer wanted to see him . The applicant inflicted several stab wounds on PERSON , who died from a massive haemorrhage , having been wounded in the throat and thorax , and on CARDINAL other individuals . On DATE the applicant was placed under judicial investigation , charged with the premeditated murder of his former girlfriend and the intentional wounding of the other CARDINAL people , and remanded in custody . On DATE the Prefect ordered his compulsory admission to FAC .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was examined by CARDINAL boards of expert psychiatrists who found that , at the material time , he was suffering from a mental disorder which had impaired his discernment and the ability to control his actions within the meaning of Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Criminal Code ....", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor asked the investigating judge at the GPE tribunal de grande instance to refer the case to ORG for a ruling as to the applicant \u2019s lack of criminal liability , in accordance with LAW , derived from LAW DATE on preventive detention and declarations of criminal insanity ( hereafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d , ... ) .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the investigating judge found that it transpired from his investigation that there was sufficient evidence against the applicant to show that he had committed the offences as charged and that there were plausible reasons to apply LAW , first paragraph , of LAW . He ordered the transmission of the case file by the public prosecutor to ORG for the purposes of referral to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG at ORG made his submissions calling for referral to ORG for a ruling as to the applicant \u2019s lack of criminal liability on grounds of criminal insanity , in accordance with the procedure set out in new LAW of LAW , which provided in particular for a public hearing ...", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the President of ORG noted that it was impossible for medical reasons for the applicant to appear at the hearing . At the hearing of DATE , his representative argued in particular that the decision of CARDINAL DATE had breached the principle that harsher criminal legislation could not be applied retrospectively . He indicated that under the above - mentioned LAW of LAW , ORG was required to rule on the commission of the offences by the applicant when deciding on compulsory psychiatric treatment , for an indefinite duration , and that this was tantamount to conviction for an offence and to the imposition of a sentence which had not been applicable at the material time .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated that there was sufficient evidence to show that the applicant had \u201c intentionally killed PERSON and that he lacked criminal liability for those acts on the ground that he was suffering from a mental disorder which had impaired his discernment and ability to control his actions . It ordered his compulsory hospitalisation pursuant to LAW of LAW , derived from the DATE Act ... , on the grounds that \u201c it transpire[d ] from the proceedings that [ the applicant \u2019s ] mental disorder represent[ed ] a risk for the safety of others and GPE ] long - term care which [ could ] only be provided in a hospital \u201d . The court also prohibited him , for DATE , from having any contact with the complainants and from possessing or carrying a weapon , those being preventive measures provided for under new LAW of LAW ... It sent the case back to ORG for a judgment on the applicant \u2019s civil liability and on the claims of damages . ORG had previously ruled on the procedural objections raised by the applicant \u2019s representative , including argument concerning the immediate application of the provisions of DATE Act and the alleged violation of LAW :", "\u201c ... The declaration of the existence of sufficient evidence that the person has committed the offence as charged does not constitute a conviction but a finding that there is a factual situation which could have legal consequences ...", "... contrary to the pleadings and contrary to the rules on preventive detention , ORG does not rule on judicial confinement of unlimited duration but orders the compulsory hospitalisation of the individual in an institution mentioned in Article PERSON - CARDINAL of LAW , which provides for hospitalisation arrangements specifically in such contexts , and the ORG is immediately informed of the decisions . Thus the person concerned will be subject to the compulsory hospitalisation arrangements solely under the auspices of the medical and administrative authorities , depending on the evolution of his state of health .", "Accordingly , this measure can not be regarded as a penalty but as a preventive measure . ... The PERSON of DATE and the Decree of DATE are thus applicable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that judgment on points of law . In his grounds of appeal he argued , relying on Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , that the principle of \u201c no punishment without law \u201d precluded the immediate application of a procedure which had the effect of rendering him liable for penalties that his mental state would not have entailed under the former legislation in force at the material time . He contended that the declaration of his criminal insanity could not be accompanied by court - ordered sanctions or coercive measures , as this would breach the principle of the non - retrospective application of harsher criminal legislation .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , the public prosecutor , in his opinion , took the view that it was impossible to find that there was sufficient evidence against the applicant to show that he had \u201c intentionally \u201d committed the offences as charged , since \u201c legally speaking , a state of criminal insanity related to a loss of discernment preclude[d ] a court from ruling on the mental element of the offence and consequently on the question whether the offences were made out under the law \u201d . He pointed out that the legislature had sought to ensure that the investigating judge would anticipate the declaration of criminal insanity and confine his assessment to the facts : \u201c as a result of such anticipation only the material element will stand , devoid of its punitive connotation , together with its \u2018 objective imputation\u2019 to an individual , which would serve as a basis for granting redress to the \u2018 GPE and was in itself the focus of the legislative intent \u201d . On this point he called for the setting - aside of part of the judgment , namely the replacement of the operative part in order to delete the word \u201c intentionally \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on points of law :", "\u201c ... The person under judicial investigation submitted that there could be no immediate application of the PERSON of DATE , as the provisions of Article MONEY [ of LAW ] derived therefrom would enable the judge to order , against the person declared criminally insane , measures which , by their effects , would be \u2018 quasi - criminal sanctions\u2019 , being listed in the person \u2019s criminal record .", "To dismiss those arguments , the judgment uses the above - mentioned reasoning .", "As those grounds stand , the judgment does not warrant the alleged complaint in so far as the provisions of LAW , which provides that the only penalties that may be imposed are those legally applicable on the date of the offence , do not apply to the preventive measures that are prescribed in cases of criminal insanity under Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL ...", "... there is sufficient evidence [ against the applicant ] to show that he committed the offences of premeditated murder and wounding ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , produced by the applicant with his observations , the Prefect of Sa\u00f4ne - et - LOC denied his requests to go outside the institution unescorted . The ORG \u2019s letter to the responsible psychiatrist of the Sevrey CHS reads as follows :", "\u201c ... In a letter dated DATE , I informed you that I had requested CARDINAL assessments to ascertain whether I would be able to grant such leave .", "Those assessments reached me DATE . CARDINAL states as follows : \u2018 In view of Mr Berland \u2019s current state of health we can envisage allowing him to go outside unescorted in the context of a trial period with a process of social rehabilitation , which seems indispensable\u2019 . The other one reads : \u2018 his current state of health allows the possibility of unescorted leave to be envisaged . We should gradually move towards trial arrangements to consolidate the rehabilitation plans\u2019 .", "Moreover , in accordance with his instructions , issued following the judgment against Mr GPE , I have contacted the public prosecutor of ORG to inform him of the findings of the assessments which could lead me in the future to authorise Mr PERSON to leave the hospital unescorted .", "The public prosecutor drew my attention to the prohibitions ordered by ORG on DATE against Mr Berland , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ...", "In those circumstances , even though the assessments tentatively allow for the possibility of granting Mr Berland such unescorted leave , it appears impossible to me to guarantee that he would not come into contact during such leave , if therefore alone , with the complainants . Consequently I wish to inform you of my decision ... to grant Mr PERSON permission in the future to leave the hospital exclusively if escorted , depending on any assessment data that you may wish to transmit to me . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["7-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
