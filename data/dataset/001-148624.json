On DATE Mr Biryuchenko and on DATE Mr PERSON complained to ORG about the de facto extension of their detention after their case files had been sent by the prosecution authorities to the respective trial courts . ORG examined their complaints together with similar complaints lodged by other individuals . In a Ruling adopted on DATE ORG found that the challenged provisions of the new CCrP complied with LAW . However , their practical interpretation by the courts may have contradicted their constitutional meaning . In part CARDINAL of ORG held :", "\u201c The second part of LAW provides that ... the detention is permitted only on the basis of a court order ... . Consequently , if the term of detention , as defined in the court order , expires , the court shall decide on the extension of the detention , otherwise the accused person should be released ...", "These rules are common for all stages of criminal proceedings , and also cover the transition from CARDINAL stage to another . ... The transition of the case to another stage does not automatically put an end to the preventive measure applied at previous stages .", "Therefore , when the case is transmitted by the prosecution to the trial court , the preventive measure applied at the pre - trial stage ... may continue to apply until the expiry of the term , for which it has been set in the respective court decision [ imposing it ] ...", "[ Under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ] a judge , after having received the criminal case concerning a detained defendant , should , within DATE , set a hearing and establish \u2018 whether the preventive measure applied should be lifted or ORG . This wording implies that the decision to detain the accused or extend his detention , taken at the pre - trial stage , may stand after the completion of the pre - trial investigation and transmittal of the case to the court , only until the end of the term , for which the preventive measure has been set .", "The prosecution , in its turn , while approving the bill of indictment and transferring the case file to the court , should check whether the term of detention has expired and whether it is sufficient to allow the judge to take a decision [ on further detention of the accused pending trial ] . If by the moment of transferal of the case - file to the court this term has expired , or if it appears to be insufficient to allow the judge to take a decision [ on detention ] , the prosecutor , pursuant to ORG and CARDINAL of LAW , [ should ] request the court to extend the period of detention . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Biryuchenko lodged a complaint with ORG office . He submitted that DATE , which was after his case had been referred for trial to ORG , and DATE , he had been detained unlawfully ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . Subsequently , his detention had been extended CARDINAL times : on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , on DATE and DATE . He pointed out that he had appealed against all the extension orders , but the appeal court had failed to take his arguments into account . Relying on the ruling of ORG of DATE , the applicant argued that in his case the courts had wrongly interpreted LAW and had taken an unlawful decision on DATE . All the subsequent detention orders had also been unlawful . He requested the Prosecutor to lodge a request for supervisory review with ORG and apply for quashing of the extension orders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG replied that the ambiguity of LAW allowed the courts to detain the defendants during DATE without taking any decision in this respect . Therefore , when extending the applicant \u2019s detention and dismissing his applications for release , the courts of first and second instances had not found any violation of law . Furthermore , the applicant had been released on DATE . Therefore , his right to liberty had been reinstated long before the adoption of the ruling of CARDINAL DATE by ORG . For these reasons , there had been no grounds to apply for a supervisory review of detention orders ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3", "5-4", "6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
