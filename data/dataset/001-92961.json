Section CARDINAL provides that a fuel fee is imposed for the purpose of preventing the use of a fuel which gives rise to the imposition of a fuel fee , and that the use in vehicles of a fuel which gives rise to the imposition of a fuel fee is prohibited . Section CARDINAL lays down the sums of the fuel fees imposed on different types of cars . Section QUANTITY provides that if a notification has not been made to the competent authority , the fuel fee shall be increased by PERCENT at most . The fuel fee may also be increased by PERCENT at most if the use of the fuel which gives rise to imposing the fuel fee is repeated , or doubled at most if the use of the fuel which gives rise to imposing the fuel fee is particularly aggravated .", "CARDINAL . The Government Bill for the enactment of the new LAW ( HE CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) noted that the use of more leniently taxed fuel led to the issuing of a fuel fee debit and an additional motor vehicle tax and that the aim of this was effectively to prevent the use of fuel other than fuel intended for traffic . Formally , the use of more leniently taxed fuel was not forbidden , but it was subject to fairly severe financial sanctions . The basic structure of LAW and LAW was identical to , for example , LAW , which does not specifically forbid certain unwanted acts but only provides for the consequences of such acts . The only difference was that the sanction applicable to the use of fuels was an administrative sanction collected as a tax . The basic aim of the provisions on additional tax and fuel fee is well established in GPE . The provisions are well - known among motorists and the consequence is that , compared with other countries , more leniently taxed fuel is hardly ever used in road traffic in GPE . The Government PERSON considered that the high level of the fuel fee was necessary with regard to the preventive effect of the sanctions system .", "CARDINAL .
