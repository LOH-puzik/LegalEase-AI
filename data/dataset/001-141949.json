She was once married , but divorced her husband in DATE , after which she lived with their son , born in DATE , in GPE while her former husband moved to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and applied for a residence permit DATE and for asylum on DATE . She stated that she and her son had left GPE on DATE and had then stayed with relatives in GPE , GPE , for DATE . In GPE she had left behind her son , because she had not been able to afford his trip . Later , her former husband had come to GPE and brought the son back with him to GPE . To the NORP authorities the applicant submitted an NORP citizenship certificate , an identity card , divorce documents and a membership card for NORP regarding her and her son .", "CARDINAL . Assisted by legal counsel , the applicant stated in essence the following in support of her application . Her main reason for leaving GPE was the generally insecure situation for NORP in GPE , which had affected her and her family personally . Her fears had led to her son going to school only sporadically during DATE . Moreover , at DATE her mother had received a threatening phone call from someone who had wanted to contact the applicant , presumably to forcibly remarry her with another man . If they did not comply , the applicant understood that her family would have to leave the neighbourhood . They had taken the threats very seriously and she had moved immediately with her son to her grandmother \u2019s house in the LOC neighbourhood of GPE , where they had stayed for DATE . The applicant further stated that her only remaining relative in GPE was her mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected the application and ordered the applicant \u2019s deportation to GPE . ORG held that she had not proved her identity , but that she had made it plausible that she was from GPE . It further considered that the situation in GPE as such did not constitute grounds for asylum . While noting that NORP were an exposed minority , their general situation did not suffice either for an individual be granted protection , but his or her personal circumstances would have to be assessed . ORG went on to state that the applicant had not submitted any written evidence in support of her allegations of persecution . Furthermore , she had received a threat on CARDINAL occasion and it had not been shown that the person threatening her had referred to her religious beliefs . Nor was there any other indication that she had been ill - treated on account of those beliefs or that she had received other threats before leaving GPE . ORG then noted that the applicant \u2019s brother , who had also applied for asylum in GPE , had had his application rejected and his deportation to GPE ordered and that , consequently , the applicant would likely not lack a male network upon return to GPE . In conclusion , the ORG found that she had not made it probable that she was at personal risk of being subjected to serious ill - treatment if she returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s brother , who had arrived in GPE on DATE , had his application for a residence permit rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , adding the following to her story . NORP , being the smallest and most vulnerable minority in GPE , were subjected to extortion , kidnappings and murder . QUANTITY women and children had been forced to convert to NORP , often after having been assaulted and raped . The NORP were not a large enough community to be able to protect and support each other and there was no particular region where they could settle safely . This was enough to show that she was in need of protection . The applicant asserted that the threat against her had to be seen against this background . Her whole existence had been marked by the threatening atmosphere and demands directed at non - NORP women and in particular the NORP . Her situation had been further aggravated by the fact that she is a single woman without a social network in GPE . Her mother had had the intention of leaving the country as well , but the applicant had no information on her whereabouts . Furthermore , in GPE the applicant had met a NORP man from GPE together with whom she now lived . This situation would never be accepted in GPE . Also , when she had talked about her new relationship in GPE , her family had reacted very negatively and had virtually frozen her out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) upheld the decision of ORG . The court acknowledged the difficult situation for NORP in GPE and stated that , consequently , a lower threshold was applied in assessing the individual risks than in NORP cases in general . The general situation for NORP did not suffice of itself to be granted protection , however ; an assessment of the applicant \u2019s individual circumstances was necessary . In the absence of written evidence , the court went on to examine the statements made by the applicant . It considered that the threat received concerning forced marriage was primarily related to the general security situation in GPE at the time . In DATE since the applicant had left the country , the security situation had improved . While the NORP remained disadvantaged , there was no sign that she was still being searched for in GPE . Nor was there anything to indicate that her mother \u2019s possible exile had been caused by continued threats . The court further found that the negative reaction of the applicant \u2019s family to her new relationship did not imply a need of protection . In that connection , it further noted that the asylum appeal lodged by her brother , who had not turned his back on her , had been rejected on DATE . Thus , she could return to GPE with him and thereby have a social network in the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrations - \u00f6verdomstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal . On DATE it refused leave to appeal also in the applicant \u2019s brother \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant , as well as her brother , claimed that there were impediments to the enforcement of their deportation orders . Their petition mainly concerned the brother \u2019s period of active duty in the NORP army , during which he had gained knowledge of important people in the army and their illegal actions . This knowledge would put both the applicant and her brother at risk if they were returned . The applicant further claimed that her mother had been kidnapped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the petition , finding that no new circumstances justifying a reconsideration had been presented . It considered that the claims made in relation to the brother did not in any way show that there were threats against him or the applicant . The allegation that the mother had been kidnapped was actually new , but it was unclear when this incident was supposed to have happened and there was nothing to conclude that the possible kidnapping had any personal connection to the situation of the applicant and her brother . The applicant did not appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a letter to ORG , which was perceived by ORG as a new petition for reconsideration . The applicant stated that , if she were forced to return to GPE , she would have to do so without her current partner or her brother , who were both in GPE . Her partner had been issued a visa to GPE , as he was born in GPE , and could not return to GPE . Consequently , they would be separated , because she could not travel to GPE since she lacked a passport and would not be granted a visa . The applicant further asserted that she had no relatives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to reconsider the case . Although the fact that the applicant \u2019s partner had been granted a visa to GPE was considered to be new , ORG stated that this fact did not constitute a lasting impediment to the enforcement of the deportation order . The applicant did not appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government have submitted the following notes to the ORG , taken from the files of ORG . The applicant \u2019s mother was living with relatives and friends in GPE . When the applicant left GPE , her grandmother and cousins were living in the LOC neighbourhood of GPE . In GPE , the applicant has been living in the same flat as her brother and her partner from DATE . Her partner left GPE in DATE to be reunited with his family in GPE , whereas her brother is still in GPE . Furthermore , in reply to the ORG \u2019s request for information in the case , ORG had stated that it was likely that the applicant had a large number of relatives left in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has given the following additional account to the ORG . Following her divorce in DATE , she went to live with her parents and her brother . Her father , under whose protection she was living , died in DATE . Her grandmother , with whom she had briefly lived after the threatening telephone call , died in DATE . To her knowledge , she has no relatives left in GPE , cousins or others . Several relatives are living abroad , in GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . Her sister is living in GPE . After the applicant and her brother had left GPE , their mother went to live with a NORP family in GPE , from whom she rented a room . In DATE , the applicant and her brother received information about their mother \u2019s disappearance . The family with whom the mother had lived called the applicant \u2019s uncle in GPE and said that they did not think that she had left voluntarily . A police report , sent to the uncle only in DATE , states that the report was filed on DATE by the mother \u2019s landlord , who had told the police that the mother had been missing since DATE . The applicant does not know why the landlord did not file a report earlier or why he did not state that her mother had been missing for DATE . The applicant is still unaware of what has happened to her mother following her disappearance . However , given the time that has passed without any contact with her , she assumes that she is dead . The applicant is still in a relationship with the man she met in GPE , although he is now living in GPE . The people who disowned her because of that relationship were her relatives in GPE , with the exception of her brother . The brother married a relative , who is a NORP citizen , on DATE . He left GPE and applied at the ORG in GPE for a NORP residence permit based on his marriage . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted him a residence permit until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . An alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( LAW , LAW CARDINAL of the Act ) .

This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .

If a residence permit can not be granted under these criteria , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not having done so .
