The applicants are sisters who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in P.", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants , represented by their mother PERSON , concluded a real estate agreement with ORG in which they expressed their intention of buying a villa of QUANTITY and the adjacent courtyard of QUANTITY in GPE , a seaside neighbourhood of P. ( hereinafter : the \u201c house \u201d ) . The agreement stated that the house was in poor condition as certain individuals had lived there for DATE without any legal basis and had ruined the furniture and installations .", "CARDINAL . The agreement was formalised in a real estate purchase contract of CARDINAL DATE by which the applicants acquired ownership of the house for an amount of CARDINAL NORP kunas ( HRK ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants registered their ownership of the house and the plot of land in the land register in equal shares .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON requested from the relevant ORG ( hereinafter : the \u201c LOC ) the authorisation to sell the house owned by the applicants , such authorisation being required under the relevant domestic law in cases where a parent wishes to dispose of a child \u2019s property ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . As a result of that request , on DATE PERSON and her husband PERSON ( the father of the second applicant ) were interviewed at FAC . They stated that they had bought the house in DATE for HRK CARDINAL and that they had already spent MONEY ( ORG ) renovating it . However , the house required some further investment for which they lacked the necessary means and thus they intended to sell it and to live with CARDINAL of their parents . They further explained that they owned a retail business and that they had no problems with their children , who both had excellent marks at school . PERSON and PERSON also promised that they would open a bank account on behalf of their children , into which they would deposit the money from the sale of the house . They pointed out that they had contacted a real estate agency , which was looking for a potential buyer . They also agreed that PERSON would conclude the sale contract once they had managed to find a buyer .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON was arrested and held in detention in connection with a suspected attempted murder and the unlawful possession of firearms . He was later indicted on the same charges in ORG PERSON , which on DATE found him guilty and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . During the criminal proceedings his defence lawyer was ORG , a lawyer practising in P.", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted a request to the FAC seeking authorisation for a real estate swap agreement between the applicants and a certain FAC , who was in fact ORG mother - in - law . He provided powers of attorney signed by PERSON , GPE and PERSON ( the father of the first applicant ) authorising him to obtain the ORG \u2019s consent to a swap real estate agreement .", "CARDINAL . Together with his request , ORG provided a draft swap agreement stipulating that ORG would transfer to the applicants her CARDINAL - room flat of QUANTITY , situated on the fourth floor of a residential building in P. ( hereinafter : the \u201c flat \u201d ) , while the applicants would transfer their ownership of the house to FAC The draft swap agreement also stated that the values of the properties to be exchanged were the same and that the parties waived their right to object that they had sustained damage as a result of giving the exchanged property away at CARDINAL of its real value . ORG also submitted another document , a supplement to the swap agreement , in which the parties to that agreement acknowledged that GPE and PERSON had invested significant sums of money in the house and that , on the basis of the amounts shown on certain available invoices , ORG would compensate them for those investments .", "CARDINAL . V.L. was invited to ORG an interview on DATE in connection with ORG \u2019s request . She stated that her husband had meanwhile been imprisoned and that their retail business had started to go badly , leading her to close it in DATE . She also explained that she was unemployed and that this situation had affected the applicants , who were no longer doing so well at school . She further stated that she had been obliged to borrow money to pay the bills for the house and that the overall situation had prompted her and PERSON to exchange the house for a flat in P. with the additional obligation on the part of the flat - owner to pay them the difference in value between the CARDINAL properties , amounting to CARDINAL ORG according to her estimate . Lastly , PERSON pointed out that PERSON , the father of the first applicant , had given his consent to the swap agreement . She also undertook to register the ownership of the flat in the applicants\u2019 names .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave its authorisation for the swap agreement , whereby the applicants would transfer their ownership of the house to FAC while the latter would transfer her ownership of the flat and a garage to the applicants . The decision drafted by the Centre specified that PERSON was obliged to provide the ORG with a copy of the swap agreement .", "CARDINAL . In its statement of reasons behind the decision , the ORG pointed out that it had taken note of the powers of attorney provided to ORG by the applicants\u2019 parents , ORG statement of DATE , birth certificates for the applicants and land registry certificates for the properties , and the draft swap agreement . It had also noted the fact that ORG had been convicted at first - instance of the offence of attempted murder and unlawful possession of firearms . Based on this information , the ORG concluded that the swap agreement was not contrary to the best interests of the applicants since their property rights would not be extinguished or reduced as they would become the owners of a flat which would provide fully suitable living accommodation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG gave its authorisation for the supplementary document to the swap agreement by virtue of which ORG would pay the applicants CARDINAL ORG each on account of the difference in value between the exchanged properties . As a condition of this decision , PERSON was obliged to provide the ORG with a bank statement attesting that the payment had been made . In its statement of reasons , the FAC referred to a request made by PERSON for the conclusion of a supplement to the swap agreement and the statement she had given to the ORG . The ORG also found that this would not be contrary to the interests of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The above CARDINAL decisions issued by ORG DATE were forwarded to the lawyer PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , represented by ORG , concluded the real estate swap agreement with ORG before a Public Notary in P. , and the applicants thereby transferred their ownership of the house to ORG while the latter transferred her ownership of the flat and the garage to the applicants . The swap agreement contained a clause under which the parties agreed that there was no difference in the value of the exchanged properties , and that they had no further claims on that account . It also set down the value of the properties at some HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Based on this contract , the applicants and ORG duly registered their ownership of the properties with the land registry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE lawyer PERSON submitted to the Centre a certificate from the land registry showing that the applicants had registered their ownership of the flat and bank statements showing that they had received the amount of CARDINAL ORG each .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG financija , PERSON uprava ) declared a tax obligation of HRK CARDINAL for each of the parties \u2012 based on the declared value of the transaction involved in the swap agreement \u2012 which was divided by CARDINAL in respect of the applicants , who were thus obliged to pay HRK CARDINAL each .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , represented by ORG as their legal guardian , brought an action against D.M.in ORG ( PERSON ) , asking the court to declare the swap agreement null and void ( ni\u0161tav ) .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the applicants argued that the swap agreement had effected the exchange of the ownership of the house \u2012 which comprised CARDINAL flats , each measuring QUANTITY , was CARDINAL minutes\u2019 walk from the sea and was worth MONEY ( ORG ) \u2012 for a flat and a garage worth in total no more than LAW . Given that at the time when the contract was concluded they were DATE , the ORG should have defended their rights and should not have given its consent to a swap agreement of that kind . In this respect they pointed out that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW listed specific instances in which the property of a minor could be disposed of , and that no such instance had existed in their case . Moreover , the ORG had failed to carry out an on - site inspection or to commission an expert report which would have allowed it to estimate the value of the house and adopt a proper decision concerning the request for authorisation of the swap agreement . The applicants therefore considered that , by failing to take such vital measures , the ORG had allowed an unlawful and immoral property exchange to be executed . In their view , this had resulted in ab initio invalidity of the exchange . The applicants also pointed out that their legal guardian PERSON had not been party to the discussions concerning the swap agreement . They therefore proposed that the trial court examine several witnesses , including the participants to the swap agreement , the employees of the ORG , the first applicant \u2012 who was by that time already DATE \u2012 , and commission an expert report establishing the value of the properties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG request to take any of the proposed evidence on the grounds that the case could be decided on the basis of the documents from the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 civil action . It argued that it was not in a position to re - examine the ORG \u2019s decision to authorise the swap agreement , since that was an administrative decision which could only have been challenged in administrative proceedings . Thus , given that such a decision existed , ORG could not find the swap agreement to be unlawful or contrary to the morals of society . It also pointed out that the swap agreement could possibly be only a voidable contract ( pobojan ) but no claim to that effect had been made by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged that judgment by means of an appeal lodged before ORG , arguing that the first - instance court had failed to examine any of their arguments and had thus erred in its decision concerning the validity of the swap agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal as ill - founded , endorsing the reasoning of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then lodged an appeal on points of law before ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE . The second applicant was represented by PERSON , and the first applicant , having in the meantime reached the age of majority , was able to conduct the legal action herself .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal on points of law the applicants argued , inter alia , that the P. had negligently allowed the swap agreement to be concluded without taking into account the value of the properties and the nature of their family circumstances at the time , namely the fact that LOC was in detention and that PERSON was known as a person with a problem of drug abuse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal on points of law as ill - founded and endorsed the decisions of the lower courts , which found that the civil courts were not in a position to re - examine the ORG \u2019s final administrative decision allowing the conclusion of the swap agreement . Moreover , it did not appear to ORG that the ORG had failed in its protection of the best interests of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) reiterating their previous arguments before the lower courts . The second applicant was represented by ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . A report by ORG and Youth ( ORG socijalne politike i ORG ) of DATE submitted to the ORG suggests that the ORG was not aware of PERSON \u2019s drug abuse problem nor had it been alerted concerning ORG \u2019s conflict of interest .", "CARDINAL . According to a report by ORG ( ORG zdravlja ) of DATE , PERSON started her drug addiction therapy on DATE and terminated it in DATE . She then started again in DATE and she was still undergoing therapy at the present time .", "CARDINAL . The information available from the e - land registry concerning property in GPE shows that the house and the land on which it is located measure QUANTITY with an adjacent courtyard of QUANTITY , all of which is registered in the name of ORG as owner ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
