The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , who was succeeded in that function by PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant receives an old - age pension . At the same time , he is still economically active as a self - employed entrepreneur . He has an ongoing dispute with ORG ( ORG ) concerning the contributions he is required to make to the social security funds in his capacity as a pensioner who is self - employed .", "On DATE the ORG quashed CARDINAL decisions of CARDINAL DATE and took CARDINAL separate new decisions ordering the applicant to pay contributions for DATE and DATE and financial penalties for late payment of contributions for DATE . The applicant 's appeal was unsuccessful and the decisions were upheld by the ORG appellate body on DATE .", "Although the applicant could have challenged the decisions of DATE by way of an administrative - law appeal to the courts , he did not do so . He nevertheless lodged an unsuccessful request , which had no suspensive effect , for a review by the public prosecution service , which was at the latter 's discretion . The decisions of CARDINAL DATE thus became final and binding .", "The ORG subsequently commissioned a judicial enforcement officer ( s\u00fadny exek\u00fator ) to enforce the amounts due . The enforcement was authorised by ORG s\u00fad ) on DATE . The enforcement was to be carried out in the form of deductions from the applicant 's old - age pension .", "On DATE the applicant challenged the enforcement by way of an appeal ( n\u00e1mietka ) . He contended mainly that the decisions of DATE had been flawed by numerous mistakes in calculation and formal irregularities .", "On DATE the ORG quashed the decisions of DATE upon an extraordinary review outside the framework of the appellate procedure in so far as they concerned the contributions and penalty for DATE . The ORG informed the judicial enforcement officer accordingly and advised him that all that remained to be enforced were the decisions concerning the contributions and penalty for DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's enforcement appeal , observing that it was aimed at substantive elements of the enforced decisions while the review of such elements fell within the framework of the appellate procedure and outside the scope of the enforcement procedure . No mention was made of the decision of DATE to quash the decisions of CARDINAL DATE concerning DATE .", "The written version of the decision of DATE , which was not subject to appeal , was mislaid and only came to the attention of the judicial enforcement officer on CARDINAL DATE .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) had declared the applicant 's complaint under LAW that the decision of DATE was arbitrary , unfair and wrong and that the procedure leading to it was unfair , inadmissible on account of the lack of legal representation , which was mandatory . ORG took that decision having previously dismissed the applicant 's request for legal aid on the ground that his complaint had no prospect of success .", "By DATE the applicant had paid the entire amount due under all the decisions of DATE . The amount corresponding to the decisions concerning DATE was later returned to him . Consequently , the enforcement proceedings were discontinued on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
