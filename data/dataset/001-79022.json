The first and second applicants then lodged an application with ORG , requesting it to direct the ORG to enter them in the register of residents as permanent residents . In a judgment delivered on DATE , which was upheld on DATE following an appeal on points of law , the court allowed their application . It considered that under the legislation in force the situation of the second applicant , who had left the army before CARDINAL DATE \u2013 the date on which GPE had declared its independence \u2013 could not be equated with that of a non - NORP serviceman temporarily present on NORP soil , who would be entitled to a temporary residence permit only .

The GPE only discovered this fact in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL decisions dated DATE and DATE , the ORG police decided not to institute criminal proceedings against the applicants for using false identity papers . However , ORG imposed an administrative penalty of CARDINAL lati ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) on them for breach of the passport regulations .

ORG also noted that the third applicant had followed the example of her parents and sister in DATE , obtaining CARDINAL passports and having her place of residence registered in both GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , ruling on the application for the proceedings to be reopened , allowed the ORG \u2019s application , quashed its own judgment of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the removal of the ORG names from the register of residents .

In a second letter sent DATE , ORG informed ORG that the first applicant had neither NORP nor any other nationality .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants submitted a further request to ORG . In a joint memorial they argued that , as the second and third applicants had NORP nationality , they had the right to obtain permanent residence permits under the NORP - Latvian agreement . The first applicant , who had no nationality , contended that she was entitled to the status of a \u201c permanently resident noncitizen ( nepilsonis ) \u201d under the PERSON on the status of former GPE citizens without NORP or other citizenship ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In court , the applicants made no attempt to deny the actions of which they had been accused by ORG and the ORG , but maintained that those actions had been in breach only of NORP law and therefore had no effect on their rights in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG Instance allowed the ORG request . It noted that the applicants\u2019 place of residence had been legally registered in ORG DATE and that they had lived there from then onwards . In the court \u2019s view , since the procuring of second passports by the applicants and their registration in GPE were illegal and void acts , they had no impact on the applicants\u2019 legal status in GPE . The court also noted that the second applicant was on the list of former members of the NORP armed forces in receipt of a NORP military pension and entitled to remain in GPE . That list had been drawn up jointly by the QUANTITY governments in accordance with the NORP - Latvian agreement . Consequently , the court held that the first applicant was entitled to apply for a passport as a \u201c permanently resident non - citizen \u201d and that the second and third applicants were entitled to obtain permanent residence permits .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed against that judgment to ORG . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal , endorsing the findings and reasoning of the firstinstance court .", "CARDINAL . The ORG then lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG of ORG . In a judgment of DATE , the ORG quashed ORG judgment and declared it null and void . The ORG found that secretly obtaining CARDINAL passports and registering places of residence in CARDINAL different countries , failing to disclose the second passports , and supplying false information to the authorities when applying for regularisation constituted serious breaches of NORP immigration law . The ORG also referred to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW , which stated that the status of \u201c permanently resident noncitizen \u201d could not be granted to persons who , on DATE , had their permanent place of residence registered in a member ORG of ORG ( of which GPE is a member ) . The ORG considered that the provision in question was fully applicable to the applicants\u2019 case .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted that the judgment of ORG of DATE had been subsequently set aside when the proceedings were reopened , thereby depriving the entry of the applicants in the register of residents of any legal basis . It concluded that the second and third applicants , since they did not satisfy the requirements of the PERSON on aliens and stateless persons ( entry and residence ) ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , were also not entitled to obtain permanent residence permits . Consequently , the ORG set aside the judgment of DATE and referred the case back to the appellate court .", "CARDINAL . For procedural reasons , the case was transferred to ORG which , in a judgment of DATE , rejected the applicants\u2019 application , reaffirming the reasons given by the ORG . Unlike ORG , ORG considered that the first applicant had NORP nationality under GPE Nationality Act . With regard to the second applicant , it considered that the fact that an individual was on the list of retired army personnel merely attested to the fact that the person concerned actually resided in GPE and was in receipt of a NORP military pension ; it did not in any sense confer entitlement to a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the ORG of ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicants on points of law , endorsing in substance the arguments of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL letters dated DATE and DATE , the ORG reminded the applicants that they were required to leave GPE .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , the first applicant , PERSON , was summoned to the regional headquarters of the security police ( PERSON policija ) . An officer of the security police asked her a number of questions , some of them relating to her application to the ORG and to an interview she had given to journalists from a NORP television channel on the subject . In particular , the police asked the first applicant how the NORP journalists had made contact with her , how she had heard about the possibility of lodging an individual application with the ORG , how she had found lawyers to represent her before the ORG , and how she had known that certain persons had bribed ORG officials in order to obtain NORP residence permits . In addition , the police officer asked her several questions about her professional career and about the members of her family .", "CARDINAL . The dialogue between the first applicant and the police officer , as reconstructed by the applicant and sent to her lawyers on DATE , ran as follows :", "\u201c Police officer : How did the television channel ORG find you ?", "Applicant : We had had telephone calls in DATE [ and ] DATE . At the time , we had refused to meet them , but journalists are bloodhounds , they always get what they want .", "Police officer : And then ?", "Applicant : They telephoned from GPE and said they wanted to meet us and talk to us .

They wanted to talk to several [ people ] who had brought cases before the courts .", "Police officer : When did they phone ?", "Applicant : It was a DATE TIME , TIME They came round on the DATE , at TIME If you want to come round [ too ] , you \u2019re welcome . Our door is always open .", "Police officer : You said that you PERSON taken the case all the way to ORG , did n\u2019t you ?", "Applicant : Yes , I did . There were CARDINAL sets of proceedings ; we fought and fought [ again ] , and eventually we turned to ORG , because of the people in charge in the [ Directorate ] . They saw it as a game to get us deported from the country , while we wanted to prove that we were in the right . [ Their ] attitude towards us was based on prejudice : we had n\u2019t broken any laws in GPE .", "Police officer : How and where did you find out that you could apply to ORG ?", "Applicant : The issue of our regularisation was discussed several times by ORG . We had approached ORG . We had lawyers . The representatives of ORG and the [ ORG ] had told us at the last meeting that they had no objections to raise or accusations to make as far as we were concerned , and that everything would be fine . Unfortunately , they have n\u2019t kept their promises so far . ORG advised us to lodge an application with ORG about the length of the proceedings if the case was n\u2019t resolved .", "Police officer : And how did you find those lawyers ?", "Applicant : With the help of the lawyers in the social welfare office we were registered with .", "Police officer : Perhaps your lawyers threatened you , saying that if you did n\u2019t give information to ORG they would stop working with you ?", "Applicant : That \u2019s nonsense . They told us not to give information to anyone without their consent , not even to ORT ...", "Police officer : You said that over DATE people had lodged applications ?", "Applicant : Yes , I did . Actually , there are even more people involved : I meant that there were CARDINAL families . We \u2019ve all been through the courts : some of us once , some twice , and some even CARDINAL times . A lot of people solved the problem by paying backhanders .", "Police officer : How do you know that ?", "Applicant : We were all in the same boat and we helped one another . We used to say to one another that if someone had money , it was better for him to pay , to avoid a trial . [ The first applicant then gave the example of CARDINAL families whose status had been regularised after they had bribed ORG officials ; she named CARDINAL of the officials concerned . ]", "Police officer : And why did you not come to us ?", "Applicant : We did n\u2019t know you could help us .", "Police officer : How did you come by the information that CARDINAL people had lodged applications ?", "Applicant : Actually , the figure is higher . We \u2019ve all had a lot of problems . [ The applicant dwelt in detail on CARDINAL specific cases concerning the regularisation of persons in a similar situation to her own . ]", "Police officer : What does your husband think about the case ?", "Applicant : He supports [ me ] : what would you do ?", "[ The police officer then asked the applicant a series of questions about her education , her work , her husband \u2019s work and the family \u2019s financial situation . ]", "Police officer : Once more , how did you find out that you could take your case to ORG ?", "Applicant : We read the papers , we watch television ; the cases of GPE , PERSON , PERSON and several other families were reported in the media . We approached ORG , who gave us advice and even offered to [ help us ] find a lawyer . Strange , is n\u2019t it ? It was very hard for us , having to bring a case against GPE before ORG , but all the avenues open to us to try and resolve the problem in GPE had been exhausted . It \u2019s the fault of the [ Directorate and its officials ] , who flout the law and force people to leave GPE . They \u2019re the ones who bring shame on GPE . We have n\u2019t broken any law .", "Police officer : When is the case going to be examined ?", "Applicant : We do n\u2019t know .", "Police officer : What documents have you sent them ?", "Applicant : The courts\u2019 decisions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government contested the accuracy of this record , particularly in view of the length of time that had elapsed between the interview itself and the drafting of the document . The first applicant conceded that the document was probably less than perfect , given that it had been drafted from memory DATE after the fact ; she acknowledged that several other questions ( which she could not recall ) might have been asked during the interview . However , she contended that her record reflected with sufficient accuracy the content and tone of the interview .", "CARDINAL .
