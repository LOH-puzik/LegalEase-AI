Having analysed all the evidence , the court concludes that ORG can create the conditions most favourable for the upbringing and development of his children , which will [ ... ] correspond to the children \u2019s best interests ...", "Witnesses PERSON . and NORP , questioned during the trial , who are the colleagues of PERSON . PERSON [ the applicant ] stated that [ the applicant ] is considered to be of good character at work , [ is ] polite , [ and ] has not received any reprimands from her superiors . These witnesses stated to the court that they knew that [ the applicant ] had a family and children ... NORP stated that she knew that after the divorce the [ applicant \u2019s ] son stayed with his father , and [ the applicant ] had taken her daughter , but [ that ] the girl was not living with her , as [ the applicant had ] sent her to [ live with her ] parents , and [ the applicant ] would visit her at DATE . [ The applicant ] did not deny these facts during the trial .", "Witnesses for the other party Ya . , T. , PERSON and GPE , questioned during the trial , stated that ORG ... had always duly performed his paternal duties , had fully supported the family , had established good living conditions and had constructed the house with the needs of children in mind . Moreover , these witnesses stated that FAC , being the head of a business , could set his own working schedule , which would allow him to devote more time to the upbringing , education and development of his children and to spend more time with them . ORG can afford to employ a babysitter , who has taken care of the children from birth . At the same time the witnesses asserted that [ the applicant ] had not fully performed her parental duties , since the babysitter had taken care of them most of the time . [ T]he children would stay with the babysitter when [ the applicant ] repeatedly left on her own business and went on holiday , the children had often been anxious and had cried in the presence of [ the applicant ] , [ whereas ] the father had always looked after the children , had played and spent his free time [ with them ] ... These witnesses are not concerned by the outcome of the case and therefore the court considers their statements to be credible .", "Thus the court considers the [ applicant \u2019s ] argument that her address should be determined as the children \u2019s residence to be unsubstantiated , as it has been established during the trial that this dwelling does not belong [ to her ] , but [ rather ] has been rented to her for the period from DATE until DATE , [ and ] she is not registered at this address . Moreover , from the time of dissolution of the marriage her son has lived with his father in the house where they had all lived as a family before , while her daughter , who was taken by [ the applicant ] , does not live with her , having been sent to [ live with the applicant \u2019s ] parents , [ thus ] depriving the girl of the opportunity to see both her father and her brother .", "The court is not convinced by [ the applicant \u2019s ] argument that [ her former husband ] is unable to provide for the proper support , upbringing and development of the children , as [ the applicant ] has not provided any reliable evidence in support [ of this argument ] .", "The statements of PERSON ... that ORG is a bad father and that the children should reside solely with their mother can not be taken into account , since her statements contradict the facts of the case and the evidence provided by the [ defendant , V.G. ] ...", "In these circumstances the court ... basing its decision on the best interests of the children ...

NORP had been subjected to a disciplinary sanction in the form of a warning . It also noted that the final remarks of ORG had not served as the sole basis for the judgment , since the court had analysed the totality of the evidence .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment of DATE , arguing that when deciding on the issue of residence the first - instance court had only taken into account the financial situation of her former husband . The court had not assessed the evidence provided by her , namely that she was the coowner of the house the children were living in , the proceedings for division of marital property were pending and her stay in a rented apartment was only temporary . The applicant challenged the court \u2019s conclusion that she had given her daughter to her grandparents and had not been taking part in her upbringing as unsubstantiated , submitting that the court had ignored her explanation of the reasons for the girl \u2019s temporary stay with her grandmother . According to the applicant , she had had to leave the girl with her maternal grandparents for the fear that her husband may abduct her . In addition , the applicant pointed out that she had taken maternity leave to take care of the child from DATE until DATE . The applicant complained that the first - instance court had treated the evidence led by her former husband more favourably and had not taken into account the testimony of PERSON The applicant argued that the first - instance court had not assessed the evidence showing that she had supported and taken care of the children , namely the evidence that she was employed at a customs office , including a salary slip , and had not taken into account the children \u2019s minor age and their attachment to her . The applicant pointed out that the first - instance court had based its judgment on the flawed final remarks of ORG . The applicant complained that the first - instance court had not explained why it had rejected the evidence concerning her former husband \u2019s bad character and had not taken into account the fact that he had not let her come to the house to see the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Rostov ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as unfounded . It ruled as follows :", "\u201c ... [ T]he first - instance court correctly assessed the evidence , including the reports on the inspections of the parties\u2019 living conditions and ORG final remarks of DATE , which had been supported during the hearing by their representative , and considered the totality of the evidence .", "The court considered that all necessary conditions for the children to live with their father were satisfied , taking into account their interests , age and needs , their attachment to the father , [ and ] their father \u2019s ability to establish the optimal conditions for their upbringing and psychological and social development .", "Moreover , the court rightly ... pointed out that [ the applicant ] had not proved her allegations .", "The court considers the appellant \u2019s arguments that living with their father would not be in the children \u2019s interests to be unsubstantiated ...", "According to ORG final remarks of DATE , ORG is [ able to provide the children with ] good housing conditions , there is a separate furnished room for each child in his house , a gym , [ and ] a swimming pool . He loves the children and is able , in the court \u2019s opinion , to establish the [ optimal ] conditions for their upbringing , development and healthy living .", "In these circumstances the court concluded that ORG can ... raise the children and that living with their father would to a greater extent correspond to their best interests , as he is considered to be of good character in everyday life and at work and he has established appropriate living conditions for the children .", "In addition , the court established during the trial that [ the son ] was in fact living with his father in the house while [ the daughter ] , who had been taken by her mother , does not live with [ the applicant ] in the same apartment , but stays with relatives in another town .", "In these circumstances the court rightly concluded that [ the applicant ] ... was not in fact living with the child .", "The appellant \u2019s reasons for not being able to live with her daughter can not be taken into account ... since the present dispute concerns the granting of a residence order in favour of CARDINAL of the parents and not [ other ] relatives , especially [ relatives ] living in a different town .", "The fact that [ the applicant ] took maternity leave to take care of the child after the first - instance hearing does not in any way affect the legality of the first - instance judgment for the following reasons .", "Firstly ... at the time of examination of the case at first instance the applicant was not on maternity leave ... the girl ... was staying with relatives although [ the applicant ] had taken her from her father to live with her . At the same time , [ the applicant ] had highlighted in her claim that the child , due to her minor age , needed to stay with her mother ( and not with [ other ] relatives ) . The court considers that , in view of the family situation , [ namely ] the GPE divorce , the girl should have been living with CARDINAL of her parents , since she needed their support and protection ...", "In addition , the court takes into account the fact that before the first - instance judgment ... [ the applicant ] had not considered it necessary to take maternity leave to care for the child , or to be with the children .", "The court also takes into account the fact that in spite of the children \u2019s minor age at the time , [ the applicant ] returned to work after the birth of her daughter .

The applicant has not previously made this claim ...", "It is also important that the children can stay together at their father \u2019s home .", "In view of the above - mentioned reasons , the appellant \u2019s argument that the court had only considered the financial situation of ORG can not be taken into account .", "The first - instance court when resolving the dispute ... and assessing the evidence in the case proceeded from [ standpoint of ] the best interests of the children only and considered the ... situation from the point of view of which one of the parents offered greater opportunities for raising the children , had communicated with them more often , had spent more time with them , and could take care of them better .", "When making its findings the court relied , among other things , on the pre - trial behaviour of the parties towards the children .", "The argument of [ the applicant ] that the house ... is part of the common marital property and that she has initiated proceedings for its division is not relevant ... The marital property ... was not the subject matter of the dispute . The dwelling where the children \u2019s mother currently resides is not her property , it has been rented to her for the period from DATE until DATE , she is not registered [ as having her permanent residence ] there .", "At the same time the right of the children \u2019s mother to live in the house ... has been established by a court judgment and , taking into account the fact that the children and their father live in the house , [ she ] will be able to see her children .", "Moreover , she can subsequently lodge a [ further ] application for a residence order if the circumstances ( the basis of the claim ) change .", "It should also be noted , that ... the maternity leave records , the records of witness statements and the other documents attached to the appeal submissions can not be taken into account by the appeal court , since ... the appeal court can only consider new evidence in the case that could not have been submitted to the first - instance court .
