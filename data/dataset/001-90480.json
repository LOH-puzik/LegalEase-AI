On DATE , as the first applicant had left the country , the competent judge in GPE cancelled the indictment for domestic violence that she had initiated in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG dismissed the father 's application . Having carried out an additional investigation , and taking into account the expert 's report by Dr. PERSON dated DATE , it took the view that the child 's return carried a grave risk of psychological harm , whether or not he was accompanied by his mother , and would also place him in an intolerable situation . It therefore considered that the conditions of LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW were met . Finding however that the child could not be deprived of all relations with his father , it prescribed measures with a view to rebuilding the personal relationship between them .", "CARDINAL . The father lodged a civil appeal with ORG seeking the quashing of ORG judgment and the return of the child to GPE . He alleged that the court had misapplied LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW , principally , and LAW , secondarily .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , the President of the appropriate division of ORG granted the father 's request for immediate suspension of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , served on the first applicant 's lawyer on DATE , ORG allowed the father 's appeal . The relevant passages of its judgment read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The object of LAW on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any ORG ( DATE , sub - paragraph ( a ) ) . The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person , an institution or any other body , either jointly or alone , under the law of the ORG in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention ( Article CARDINAL , sub - paragraph ( a ) ) . ' Rights of custody ' include rights relating to the care of the person of the child and , in particular , the right to determine the child 's place of residence ( DATE ( a ) ) . In the present case it is not in dispute that the child 's removal to GPE was wrongful , since the father retained , jointly with the respondent , the right of ' guardianship ' , which under NORP law includes the right to decide on the child 's residence . Moreover , since the request for return was presented within DATE after the removal , the respondent can not deny either that , in principle , pursuant to LAW , the child 's prompt return should be ordered . The only matter in dispute is therefore the question whether an exception to that return may be applied under LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to the appellant , by refusing to order the child 's return to GPE , ORG misapplied LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW .", "CARDINAL Under LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW , in respect of which ORG is entitled to examine matters of compliance freely ( section CARDINAL(b ) LAW ) , the judicial authority of the requested ORG is not bound to order the child 's return when the person opposing that return establishes that there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation .", "The exceptions to return provided for LAW must be interpreted restrictively ; the parent who has abducted the child can not take advantage of his or her unlawful conduct ( judgment CARDINAL of DATE recital CARDINAL , in DATE p. CARDINAL ) . Only grave risks must be taken into consideration , excluding any grounds relating to the parents ' educational capacities , as the purpose of LAW is not to attribute parental authority ( ORG judgment CARDINAL III CARDINAL recital CARDINAL ; CARDINAL II CARDINAL recital CARDINAL p. CARDINAL ) . An exception to return under LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW , is therefore not open to consideration unless the child 's intellectual , physical , moral or social development is under serious threat ( judgment CARDINAL of DATE recital CARDINAL / bb in DATE p. CARDINAL and the reference cited therein ) . The burden of proof lies with the person who opposes the child 's return ( ibid . , recital CARDINAL , in DATE p. CARDINAL and the reference cited therein ) .", "CARDINAL ORG observed that the case concerned a very young child in the custody of his mother , who had always provided for him . The father , for his part , lived in a religious community where he was fed , and from his activity as a sports and art teacher he had a DATE income of CARDINAL [ Swiss ] francs . The custody of the child had been withdrawn from him on account of the atmosphere of fear that he had created at the family home . For the same reason , the NORP courts ordered him to live separately and prohibited him from approaching the mother 's flat . Before the child 's removal to GPE he had only had a restricted right of visitation , limited to TIME twice a week , under the supervision of the NORP social services . Concerning the conditions of a possible return of the child without his mother , according to the information provided by ORG on DATE , the father , who now shares a flat with CARDINAL other tenant and still works in an institution for religious education , would be prepared to take care of the child . Taking into account the laconic and not very reassuring nature of this information , together with the expert 's report by Dr [ ... ] , a psychiatrist , ORG considered that a return to GPE involved a risk of psychological harm for the child and might place him in an intolerable situation , whether or not he was accompanied by his mother . The court added that , in view of the father 's low income , the return to GPE of the respondent would also undermine the child 's economic stability and the mother would have to find a job in order to provide for them both .", "In his appeal , the appellant does not criticise ORG finding that there was a grave risk that the child would be exposed to psychological harm if he returned to GPE without his mother . He is of the opinion , however , that such a risk would not exist if the child 's mother accompanied him to GPE , as could be reasonably expected of her . As regards that latter hypothesis , the judgment of ORG fails to adduce any evidence of such a grave risk of harm , or of any intolerable situation for the child . The expert psychiatrist failed , in particular , to address that question , simply explaining that the risk could not be assessed without ascertaining the conditions of a possible return . As to the appellant 's aggressive behaviour towards the respondent , it does not appear from ORG judgment that the child would be threatened directly or indirectly as a result of witnessing such violence against his mother . She stated that the father had complied with the arrangements for his right of visitation and that the visits had gone well . The social worker appointed to supervise the right of visitation had described as marvellous the father - son relationship as established just before the child 's abduction by his mother . She has not claimed that the appellant breached the judicial instructions which required him not to approach her flat or to disturb and/or harass her . As to the considerations relating to the father 's low income and his ties with the religious community ' PERSON ' , as they stand they do not indicate a grave risk that the child would be exposed to harm within the meaning of LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW . Whilst such considerations may help to determine which of the CARDINAL parents offers the best educational capacities for the purpose of deciding on the attribution of the right of custody \u2013 a matter that is decided by the judicial authorities of the place of habitual residence ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) \u2013 they are not pertinent , however , for a decision about the return of a child after a wrongful abduction ( see recital CARDINAL above ) .", "As to the mother 's threat not to return to GPE , the judgment of ORG did not deal at all with the reasons for her refusal , whereas it should have established the existence of objective circumstances justifying that attitude . The Cantonal judges quoted the expert psychiatrist who had referred to the ' judicial risks ' that would be incurred in the event of a return to GPE , without any indication as to whether the respondent actually faced a prison sentence as a result of the abduction . Supposing that such a risk were proven , she could not be expected to return to GPE with the child \u2013 and that would accordingly rule out the return of [ the child ] in view of the major psychological harm that would be caused to him by the separation from his mother . She made no comment on that question in her reply to ORG ; in particular , she has not claimed that immediate imprisonment , or even any criminal sanction at all , would be imposed on her . Neither has she argued that in the event of her return to GPE it would be impossible or very difficult for her to integrate , or , in particular , to find a new job . Consequently , it can not be said that the mother 's return , and therefore that of the child , would be unbearable for economic reasons either . Therefore , as the respondent has failed to establish the existence of reasons that would objectively justify a refusal on her part to return to GPE , it must be accepted that she could reasonably be expected to return to that ORG of origin accompanied by the child . In these circumstances , it is of no import that the information provided by ORG ( see recital CARDINAL above ) on which the ORG based , in particular , its justification of the exception to the child 's return as provided for by DATE , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW , was deemed not very reassuring , because that information was based only on the hypothesis of the child 's return without his mother .", "Accordingly , the Cantonal judges breached LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW in finding that they were entitled to apply an exception to the child 's return to the ORG of his habitual residence . The appeal must therefore be allowed and the judgment of the court below quashed , without it being necessary to examine the complaint concerning a violation of LAW . It is incumbent on the respondent to secure the return of the child ... to GPE by DATE . ...", "ORG therefore finds as follows :", "CARDINAL . The appeal is allowed and the judgment of the court below is quashed .", "CARDINAL . The respondent is ordered to secure the return of the child ... to GPE by DATE .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the child 's father , through counsel , lodged an application with LOC of the Peace , who was responsible for the enforcement of the return decision , seeking the appointment of an ad hoc administrator for the child who would be entrusted with the organisation of his departure . On DATE , after the ORG had decided on DATE to indicate interim measures to the Government , the father withdrew his application of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In connection with LAW concerning this LAW , ORG submitted to ORG a \u201c dispatch \u201d ( PERSON DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) of which the relevant passages read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL Return and interest of the child ( section CARDINAL )", "In order to ensure an application of LAW of DATE that is better adapted to the interests of the child , it is necessary for the legislature to specify the various situations in which the return of the child can no longer be taken into consideration because it would place him or her in a manifestly intolerable situation . The rule in section CARDINAL is not supposed to supersede the provision of LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW of DATE . The term ' in particular ' means that the list merely enumerates a few situations which \u2013 although essential \u2013 do not preclude reliance on the clause provided for in the Convention .", "Firstly , sub - paragraph ( a ) refers to the situations in which the child 's accommodation by the parent who requested the return is manifestly not in the child 's interest . If that is not so , in particular where the parent who lodged the application has an exclusive right of custody or is the only one who could be granted such responsibility , there will not , in principle , be any cause for fear that the child will be placed in an intolerable situation on his or her return and therefore there is no reason why the return should be refused . This will not be the case where it appears obvious to the court that the party lodging the application would not be able to take care of the child .", "ORG - paragraph ( b ) governs cases in which the appropriateness of the child 's return can be assessed only from the standpoint of his or her relationship with the abducting parent . Where the child 's accommodation by the parent who requested the return is manifestly not to be taken into consideration , the problem of his or her return to the ORG of origin will be addressed differently , depending on whether the person who wrongfully removed or retained the child ( usually the mother ) is or is not in a position to return to that ORG . If the said parent is not able to do so because , for example , he or she faces a prison sentence that would lead to separation from the child or because the parent has very close family ties in GPE ( for example following remarriage or on account of a situation of hardship suffered by another family member living in GPE ) , the child 's psychological and physical stability may be at stake , because the child would , after the return , be obliged to live apart from his or her parents . Such separation is tolerable only in exceptional cases and must constitute an ultima ratio .", "Second type of situation : where , given all the circumstances , it can not reasonably be required of the abducting parent that he or she take care of the child in the ORG where it had its habitual residence immediately before the abduction ( section CARDINAL(b ) ) . It is not sufficient for the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child to state that he or she refuses to return to that ORG . He or she would also have to be in a situation of hardship such that he or she could not reasonably be expected to return to his or her place of prior residence to await there , with the child , the court 's final decision on the attribution of custody . In that context , we have in mind especially those cases in which the mother can not be guaranteed safe or affordable accommodation outside the home of his or her former partner . One must further take into account those cases in which the parent who has requested the return of the child will not resume the exercise of the right of custody and will not obtain it by court order , whilst the abducting parent is clearly the child 's primary carer . In such a case the child would only be taken to the ORG of origin to await the final attribution of the right of custody to the abducting parent , before coming back to GPE again with that parent . Such coming and going would ultimately only have served the purpose of bringing the case before the authorities of the former ORG of residence . Such a solution would be inadmissible according to the spirit and purpose of LAW , because it would be incompatible with the child 's interest . But the situation would have to be beyond doubt for the NORP court dealing with the request for return . Unless the circumstances can be established clearly , the court will have to rule that the return to the parent 's ORG of origin is bearable and that , accordingly , the child will not be placed in an intolerable situation such as to justify a decision denying the return under LAW , first paragraph , sub - paragraph ( b ) , of LAW .", "ORG - paragraph ( c ) refers to placement with third parties . If the child 's return were to lead to separation from the parent who wrongfully removed or retained the child ( because return is impossible for that parent or can not reasonably be required of him or her ) , it could only be carried out in appropriate conditions if the child were placed with a third party in the ORG of origin . However , such a solution should only be sought , with the resulting possibility for the competent NORP court to order the child 's return , if placement with CARDINAL party is not manifestly contrary to the child 's interest . That third condition can be satisfied only if separation from the parent remaining in GPE is bearable for the child \u2013 which may be the case where he or she has an antagonistic relationship with that parent DATE and if the foster family receiving the child can provide proper guarantees as to the protection and normal upbringing of the child . In any event , such a situation should only be envisaged as an ultima ratio .", "It must further be noted that , for the return to be compatible with the child 's interests and , in particular , for the conditions of LAW to be fulfilled , the authority ruling on the matter has to be apprised of the situation prevailing in the ORG of origin and of the legal provisions in force there . Thus , the parties , and in particular the parents , have a duty to participate in the establishment of the facts . The hearing of the parties in person by the court ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ) is therefore of great importance . The new provisions concerning the procedure and the cooperation with the competent authorities of the ORG of origin also play an essential role . The court must be able to verify whether , and in what manner , it is possible to ensure the child 's return ( section ORG ) ) . If it does not succeed in that task , or succeeds only partially , it will not be in a position to weigh up all the consequences that a return might have for the child . The same will be true if it does not succeed in obtaining from the local authorities any reliable assurances as to the conditions of the child 's reception and protection , in particular when there is some doubt about the requesting parent 's capacity to look after the child properly . In this respect , section CARDINAL is thus directly related to the practical application of section CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
