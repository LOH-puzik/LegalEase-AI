Police officer ORG account was as follows . PERSON was in the second ( rear ) room when the QUANTITY police officers entered the house . The door was barricaded with an armchair and a wardrobe . As they were entering , he proposed that PERSON come out of the room but he held the knife as if he wanted to throw it and kept threatening to stab him . Realising that it was not possible to remove him from the room and that he could harm someone , GPE told the other CARDINAL police officers that they should all go outside and find another way to neutralise GPE NORP . They left the house ; the last one to leave was PERSON . , who was holding a table to protect himself in case a knife was thrown . GPE went down from the porch and was already in the yard when those of his colleagues who had gathered there shouted \u201c He has come out and attacked . \u201d H.Gev . was holding a table , defending himself against PERSON . GPE ran towards them and saw PERSON stab PERSON . in the head , so he shot at GPE NORP \u2019s legs . PERSON NORP fell down and , while lying on the ground , he threw the same knife at GPE . Then he took out another knife and threw it at the police officers . A.S. fired again in his direction .

The police officers approached and handcuffed him .", "CARDINAL . Police officer PERSON . \u2019s account was as follows . After the CARDINAL police officers had entered the house , GPE NORP threatened them and told them to leave . They left DATE that is to say he noticed that the others had already gone out . Realising that he was alone , he tried to leave the house while holding the table . He had not yet reached the door when suddenly PERSON screamed and ran towards him with a knife in his hand . Seeing this , he tried to move faster towards the door . PERSON reached him and stabbed him with the knife in the head . This happened in the doorway . PERSON NORP managed to stab him because he ( that is to say PERSON NORP ) was taller , although he ( that is to say PERSON ) had managed to a certain extent to push PERSON back with the table . He fell down on the porch . As he was lying on his side , facing the door and bleeding , he saw PERSON trying to stab him a second time with the same knife , again in the head . PERSON was still standing at a distance of QUANTITY away while he ( that is to say PERSON ) continued to use the table to defend himself . After PERSON NORP had tried to stab him for a second time , he heard a number of shots , but could not remember how many . He saw that the shots had hit PERSON in the legs . PERSON fell down , with his legs lying next to his own . PERSON then took out another knife . PERSON NORP must have thrown the first knife either in his direction or in the direction of those who were behind him , but he could not tell how far away the knife had been thrown . PERSON subsequently wanted to get up and stab him again , but then he heard other shots . PERSON was screaming loudly , but while the shots were being fired the others dragged him away from GPE NORP and transported him to the hospital .", "CARDINAL . Police officer GPE . \u2019s account was as follows . PERSON hid behind the wardrobe with a knife in his hand and made death threats when the QUANTITY police officers tried to approach . At that time he was standing with his rifle next to the porch windows . Then he heard PERSON screaming and saw the others come out of the house and PERSON , with a knife in his hand , run towards and reach PERSON . ( who had been the last to leave ) and stab him in the head . PERSON . squatted and started bleeding . With the same knife PERSON tried to stab PERSON . , who was at that time lying on the ground , CARDINAL more time . He fired a warning shot in the air but seeing that PERSON was trying to stab PERSON . again he fired at PERSON left leg , with the aim of neutralising him . PERSON NORP did not fall after his shot but stumbled back with a knife in his hand . One of the police officers at that moment managed to drag PERSON . away from PERSON , who then threw a knife at them and took out another knife to throw again . PERSON was still standing . He heard a number of other shots but could not tell who had fired them , how many there had been and at which parts of GPE GPE \u2019s body the shots had been fired . He did not fire any other shots apart from the above - mentioned CARDINAL . Then the other police officers managed to approach and disarm PERSON GPE , who was already on the ground .", "CARDINAL . Police officer ORG \u2019s account was as follows . Police officer PERSON . was the first to enter the house , holding a table as a shield , since PERSON was holding a knife by its blade and was threatening to throw it . He and the others following PERSON . entered the first room . PERSON retreated into the second room and barricaded the door with an armchair , which prevented them from entering the second room . PERSON refused to give up and would not allow them to advance , threatening them with a knife . They were forced to leave the house . While they were still on the porch , he PERSON heard the others saying \u201c He \u2019s coming \u201d . He turned around and saw that PERSON , having left the house , in the doorway stabbed PERSON . in the head with a knife . PERSON . immediately started bleeding . He had tried to defend himself with a table , but PERSON had managed to stretch his hand over it and stab PERSON . , who had fallen down . As far as ORG could recall , PERSON then fell ; after falling he threw the knife at them . Then PERSON took out another knife and wanted to stab PERSON . again . At that moment PERSON heard shots but did not see who was firing . Then they managed to handcuff PERSON NORP .", "CARDINAL . Police officer PERSON \u2019s account was as follows . Once the fire engine had started working , they broke down the door and entered the house . PERSON . was the first to enter DATE or rather they all entered together , with a small table in front of them for protection . At that moment the fire engine was spraying water at PERSON , who had barricaded himself in with a wardrobe and moved the wardrobe to protect himself from the water . PERSON had also placed an armchair between the CARDINAL rooms , so that they could not enter the second room . They tried to persuade him to throw down the knife , but he continued to threaten them . As PERSON was not coming out and was refusing to calm down , PERSON received an order to leave the house in order that an alternative plan could be devised . As the QUANTITY police officers were leaving , PERSON unexpectedly ran towards them , screaming loudly . PERSON could not see whether PERSON had a knife since he ( that is to say PERSON ) was facing the main entrance . He heard somebody outside say \u201c Careful , he \u2019s about to strike \u201d . He then jumped out of the house and over the porch into the yard . Before rolling away , he heard two shots and saw PERSON . lying in the porch on his back , facing the main entrance . Seyran NORP was squatting with a knife in his hand and was trying to stab PERSON . , who had already been injured . Thinking that the shots fired earlier had not touched PERSON and that , if he did not shoot , PERSON GPE would strike again and kill PERSON . , he took out his weapon , took aim at PERSON legs and fired QUANTITY shots at them . While shooting , he heard other shots and saw PERSON fall next to PERSON . He then saw CARDINAL knives in PERSON hands .", "CARDINAL . The investigator posed CARDINAL questions to each of the police officers . GPE was asked ( a ) whether it would have been possible to neutralise PERSON without the use of firearms ( answer : negative ) and ( b ) how many firearms had been used for that purpose ( CARDINAL ) . PERSON . was asked how much time had elapsed between their entering the house and the stabbing ( TIME ) . H.Gri . was asked who had been beside him at the time of the shooting ( police officer GPE ) and how many knives PERSON had had ( CARDINAL ) . ORG and PERSON were asked whether they had received an order to shoot before they had entered the house ( both : negative ) . PERSON was also asked ( a ) who had been beside him at the time of the shooting ( he could not remember ) and ( b ) to provide further details of the shooting incident . PERSON . , GPE . , ORG and PERSON were also asked whether they had noticed a grenade in PERSON hands or whether he had made threats with a grenade ( all CARDINAL : negative ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the investigator took statements from CARDINAL other police officers who had been present at the scene . Police officers PERSON . and PERSON , who had witnessed the shooting incident , were asked to provide accounts . Police officer PERSON submitted , inter alia , that neighbours and other villagers had been present and had watched the entire incident ; this was confirmed by PERSON . Police officer GPE submitted , inter alia , that there had been CARDINAL police officers at the scene . All the above - mentioned police officers submitted that the fire brigade and an ambulance had been called to the scene . PERSON further submitted that he had seen another police officer , PERSON , filming the incident but was not sure whether he had been filming during the shooting . ORG , when asked about the video , submitted that no material was available since he had been mistakenly filming without a tape in the camera , which he had discovered DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator of the PERSON regional prosecutor \u2019s office , decided to discontinue criminal case no . DATE in the light of the death of PERSON . By the same decision the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings against police officers GPE , PERSON , GPE and GPE . The wording of the decision first outlined the facts , as established by the investigation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , and concluded that the police officers had employed their service weapons in the light of the exigencies of the situation for the purpose of repelling a life - threatening attack on police officer PERSON . Thus , their actions had been lawful , as they had been undertaken in compliance with the requirements of sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant , together with An . A. and her CARDINAL other sisters , lodged a complaint with the PERSON regional prosecutor seeking to quash the part of the decision of DATE relating to the refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON regional prosecutor informed them by letter that there were no legal grounds for quashing the decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL since it had been taken on the basis of an accurate", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her CARDINAL sisters then lodged a similar complaint with ORG of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed them that there were no grounds for quashing the decision of DATE since , following a thorough and objective investigation , the actions of the police officers had been determined to have been lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE An . A. lodged a complaint in her capacity as a victim with the ORG against the decision of DATE , seeking to have invalidated the part of the decision concerning the refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers for killing her brother . In particular , she complained that , despite the fact that her brother had been deliberately killed by the police officers , no separate criminal proceedings had been instituted and no criminal investigation had been conducted into the fact of his killing . She also complained that the police officers had opened fire on GPE NORP in a situation where there had been no threat to life or limb for any of them . As to the finding of a grenade in PERSON house , An . A stated that this could not serve as justification for the police officers\u2019 actions , since it had been discovered only after the fatal incident had taken place , and her brother had never threatened the policemen that he would use it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG admitted the complaint for examination as having been lodged in compliance with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , relying on the facts , as established by the investigation , examined the complaint and decided to dismiss it , finding that the use of firearms by the police officers had been justified as they had opened fire to prevent , and protect themselves from , PERSON unlawful violent actions . It concluded that the police officers had acted in necessary defence , as provided for by LAW , and also in compliance with sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . ORG moreover held that there was no need to institute separate criminal proceedings concerning PERSON GPE \u2019s killing , since the investigation into that incident had been carried out within the framework of criminal proceedings instituted in relation to PERSON \u2019s unlawful actions . Separately , ORG found that the complaint against the refusal to institute criminal proceedings had been lodged outside the DATE time - limit prescribed by LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE An . A. lodged an appeal against the decision of ORG raising the same arguments as those contained in her original court complaint . She also alleged that she had lodged her complaint in compliance with the procedural rules since neither of the applicable Articles of the ORG , namely LAW and CARDINAL ( as in force at the material time ) , had provided any time - limit for lodging a complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the merits of the appeal and dismissed it , upholding the findings of ORG concerning the lawfulness of the police ORG actions . It then also examined the question of the compliance of An . PERSON \u2019s court complaint with the procedural rules and found that it had not been lodged in compliance with LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE An . A. lodged an appeal on points of law against the decision of ORG , raising the same arguments regarding both the admissibility and the merits of her court complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the appeal admissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the appeal . Turning to the question of compliance with domestic time - limits , it found that the appeal procedure pursued by An . A. was indeed governed by LAW , which at the material time had not prescribed any time - limits for contesting the prosecutor \u2019s refusal before the courts . However , the onemonth time - limit prescribed by LAW was applicable to her case . The appeal had only been lodged on DATE namely outside that DATE timelimit . Thus , both ORG and ORG had exceeded their temporal jurisdiction by examining the merits of An . A. \u2019s complaint . This in itself was sufficient grounds for rejecting the appeal ; however , ORG found it necessary \u2013 taking into account the fact that ( a ) both courts had examined the merits of the case and had reached findings on the merits , and ( b ) it was called upon to ensure uniform application of DATE to express a number of legal positions on the matter , which could provide guidance to lower courts in similar cases .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Cassation first examined the question of whether any criminal proceedings had been instituted and any investigation carried out into the killing of PERSON . Referring to Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , ORG concluded that it was impossible to answer that question unequivocally . In particular , a number of factors suggested that criminal case no . DATE had been instituted on account of the acts committed by PERSON rather than his killing . Firstly , the proceedings had been instituted only under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , in conjunction with LAW ( namely in respect of attempted murder of CARDINAL or more persons ) and therefore could not legally be characterised as applying to his killing . Secondly , the wording of the decision to discontinue the proceedings also contained a refusal to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers implicated in his shooting , which confirmed that no criminal proceedings had been instituted on account of that incident .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , a number of factors suggested that the proceedings instituted had also been based on the fact that he had been killed , and an investigation had been carried out in that connection . Thus , the descriptive part of the wording of the decision to institute proceedings had mentioned the fact that Seyran NORP had been taken to hospital and had died . Furthermore , PERSON sister , An . A. , had been granted victim status in the criminal case by decision of the investigator , moreover , that decision had stated that PERSON had been deprived of his life \u201c as a result of a crime \u201d . Lastly , certain investigative measures taken in the course of the criminal proceedings had been aimed at obtaining evidence concerning the circumstances of GPE NORP \u2019s death , including the inspections of the crime scene , of GPE GPE \u2019s body and of his clothes , the autopsy , the forensic examination of his clothes and the interviews with the police officers who had shot at GPE NORP or witnessed the shootings . This suggested that some investigation into his death had nevertheless been carried out . Having reached this conclusion , ORG decided in any event to examine the question of whether the investigation had been adequate .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Cassation firstly noted that there had been no eyewitnesses to the shooting , other than the police officers . However , not all the police officers who had witnessed the shooting had been questioned . In particular , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL officers who had been present at the time of the shooting , namely GPE and GPE , had not been questioned . Thus , the investigating authority had failed to secure all the evidence relating to the incident . As regards those officers who had been questioned , GPE . had been questioned DATE , ORG DATE and PERSON DATE after the incident . No measures had been taken in the meantime to isolate them from each other . While there was no evidence to suggest that the police officers had colluded with each other , the fact that no steps had been taken to minimise such risk constituted a significant shortcoming in the investigation . Furthermore , no adequate assessment had been made of the direction of the bullets fired at GPE NORP . In particular , no reasonable explanation had been determined by the investigation for the fact that CARDINAL bullets had been fired at GPE NORP from behind .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of those findings , ORG concluded that the investigation into the killing of PERSON had not been adequate . Nevertheless , ORG decided to dismiss the appeal on points of law on the ground that neither the ORG nor ORG had had temporal competence to examine the complaint against the decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL .
