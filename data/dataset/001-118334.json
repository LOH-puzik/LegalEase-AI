Following a remittal in DATE , on DATE ORG ( PERSON ) ruled in favour of the applicant . As regards the outstanding holiday pay , the court observed that company Z had not paid DATE pay due for DATE and DATE to any of its employees , as its alleged parent company had been encountering financial difficulties . The court , however , found these facts to be irrelevant to the outcome of the applicant \u2019s claim , as according to LAW and enterprise bargaining agreements in force at the company he had been entitled to holiday pay regardless of the level of his employer \u2019s profits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Okru\u017eni sud ) reversed the part of ORG judgment which concerned holiday pay and legal costs , while upholding the remainder . ORG based its refusal on the finding , disregarding applicable employment law , that company Z had not paid outstanding holiday pay to any of its employees and therefore that \u201c to accept the applicant \u2019s claim would mean that the applicant would be treated more favourably than his colleagues , who had not received payment of outstanding holiday pay from their employer either \u201d . No further recourse against this judgment was available to the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

However , ORG , which , following reforms to the judicial system had become the competent appeal court , overturned both judgments on DATE and DATE , respectively . In so doing , the appeal court found that the claimants had been entitled to their outstanding holiday pay by applicable domestic law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , finding that the reasons for judgment given by ORG in their cases were irrelevant and that it had erred in law in rendering the judgments .", "CARDINAL .
