He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ms I. GPE , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was employed as a mechanic and in DATE he had a nervous breakdown ( psykisk kollaps ) . On DATE he submitted an occupational injury report ( arbetsskadeanm\u00e4lan ) to ORG ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan , \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE in which he requested that his psychological problems be considered workrelated and thereby make him eligible for life annuity ( livr\u00e4nta ) . He claimed that his psychological problems had been caused by degrading treatment to which he had been subjected by his co - workers and his supervisor .", "In a decision on DATE , ORG ( PERSON , \u201c the Board \u201d ) decided not to accept the applicant \u2019s mental illness as a work injury and found that the applicant \u2019s personality was the primary cause of his problems . The applicant and his representative at the time had been present at a meeting with ORG , before ORG made its decision .", "The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , claiming that he had been subjected to degrading treatment at work . Through his legal representative he requested compensation under the DATE LAW ( lagen om arbetsskadef\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .

It found that he had not sufficiently proved that , from an objective point of view , he had been subjected to treatment that was considered injurious in the eyes of the law . The court did not question the applicant \u2019s subjective perception of the alleged circumstances , but there was not sufficient objective evidence to hold that the applicant \u2019s supervisor and colleagues had acted in an incorrect manner . During the proceedings before ORG no oral hearing was requested by the applicant , nor did the court hold one on its own initiative .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE . He requested leave to appeal and maintained his claim . He further requested that an oral hearing be held in his case so that he could explain , under oath , the treatment to which he had been subjected and so that CARDINAL of the witnesses , who had previously given written statements , could be heard before the court under oath .", "On DATE , the judge rapporteur at ORG drew up a memorandum stating that the applicant \u2019s legal representative had been informed over the phone that the court did not intend to hold an oral hearing before taking its decision regarding leave to appeal . The memorandum further stated that the applicant had been given a prolonged respite until DATE to submit additional documents .", "In a final submission to the court , received on DATE , the representative supplemented the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE ORG , which had access to ORG and ORG case - files , refused leave to appeal .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Regerings - r\u00e4tten ) . He stated that he had requested an oral hearing before ORG and that the purpose of the oral hearing had been presented .

No request was made for an oral hearing before ORG .", "On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "Domestic provisions of relevance in the present case are found in DATE Insurance Act ( lagen om arbetsskadef\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) and ORG ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen , ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL , \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The DATE LAW has been incorporated into Chapters CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Social insurance Code as of DATE .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the DATE LAW , the term \u201c work injury \u201d mainly refers to injuries resulting from accidents or other harmful factors at a person \u2019s workplace . Under the LAW , all gainfully employed persons working in GPE are insured against work injuries .", "For an injury to qualify as a work injury , a causal link must be established between the accident or harmful factor in the workplace and the insured person \u2019s health problems . At the relevant time , if it was clear that the insured person had been subjected to harmful factors at work , his or her medical problems were presumed to have been caused by the harmful factors unless there were substantially stronger grounds for a conclusion to the contrary ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW in its wording before DATE , which applied to the present case ) .", "Regarding mental and psychosomatic illnesses , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires ( govt . PERSON pp . DATE and CARDINAL ) emphasise that some factors that are connected to work or work conditions , and that may give rise to a disturbance to mental health , are not such that the harmful effect that may occur should fall under LAW . Thus , it is in the nature of things that mental health disturbance as a result of , inter alia , shutting down work places , lack of appreciation of work efforts and discomfort with work tasks or colleagues should not give rise to compensation .", "Section CARDINAL of the Administrative Court Procedure Act , as in force at the relevant time was worded as follows :", "\u201c The procedure shall be in writing .", "Where it may be assumed to be advantageous for the investigation or promote the expeditious determination of the case , the processing may include an oral hearing regarding certain issues .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "In a case concerning social insurance , leave to appeal is required for ORG to consider an appeal against a decision issued by ORG . Leave to appeal shall be granted if it is of importance for the guidance of the application of law that a superior court considers the appeal , if reason exists for amendment of ORG conclusion , or if there are otherwise extraordinary reasons to entertain the appeal .", "A decision of ORG not to grant leave to appeal may be appealed against to ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
