In DATE there was a riot in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , a social worker of FAC , reported to the prison governor , inter alia , the following facts . The applicant , after his conviction , shared a cell with CARDINAL other convict . Letters sent by the applicant were not opened . Letters sent to the applicant by ORG were opened by a prison officer in front of the applicant . Foreigners who did not speak NORP could not participate in the vocational training courses organised in PERSON . A programme for learning NORP had once been available in the prison library but was destroyed during the riot . However , it was the intention of the welfare office to replace it in due course . According to LAW , remand prisoners did not have the right to work . However , the applicant , after his conviction , started working as a cleaner . Almost immediately after his arrival at FAC the applicant started being treated by PERSON , a psychiatrist . He continued to participate in the awareness and self - help therapeutic programmes for the foreign prisoners of CARDINAL organisations , Drug Addicts Anonymous and CARDINAL . He was also individually treated by a psychologist who was a member of Drug Addicts Anonymous . After the applicant \u2019s arrival at FAC , his case was followed by the prison \u2019s welfare office . It was true that no distinctions were made between remand prisoners and convicts .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was transferred from GPE to ORG .

The evidence of the applicant and the CARDINAL witnesses who appeared before the delegates at FAC on DATE may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was admitted to ORG psychiatric hospital on DATE . Initially , he was detained in a single cell for DATE . He slept all the time due to medication . It was another prisoner who told him how long he had been there . When he woke up , he was moved to a cell with TIME QUANTITY \u201c very disturbed \u201d persons . They slept on mattresses on the floor . It was hot , but the windows were open . Occasionally , the door would open and they would be allowed out to go to the toilet or have a shower or walk in the yard . Meals were served in plastic containers on the floor . He stayed for DATE and nights in the second cell .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant was taken to the prison proper . He asked to be kept somewhere quiet and he was immediately placed in the segregation unit of the LOC wing . At first , the applicant did not know that he was in a segregation unit .", "CARDINAL . The cell was very small and high . It had CARDINAL doors and there were CARDINAL beds . One could hardly walk between them . During the entire period of his stay in the segregation unit he was detained with another person , Mr PERSON . There was CARDINAL window in the roof which did not open and which was so dirty that no light could pass through . There was just CARDINAL electric bulb which did not provide sufficient light for reading . There were no other windows apart from a peephole in CARDINAL of the CARDINAL doors , which could be opened . There was an NORP - type toilet in the cell . There was no screen or curtain separating the toilet from the rest of the cell . Sometimes the toilet would flush and sometimes not . There was CARDINAL shower in the unit , which contained CARDINAL cells with CARDINAL prisoners in each . There was no sink in the cell .", "CARDINAL . It was DATE when the applicant was placed in the segregation unit . It was very hot . During DATE the door of his cell would be open . The segregation unit was unsupervised and \u201c anything could happen \u201d . However , the applicant had not been ill - treated by any particular person . There were CARDINAL small high - walled yards , \u201c CARDINAL steps forward , CARDINAL steps back \u201d . At TIME the door of his cell would be locked . As there was no ventilation the cell became so hot that the applicant would wake up drenched . In order to have water in his cell , the applicant would fill a bottle from the tap near the shower and sometimes from the toilet flush .", "CARDINAL . After DATE in the segregation unit , the applicant was offered the possibility of going to the ordinary cells in the LOC wing . However , he had to turn this offer down because the ORG wing was for drug addicts and \u201c he wanted to stay away from drugs \u201d . There were no drug addicts in the segregation unit .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant did not remember exactly when he left the segregation unit \u2013 perhaps CARDINAL or DATE , at DATE or DATE . He was moved to the Alpha wing where mainly economic offenders were kept . Mr PERSON was moved with him and they continued to share the same cell .", "CARDINAL . Alpha was the best wing in the prison . However , it was still dirty and overcrowded . There were CARDINAL beds in each cell : CARDINAL bunk beds , CARDINAL on top of the other , and a third bed . Usually , there were CARDINAL prisoners in each cell . There was a sink and an NORP - type toilet . There was a plastic screen on CARDINAL side of the toilet , part of which was broken . Although one could not see the inmate using the toilet , one could smell and hear him . The cell had a window . Sometimes there was a table and a chair in the cell .", "CARDINAL . The doors of the cells were locked TIME and TIME This schedule differed by TIME DATE . The cells were very noisy due to fellow inmates\u2019 television and radio sets . The prisoners had no control over the light switches . In DATE , the cells were very cold as they were heated for TIME a day . Sometimes the applicant had to stay in bed under his blankets to keep warm . After the riot , several windows were broken and it was freezing in the prison . In DATE , the cells were unbearably hot , as there was no through - draught when the doors were shut . Sometimes the applicant had to wait until DATE in the morning before he could fall asleep . When the door of the cell was open , the situation improved but there was no ventilation in the wing in general . Occasionally , there were problems with the plumbing and the toilet would not always flush .", "CARDINAL . At CARDINAL point , when the applicant was sharing his cell with CARDINAL other prisoner , CARDINAL NORP inmates were brought in for TIME . They slept on CARDINAL mattresses on the floor .", "CARDINAL . The only thing the applicant was ever given were blankets . He was not given any clothes , sheets , pillows , toiletries ( including soap ) or toilet paper . He had to buy toiletries and toilet paper from the canteen . Occasionally he did not have any money and had to ask other prisoners . The social services and certain charitable organisations would also help . However , there were times when he was left with no toilet paper , in particular when he had to use the toilet often , due to problems with his stomach . On these occasions , in order to keep clean , he had to use water from the NORP - type toilet . Despite all that , he managed \u201c to keep himself clean \u201d . Eventually , he managed to get hold of sheets and a pillow , which he inherited from other prisoners . However , it took him a long time , perhaps DATE .", "CARDINAL . There were CARDINAL showers DATE described by the applicant as pipes \u2013 in the basement for the CARDINAL to CARDINAL prisoners held in the wing . There was hot water for TIME a day or perhaps longer . There were no curtains and no windows . After the riot there was no hot water . In DATE , the showers were used by the cats as toilets .", "CARDINAL . He had to wash his clothes himself and this was made difficult because of the shortage of hot water . He would dry his clothes by hanging them on the bars of his cell window .", "CARDINAL . Food was served in such a manner that the cats could play around with it . Before entering prison he had been a NORP but he had to change his eating habits as there were no NORP menus in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u201c lived in a vacuum \u201d . He could not communicate with the prison staff , who did not speak LANGUAGE . The social worker knew LANGUAGE . In order to see her , he had to make a request . He would see the social worker CARDINAL times a week , usually for TIME . TIME was the maximum .", "CARDINAL . There were no vocational activities , courses or library .", "CARDINAL . At first , the applicant was allowed CARDINAL telephone call a week , in the TIME . However , the social worker subsequently arranged for him to be able to use the telephone in TIME .", "CARDINAL . The witness was the governor of ORG DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The witness did not know of any improvements that had been made in the ORG wing since the applicant \u2019s transfer from FAC . There had been some improvements made to the segregation unit . Now , there were screens separating the toilets from the rest of the cell in the segregation unit , but he did not want to contradict the applicant in this regard . It was possible that there had been no screen in his cell . There were sinks in the cells of the segregation unit .", "CARDINAL . It was as hot in the segregation unit as in the rest of the prison . In DATE it could be hot . During DATE , there was central heating .", "CARDINAL . The prison administration provided inmates with pillows . However , it was possible that the applicant did not receive any because at times there were shortages . There was a problem with sheets , especially for foreign prisoners . The latter could get sheets from the welfare office , which had a stock built up from donations or acquisitions through grants from ORG . The prison administration did not provide prisoners with toiletries . Such items were provided by charitable organisations via the welfare office . Toilet paper could be obtained from the welfare office or another prisoner or the chief warden . It was more difficult to find sheets than toilet paper .", "CARDINAL . Food was not served in an unhygienic manner . While it was being transported , the pan was QUANTITY from the floor , although the witness was not PERCENT sure about that .", "CARDINAL . It was possible that the applicant had slept in the cell with CARDINAL other prisoners . Usually , each prisoner had his own bed . It was very rare that he did not . However , accommodating CARDINAL prisoners in a cell had been known to happen .", "CARDINAL . There was no problem with the showers . However , those who had to wash their clothes in prison were faced with problems .", "CARDINAL . Prisoners communicated with the social workers whom they could see upon request either on DATE after . Those who did not speak NORP could face problems . However , in the witness \u2019s experience , they managed to adapt . There was always somebody , a member of staff or another prisoner , who could speak LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL . All announcements and notices were in NORP . Foreign prisoners were informed of their rights orally upon arrival . However , this was not done systematically . An information pamphlet in LANGUAGE entitled \u201c Everyday life in the prison establishment \u201d was distributed to newcomers in DATE but the witness did not remember whether this was before or after the applicant had left FAC .", "CARDINAL . The witness was the social worker of the LOC wing of FAC . She met the applicant there and followed his case throughout his stay in prison .", "CARDINAL . On his arrival in FAC proper ( after his detention in the ORG psychiatric hospital ) , the applicant was placed in the segregation unit . This had been decided by the prison governor and the chief warden as a result of his condition \u2013 he had withdrawal symptoms . The applicant did not have advance knowledge of the conditions in the segregation unit . Shortly afterwards , the applicant complained of the conditions there and the witness arranged for him to meet the governor , PERSON . The latter gave instructions for the applicant to be moved to another wing . However , this would have been the ORG wing , which was for drug addicts . The applicant was aware of this . He had found out through his contacts with other inmates . He refused to go there . He considered that staying in the segregation unit would help him stay away from drugs . The witness would not confirm that there were drugs in the ORG wing . However , she accepted that \u201c the LOC wing was problematic for someone who wanted to free himself from drugs \u201d . In her view , the segregation unit was not appropriate for prisoners . However , the applicant , who was suffering from withdrawal symptoms , could not be moved to the ORG wing immediately . This wing was reserved for persons convicted of economic offences and other prisoners whose conduct had been good . So the applicant had a choice between the segregation unit and the LOC wing . The witness did not advise the applicant to choose one or the other because she did not want to influence what she regarded as a purely personal choice . The applicant chose to remain in the segregation unit . He was subsequently moved to the ORG wing , together with all the inmates of the segregation unit , when it was decided to accommodate in the segregation unit prisoners who were serving disciplinary terms .", "CARDINAL . The witness would communicate with the applicant in LANGUAGE . The applicant did not speak NORP and this exacerbated his adaptation problems at the beginning , since most of the prison staff did not speak LANGUAGE . However , several of the NORP prisoners spoke some elementary LANGUAGE . Gradually , the applicant managed , through his personal efforts , to establish a rudimentary level of communication with the prison staff in NORP . There were no information notices in LANGUAGE . The pamphlet to which PERSON PERSON referred was distributed in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The welfare office had a storage room in the prison with toilet paper , razors , detergent , soap , etc . These were funded by ORG and charitable organisations . Destitute prisoners could get supplies from this storage room once a week . However , during DATE there were often shortages . The welfare office did not provide prisoners with sheets and blankets . These were provided to newcomers by the prison administration , but it was impossible to replace them . The witness did not know whether the applicant had received any sheets . The applicant would receive clothes , toiletries and toilet paper from the welfare office in so far as this was possible , given the restrictions with which it was faced . In the witness \u2019s view , given the extended period of the applicant \u2019s detention in GPE , it was possible that he had been confronted with shortages of toiletries and toilet paper . The applicant had also been given assistance by charitable organisations with which the witness had put him in touch .", "CARDINAL . The witness was an inmate of FAC . He spent DATE in the same cell as the applicant , DATE in the segregation unit of the LOC wing and DATE in the Alpha wing . The witness was in the segregation unit of his own free will because he was a new prisoner and wanted some peace and quiet . They were both moved to the ORG wing , probably when the prison administration decided to accommodate in the segregation unit prisoners who were serving disciplinary terms .", "CARDINAL . The segregation unit of the LOC wing contained CARDINAL cells , each occupied by CARDINAL prisoners . While in the segregation unit , the witness shared his cell with the applicant and nobody else . There were CARDINAL beds with mattresses and blankets . They were not given sheets or pillows . The toilet had no curtain .", "CARDINAL . While he was in the segregation unit the applicant would often complain . As it was very hot and he had respiratory problems , he would wake up at TIME coughing . He would bang on the door because he could not breathe .", "CARDINAL . There were usually CARDINAL prisoners in the cells in the ORG wing . The witness could not remember CARDINAL prisoners in his cell . He remembered CARDINAL NORP inmate sleeping in their cell but not CARDINAL . He did not remember anybody sleeping on the floor . The toilet screen was always there and was not broken . The witness kept a cat in the cell .", "CARDINAL . As regards the conditions of detention in FAC in general the witness stated the following . The food was bad and risked being contaminated by cats . It was easy to take a shower and one did not have to queue . However , there was not enough water and no curtains . He spoke to the applicant in LANGUAGE and sometimes in NORP . He would also act as a mediator for him . The prison administration would only provide soap . The welfare office would sometimes hand out certain things , but it was difficult . The witness would buy toiletries and toilet paper himself . The applicant would buy them whenever he had money . He would also ask the witness for toothpaste and toilet paper , which the witness would give him . Sometimes it was possible to find a pillow .", "CARDINAL . The delegates of the Commission visited the segregation unit of the LOC wing where the applicant had been detained in cell no . CARDINAL . The description given by the applicant was on the whole accurate . All the cells were approximately the same size . Cell no . CARDINAL measured QUANTITY Given that there was practically no window , the cell was claustrophobic . At the time of the delegates\u2019 visit , the prisoners were locked in their cells . Cells where CARDINAL persons were held were very cramped . Prisoners were virtually confined to their beds . There was no screen separating the toilet from the rest of the cell . The toilet was adjacent to the beds . Some prisoners had put up curtains themselves . The entire unit was very hot . Due to the lack of ventilation , the cells were unbearably hot , \u201c like ovens \u201d . The air was stale and a stench came out of the cells . The cells were all in a state of disrepair and they were very dirty . Some prisoners complained about rats in the cells . There was no sink in cell no . CARDINAL . There was a tap . According to the applicant , who accompanied the delegates during their inspection , the tap had recently been installed . On the doors of some cells there were signs saying \u201c WC \u201d . When asked , the prisoners said that the signs would be put up during DATE when the cell doors were not locked to ensure that the cell - mate did not enter the cell while the toilet was being used . The applicant \u2019s cell could be compared to a medieval oubliette . The general atmosphere was repulsive .", "CARDINAL . The delegates also visited a cell on the third floor of the Alpha wing where the applicant had been detained . According to the chief warden of FAC , who accompanied the delegates during their inspection , Mr PERSON was still detained in this cell . The cell measured CARDINAL by QUANTITY The description by the applicant was again accurate , except that the toilet screen was not in disrepair . The cell had windows of an adequate size .", "CARDINAL . The delegates saw the shower area in the basement . It was reasonably clean , although the applicant claimed that during his time it had been much dirtier . Most shower cubicles had curtains . However , some did not .", "CARDINAL . In the prison storage room , there were small bags containing toilet paper and toiletries that were given to new prisoners . However , the delegates were told that these bags had arrived only very recently . There were no sheets . The inmate in charge claimed that they had all been distributed or that they were at the laundry . There was a cupboard which contained mainly soap .", "CARDINAL . The welfare office storage room was closed at the time . There was a sign indicating that each wing was served once DATE . It was opened at the ORG request . It contained a lot of used clothes . The delegates were shown toilet paper and CARDINAL sheet . There was a book showing that prisoners came to the room and were provided with various items , such as toiletries , shoes , etc .", "CARDINAL . The kitchen was quite spacious and clean . The trolleys on which food was transported , however , did not correspond to Mr PERSON \u2019s description . They were rather low .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL corner of a corridor outside the kitchen a cat had defecated . The delegates also had the opportunity of seeing the inmates queuing to use the telephones . The queues were rather long .", "CARDINAL . According to the chief warden , no prisoners\u2019 location charts dating from the applicant \u2019s detention in ORG had been kept . Nor were there books showing the movement of prisoners from one cell to another . The only books that had been kept indicated the last cell in which each prisoner had been kept before leaving FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG published a report following its visit to GPE in DATE [ FAC was also visited by the ORG in DATE ] which contains the following findings and recommendations concerning PERSON .", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL ... PERSON for men was built to accommodate CARDINAL prisoners in CARDINAL separate blocks , each having CARDINAL cells on CARDINAL floors . On DATE of the delegation \u2019s visit , the establishment was holding CARDINAL prisoners , CARDINAL on remand and the remainder sentenced . The total prison staff complement was CARDINAL , of which CARDINAL were prison officers . Perimeter security was the responsibility of armed police .", "...", "CARDINAL . In the following paragraphs , the ORG shall make a number of specific recommendations concerning the prison establishments visited by its delegation . However , it wishes to emphasise at the outset that the act of depriving someone of his liberty brings with it the responsibility for the ORG to detain him under conditions which respect the inherent dignity of the human person . The facts found during the course of the ORG \u2019s visit demonstrate that as a consequence of the present level of overcrowding in prisons , the NORP authorities are not in a position to fulfil that responsibility vis - \u00e0 - vis many prisoners .", "The ORG therefore recommends that a very high priority be given to measures to reduce overcrowding in the NORP prison system .", "...", "CARDINAL . As already indicated ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL ) , at the time of the delegation \u2019s visit to FAC for men the number of inmates amounted to CARDINAL times the establishment \u2019s official capacity . A standard cell measured QUANTITY and was equipped inter alia with a screened NORP - type toilet and a hand - basin . Originally designed for individual occupancy , the cells are just about large enough for CARDINAL prisoners ; with CARDINAL , conditions become very cramped . In practice , only a handful of prisoners had their own cells ; the majority of the cells were accommodating CARDINAL or CARDINAL prisoners , and a number were accommodating CARDINAL . The level of overcrowding was somewhat lower in A wing ( CARDINAL prisoners ) than in B , C and D wings ( each of which were accommodating CARDINAL or more inmates ) .", "The prisoner distribution chart indicated that CARDINAL cells ( one in C wing and CARDINAL in D wing ) were holding CARDINAL prisoners . The delegation visited the relevant cell in C wing , in which it found CARDINAL prisoners of NORP origin ; they claimed to have been held under such conditions for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Inevitably , the high level of overcrowding had extremely negative repercussions upon the conditions of detention : living space was very poor , ventilation inadequate , and cell cleanliness and hygiene wanting . In many cells prisoners were to all intents and purposes confined to their beds , there being no room for other furniture . In some of the most over crowded cells , there were more prisoners than beds . Further , the toilet and washing facilities in certain cells were in need of repair .", "Despite the overcrowding , prisoners apparently did have ready access to the shower facilities located in the basement of each wing . However , some of the shower cubicles were in a poor state of repair and decoration .", "CARDINAL . NORP The negative aspects of the overcrowding were mitigated to some extent by reasonable out - of - cell time . TIME QUANTITY to sunset , inmates were allowed to circulate freely and associate with other prisoners within their detention wing and its courtyard ; the wing courtyards were of a good size . It must be stressed , however , that the free circulation of prisoners in their detention wings could have undesirable effects in the absence of proper control by prison staff ; with the manning levels at the time of the delegation \u2019s visit ( CARDINAL to CARDINAL prison staff on duty during DATE in a wing accommodating CARDINAL prisoners ) , it is difficult to see how such control could be guaranteed ( cf . also paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Activities in any meaningful sense of the term were scarce . There were CARDINAL work places ( i.e. CARDINAL work place for CARDINAL prisoners ) , practically all in the area of general services ( kitchen , laundry , cleaning , maintenance , stores , etc . ) ; no workshops were in operation . However , a printing and bookbinding vocational training centre , with places for CARDINAL prisoners , was due to open in DATE . The shortage of work places was particularly resented by many sentenced prisoners , as it prevented them from taking advantage of the system of earning remission through work .", "No educational classes were available and the prison library was both small and ill - equipped . Further , there was no prison gymnasium and , as far as the delegation could ascertain , no organised sporting activities . However , the exercise yards were sufficiently large for certain games ( e.g. volleyball ) , and arrangements were in hand to provide a separate weight - training area in each of the yards ( at the time of the visit , a few prisoners did weight training in the wing basements ) .", "To sum up , the vast majority of prisoners at FAC for men ( including a majority of the sentenced prisoners ) were offered no work or educational activities , and possibilities for sport were very limited . Most prisoners spent DATE walking around their detention wing or courtyard , talking with fellow prisoners , or watching television in their cell . Such a monotonous and purposeless existence is quite inconsistent with the objective of social rehabilitation set out in the Greek Code of basic rules for the treatment of prisoners ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards material conditions of detention at FAC for men , the ORG recommends :", "\u2013 that immediate steps be taken to ensure that CARDINAL prisoners are held per cell ;", "\u2013 that serious efforts be made to reduce as soon as possible the occupancy rate to CARDINAL prisoners per cell ( Naturally , the long - term objective should be to have CARDINAL prisoner per cell , save for specific situations when it is not appropriate for a prisoner to be left alone ) ;", "\u2013 that every prisoner be provided with his own bed and mattress ;", "\u2013 that shower cubicles , toilets and washing facilities be restored to a good state of repair and maintained in a hygienic condition .", "As regards out - of - cell activities , the ORG recommends :", "\u2013 that current efforts to augment the number of work and vocational training places be intensified ;", "\u2013 that a thorough examination of the means of improving the prison \u2019s activity programmes in general ( including education , sport and recreational activities ) be undertaken without delay and that fuller programmes be progressively introduced as overcrowding is brought down .", "...", "CARDINAL . NORP The segregation unit at ORG consisted of CARDINAL groups of CARDINAL cells , all of which were apparently used for both disciplinary confinement and other segregation purposes . The cells measured QUANTITY ; they were equipped with a bed , but no other furniture ( e.g. table or chair ) . There was adequate ventilation and artificial lighting ; however , access to natural light was , at best , mediocre . Each cell possessed an NORP toilet , and some cells had a wash basin . The adjacent exercise yards measured QUANTITY . The whole unit required to be DATE and was being DATE redecorated .", "CARDINAL . No - one was being confined as a punishment at the time of the delegation \u2019s visit . A number of transvestite prisoners had been held in the unit for DATE at their own request . Other prisoners were being held in the unit involuntarily , presumably under LAW or CARDINAL of the LAW ( the absence of a segregation unit register made it difficult to ascertain the precise grounds ) ; certain of them appeared to have psychological or psychiatric problems .", "The prisoners were allowed to move freely within the unit and exercise areas during much of DATE , and they had TV sets and other personal possessions in their cells ( though staff indicated that a prisoner undergoing disciplinary confinement would remain in his cell and would not be allowed personal possessions ) .", "CARDINAL . The conditions of detention in this segregation unit are on the whole acceptable for prisoners undergoing the disciplinary sanction of confinement in a special cell . However , the ORG considers that it would be desirable for the cells accommodating such prisoners to be fitted with a table and chair , if necessary fixed to the floor .", "The ORG also recommends that all prisoners , including those confined to a special cell as a punishment , be allowed TIME of exercise in the open air everyday .", "CARDINAL . Conditions of detention in the unit are far less suitable for prisoners subject to segregation for non - disciplinary reasons , in particular if that measure is applied for a lengthy period .", "As regards more particularly prisoners who are segregated because of personality disorders and/or for their own protection , the ORG invites the NORP authorities to explore the possibility of creating special units organised along community lines .", "The unit is a totally unsuitable place in which to accommodate someone in need of psychiatric care . Neither the material environment nor the staff ( ordinary prison officers ) are appropriate . The ORG recommends that no such prisoner be placed in the unit . If , exceptionally , prisoners who are emotionally or psychologically disturbed have to be held temporarily in the segregation unit , they should be kept under close observation .", "Further , the ORG recommends :", "\u2013 that the cells in the unit used to accommodate prisoners segregated for a non - disciplinary reason be equipped in the same way as an ordinary prison cell ;", "\u2013 that the respective regimes applicable , on the one hand , to persons undergoing disciplinary confinement and , on the other hand , to persons held in the segregation unit for other reasons , be expressly laid down . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
