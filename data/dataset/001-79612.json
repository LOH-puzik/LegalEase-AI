With regard to the order to expel the applicant and his cousin , the majority of CARDINAL judges held as follows :", "[ The applicant \u2019s cousin ] was born in GPE , whereas [ the applicant ] arrived as a threeyearold . They have spent their youth and had their schooling in this country where also their parents and siblings live . Thus , they have a strong connection with the NORP society and to people living here . At the same time , however , they have a [ significant ] connection with GPE and NORP culture . They speak NORP and DATE they have visited GPE where they have a big family . Both have been previously convicted , and have now been sentenced to longer prison terms , inter alia , for manslaughter , attempted robbery and aggravated assault . Having taken all considerations into account , in our view neither the elements mentioned in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) nor LAW speak decisively against [ their ] expulsion . Accordingly , we vote [ for their expulsion ] .", "The minority of CARDINAL judge held as follows :", "In my view , when taking all the elements mentioned in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW into account , the connection which the applicant and [ his cousin ] have with GPE and NORP culture , is not of such an extent and character that it has decisive weight when compared to their strong connection to the NORP society and people living here . In my opinion , the latter speaks significantly against expelling the applicant and his cousin from GPE . Accordingly , notwithstanding the serious crimes committed , I vote [ against their expulsion ] .", "The relevant provision of LAW ( PERSON ) applicable at the time read as follows :", "\u201c An alien who has lawfully stayed in GPE for more than DATE , and an alien issued with a residence permit under sections DATE may be expelled only if :", "( i ) the alien is sentenced to minimum DATE imprisonment or other criminal sanction involving or allowing deprivation of liberty in respect of an offence that would have resulted in a punishment of this duration .", "...", "( vi ) the alien is sentenced , pursuant to ...
