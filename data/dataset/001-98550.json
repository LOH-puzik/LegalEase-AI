In conclusion the court stated as follows :", "\u201c The argument that [ the applicant 's ] absence in court was excusable because he had been unable to inform the court in a timely fashion of the valid reasons for his absence can not be accepted as a sole ground for quashing the judgment since the default judgment may only be quashed if both of the above - mentioned conditions have been met .
