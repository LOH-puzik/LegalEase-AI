LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) took away the disciplinary jurisdiction of ORG , allocating it to prison Governors . It also introduced a new framework for determining the period of a sentence which would be served in custody .

In its place , a new regime was created which distinguished between those prisoners sentenced to less or more than four years\u2019 imprisonment ( short and long - term prisoners , respectively ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) concerned a short - term prisoner \u2019s detention beyond the statutory release date because of an erroneous calculation of the release date . ORG found detention beyond that statutory release date to be unlawful and awarded damages for false imprisonment . Lord Justice PERSON noted that , pursuant to section DATE of the CARDINAL Act , DATE could be added onto the core period foreseen by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) so that the date therein envisaged was not absolute , but was DATE that could be affected by decisions made by the prison Governor under section CARDINAL .

Nevertheless , the prisoner is entitled to be released immediately the sentence has been completed . The method of calculating the date of release depends on statutory provisions which must be applied correctly , that is , correctly in law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) later rejected the appeal and confirmed the finding of false imprisonment and the award of damages .", "CARDINAL . In the case of NORP v. the Secretary of ORG for ORG ex parte PERSON , PERSON and GPE ( judgment of ORG of DATE ) , the appellants argued that LAW should apply to prison disciplinary proceedings referring , inter alia , to the changes brought about by LAW .

Section CARDINAL merely gives their case its proper perspective . The awards of DATE to be served by each of the appellants did not have the effect of adding to their sentence . It was not a fresh sentence of imprisonment . Their effect was to postpone the appellant \u2019s release on licence . The awards clearly had a practical effect so far as the appellants were concerned and that practical effect was to postpone their release . But there was no question of their sentence being increased as a matter of law . DATE could not be imposed so that they extended the actual sentence , which the appellants were serving , and the sentence passed by the court was the justification for the appellant \u2019s detention for the purposes of Article CARDINAL ) ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment went on to apply \u201c the PERSON criteria \u201d ( PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . It noted that the domestic categorisation of the relevant offences was not criminal but disciplinary . It was held , inter alia , that LAW did not apply to proceedings concerning a penalty of DATE for a charge of administering a controlled drug to himself or failing to prevent the administration of a controlled drug by another person contrary to LAW ) of the Prison Rules DATE . It was found that the offence of which the prisoner was found guilty did not precisely replicate any offence contrary to the criminal law and that \u201c the power of punishment \u201d was not disproportionate for a disciplinary offence although it was considered close to the borderline .", "CARDINAL . This document entitled \u201c ORG and ORG on the use of Additional Days \u201d provided guidance on the implications of LAW DATE for the conduct of adjudications and the imposition of punishments , particularly the punishment of DATE . Insofar as relevant , it provided as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Disciplinary proceedings in prisons require swift hearings and a speedy process to maintain discipline and order . They are not adversarial and the nature of the decision is an administrative public law decision rather than CARDINAL which resolves a dispute between CARDINAL parties . Domestic LANGUAGE law has distinguished prison disciplinary proceedings from criminal proceedings when deciding the procedural standards necessary for fairness . PERSON case law confirms this view .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the fact that the ORG will not in general apply to disciplinary proceedings does not mean that there is not , in theory , a risk it could apply in certain circumstances . ...", "CARDINAL . The imposition of DATE is generally the heaviest of the range of punishments available to adjudicators and should be used accordingly , in targeted fashion . It is not possible to give an exhaustive list of the types of offence where DATE might be appropriate ; much will depend upon the circumstances of the individual case . The following , however , are examples where DATE may be particularly appropriate following a finding of guilt at adjudication .", "( a ) Cases which would have been referred to the police but for the wishes of the victim .", "( b ) Serious assaults and assaults on staff .", "( c ) Escapes , attempted escapes and absconds .", "( d ) ORG offences , particularly involving Class A drugs .", "( e ) Concerted or persistent acts of indiscipline .", "CARDINAL . Where DATE are imposed , the number of DATE imposed must be proportionate to the aim of securing good order and discipline in the prison . In making this decision , the Governor will consider the same factors as those set out in paragraph CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Adjudicators should be particularly careful before imposing a large number of DATE . Overall , it should be extremely rare for punishments of DATE to be made . As a guide , in DATE , PERCENT of punishments of DATE were for DATE .", "CARDINAL . For more serious cases , adjudicators must ensure that they have fully considered the alternative of referring the matter to police ( see section CARDINAL of ORG ) . Only if this is not possible in the circumstances or there are very good reasons where a disciplinary punishment is more appropriate ( for example if the victim objects to the involvement of the police ) should adjudicators use the disciplinary procedure instead . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Prison Act DATE provides :", "\u201c Rules made under this section shall make provision for ensuring that a person who is charged with any offence under the rules shall be given a proper opportunity of presenting his case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The above provision is implemented through Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Prison Rules :", "\u201c At an inquiry into a charge against a prisoner , he shall be given a full opportunity of hearing what is alleged against him and of presenting his own case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The courts have interpreted Rule CARDINAL ) as conferring a power on the Governor to grant , or not , to a prisoner legal representation at an adjudication hearing . In R v. the Home Secretary ex parte GPE and Others ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL QB CARDINAL ) , ORG pointed out that there is no right to legal representation for prison adjudications and that its grant in a particular case should be determined by reference to certain factors . Those factors were stated to include the seriousness of the charge and of the potential penalty ; whether any points of law are likely to arise ; the capacity of the particular prisoner to present his own case ; procedural difficulties ; the need of the prison authorities for reasonable speed in making their adjudications ; and the need for fairness as between prisoners and as between prisoners and prison officers .", "CARDINAL . ORG endorsed the factors outlined in the aforementioned GPE judgment in the above - cited case of ORG and PERSON v. ORG . FAC found it difficult to imagine that \u201c the rules of natural justice would ever require legal representation before the Governor \u201d . Lord PERSON considered that :", "\u201c ... it is easy to envisage circumstances in which the rules of natural justice do not call for representation , even though the disciplinary charge relates to a matter which constitutes in law a crime , as may well happen in the case of a simple assault where no question of law arises , and where the prisoner charged is capable of presenting his own case . To hold otherwise would result in wholly unnecessary delays in many cases , to the detriment of all concerned including the prisoner charged , and to a wholly unnecessary waste of time and money , contrary to public interest . Indeed to hold otherwise would not only cause injustice to prisoners : it would also lead to an adventitious distinction being drawn between disciplinary offences which happen also to be crimes and those which happen not to be so , for the punishments liable to be imposed do not depend on any such distinction . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
