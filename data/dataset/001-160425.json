According to the order , the father \u2019s right to have contact with the second applicant , as specified in the order of CARDINAL DATE , had been considerably affected by the strained relationship between him and the first applicant .

On an unspecified date , the father requested that the Centre review the level of contact with the second applicant . The first applicant failed to appear at FAC to discuss the father \u2019s request , notwithstanding that the ORG invited her to do so at CARDINAL occasions . On DATE the ORG made an order specifying that the father should meet his daughter DATE ( from TIME ) .

Subsequent to the CARDINAL judgments against her of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) , on DATE , the public prosecutor brought criminal charges against the first applicant . She was accused of failing to allow the meeting scheduled for DATE to take place , as required by the ORG \u2019s orders of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In submissions of DATE , the first applicant denied the charge , arguing that she had never been served with the ORG \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE . In this connection , she maintained that she had received another order from the ORG dated DATE . She also expressed concerns about the fairness of the upcoming trial , given her NORP nationality . She further applied for the removal of Judge PERSON , should he be assigned to decide the case . On DATE her application was dismissed by \u201c a judge replacing the president \u201d of the first - instance court . In submissions of DATE to the first - instance court , the first applicant repeated her arguments and explained that she had sought Judge PERSON \u2019s removal because he had convicted her in the previous criminal cases brought against her . She also maintained that he had allegedly solicited sexual favours from her . Her criminal complaint on the latter subject had allegedly been rejected by the same public prosecutor who had indicted her in the impugned proceedings . She also alleged that the judge who had replaced the president of the first - instance court , and who had dismissed her application for the removal of Judge PERSON , was a relative of hers who , in discussions with her , had expressed disagreement with a decision she had made to study in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant decided not to testify at the hearing held on DATE . The first - instance court heard the father , who stated that for reasons unknown to him he had not seen his daughter at any of the scheduled meetings since DATE . A representative of the ORG stated that the first applicant had not complied with its orders of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , notwithstanding the fact that she had been informed of the consequences of non - compliance . She confirmed that the first applicant had been served with all the relevant orders the ORG had made . In a judgment of DATE first - instance court , presided over by Judge PERSON , found the first applicant guilty and sentenced DATE in prison . In doing so , it relied on the oral and documentary evidence admitted at the trial , including the ORG \u2019s orders of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , which had provided explicitly for the need of the child to \u201c strengthen the emotional bond with the [ father ] and to protect [ her ] right to have contact with [ him ] \u201d as being \u201c in [ the child \u2019s ] absolute interest \u201d . The court established that the first applicant had not complied with these orders notwithstanding that she had been alerted about the consequences for non - compliance . She had not allowed the father to see his daughter on several occasions before and after DATE , the date specified in the enforcement order of CARDINAL DATE . The court further stated that it could not assess the first applicant \u2019s defence due to the fact that she had remained silent at the trial and provided no arguments regarding the incident . Lastly , it stated that :", "\u201c In assessing the severity of the sentence , the court took into consideration all relevant circumstances ( aggravating and mitigating factors ) ... in particular , the gravity of the charges and concrete consequences , the manner in which the crime had been committed , the fact that [ the first applicant ] had already been convicted of the same offence on DATE [ judgment K.br.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] and CARDINAL DATE [ judgment K.br.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] and [ sentenced to an alternative penalty - suspended prison term ] .

Lastly , it endorsed the reasons of the first - instance court regarding her custodial sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied to ORG for an extraordinary review of the final judgment , reiterating the arguments she had raised in her appeal . On DATE ORG dismissed her application , finding that the facts , as based on the evidence admitted at the trial , had been correctly established by the lower courts . In this connection , the lower courts had correctly applied the procedural rules and based their judgments on evidence admitted at the trial . Lastly , the court endorsed the reasons given by the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was ordered to present herself at prison on DATE . On DATE the first - instance court postponed the execution of the sentence because the second applicant was ill and a new date was set for DATE .

On DATE , the date when the first applicant started serving the sentence , the ORG gave the father , of its own motion and on the basis of LAW ) of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) , temporary custody of the second applicant pending the conclusion of custody proceedings which he had initiated in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to the order , the first applicant had not allowed the second applicant to have any contact with the father at any of the scheduled meetings since DATE . After that date , the applicants had gone into hiding , despite the second applicant \u2019s poor health , which required continuous medical supervision . The order further referred to the first applicant \u2019s incarceration . The order did not provide for any contact rights for the first applicant in respect of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant sought permission from the FAC to see the second applicant . According to the Government , the ORG invited her to an interview upon her release from prison . However , it appears that she did not receive the invitation and , accordingly , failed to appear .", "CARDINAL . According to the first applicant , on DATE a lawyer acting on her behalf contacted the ORG to find out the whereabouts of her daughter and it was allegedly on that occasion that she was given the ORG \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The lawyer allegedly requested the Centre to decide the contact arrangements between the first and second applicants , which the ORG refused to do , as under the law such orders were only made after both parents had been interviewed by the ORG \u2019s welfare officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant again requested that the ORG specify her contact rights . In reply , the ORG twice asked the first applicant to specify a time and place for meeting her daughter . The first applicant refused to be served with these notifications .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE the first applicant applied to the first - instance court for a decision on the amount of contact she could have with her daughter .

On DATE the father initiated custody proceedings , seeking to have the first - instance court amend its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and give him custody of the second applicant . In a judgment of DATE , the court granted his application and ordered the first applicant to hand the child over to the father . The first applicant would be allowed to maintain personal and direct contact with her . On DATE , however , the judgment was set aside by ORG , which remitted the case for a fresh examination . ORG ordered the first - instance court to reassess the available evidence and provide convincing reasons why the first applicant was unfit to enjoy custody of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court dismissed the father \u2019s application after hearing evidence from him and the first applicant and admitting expert opinions , of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , which confirmed that both parents were mentally fit and had the required capacity to care for the child . It also admitted a report by the ORG , dated DATE , in which welfare officers confirmed that the first applicant had the necessary capacity to provide basic care for the child , but that she had continuously prevented her from seeing the father . They had not applied to a court to have her parental rights restricted since there were other ways to protect the interests and rights of the child . They further argued that the first applicant \u2019s behaviour had been inappropriate : she had used insulting language towards everyone involved in the case , and had portrayed herself , without any justification , as a victim of the system . According to the experts , this was not a suitable environment for the second applicant . On the basis of all the available information , the ORG \u2019s welfare officers suggested that it would be in the child \u2019s best interests for the father to be given custody . In that way the child could maintain a relationship with both parents , which she had been unable to do when the first applicant had had custody .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the aforementioned facts , ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL above ) , the court found that the first applicant had , for a protracted period of time , prevented the father from having contact with his daughter at the scheduled meetings . She had not been cooperative or shown any insight in her dealings with the ORG authorities , unlike the father , whose behaviour had been of no concern . Her past behaviour had been the result of her lack of trust in the authorities and her strained relationship with the father , but this had not affected her ability to care for the child . In this connection , the court stated :", "\u201c The court took into consideration the [ ORG \u2019s welfare ORG ] opinion , but it has found that it would be in the best interests of the child , given the child \u2019s ( young ) age and current stage of her development , for her to remain in the custody of the mother . The father may maintain a personal relationship and direct contact with the child . The court also took into consideration the fact that , as a consequence of these proceedings , the parties have understood the need for mutual communication in order to ensure the rights of the child . They ... have reached an agreement regarding their right to have contact with the child , which reduces the need for the competent body to determine those relationships ... In this connection , there is always the possibility that the parents reach their own agreement , at any given time , regarding custody of the child , as befits her interests . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court concluded that the first applicant \u2019s nationality was of no relevance to the case . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . After the judgment became final , on DATE the ORG specified the contact rights of the father and allowed him to meet his daughter on DATE , DATE ( TIME ) and DATE ( TIME ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld an appeal on points of law ( \u0440\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) by the father , finding that there had been a \u201c wrongful application of the substantive law given the established facts \u201d ( \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e , \u0430\u043a\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0434 \u0443\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0431\u0430 ) . The court overturned the lower courts\u2019 judgments and gave custody of the second applicant to the father . The first applicant was further ordered to pay maintenance of MONEY ( MONEY ) per month .

Relying on sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c This court considers that after [ the first - instance court \u2019s ] judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which granted [ the first applicant ] custody of [ the second applicant ] , the child was deprived of the fundamental right to receive parental care from both parents because of the first applicant alone . That is the fundamental , most important and decisive reason for amending the judgment [ of CARDINAL DATE ] ( and ) granting the [ father ] custody of the minor [ the second applicant ] . The court notes that the lower courts disregarded the change in circumstances and the ORG \u2019s expert opinion , without any legally justified and reasonable grounds . This court considers , contrary to the findings of the lower courts , that ... it is in the best interests of the minor , PERSON , with a view to her enjoying the company of both parents , and ensuring her development , that [ the father ] should be given custody . His past behaviour has shown that he is a constructive and cooperative parent whose main concern is the interests of the minor , S.", "This court further considers that the reason why the lower courts dismissed the appellant \u2019s claim to have custody of [ the second applicant ] , namely that she was DATE and DATE and that at that age she needed to stay with the mother , with whom she was biologically connected , can not be regarded as the only relevant legal ground ( \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) . The child \u2019s age is an important ground , but it is not the only [ element ] which is decisive for the court . A court order determining which of the parents of a minor child should be given custody is dependent on other factors , such as the GPE personalities ; their views regarding their rights and duties in respect of their child ; the rights and interests of the child , including , certainly , [ the child \u2019s ] right to both parents ; and the need for the child to have the best environment for [ his or her ] healthy mental and physical development . In the present case , and having regard to all the circumstances , not only the [ second applicant \u2019s ] age , a final conclusion can be drawn that it is in the [ child \u2019s ] interests , and best for her mental and physical development , that [ the father ] should have custody rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
