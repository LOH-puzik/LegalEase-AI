SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Ms R. Z\u00e1hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG of GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a NORP priest . In DATE he had been appointed to a parish in GPE . On DATE his superior informed the applicant that he had been transferred to a different parish . The applicant challenged this decision . His objection was declared inadmissible by ORG on DATE . The decision on the applicant \u2019s transfer thus became effective . In the meantime , on DATE , a different priest had been transferred to the parish in question . The applicant was suspended by the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE . The applicant filed an objection . ORG in GPE upheld that decision on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant brought proceedings before ORG claiming the payment of his remuneration which the defendant diocesan office had stopped . The case was transferred to ORG to which the applicant submitted the same claim on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the action . In its decision the court referred to the Code of Canon PERSON , to sections PERSON ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW and concluded that the legal relations between the applicant and the defendant diocesan office were governed by canon law . Those relations were not labour law relations within the meaning of LOC the provisions of which could not , therefore , be applied . The judgment stated , with reference to the decree of ORG of DATE , that the bishop \u2019s decision to transfer the applicant had been effective as from DATE and that the applicant \u2019s appeal against it could not affect the position . The judgment also stated that the applicant had lost the right to carry out pastoral activity as a result of the bishop \u2019s decision to suspend him given on DATE .", "The applicant appealed . He claimed that the first - instance court had decided arbitrarily in disregard of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . He also submitted that the ordinary courts should examine whether the application of its internal rules by ORG was in accordance with the generally binding legal rules . He argued that the defendant diocesan office was to be regarded as his employer . It had paid health insurance contributions in respect of the applicant in the same way as other employers and it had issued a certificate indicating the period of the applicant \u2019s employment for the purpose of health and social insurance . The applicant also submitted that the relevant regulations published in the Collection of Laws governed the remuneration of priests .", "In its observations on the case the defendant diocesan office underlined that the applicant \u2019s service within the church was governed by canon law and that the relevant issues could not be examined under LAW as suggested by the applicant . The defendant explained that the applicant , of his own will , had carried out no pastoral activity after DATE when he had handed over the parish in GPE to a different priest . Under the relevant provisions of Act CARDINAL and of Regulations DATE and CARDINAL the applicant had therefore no right to remuneration after that date . In accordance with the provisions of canon law , the bishop had suspended the applicant after attempts to redress the situation had failed . ORG in GPE had confirmed the validity of the bishop \u2019s decree on DATE .", "On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . It noted that churches were autonomous in the exercise of their functions and that interference by courts with their decisions relating to the modalities of service of their ministers or its termination would be contrary to the LAW . With reference to the relevant law , ORG held that clergymen were entitled to remuneration for the exercise of pastoral activity . Should a church fail to pay remuneration and other sums due to a member of its clergy for exercise of pastoral activity , the person would be entitled to seek redress before the ordinary courts . However , since the applicant \u2019s claim for remuneration related to a period when he did not exercise his function as a priest , and since the ordinary courts lacked power to examine whether or not the church authority \u2019s decisions to transfer the applicant to a different parish and to suspend him had been justified , his action could not be granted .", "On DATE the applicant petitioned ORG . He alleged a violation of his constitutional rights to judicial protection , to equality of rights without discrimination and to freedom of religion and expression , as well as of his right to satisfactory working conditions including remuneration .", "On DATE ORG found that the ordinary courts dealing with the case had violated the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL in conjunction with LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW and also his rights under LAW and ( b ) of the LAW . ORG expressed the view , among others , that the applicant \u2019s claims for payment of a sum of money and for remuneration fell to be examined under the NORP legal order and , as such , they should have been determined by the ordinary courts . ORG judgment in its relevant parts reads as follows :", "\u201c The ordinary courts considered the church law to form a part of the legal and not of the factual aspect of the case . They decided in application of rules which are not a part of the legal order of GPE [ which ] does not allow their particular use ; [ they ] thereby violated the petitioner \u2019s right under LAW ...", "The decision on the existence , termination and nature of the legal relations between the petitioner and ORG in ORG determines the preliminary issue in respect of the decision on the financial claims of the petitioner . A preliminary question is one which can be decided upon in separate proceedings in which , of course , the legal order of GPE would be applied . In this context the Constitutional Court points out that even when deciding on a preliminary issue , the courts were obliged to apply the legal order of GPE or rules the use of which the NORP legal order permits ...", "The church authorities deciding on the legal relations between the petitioner and ORG in ORG are not public authorities and they applied canon law . For this reason the [ ordinary courts ] should not have accepted their decision as determining a preliminary issue by a different authority under LAW . By accepting the decisions of the church authorities concerning the legal relations between the applicant and ORG in ORG as decisions within the meaning of LAW , ORG and ORG in ORG violated the petitioner \u2019s right to judicial and other legal protection under LAW ... \u201d", "At the relevant time the Constitutional Court lacked power to afford effective redress to the applicant ( see below ) .", "Pursuant to LAW , GPE is a sovereign and democratic State of law . It is not bound by any ideology or religion .", "LAW and QUANTITY provides , inter alia , that human beings are equal in dignity and rights . The fundamental rights and freedoms are guaranteed to everybody without distinction .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL guarantees to everyone the freedom of thought , conscience , religion and faith . Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL provides that churches and religious communities administer their matters themselves . In particular , they establish their organs and appoint their clergymen independently of ORG authorities .", "Article CARDINAL(a ) and ( b ) guarantees to employees , inter alia , the right to remuneration for their work and protection against arbitrary dismissal and against discrimination in employment .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL guarantees the right to judicial protection . It provides , in particular , that everybody has the right to seek protection for his or her rights before an independent and impartial tribunal in accordance with the procedure set out in the law or , in cases provided for by the law , before a different authority of GPE .", "Pursuant to LAW , as in force until DATE , ORG could commence proceedings upon the petition ( \u201c podnet \u201d ) presented by any individual or corporation claiming that their rights had been violated . According to its case - law under this provision , ORG lacked power to draw legal consequences from its finding that a petitioner \u2019s rights had been violated . It could neither grant damages to the person concerned nor impose a sanction on the public authority liable for the violation found . ORG held that it was therefore for the authority concerned to provide redress to a petitioner who was successful in proceedings before it .", "LAW and QUANTITY provides that courts in civil proceedings examine matters related to civil law relations and also to labour , family , co - operative as well as business relations unless the law reserves their examination to other authorities . Courts examine and decide upon other issues only where the law so provides .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that courts are bound , inter alia , by decisions given by competent authorities that an offence or a minor offence was committed as well as by decisions determining the status of a person . Under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , a court can otherwise itself determine issues which fall to be determined by a different authority . However , where a competent authority has determined such an issue in an earlier decision , courts shall base themselves on such a decision .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , churches and religious communities administer their own affairs . In particular , they establish their organs , appoint their ministers and establish their own orders and other institutions independently of the ORG authorities .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that persons carrying out ecclesiastical activities do so upon authorisation by churches and religious communities in accordance with their internal rules and the generally binding rules . As regards the latter rules , the law expressly refers to LAW .", "Paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL provides that churches and religious communities assess the capacity of persons to carry out ecclesiastical activities and decide on their appointment to posts in accordance with such assessment .", "Under section CARDINAL ) , churches and religious communities , in accordance with their internal rules , appoint persons who carry out ecclesiastical activities and teachers of religion , and assign them to a certain geographical district where appropriate .", "Act CARDINAL , as amended , governs the economic maintenance by the ORG of churches and religious communities .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that , where registered churches and religious communities so request , the ORG remunerates , in accordance with this LAW , ministers who act as employees of churches and religious communities in ecclesiastical matters , in church administration or in institutions for the education of ministers .", "The scale of basic salaries and of supplements payable to clergymen is set out in Government \u2019s Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL as amended by Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that the period of pastoral activity to be taken into account for determination of the remuneration of clergymen is to be determined by the church concerned .", "ORG has been charged with carrying out state administration in matters relating to churches and religious communities . Its activities comprise , inter alia , finalising the proposals as regards the relevant part of the ORG budget , distribution of financial means from the ORG budget to churches and supervision of the use of such means . ORG does not , however , interfere with internal matters of churches and religious communities ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
