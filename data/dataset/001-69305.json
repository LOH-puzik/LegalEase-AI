POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE . He has CARDINAL nationalities : NORP and NORP . He lives in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE a cheque drawn on the applicant 's closed account was cashed in a NORP bank . Subsequently , the police started to investigate the case and interviewed the applicant .", "In DATE the applicant moved to GPE .", "In DATE the police summoned the applicant , however , the summons was returned undelivered as the applicant had moved .", "On DATE the prosecution service filed with ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) a bill of indictment against the applicant . He was charged with drawing and cashing the cheque on DATE .", "On DATE a hearing was held . The applicant , despite having been properly summoned , failed to attend it . The court was informed that the applicant did not live at the address provided by him .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be detained on remand for DATE . The decision was reasoned as follows :", "\u201c The pre - trial detention is justified by LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW since the accused is avoiding the criminal justice system . \u201d", "On DATE a \u201c wanted \u201d notice was issued concerning the applicant .", "On DATE the applicant was taken into custody by the NORP police while crossing the NORP - Polish border .", "On DATE ORG in GPE and ORG decided that the applicant should be remanded in custody in connection with CARDINAL other criminal proceedings pending against him .", "The applicant appealed against the decision of DATE ordering his pretrial detention but his appeal was dismissed on DATE by ORG ( PERSON ) . The court gave the following reasons for its decision :", "\u201c Among the complaints made in the appeal CARDINAL , concerning the wrong legal basis of the impugned decision is right . Admittedly , in the present case [ the decision ] should be based on LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW since the accused did not have his permanent place of residence in the country and anyway he did not properly inform the person conducting the investigation of his address but instead gave an address where he was not present and subsequently DATE despite being instructed to do so \u2013 did not notify his actual place of residence . Therefore , it was justified to consider that it was probable that the accused was hiding ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . However , this mistake in the impugned decision did not have any influence on its contents as in fact ORG had based the decision on the risk that the accused would go into hiding .", "As for the accused 's claim that the impugned decision did not refer to any evidence supporting the charges against him , it is not true since the reasoning of the impugned decision point to such evidence . It is obvious to everybody that in a situation where the pre - trial detention is based on the risk of flight , detention constitutes the only effective preventive measure . Therefore , the accused 's allegation concerning the failure to explain why a different preventive measure could not be applied is groundless .", "As for the accused 's submissions made under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( provision of care to his brother , renovation of a hotel and the risk of losses in the hotel ) they are groundless and unconfirmed . Therefore , they can not justify release from pre - trial detention .", "Taking the above into account and in view of the fact that the pre - trial detention of PERSON is justified , and since his case does not disclose any grounds for release from pre - trial detention listed in LAW , the impugned decision is upheld . \u201d", "On DATE ORG dismissed an application for release from detention made by the applicant on DATE . The decision dismissing the application referred to the fact that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had reached only \u201c the stage of jurisdictional proceedings \u201d . Moreover , the evidence collected in the case showed a significant probability that the applicant had committed the act with which he was charged . The detention was justified by LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW as the applicant had moved to GPE and had not notified his actual place of residence . There existed in his case a risk of flight . In addition , only detention on remand would \u201c secure the proper conduct of the proceedings \u201d . The applicant 's case did not disclose any of the grounds for release from pre - trial detention listed in LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure relating to the hardship suffered by the applicant or his family . Finally , certain effects of the applicant 's pretrial detention \u201c constituted the normal consequences of such a preventive measure \u201d .", "The applicant 's appeal against this decision was dismissed on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant attempted to commit suicide .", "On DATE the applicant 's pretrial detention was prolonged until DATE . The decision repeated the grounds for pre - trial detention given in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant appealed against this decision , but his appeal was dismissed on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant made a fresh application for release from detention to ORG but it was dismissed on DATE . The decision dismissing the applicant 's application repeated the grounds of the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicant 's counsel applied to ORG for the applicant 's release from detention and asked that it be replaced with police supervision and seizure of his passport . On DATE the court dismissed the application . The decision dismissing the application repeated the grounds given in the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicant 's pretrial detention was further extended until DATE . The reasons given for the extension repeated those in the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the applicant was hospitalised in the ORG hospital .", "On CARDINAL and DATE the applicant made new applications for release from detention to ORG but they were dismissed on DATE . The reasons given for the dismissal of the applications repeated those in the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the ORG gave a judgment . The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to DATE imprisonment , suspended for DATE . On DATE ORG decided to release the applicant .", "The applicant remained in detention on remand ordered by ORG in connection with another set of criminal proceedings against him . On DATE he was released .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL sets out the general grounds for imposition of the preventive measures . That provision reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings and , exceptionally , also in order to prevent an accused 's committing another , serious offence ; they may be imposed only if the evidence gathered shows a significant probability that an accused has committed an offence .", "Article CARDINAL lists grounds for detention on remand . It provides , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Detention on remand may be imposed if :", "( CARDINAL ) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding , in particular when his identity can not be established or when he has no permanent abode [ in GPE ] ;", "( CARDINAL ) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce [ witnesses or co - defendants ] to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of proceedings by any other unlawful means ;", "CARDINAL . NORP If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an offence for the commission of which he may be liable to a statutory maximum sentence of DATE imprisonment , or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , the need to continue detention to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings may be based on the likelihood that a severe penalty will be imposed . \u201d", "The Code sets out the margin of discretion as to the continuation of a specific preventive measure . Article CARDINAL reads , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Detention on remand shall not be imposed if another preventive measure is sufficient . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL , in its relevant part , reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
