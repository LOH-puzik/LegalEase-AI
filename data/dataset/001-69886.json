The expert also noted that the first and second applicant had not demonstrated that they acknowledged their own contribution to their son 's ( the children 's father 's ) drug addiction .

It rejected however the first and second applicants ' complaint with respect to the third applicant 's guardianship . ORG found that the first and the second applicant were well suited to raise NORP However , it would not be in the third applicant 's best interests to be deprived of her current foster family . The passages regarding the third applicant 's development read as follows :", "\u201c According to the expert PERSON 's opinion , which concurs with the content of the casefile , ORG had not been able to build steady and supportive relationships during DATE of her life . She had been taken care of by continuously changing attachment figures , including her mother , her maternal grandparents , her father , her paternal grandparents , and finally the first foster parents . When examined by the expert , she already showed considerable behavioural disorders , such as a lack of distance ( PERSON ) , an inability to bond ( ORG ) and an inability to adjust ( fehlende GPE ) . As [ the first CARDINAL applicants ] had told the expert , she walked up to anybody and would not accept to be told anything . This had been confirmed by the maternal grandparents and [ the first foster mother ] . The latter added that ORG did not show any inhibitions concerning her contact with men , that she followed and even kissed them . At the beginning of her stay with the foster family , she had shown distinct rocking motions , could not accept limits , put everything into her mouth and had a phase of spitting . During the subsequent time she intensively smeared around with excrement . She was also very jealous of her brother . Both children lacked a DATE routine and had to learn how to play .", "After ORG had stayed for DATE in the care of the [ first ] foster family , a new change of attachment figure occurred by her placement in the [ second ] foster family . As [ the second foster mother ] reported on the occasion of ORG 's hearing , ORG continued to show considerable behavioural disorders . She appeared mask - like , was \u201c just a friendly child \u201d , did not show sorrow or pain and lacked any sense of distance . Furthermore , she was hyperactive and unable to adjust . She fell down on straight paths , which , as [ the foster mother ] supposed , was owed to the fact that her mind was so restless that she was unable to control her movements . Ireen had a totally disordered day and night rhythm . She was temporarily very restless and demanded permanent attention , but also to be set limits . She was now able to abide by simple rules . Ireen suffers from neurodermatitis , which DATE according to [ the second foster mother ] had been aggravated in situations of stress .", "The statements of [ the second foster mother ] show that the behavioural disorders which had been found by the expert PERSON , who attributed them to her unsteady socialisation , persisted after she was taken into the household of [ the second foster family ] . ORG 's behaviour during her hearing showed that she had since developed positively and in particular that she had learned to adjust . She followed [ the foster mother 's ] requests and propositions without opposing to them . She did not try to raise special attention ... The hearing and observation of the child made it clear that she had settled well into the foster family and that she had obviously bonded with her foster parents ... \u201d", "ORG concluded that , given the third applicant 's lack of socialisation during DATE of her life and her positive development in the second foster family , where she had stayed for DATE , it could not be justified to deprive her of this stable environment .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants lodged a further complaint with ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) with a view to being granted guardianship of the third applicant . They argued that ORG had failed to hear expert opinion , to hear the interested parties before the whole chamber and to appoint a curator ad litem ( PERSON ) to represent the third applicant during proceedings . They further requested ORG to pass an interim order granting them the right to determine the third applicant 's residence .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants submitted CARDINAL additional pages of reasoning and requested ORG to establish that ORG had failed to respect their right to a trial within a reasonable time .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants requested ORG to accelerate proceedings and to pass a decision on their request for an interim order .", "On DATE ORG rejected the request for an interim order on the grounds that it would soon pass a decision in the main proceedings and that a change of the third applicant 's attachment figures would be contrary to the child 's best interests .", "On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case to ORG . It found that ORG had failed to raise evidence by expert opinion on the relationship between the third applicant and her foster parents . ORG rejected the applicants ' request of CARDINAL DATE to establish the allegedly undue length of proceedings for lack of a legal basis . It further ordered ORG to appoint a curator ad litem ( PERSON ) , to safeguard the third applicant 's interests during proceedings .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the first CARDINAL applicants requested a swift processing of the proceedings in view of the fact that the third applicant still remained with a foster family .", "On DATE ORG decided to hear expert opinion and appointed a curator ad litem to represent the third applicant .", "On DATE the expert informed the court that she had agreed with the first CARDINAL applicants and with the foster parents that the third applicant should also be examined with respect to her behaviour during and after DATE which she would spend with the first CARDINAL applicants . Accordingly , she would submit her expert opinion by DATE .", "On DATE the expert submitted her expert opinion . She found that the foster family , especially the foster mother , had succeeded to help the third applicant to develop from a disturbed , mentally disordered child , who had been unable to build relationships , into a healthy , self - confident DATE girl . This positive development was owed to the foster mother 's high qualification as a trained social pedagogue and the additional support offered by a professional institution devoted to the welfare of children .", "In spite of the fact that the third applicant was very much attached to her foster family , she nevertheless expressed the strong wish to live with the first CARDINAL applicants . With regard to the fact that the child felt torn between the CARDINAL families , the expert recommended to postpone a final decision for DATE until the third applicant 's entrance into primary school . However , if a decision had to be taken earlier , the expert found that the first and the second applicant were very well able to raise both grandchildren , and that they were willing to seek professional assistance if this should appear necessary . Considering the third applicant 's strong wish to live with her grandparents , the expert recommended to place her into the care of the first and the second applicants .", "On DATE the expert opinion was served on the parties for comments within DATE .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants submitted their comments and requested ORG to schedule a hearing .", "On DATE the foster family organisation submitted their comments , according to which the third applicant should remain within the foster family , while maintaining regular contact with the first CARDINAL applicants .", "On DATE the third applicant 's curator ad litem submitted her comments , according to which the expert had not sufficiently explored the first CARDINAL applicants ' ability to raise the third applicant . She further found that , while the child 's own wishes were not to be neglected , a child of DATE was not able to reach an autonomous decision on its circumstances of life .", "On DATE the curator ad litem asked that the expert should be heard by the court .", "On DATE ORG served the comments to the applicants for further comments within DATE .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants submitted comments drafted by a psychological expert , which supported the court - appointed expert 's conclusions .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants requested ORG to promote the proceedings and to schedule a hearing .", "On DATE the curator ad litem asked to be granted DATE leave for further comments .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicants about its intention to schedule a hearing for DATE , which could not take place because of the expert 's illness . Should the expert be able to attend a hearing on DATE , the hearing would be scheduled accordingly .", "On DATE the expert informed the ORG that she could appear on DATE .", "On DATE ORG scheduled a hearing for DATE .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants submitted further comments .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing , in which it heard the foster parents , the first CARDINAL applicants , the expert and the curator ad litem .", "By decision of DATE ORG discharged ORG and appointed the first and the second applicants as the third applicant 's guardians .", "In its reasoning , ORG referred to the expert 's finding that the first CARDINAL applicants were well suited to raise the third applicant and that the latter had expressed a strong wish to live with them .", "On DATE the first and second applicant lodged a further complaint against the decision of CARDINAL DATE with the aim to be granted legal aid and to establish that the length of the proceedings before ORG had violated their rights under LAW and under LAW , CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "On DATE the ORG refused to grant legal aid and rejected the complaint as inadmissible , maintaining that there was no provision in the procedural law which allowed establishing that proceedings had lasted too long .", "On DATE the first and second applicant raised an objection ( NORP ) against the refusal to grant them legal aid , which was rejected on DATE .", "On DATE the first and second applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which they complained about the length of the proceedings before ORG and about the decision of ORG of DATE .", "On DATE all CARDINAL applicants lodged a constitutional complaint complaining about the length of the proceedings before ORG , about the decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE and about the decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the applicants requested ORG to grant them adequate compensation for the length of proceedings .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint in which they complained about ORG decisions of DATE and DATE to deny them legal aid .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to entertain the applicants ' complaints as being inadmissible .
