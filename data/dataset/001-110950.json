The applicant was dissatisfied that in the interviews given in DATE the prosecutor had given the impression that the criminal proceedings had been successful and everything was clear , the evidence had been gathered and what had remained had only been technicalities . The prosecutor had persuaded the public that it had been the applicant who had demanded the bribe and had disclosed the amounts of the bribe in question . Prosecutor PERSON had also given a number of interviews after the commencement of the court proceedings from which it could be understood that the whole matter was an extremely simple and clear story .", "CARDINAL .

In a written statement to ORG by the head of the public relations department of ORG it was noted that the press release of DATE had been prompted by a telephone call from a journalist who had heard about the arrest of a judge and had sought confirmation of that information .

The press release had been based on facts and contained no personal references . On DATE several media channels interviewed prosecutor PERSON who gave no further information than was contained in the press release .

On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint , finding that ORG had released the information in compliance with LAW ORG seadustik ) . Furthermore , it held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In assessing the lawfulness of the actions of ORG , it is necessary to clarify on which considerations they were taken . According to the submission of [ ORG ] , [ its ] press officers and prosecutor [ ORG ] acted in order to give to the media , which demonstrated extraordinarily high interest in the criminal case in question , information that was as precise and as minimal as possible .", "The court agrees with the [ ORG ] that there was elevated public interest in the criminal case in question . This is already demonstrated by the fact that the criminal proceedings were extensively covered by the press . [ This is ] also [ confirmed ] by ORG numerous [ requests for information ] to the [ ORG ] ... . There is no dispute between the parties about the fact that the criminal case was extensively covered by the press and this can also be concluded on the basis of the materials of the case . As the criminal proceedings were being conducted in respect of a judge who had also been arrested as a suspect , the court considers that the elevated interest of the public in the criminal case was justified . The court considers it a matter of general knowledge that the press , in particular the part of it that qualifies as non - quality press , also tends to publish untrue information . Therefore the court agrees with the [ ORG ] that [ its ] ... communication with the media is also very important in order to avoid , or at least minimise , the spread of misinformation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court has not established that the information released by ORG to the press in the course of the preliminary investigation of the criminal case ... went beyond what was objectively necessary for informing the public or that the applicant \u2019s interests were excessively interfered with .", "It appears from the materials of the case that ORG declined to release detailed information on the circumstances of the offence at the time when [ the applicant ] had the status of suspect . The press release of ORG of DATE and the disclosure of information ( interviews ) by [ the prosecutor ] in charge of the criminal proceedings to the programmes PERSON of [ ORG ] and PERSON of FAC as well as the newspapers Postimees , ORG and ORG ... fell within this period . It can be clearly understood from the press release and the public prosecutor \u2019s statements that [ ORG ] merely suspected the applicant of having accepted a bribe . The [ applicant \u2019s ] allegation that the identity of the judge in respect of whom the proceedings were being carried out was disclosed by ORG is incorrect . ... [ In ] ORG press release of DATE ] it is stated that \u2018 the judge suspected of accepting a large bribe who was arrested by the security police in the course of the simulation of the offence is [ the applicant]\u2019 ... . Thus , the identity of the judge suspected of the offence was already known to the public when [ the prosecutor ] used [ the applicant \u2019s ] name in communication with the media . Therefore the use of [ the applicant \u2019s ] name by [ the prosecutor ] after ORG press release of DATE ] did not aggravate [ the applicant \u2019s ] situation .", "Information about the classification and degree of the offence and the amounts of the bribe were disclosed by ORG only after the drawing up of the bill of indictment when [ the applicant \u2019s ] status had changed to an accused . Proceeding from LAW of [ LAW ] , the drawing up of the bill of indictment demonstrates the conviction of ORG that all the necessary evidence had been gathered . Publication of the press release of DATE by ORG and disclosure of information ( interviews ) by [ the prosecutor ] in charge of the criminal proceedings to the news agency ORG , newspaper ORG , and the programme ORG on [ Eesti Televisioon ] ... fall within this period . The press release and the subsequent imparting of information were based on the official bill of indictment . The court agrees with the [ ORG ] that giving more detailed information about the bill of indictment than the suspicion is legitimate since the bill of indictment represents the result of the pre - trial proceedings and indicates that the criminal proceedings are about to resume in court .", "The court does not agree with [ the applicant \u2019s ] position that ORG violated the principle of the presumption of innocence . The presumption of innocence is protected by LAW ... . Nevertheless , addressing criminal proceedings in the media before passing a judgment is not completely restricted by the presumption of innocence . It has been found in the case - law that covering a case in the media during the pre - trial proceedings may result in a violation of the presumption of innocence but this does not mean that nothing about the pre - trial proceedings may be published in the media ( see the judgment of DATE of ORG in case no . DATE ) . The content of what is disclosed to the media about the criminal proceedings is decisive \u2013 if only objective information reaches the public , the court considers that the publication of such information does not interfere with the presumption of innocence . It has not been established in the present case that ORG informed the public about the criminal proceedings in a subjective manner or gave an opinion about [ the applicant \u2019s ] guilt . [ LAW ] does not prohibit informing the public about proceedings when no opinion about the guilt is given ( PERSON v. GPE , CARDINAL DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the court considers that ORG objectively informed the public about the criminal proceedings . The information given to the press did not exceed the limits of the objective need to inform the public , nor did it excessively damage the interests of [ the applicant ] . As the actions of ORG were lawful there is no ground to allow the claim for damages ... . \u201d", "DATE . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c The public interest and the interest of the person concerned have to be assessed in the specific circumstances . [ The applicant \u2019s ] position that in the present case the statements of ORG related to an individual case in respect of which there could be no public interest can not be sustained . In the case in question there was a suspicion that a judge had committed an offence of accepting a bribe . [ ORG ] correctly notes that the initiation of criminal proceedings related to the suspected acceptance of a bribe by a judge concerns the exercise of functions by a high official . The suspicion that a high official expected to enjoy public confidence has accepted a bribe is an important event justifying elevated public interest . It also justifies ORG informing the public of such an important event .", "ORG concluded that the information disclosed about the criminal proceedings had not exceeded the limits of the objective need to inform the public and that the presumption of innocence had not been violated . ORG agrees with that assessment . [ The applicant ] validly argues that the [ case of PERSON ] , referred to in the judgment , concerns the disclosure of information in respect of ongoing criminal proceedings . However , the case - law of the [ ORG ] does not prohibit disclosure of information concerning pre - trial proceedings and ORG in case no . CARDINAL has also admitted that media coverage of a case during pre - trial proceedings may in itself result in a violation of the presumption of innocence , but this does not mean that nothing at all may be disclosed about pre - trial proceedings .", "...
