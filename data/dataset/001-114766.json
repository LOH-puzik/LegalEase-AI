He specified that on the basis of these orders unlawful action had been taken against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s application to have the orders issued by the prison governor nullified , as they were internal acts and therefore not amenable to review by the administrative courts .

On DATE ORG ( Administrat\u012bva apgabaltiesa ) upheld the lower court \u2019s decision and set a new time - limit within which the applicant was required to give more details .

DATE to ORG , which forwarded his complaint to ORG , where it was received on DATE . ORG also received another complaint from the applicant about both orders and replied on DATE that he should address such complaints to ORG , which was the competent institution in that regard . However , ORG had already replied to the applicant on DATE , stating , inter alia , that order no . DATE had replaced order no . CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s substantive complaints remained unaddressed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following an administrative reform , FAC was merged with FAC , and the newly established prison has since been called FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon the applicant \u2019s request , he was transferred to Jelgava Prison in order to serve his sentence there .", "CARDINAL . ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( the \u201c CPT \u201d ) has voiced serious concerns about the regime and the security measures applied to lifesentenced prisoners in GPE on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . After its second periodic visit in DATE , the ORG noted that all life - sentenced prisoners at that time were held in FAC . The only activity offered for them was DATE outdoor exercise ( TIME ) . For the remaining TIME of the day they were usually locked in a cell . They could only listen to a radio programme , read or play board games . Occasionally , they could watch TV , which was made available on a rota basis . They could only interact with their cell mate . The ORG stressed that life - sentenced prisoners were not necessarily more dangerous than other prisoners and called upon the domestic authorities to make individual risk assessments to allow decisions concerning security , including degree of contact with others , to be made on a case - by - case basis . The ORG concluded that the regime applicable to life - sentenced prisoners should be fundamentally revised ( see paragraphs CARDINAL of the relevant report : ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted with concern that draconian security measures were applied whenever life - sentenced prisoners were removed from their cells ( e.g. to be taken to the shower area or for outdoor exercise ) . They were systematically handcuffed with their hands behind their backs and escorted by CARDINAL prison guards accompanied by a muzzled dog . It was the ORG \u2019s view that there could be no justification for routinely handcuffing life - sentenced prisoners outside their cells ; they found these arrangements disproportionate and punitive and recommended the revision of these security measures without delay ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . During an ad hoc visit in DATE , the ORG also visited the new unit for life - sentenced prisoners in FAC ( located in the former disciplinary block ) , which was in an advanced stage of reconstruction , but had not been finished , and expressed misgivings about certain aspects of the design of those facilities ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the relevant report : ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After this visit , the ORG was seriously concerned by the failure of the NORP authorities to implement the specific recommendations made after its DATE visit . Apart from DATE exercise , prisoners continued to be constantly locked in their cells , alone or with CARDINAL cellmate , without any purposeful activities . They could not interact with inmates from other cells . The ORG reiterated its recommendation that the regime applicable to life - sentenced prisoners be fundamentally revised ( see paragraphs CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . The draconian security measures ( hands cuffed behind the back , escorted by CARDINAL prison guards with a dog , which would sometimes be muzzled ) continued to be systematically applied whenever the lifesentenced prisoners left their cells . At the end of its visit , the ORG made an immediate observation requesting the NORP authorities to carry out an individual risk assessment in respect of all life - sentenced prisoners and to adjust the security measures applied to them accordingly . The ORG refused to do so . In its report of the DATE visit , the ORG called upon the NORP authorities to take immediate steps in this regard ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . After its third periodic visit in DATE , the ORG expressed serious concern about the almost total failure of the NORP authorities to improve the conditions under which life - sentenced prisoners were being held in NORP prisons , despite the specific recommendations made after its CARDINAL previous visits ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the relevant report : ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG confirmed that not only in FAC , but also in Daugavpils Prison , life - sentenced prisoners were locked in their cells for TIME per day , alone or with a cellmate , without being offered any purposeful activities . They were not allowed to interact with lifesentenced prisoners from other cells . The ORG found such a state of affairs unacceptable . The ORG saw encouraging signs in FAC , where one cell had been converted into a computer room and work to create new facilities had started ( a workshop , a recreation area and a small gym ) . They noted , however , that additional steps were required to offer a sufficiently large area for these facilities , in order to allow all life - sentenced prisoners to spend a reasonable part of DATE outside their cells . The ORG called upon the NORP authorities to take steps without any further delay to devise and implement a comprehensive regime of out - of - cell activities in respect of all life - sentenced prisoners at NORP and Jelgava Prisons ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . Overall , the material conditions of detention were adequate in the new unit for life - sentenced prisoners at FAC . All cells were of a reasonable size and well equipped . However , the ORG had certain misgivings about access to natural light ( frosted glass bricks ) and the ventilation system ( considerable noise ) . The prison authorities informed the ORG that steps were being taken to resolve these issues ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the security measures , the ORG reiterated once again that there could be no justification for routinely handcuffing life - sentenced prisoners whenever they were outside their cells , all the more so when this measure was applied in an already secure environment . Further , the use of dogs to escort this category of prisoner whenever they were taken out of their cells was unnecessary from a security standpoint and could only be regarded as a means of intimidating and humiliating the prisoners . The ORG welcomed the recent decision of the management of FAC to no longer use dogs when life - sentenced prisoners were being escorted within the confines of the prison ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the individual risk assessment of life - sentenced prisoners in FAC , the ORG noted that panels to undertake these assessments had been set up but the proceedings carried out by them were , to a very large extent , devoid of any meaning . In practice , they met DATE and did not hear the views of the prisoners concerned , many of whom were apparently not even aware of the existence of such proceedings . As a matter of fact , a relaxation of the draconian security measures had been rejected in virtually every case , mainly on account of the nature of the crime(s ) for which the prisoners concerned had been sentenced ; and the fact that many of them had already spent DATE in a remand prison without posing any particular security problems did not seem to be taken into account . The ORG called upon the NORP authorities to take immediate steps to carry out a proper individual risk assessment on a regular basis for all life - sentenced prisoners and to alleviate the security measures applied to them accordingly ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the ORG stated that life - sentenced prisoners were subject to some anachronistic rules . By way of example , they were not allowed to sit or lie on their bed during DATE . If this rule was not respected , the prisoners usually received a disciplinary punishment . In addition , several prisoners alleged that , whenever the cell door was opened by a prison officer , they were required to recite their full name and the section of LAW under which they had been sentenced . The ORG recommended the abolition of the above - mentioned rules / practices without delay ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ORG also had misgivings about the systematic practice of strip - searches for life - sentenced prisoners . The ORG noted that while prison officers had indicated that strip - searches were only carried out on entry or return to the prison , after visits or \u201c on suspicion \u201d , all the prisoners interviewed by the ORG had given consistent accounts of routine , systematic strip - searches and searches of their cells DATE . Every prisoner was required to undress completely and to hand each item of clothing through the bars of the cell in order for it to be searched by the guards . They remained standing and fully naked in view of the guards and the prisoner sharing the cell for TIME . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , such a practice could be considered as amounting to degrading treatment . The ORG recommended that strip - searches only be conducted on the basis of a concrete suspicion and in an appropriate setting ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . Summing up , the ORG noted that its delegation had gained the distinct impression that senior prison officers , including at the management level , had deeply rooted negative attitudes towards life - sentenced prisoners , which explained their resistance to any change in regime , providing work opportunities or even medical care . Their mindset was focused on the heinous , and sometimes sordid , offences committed by the life - sentenced prisoners , rather than their prospects for long - term rehabilitation and reintegration into society . Indeed , many of the officers concerned appeared to be psychologically unsuited to be put in charge of life - sentenced prisoners . It was the ORG \u2019s view that there was an urgent need for senior prison officers to receive clear guidance and special training on how to deal with life - sentenced prisoners in a contemporary prison system ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted the following :", "\u201c DATE . The ORG also wishes to draw the NORP authorities\u2019 attention to LAW ( DATE ) CARDINAL on ORG and Other ORG ( adopted by ORG on DATE ) , which emphasises that life - sentenced prisoners should not be segregated from other prisoners on the sole ground of their sentence ( non - segregation principle ) .", "The Explanatory Report of the afore - mentioned recommendation further states that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . [ t]he special segregation of life - sentenced or long - term prisoners can not be justified by an unexamined characterisation of such prisoners as dangerous . As a general rule , the experience of many prison administrations is that many such prisoners present no risks to themselves or others . And if they do present such risks , they may only do so for relatively limited periods or in particular situations . In consequence , while it is fully recognised that time and resources are needed to implement this principle ; these prisoners should only be segregated if , and for as long as , clear and present risks exist .", "CARDINAL . Life - sentenced and long - term prisoners are thought in some countries to pose serious safety and security problems in the prison . The violence and dangerousness manifested in the criminal act is considered to carry over to their lives in prison . Offenders who , for example , have committed murder are among those most likely to receive life or long sentences . This does not necessarily mean that they are violent or dangerous prisoners . Indeed , prison authorities can refer to individual murderers with a life or long sentence as \u201c good prisoners \u201d . They exhibit stable and reliable behaviour and are unlikely to repeat their offence . The likelihood of an offender engaging in violent or dangerous behaviour frequently depends not only on personality characteristics but also on the typical situations that permit or provoke the emergence of such behaviour .", "CARDINAL . Descriptions in terms of violence and dangerousness should , therefore , always be considered in relation to the specific environments or situations in which these characteristics may DATE or may not \u2013 be exhibited . In the management of long - term and life prisoners , a clear distinction should be drawn between safety and security risks arising within the prison and those that may arise with escape into the community . The classification and allocation of long - term and life - sentenced prisoners should take account of these differing kinds of risks ( ... ) \u201d .", "The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities reconsider their segregation policy vis - \u00e0 - vis life - sentenced prisoners , in the light of the above remarks . The existing plans to construct a new detention block for life - sentenced prisoners at FAC should also be revised accordingly .", "Further , the ORG invites ORG to establish a co - operation programme with another prison administration which has experience in applying alternative approaches to dealing with life - sentenced prisoners . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After its ad hoc visit in DATE , the ORG noted on a positive note that some improvement in the attitude of staff was observed as compared to its previous visits and this observation was generally confirmed by the prisoners themselves . However , the ORG expressed some misgivings about the quality of staff - prisoner relations ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the relevant report : ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the material conditions of detention , the ORG noted that despite the assurances given by the prison governor during the DATE visit CARDINAL main problems remained unresolved in FAC . Firstly , the frosted glass bricks which rendered access to natural light in the cells inadequate had still not been replaced by transparent glass panels . Secondly , the ventilation system did not function properly ( this was all the more worrying as there were no windows in the cells that could be opened ) and created considerable noise in many cells . The ORG recommended these shortcomings be remedied without further delay ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the regime , the ORG was seriously concerned that despite its previous specific recommendations in this respect the life - sentenced prisoners at the maximum security level continued to be locked in their cells for most of DATE without being offered any purposeful activities . Although there was a small gym at FAC , it could only be used for TIME every day and it was very modestly equipped ( CARDINAL exercise bicycles , a table game and a TV set ) . In fact , it was mostly used to watch TV ( in groups of CARDINAL persons ) , as this was the only occasion for life - sentenced prisoners to meet prisoners other than their cellmates . The ORG reiterated its previous recommendation in this regard ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the security measures , the ORG noted with serious concern that the practice of systematic handcuffing of all life - sentenced prisoners continued whenever they were escorted inside the prison . It reiterated that the systematic handcuffing of prisoners can not be justified , and all the more so when applied in an already secure environment . Such a practice could only be seen as disproportionate and punitive ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recalled its previous recommendations as concerns the individual risk assessment of prisoners and that the proceedings did not function properly in practice . The ORG noted , furthermore , that not a single individual risk assessment of life - sentenced prisoners had been carried out in FAC since DATE . It reiterated its previous conclusions and expressed a wish to receive copies of all the decisions taken following the risk assessment ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG stressed once again that there was no justification for keeping life - sentenced prisoners apart from other prisoners solely on the basis of their sentence ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , as regards discipline in relation to prisoners in general , despite a specific recommendation made by the ORG , lying on the bed during DATE was still considered a disciplinary offence and was punished accordingly . The ORG reiterated its recommendation that this anachronistic rule be abolished without further delay ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL .
