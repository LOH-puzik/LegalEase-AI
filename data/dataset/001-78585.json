The applicant , ORG , is a company incorporated under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . The background to this case lies in a series of complex contractual arrangements made in DATE concerning importation of electricity from GPE to GPE and involving , in addition to the applicant company , a ORG - owned power distribution company called Moldtranselectro , a NORP ORG - owned power distribution company and a NORP private company . The agreement to which ORG was a party provided , inter alia , that it would pay the NORP private company for the electricity supplied to ORG ( ORG ) and would later be paid back by Moldtranselectro in GPE lei ( MDL ) at the official exchange rate on DATE of payment .", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates DATE the applicant company paid over USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the electricity supplied to Moldtranselectro from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date Moldtranselectro paid the applicant company MDL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government of GPE adopted Decision no . CARDINAL by which ORG was authorised to issue nominative ORG bonds in favour of private companies for the payment of debts arising from the importation of electricity supplied to state institutions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Moldtranselectro wrote a letter to ORG asking it to issue a nominative ORG bond ( \u201c ORG bond \u201d ) with a value of MDL CARDINAL in favour of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a ORG bond valued at MDL CARDINAL in favour of the applicant company , payable by DATE . The ORG bond provided that the applicant company had to present it to ORG at least DATE before the date of payment . It also provided that Moldtranselectro had to present , by that date , to ORG , documents proving the supply of electricity to state institutions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company presented the ORG bond to ORG DATE before the date of payment . However , the latter refused to pay , on the ground that Moldtranselectro had failed to submit evidence concerning the payment by FAC for the imported electricity .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant company initiated civil proceedings against both ORG and Moldtranselectro . ORG defended the action on the grounds set out in paragraph CARDINAL above while Moldtranselectro declined all responsibility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found in favour of the applicant company and confirmed its right to be paid MDL CARDINAL by ORG , in accordance with the ORG bond . It based its judgment on the finding that ORG had paid for energy supplied to Moldtranselectro from GPE in accordance with the agreement between them and that that energy had been consumed by state institutions . The court considered that the fact that Moldtranselectro had failed to comply with its obligation in the ORG bond was not in itself enough to absolve ORG from its obligation to pay . The court also decided to absolve Moldtranselectro of any responsibility .", "CARDINAL . Since an appeal by ORG was dismissed on DATE for failure to pay court fees , a warrant for the enforcement of the judgment of DATE was issued to the applicant company in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company officially requested a bailiff to start the enforcement procedure under the warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested an extension of the time - limit for lodging an appeal against the judgment of DATE and its request was granted . The appeal was examined on its merits and dismissed by a judgment of ORG of GPE on DATE . ORG lodged an appeal on points of law , reiterating that Moldtranselectro had not complied with its obligation in the ORG bond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgments of DATE and DATE . It found it undisputed that ORG had paid for electricity supplied from GPE to Moldtranselectro and consumed , inter alia , by state institutions . The failure of Moldtranselectro , which was a ORG company , to fulfil its obligations vis - \u00e0 - vis ORG by presenting it with the documents required by the latter , could not affect the rights of the applicant company , which had paid for electricity supplied from GPE . It noted that the ORG bond did not contain any provision making the payment dependent on the fulfilment of ORG 's obligations towards ORG . The court also noted that the applicant company had on many occasions asked ORG for payment , but that ORG had refused and had asked for the documents which should have been presented by Moldtranselectro . The court considered ORG request to be unlawful and argued that , according to the law , it was Moldtranselectro that should have presented the documents .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following a request by ORG , ORG introduced a request for annulment of the final judgment of ORG . On DATE ORG dismissed the request and upheld the judgments favourable to the applicant company . It found , inter alia , that both during the proceedings before the lower courts and before ORG , it had been established that over MDL CARDINAL worth of electricity had been supplied to state institutions . The fact that Moldtranselectro had failed to comply with its obligations to ORG could not have had any influence on the right of the applicant company to be paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company sold a part of the ORG 's debt , amounting to MDL CARDINAL , to a third company .", "CARDINAL . Since the judgment of DATE had still not been enforced , on DATE , at the applicant company 's request , ORG agreed to conclude an agreement according to which ORG would pay MDL CARDINAL DATE from DATE in exchange for the applicant 's promise not to initiate further claims for damages .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Ministry paid MDL CARDINAL to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the ORG paid MDL CARDINAL to a third company ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG then stopped making the payments , and on DATE the applicant company informed ORG that it had introduced an application with the ORG complaining of the failure to enforce the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government Agent informed ORG about the applicant company 's application with the ORG and requested it to \u201c take all the necessary steps in order to avoid a finding of a violation against the ORG by the ORG , with the consequent impairment of the country 's image \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG paid MDL CARDINAL to the applicant company . There were no further payments after that date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to ORG , informing it , inter alia , that it considered the judgment in favour of the applicant company to be unlawful , but that it had complied with it partially , so that ORG Plus would not complain to the ORG . ORG had informed it that ORG had already complained to the ORG . The ORG asked ORG for advice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG wrote to the ORG as follows :", "\u201c ... during the proceedings [ between the applicant company , Moldtranselectro and ORG ] the applicant company and Moldtranselectro presented invoices for MDL CARDINAL , of which by DATE only ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL had been paid .", "No other evidence as to the extent to which ORG had fulfilled its obligations under the agreement [ of DATE ] has been presented . Despite this the courts ruled in its favour .", "In that respect ORG has ordered an audit to verify the supply of electricity and the payments between ORG , Moldtranselectro and state institutions . A final decision will be adopted by ORG after the results of the audit become available to it and ORG will be informed accordingly . \u201d", "An attempt to carry out this audit was made in DATE by a representative of ORG at the request of ORG . However , it was unsuccessful because , in accordance with book - keeping legislation , the applicant company had destroyed the accounting documents after DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not wait for a final reply from ORG and on DATE lodged with ORG a request for revision of the judgments in favour of the applicant company . The request referred to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) but did not specify any reasons for revision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company submitted to ORG its observations on the revision request , in which it argued , inter alia , that the Ministry had not indicated any reasons for revision , that the revision request was time - barred and if the request were to be upheld this would amount to a breach of the principle of legal certainty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the revision request , following a hearing at which ORG was represented by ORG . It quashed the judgments in favour of the applicant company and ordered the reopening of the proceedings . It relied on ORG office 's letter of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which had been submitted by ORG during the hearing . The Plenary considered the letter to be a new and essential fact or circumstance which was unknown and could not have been known earlier , in accordance with the provisions of LAW . In particular it considered new and essential the submission of ORG that \u201c by DATE only ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL had been paid \u201d . ORG did not address in its judgment the objections raised by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing in the reopened proceedings . In contrast with the first round of proceedings , Moldtranselectro sided this time with ORG and argued that ORG action should be dismissed because it ( Moldtranselectro ) had already covered the entire debt for the electricity supplied , including MDL CARDINAL provided in the ORG bond , by paying ORG Plus MDL CARDINAL on an unspecified date .", "The court upheld the applicant company 's action and ordered ORG to pay it MDL CARDINAL in accordance with the ORG bond . It based its judgment on the fact that the supply of the electricity and the cost of the energy supplied were not disputed by the parties . Referring to the electricity supplied to state institutions , it found that by DATE they had consumed MDL CARDINAL worth of electricity imported from GPE with the participation of FAC .", "In the court 's view , the ORG bond constituted an incontestable obligation on ORG towards ORG , which could not depend on the fulfilment of third - party obligations .", "Referring to the submissions of Moldtranselectro concerning the payment of MDL CARDINAL to the applicant company , the court argued that that amount represented USD MONEY at the date of supply of the electricity , but not at the date of payment of the MDL CARDINAL . The court held that at the date of payment of the above amount by Moldtranselectro , USD MONEY was worth MDL CARDINAL .", "Referring to the amounts indicated by ORG in its letter dated DATE , which served as a basis for the revision of the final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court found that those figures were related to a completely different matter and were irrelevant to the case before it .", "ORG appealed against this judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG 's appeal and dismissed the applicant company 's action against it . While not contesting the findings of the first - instance court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and while confirming that electricity was supplied to Moldtranselectro and consumed , inter alia , by state institutions , it made its own calculations directly in GPE without converting the amounts to ORG , and came to the conclusion that the entire debt owed by the ORG to the applicant company had been covered by the payment of MDL MONEY by Moldtranselectro to the former . ORG also ordered the applicant company to pay the court fees of MDL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged with ORG a request for the return of the ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL which had been paid in accordance with the judgment of DATE . The applicant company argued , inter alia , that the request had been lodged out of time and that in any event the amount of MDL CARDINAL had never been paid to it , but had instead been paid to a third person ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the request of ORG . It dismissed the applicant company 's submission concerning the time - limit and ignored its submission concerning the MDL CARDINAL which had been paid to a third person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , having examined the letter from ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant company and against the head of Moldtranselectro on charges of large - scale embezzlement of ORG property . ORG referred to the results of the audit which it had attempted to carry out in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and stated , inter alia , that according to the results of that audit , ORG had not paid for electricity supplied to state institutions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Executive Officer of the applicant company ( \u201c PERSON ) was questioned by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the offices of the applicant company were searched and some documents seized .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the criminal proceedings were discontinued . The prosecutor in charge of the criminal case stated in his decision of discontinuation , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c According to the evidence obtained during the audit , DATE Moldtranselectro 's debt to ORG reached MDL CARDINAL ...", "The materials gathered [ during the investigation ] and the audit prove the existence of the debt of Moldtranselectro to Oferta Plus for the electricity supplied . The transfers [ of MDL CARDINAL by ORG ] to ORG accounts were carried out in accordance with court judgments ...", "Taking into consideration the evidence gathered , [ the prosecution concludes ] that the acts of ORG management do not disclose any signs of the offence [ of large - scale embezzlement ] or of other offences . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE all the bank accounts of the applicant company were frozen by a bailiff to ensure the restitution of MDL CARDINAL . The company had to make all of its employees redundant , except for PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG communicated the present case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General quashed the decision of DATE . He submitted , inter alia , that on DATE Moldtranselectro 's debt to the applicant company for the electricity supplied had been MDL LANGUAGE . He argued that while ORG Plus had paid the NORP partner more than MDL CARDINAL for the electricity supplied to Moldtranselectro , it appeared that the energy for which it had paid had not been supplied exclusively to state institutions . He also noted that ORG Plus had transferred a part of the debt to third companies in exchange for money and goods . He requested , in particular , that an international fact - finding mission be sent to GPE and that the books of the applicant company be seized .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was declared a suspect in the criminal proceedings . In a decision of the same date , it was reiterated that on DATE Moldtranselectro 's debt to FAC for the electricity supplied had been MDL CARDINAL . However , the electricity for which Moldtranselectro owed this amount had not been supplied to state institutions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor issued a decision by which PERSON was officially indicted for misappropriation of MDL CARDINAL and attempted misappropriation of MDL CARDINAL . The charges against him were based on the fact that the energy supplied to Moldtranselectro , for which the applicant company had paid the NORP private company , had not been consumed by state institutions . The prosecution argued that a ORG bond could be issued by ORG only for energy supplied to state institutions . Contrary to that provision , Moldtranselectro had asked ORG on DATE to issue a ORG bond in favour of ORG and such a bond had been issued by ORG on DATE .", "After that , Oferta Plus , in the person of GPE , its former chief executive , making use of the favourable environment created for his company by the illegal actions of Moldtranselectro , and seeking to obtain MDL CARDINAL , had initiated civil proceedings against ORG , and in the absence of any proof that electricity had been supplied to state institutions , illegally obtained judgments in its favour .", "However PERSON could not fulfil his criminal intention of misappropriating MDL CARDINAL for reasons beyond his control ( he was killed ) .", "The criminal intention to misappropriate MDL CARDINAL was continued by PERSON , the present Chief Executive Officer of ORG .", "Despite the fact that on DATE Moldtranselectro owed ORG Plus only MDL CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL , PERSON had pursued his criminal intention by pressing ORG repeatedly to comply with the judgment of DATE . As a result , on DATE ORG had concluded an agreement with him and later transferred MDL CARDINAL to Oferta Plus .", "Later , PERSON transferred the money to the account of a third company , which also belonged to him , from where it was transferred to his wife 's personal account and later withdrawn in cash .", "Referring to the reopened proceedings which followed the judgment of ORG of DATE , the prosecutor noted that , despite being well aware that ORG Plus had not paid for energy supplied to state institutions , PERSON had managed to obtain a judgment in favour of ORG Plus before the first - instance court . PERSON had presented evidence which , while showing the payment for electricity , did not prove that the electricity had been supplied to state institutions .", "CARDINAL . Also , on DATE , according to the applicant company , PERSON was told by the investigating officer , PERSON , that no criminal charges against him would have been brought had he contented himself with MDL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On the same date PERSON was arrested and a request for him to be remanded in custody for DATE was addressed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . A detention order for DATE was issued by the investigating judge of ORG on DATE . The judge argued , inter alia , that PERSON had attempted to influence a witness . He relied on a transcript of a telephone conversation of CARDINAL DATE , which , however , was never disclosed to the defence , despite the latter 's requests .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed against the detention order and argued , inter alia , that the criminal proceedings against him had been a form of pressure to persuade PERSON Plus to abandon its application before the ORG . He complained that he and his lawyers had not been allowed to see the transcript of the telephone conversation which was the main reason for his detention and insisted that he had not made any attempt to influence any witnesses .", "He also argued that he had become the CEO of ORG Plus only in DATE and thus had not even been involved in the transaction between the applicant company and Moldtranselectro and that in any event the electricity had been supplied to Moldtranselectro , which was a ORG company and held a monopoly on distribution of electricity at that time . The applicant company could not know who were the final consumers of the electricity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON 's appeal was dismissed . ORG did not give any assessment of the argument concerning PERSON 's lack of access to the transcript of the telephone conversation .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant company 's lawyer in the present case applied to ORG ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) to visit PERSON He pointed out that he was ORG lawyer in the proceedings before the ORG and submitted that he needed to see PERSON in order to prepare with him the observations due on DATE . He asked that the meeting between them take place without a glass partition separating them , since he knew that there was such a partition in the ORG lawyer - client meeting room . He submitted that both he and PERSON had reason to believe that conversations through the glass partition in the ORG meeting room were intercepted and that they were convinced that the criminal proceedings against PERSON had been instituted in order to discourage ORG from pursuing its application before the ORG . He argued that their separation by the glass partition , especially in such conditions , would not allow them to speak freely and would seriously hinder his ability to represent the applicant company before the ORG . The lawyer further argued that PERSON was not a violent person and that there was no risk that he would attack his lawyer . In any event he , the lawyer , would bear responsibility for any attack . He also declared that he would allow the ORG representatives to search him , except for the documents he would be carrying , in order to ensure that he had no forbidden objects on his person .", "CARDINAL . After repeated requests by telephone , on DATE the lawyer was finally allowed to see PERSON in the ORG lawyer - client meeting room , separated by the glass partition . In these circumstances , PERSON refused to discuss any matters relating to pecuniary damage and asked his lawyer to do likewise because the conversation would have related to the whereabouts of the company 's accounting documents .", "During the conversation with PERSON , the lawyer informed him that the charges against him were not consistent with the findings of the civil courts in the civil proceedings between ORG , ORG and Moldtranselectro . DATE , on DATE , the criminal investigator PERSON went to the archives of ORG and took the case file in the civil proceedings . The case file was returned to the archives on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in the afternoon , the applicant 's lawyer telephoned ORG and asked for assistance in seeing PERSON without a glass partition . His request was not successful .", "CARDINAL .

A meeting between the lawyer and PERSON took place DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG made public a press release according to which it had discovered , in the context of the criminal investigation against PERSON , an illegal scheme for misappropriation of budgetary funds . A similar item , with images of PERSON , was broadcast on TIME news bulletin of NORP national television .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant company 's lawyer wrote to ORG that he was the representative of ORG in the proceedings before the ORG . He submitted that , since his client believed that the criminal proceedings against PERSON and his subsequent detention served the purpose of discouraging the pursuit of the Oferta Plus v. GPE application before the Court , on DATE a formal complaint under LAW had been lodged with the Court . He noted that the main piece of evidence relied upon by the courts in placing PERSON in detention was a transcript of a telephone conversation which allegedly proved his attempt to influence a witness . Since PERSON 's defence had not been presented with a copy of that transcript during the pre - trial detention proceedings , he formally requested a copy of it for the purpose of presenting it to the ORG in support of the LAW complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON 's request was rejected by ORG on the ground that he was not PERSON 's lawyer in the criminal proceedings against him . The court also noted that in any event the materials of the criminal case file were not usually disclosed to the defence unless the criminal investigator decided otherwise .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation was completed in the criminal proceedings and the case was sent for examination on its merits to ORG . On DATE , PERSON told the applicant company 's lawyer that he had been told that he would be convicted before ORG adopted a judgment in the present case .", "CARDINAL .

It appears from the photographs submitted by the Government that in the lawyer - client meeting room of the LOC detention centre the space for detainees is separated from the rest of the room by a door and a window . The window appears to be made of CARDINAL plates of glass . Both plates have small holes pierced with a drill ; however the holes do not coincide , so that nothing can be passed though the window . Moreover , there is a dense green net made either of thin wire or plastic between the glass plates , covering the pierced area of the window .
