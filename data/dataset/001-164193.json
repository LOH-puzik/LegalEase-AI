The applicants , PERSON and her CARDINAL minor children , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . They were represented before ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG were represented by their Agent , Mr Arto Kosonen of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant mother is a NORP from GPE , GPE , who escaped from GPE with her husband and CARDINAL children due to persecution . The applicants claimed that the husband had been threatened by the \u201c NORP ORG \u201d for having denounced to the authorities persons who were in possession of firearms . He had subsequently received many death threats , for which reason the family was relocated elsewhere in LOC . Despite the internal flight , the persecution continued . The family fled first to GPE , where their persecutors tried to kidnap the children . They then fled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant mother fell gravely ill after her second pregnancy in DATE . Both of her kidneys were removed and she received a kidney transplant . Due to a lack of proper medication , she was in very poor condition during their escape from GPE and does not even remember being in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants apparently arrived in GPE in DATE and sought asylum on DATE . The applicant mother was immediately admitted to hospital and was thereafter admitted to hospital on a DATE basis for periods of varying length . It appears that her husband has in the meantime been convicted of rape and that she has decided to divorce him . Upon their application for asylum in GPE on DATE , it was discovered that the applicants had previously been registered in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE , PERSON ) rejected the applicants\u2019 application and decided to order their return to GPE . The ORG found that , on DATE , the NORP authorities had informed ORG about the applicants\u2019 family situation and the scheduled arrival of the applicant mother and her children , and that the NORP authorities had not opposed to receive them . The parents were capable of taking care of their children and removal to GPE was not against the best interest of the children , in whose interest it was to live with their parents . GPE had agreed to comply with the fundamental rights guaranteed by LAW and was to examine the applicants\u2019 asylum application . The applicants had a right to services provided by NORP authorities . In a GPE transfer decision the substance of the asylum claim is not examined , so the decision regarding the applicants did not deal with the applicant mother \u2019s illness or her factual position as a single mother due to the pre - trial detention of the children \u2019s father .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting also a stay on removal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to grant a stay on removal .", "CARDINAL . By letters dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants made their second and third requests for a stay on removal . On unspecified dates ORG refused these requests .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings before ORG are still pending . However , a GPE transfer decision is enforceable , notwithstanding that the case has not been finally determined .", "CARDINAL . The application was lodged with ORG . On DATE the duty judge of the ORG decided to suspend the examination of Rule CARDINAL of ORG until receipt of information from the respondent Government and to put factual questions to ORG under LAW ( a ) , which concerned , inter alia , the guarantees obtained from the NORP authorities in relation to the applicants\u2019 scheduled transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted their reply on DATE . In their letter , the respondent Government noted that the NORP authorities had informed the NORP authorities of the guarantees for vulnerable cases , including families with children , by their letters of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . A copy of these circular letters sent by ORG of the NORP ORG ( GPE dell\u2019Interno ) was attached to the ORG \u2019s letter . In these circular letters ORG set out the new policy of the NORP authorities on transfers to GPE of families with small children and provided an updated list of accommodation available to such families .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that ORG would transfer the medical information detailing the special needs of the applicants to the competent authorities in GPE and , accordingly , those needs would be taken care of in such a manner that the applicants would receive any necessary medical care in GPE without interruption . They noted that the NORP authorities had made sufficient efforts to obtain individual and specific guarantees from the NORP authorities , and that there was no reason to suspect that the applicants would be separated from each other or subjected to any treatment contrary to LAW upon arrival in GPE . The examination of the applicants\u2019 application by the ORG was premature , as no final decision by the relevant domestic courts had yet been made . Accordingly , the ORG considered that the applicants\u2019 application should be declared inadmissible by virtue of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW for non - exhaustion of domestic remedies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were sent a copy of the ORG \u2019s letter for information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the duty judge of the ORG decided , under Rule DATE , to indicate to ORG that the applicants should not be transferred to GPE for the duration of the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants commented on the information submitted by the Government , maintaining that they had not been informed to date of any individual or specific guarantees concerning their possible removal to GPE . A mere agreement between GPE and GPE to keep families with children together and to arrange accommodation for them could not be regarded as sufficient . The applicants\u2019 situation would be unclear if GPE could give no individual guarantees by the time of the possible removal . According to the applicants , the children \u2019s father had been convicted of rape and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant mother was certain that her marriage was over , but acknowledged that the children \u2019s well - being was fully dependent on their father \u2019s presence . Regular family visits to prison had already been arranged for the children . The applicants wished the ORG to continue the examination of their case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
