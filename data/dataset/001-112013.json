At the beginning of the hearing , the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked for the media to be present , given that the applicant \u2019s arrest involved a matter of significant public interest . The prosecutor objected to this request on the grounds that the proceedings did not concern the applicant \u2019s arrest in the second criminal case , but rather the ORG \u2019s application in relation to the first criminal case to alter the preventive measure concerning the applicant from a written obligation not to abscond to that of being held in custody . According to the applicant , only at this point did he and his lawyer find out that the hearing concerned the ORG \u2019s application to change the preventive measure affecting the applicant and not the grounds for his arrest .

The applicant and his lawyer then asked the court to adjourn the hearing in order to study the ORG \u2019s application and its supporting materials and to present documents concerning the applicant \u2019s personal situation .

The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , considering it unfounded . In his appeal , he claimed , inter alia , that the applicant had not violated his obligation not to abscond , that studying the case file was the applicant \u2019s right and not an obligation , and that the investigator had not given him all the materials in the case file and had knowingly restricted his right of access to the case file . The lawyer further stated that he and his client had not known the grounds for arrest well in advance of the hearing and that the court had refused to postpone the hearing , having put them , therefore , in a disadvantageous position , in violation of the principle of equality of arms . He complained that there was no evidence or information proving that the applicant would seek to evade the investigation or jeopardise it .

The government and prosecutor \u2019s office , anticipating such criticism , note that CARDINAL current officials are being investigated for or charged with corrupt activities . None of these individuals , however , hold enough power or influence to suggest that justice is being pursued fairly and blindly . The highest - ranking official currently under investigation in GPE is PERSON , former deputy minister for environmental protection in ORG \u2019s administration .", "Even if it disputes the claims of selective prosecution , the government understands that , at a minimum , it has a perception problem . As one official acknowledged , the judicial powers should not behave the way they have behaved of late . The same official unfavorably compared the situation DATE to that before the Orange Revolution , and expressed concern that the judicial system agrees to whatever law enforcement agencies request . Indeed , the strong perception among many observers is that the judicial system does not serve as a check or balance against the executive branch . Such concerns are not allayed by comments from the head of ORG , who is reported to have said that PERSON can always rely on the loyalty of the court , or by a top law enforcement official who said that PERSON can count on us ...", "Conclusions and Recommendations", "...

GPE ranks very high on international lists of corruption and any honest attempt to fight it will be welcomed by the international community , even if it should be against politicians from the former regime . Smooth transfer of power from CARDINAL government to the next is however so important an element in a functioning democracy and prosecution against so many members of a former government so seldomly seen , even in that part of the world , that the present government must understand and accept international skepticism as to its motives . Especially as the present government generally is considered to have a poor record in fighting corruption and could have an evident interest in removing prominent political opponents from future elections .", "...", "The case against PERSON", "PERSON belonged to ORG during DATE , when he established the ORG .

The ORG learned that the ORG personally has intervened in both cases and informed the courts and the President of GPE that the use of detention in general and in these individual cases in her opinion was a violation of their human rights . In most countries such an intervention in a pending case from an ombudsman to the President on activities of the judiciary would probably lead to raised eyebrows ; it is mentioned here only to demonstrate the point on violation of human rights .", "...", "CARDINAL . In neither of the monitored cases have individual reasons to support the need of pre - trial detention been given by the court . In the PERSON case the court only refers that : \u201c the case materials have data that indicate a possibility by PERSON personally and through others in the future to hamper the exercise of procedural decision in the case and the effect on witnesses \u201d . This clearly is not an individual justification for the legality of the use of detention with regard to the specific facts of the case , as required by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the PERSON case the investigator gave him and his lawyer a \u201c schedule \u201d dictating which pages of the files they were to read DATE in preparation of his defense , and only gave them access to the files they were instructed to review on DATE .

The defense lawyer during his preparations and during the trial will only have his personal handwritten notes to support his memory .", "As seen from point CARDINAL above , the court even justified the detention of PERSON by the fact that he and his defense lawyer were too slow in reading through the files , thus delaying the trial and not respecting a procedural decision of the investigator .", "It is unheard of and must be a violation of LAW CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL.b ) that it is up to the decision of the investigator how and when the defendant and his lawyer are to prepare themselves for the upcoming trial .

During the court session in the PERSON case on CARDINAL the chairman of ORG informed the audience that he had received a written note from Mr. PERSON through his lawyer requesting that Mr. PERSON be present in the court room . The judge however turned this request down as the note was not \u201c certified by the prison director \u201d . The court therefore had not requested Mr. PERSON to be brought from FAC to the court building and the court session took place without defendant .", "The court can have had no doubt that Mr. PERSON wanted to be present nor that the note , which it had received from the defendant \u2019s lawyer , was written by Mr. PERSON .", "The decision indicates a biased attitude in the judiciary against granting the accused person his legal rights and letting him benefit from the assumption of innocence . That also seems to indicate a lack of understanding of or respect for CARDINAL of the basic principles of human rights : Justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done .", "CARDINAL . In the PERSON case the defense lawyer complained about having only received from the court a notice of the session , in which the question of extension of the detention was to be dealt with , TIME before the meeting . With such a short notice he was unable to meet . The prosecutor claimed that the defense lawyer had been informed TIME before the meeting and that he himself had not known of the session earlier .

The ORG was impressed by the widespread opinion that the NORP courts can not be considered independent at least in cases related to politics . The judiciary certainly has a problem with its credibility in the public . As the decisive factor of such situation the composition of ORG was pointed at with its heavy bias in favour of the representation from the President of GPE or his affiliated party and the membership of ORG and his CARDINAL deputies , the Head of the Security Service etc . after LAW in DATE . The judicial reform has in other ways improved the conditions of the legal system , but ORG has obtained an unacceptable decisive influence on the appointment of , the disciplinary measures against and the dismissal of judges . The judicial reform law was criticized by ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to a public statement by ORG the prosecution DATE initiated CARDINAL disciplinary cases against judges and information indicates that CARDINAL judges have been dismissed against an average of CARDINAL\u00bd DATE . This is a strong indication that the independence of judges is under strong pressure and that the prosecution has a dominating influence on the future of judges . Prosecutors should not be responsible for disciplining judges ; that disturbs the point of balance between prosecution and judiciary .", "CARDINAL . It has also been mentioned that judges are not appointed for an unlimited time until they have served for DATE . Their first appointment is made by the President of GPE upon proposal of ORG . After that period their permanent appointment is to be approved by the ORG where CARDINAL party and its allies hold a solid majority . That gives judges little room for political independence especially during those initial DATE in the office .", "...", "CARDINAL . The ORG has been surprised to see a statement by the newly appointed Prosecutor General PERSON that he considers himself to be a member of the team of the President and will fulfil his orders . One would rather expect him to express his loyalty to the law and his independence from the political life .", "CARDINAL . This corresponds to many statements about a history of political influence on the prosecution and the courts . Reportedly CARDINAL of the main reasons for launching the case against Mr. PERSON is to pay back for his actions as Minister of ORG against some of the persons who have now come to power .", "...", "CARDINAL . It has also been mentioned by several persons that there is a tradition of leaving political investigations open and unconcluded for long periods , sometimes years . This practice can keep the defendants well occupied with meetings with the investigator , keeping them from other activities , and also serves as a PERSON sword to the defendants , knowing that the investigator or the prosecutor at any time can forward cases against them with grave consequences .", "If the purpose of the investigation is to promote a political aim not protected by the law by prosecuting somebody for acts for which others are not being prosecuted , and thus not treat everybody equally according to the law , the justice is selective and therefore unfair . The charges raised against the former ministers seem to the experienced eye somewhat far - fetched and one would rather expect them to result in a political than a criminal responsibility , if any at all . This monitoring can not and can not be expected to answer with certainty the question of whether these cases are the result of selective justice . If so it however tells about the legal system and tradition of a country , not about the guilt or innocence of an individual . Selective justice and abuse of criminal justice system is a violation of LAW and falls short of the country \u2019s international obligations to ensure respect for the rule of law principles .", "GPE has been monitored by ORG as to the implementation of the commitments and obligations undertaken when joining that organization . The President of GPE issued on CARDINAL a decree according to which GPE is to fulfill its obligations towards ORG and established a mechanism to oversee it . This process should not be solely focused on the legislative reform . The main problems have been in the culture , tradition and implementation , on top of the outdated and deficient legislation itself ( e.g. NORP Criminal Procedure Code dates back to DATE and its reform is long overdue ) .", "Based on the above observations of the monitoring of the cases against Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON it can be concluded that it would be unwise to stop that monitoring now . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["18", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-2", "5-3", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
