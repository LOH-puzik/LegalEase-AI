The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He is a professor , specialising in child and adolescent psychiatry , at ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the period DATE a research project was carried out at ORG in the field of neuropsychiatry , focusing on cases of ORG ) or Deficits in Attention , ORG ( DAMP ) in children . The aim was to elucidate the significance thereof and associated problems from a long - term perspective . Parents to a group of CARDINAL and fortyone preschool children volunteered to participate in the study , which was followed up DATE . Certain assurances were made to the children \u2019s parents and later to the young people themselves concerning confidentiality . The research file , called the GPE study , was voluminous and consisted of a large number of records , test results , interview replies , questionnaires and video and audio tapes . It contained a very large amount of privacy - sensitive data about the children and their relatives . Several doctoral theses have been based on the GPE study . The material was stored by ORG , of which the applicant was director . The project was originally set up and started by other researchers but the applicant subsequently took over responsibility for completing the study .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant alleged that ORG of ORG had made it a precondition in their permits that sensitive information about the individuals participating in the study would be accessible only to the applicant and his staff and that he had therefore promised absolute confidentiality to the patients and their parents . That fact was disputed by the Government .", "CARDINAL . Two permits were issued by ORG of ORG , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , consisting of CARDINAL page each and indicating , among other things , the dates of application ( respectively CARDINAL DATE and DATE ) , the researchers involved in the project , the name of the project and the date of approval ; they bore the signatures of the chairman and the secretary of ORG . They contained no specific requirements and no reference to \u201c secrecy \u201d or \u201c absolute secrecy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the parents of the children participating in the study , the applicant stated , inter alia :", "\u201c All data will be dealt with in confidentiality and classified as secret . No data processing that enables the identification of your child will take place . No information has been provided previously or will be provided to teachers about your child except that when starting school she / he took part in a study undertaken by ORG , and its present results will , as was the case for the previous study DATE , be followed up . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A later undated letter from the applicant to the participants in the study included the following wording :", "\u201c Participation is of course completely voluntary and as on previous occasions you will never be registered in public data records of any kind and the data will be processed in such a way that nobody apart from those of us who met you and have direct contact with you will be able to find out anything at all about you . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a sociologist , K , requested access to the background material . She was a researcher at ORG and maintained that it was of great importance to have access to the research material and that it could , without risk of damage , be released to her with conditions under LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( Sekretesslagen ; SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . She had no interest in the personal data as such but only in the method used in the research and the evidence the researchers had for their conclusions . Her request was refused by ORG on DATE because K had not shown any connection between the requested material and any research , and on the ground that the material contained data on ORG health status which , if disclosed , might harm an individual or persons related to that individual . An appeal against the decision was lodged with ORG ( ORG ) , which referred the matter to ORG to examine whether the material could be released after removal of identifying information or with a condition restricting ORG right to pass on or use the data . ORG again refused the request on DATE , on the ground that the data requested was subject to secrecy , that there was no possibility of releasing the material after removal of identifying information , nor was there sufficient evidence to conclude that the requested material could be released with conditions . K again appealed against the decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE , a paediatrician , E , also requested access to the material . He submitted that he needed to keep up with current research , that he was interested in how the research in question had been carried out and in clarifying how the researchers had arrived at their results , and that it was important to the neuropsychiatric debate that the material should be exposed to independent critical examination . His request was refused by ORG on DATE , for the same reasons as its refusal to K , a decision against which E appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL separate judgments of DATE , ORG found that K and E had shown a legitimate interest in gaining access to the material in question and that they could be assumed to be well acquainted with the handling of confidential data . Therefore , access should be granted to K and E , but subject to conditions made by ORG in order to protect the interests of the individuals concerned in accordance with various named provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG request to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) for relief for substantive defects ( resning ) was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In vain the applicant and some of the individuals participating in the study also applied to ORG for relief for substantive defects . Their requests were refused on DATE , CARDINAL May and CARDINAL DATE respectively , because they were not considered to be party to the case ( bristande taler\u00e4tt ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG decided that , \u201c provided that the individuals concerned gave their consent \u201d , the documents would be released to K and E with conditions specified in detail in the decisions .", "CARDINAL . K and E appealed against certain of the conditions imposed by ORG . They also reported ORG handling of the case to ORG , which in decisions of DATE criticised ORG , notably regarding the delays in replying to the request for access .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL separate judgments of CARDINAL DATE , ORG lifted some of the conditions imposed by the university . It pointed out that in the judgments of DATE K and E had already been given the right of access to the requested documents and that the only matter under examination was the conditions of access , which could only be imposed if they were designed to remove a given risk of damage , and that a condition should be framed to restrict the recipient \u2019s right of disposal over the data . Thereafter , CARDINAL conditions were set regarding ORG access , including that the data was only to be used within ORG funded research project called \u201c The neurological paradigm : on the establishment of a new grand theory in GPE \u201d which K had specified before ORG , that she was not allowed to remove copies from the LOC where she was given access to the documents , and that transcripts of released documents containing data on psychological , medical or neurological examinations or treatment , or concerning the personal circumstances of individuals , and notes concerning such examinations , treatment or circumstances from a document released to her , would be destroyed when the above research project was completed and at the latest by DATE . CARDINAL similar conditions were also imposed on E , including that data in the released documents referring to psychological , medical , psychiatric or neurological examinations or treatment , and data in the released documents concerning the personal circumstances of an individual , was to be used for examination of how the researchers who participated in the research project in which the documents had been used had arrived at their results and conclusions , and so that E could generally maintain his competence as a paediatrician .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not have a right to appeal against the judgments and on DATE the applicant \u2019s request to ORG for relief for substantive defects was refused because he was not considered to be a party to the case .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the applicant , the NORP of the university stated that , by virtue of the judgments of ORG , K and E were entitled to immediate access to the documents on the conditions specified . Furthermore , by decision of the university , K and E were to be given access to the documents on the university \u2019s premises on a named street and the documents therefore had to be moved there from ORG without delay .

The applicant replied in a letter of CARDINAL DATE that he did not intend to hand over either the material or the keys to the filing cabinets to P. On DATE the Vice - Chancellor had a meeting with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On instruction by the Vice - Chancellor , on DATE P visited ORG . He was met by controller L , who handed him a document showing that L had been instructed by the applicant not to release either the material in question or the keys to the filing cabinets .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE the Vice - Chancellor of ORG informed K and E that since the applicant refused to transfer the material for the present he could not help them any further and that he was considering bringing the applicant before ORG ( Statens ansvarsn\u00e4mnd ) on grounds of disobedience .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant had a meeting with the Vice - Chancellor of ORG about the case . Moreover , in DATE the applicant and various persons corresponded with the ORG , including a professor of jurisprudence and Assistant Director General of ORG who questioned the judgments of ORG , which prompted the Vice - Chancellor to consider whether it would be possible to impose new conditions on K and PERSON The case was discussed within ORG and subsequently , by decision of DATE , ORG decided to refuse to grant access to K because , in the light of a memorandum drawn up on DATE by ORG , there was no connection between ORG research and the research project that she had specified before ORG . Likewise , in a decision of DATE the university decided to impose a new condition on E before giving him access . It stated that it had reason to believe that E \u2019s activities and position did not justify giving him access to the material , even subject to restrictions . E thus had to demonstrate that his duties for the municipality included reviewing or otherwise acquiring information about the basic material on which the research in question was based .", "CARDINAL . The decisions were annulled by ORG by CARDINAL separate judgments of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s request to ORG for relief for substantive defects was refused on DATE and DATE , because he was not considered to be party to the case .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , according to the applicant , the research material was destroyed during DATE of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE by CARDINAL of his colleagues .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant and by a judgment of DATE ORG ( ORG ) convicted the applicant of misuse of office pursuant to LAW , LAW ( ORG ) . The applicant was given a suspended sentence and ordered to pay CARDINAL day - fines of MONEY ( SEK ) , amounting to a total of SEK CARDINAL , ( MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The Vice - Chancellor of the university was also convicted of misuse of office for having disregarded , through negligence , his obligations as Vice - Chancellor by failing to ensure that the documents were available for release as ordered in accordance with the judgments of ORG .

On appeal , on DATE the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence were upheld by ORG NORP ) in the following terms :", "General observations on the university \u2019s management of the case", "\u201c In its CARDINAL initial judgments of DATE ORG held that K and E were entitled to have access to the documents requested . In its CARDINAL subsequent judgments of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided on the conditions that would apply in connection with the release of the documents to them . The judgments of ORG had therefore settled the question of whether the documents were to be released to K and E once and for all .", "At the hearing in ORG , the university had the opportunity to present reasons why the documents requested should not be released to K and E. Once the judgments , against which no appeal could be made , had been issued in DATE , whether or not the university considered that they were based on erroneous or insufficient grounds had no significance . After the DATE judgments the university was only required to formulate the conditions it considered necessary to avoid the risk of any individuals sustaining harm through the release of the documents . Subsequently the university had the opportunity to present its arguments to ORG for the formulation of the conditions it had chosen . After ORG had determined which conditions could be accepted , the question of the terms on which [ K and E ] could be allowed access to the documents requested was also settled once and for all . There was then no scope for the university to undertake any new appraisal of ORG and E \u2019s right of access to the documents .", "Therefore , in the period referred to in the indictment [ from DATE until DATE ] it was no longer the secrecy legislation that was to be interpreted but the judgments of ORG . Their contents were clear . [ The Vice - Chancellor \u2019s ] letters of DATE to [ the applicant ] and of CARDINAL DATE to K and E show that the university administration had understood that it was incumbent on the university to release the documents without delay .", "The promptness required by LAW in responding to a request for access to a public document should in itself have caused the university to avoid measures leading to further delay in releasing the documents . Despite this , in its interpretation of the conditions and in laying down additional conditions , the university made it more difficult for K and E to gain access to the documents . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s liability", "\u201c The prosecutor has maintained that after the judgments of ORG of CARDINAL DATE and until DATE , when the material is said to have been destroyed , [ the applicant ] in his capacity as head of ORG , wilfully disregarded the obligations of his office by failing to comply with the judgments of ORG and allow [ E and K ] access to the documents . According to the indictment , [ the applicant ] in so doing not only refused to hand over the documents in person but also refused to make them available to the university administration .", "The research material was the property of the university and hence to be regarded as in the public domain . It was stored in ORG , where [ the applicant ] was the head . [ The Vice - Chancellor \u2019s ] letter of DATE , to which copies of the judgments of ORG relating to the conditions were attached , made it clear to [ the applicant ] that the material in question must be released . As head of the department , [ the applicant ] was responsible for making the material available to [ K and E ] . [ The applicant \u2019s ] awareness of his immediate responsibility is revealed not least by the instructions that he gave to [ L ] before the visit of [ P ] not to allow the university administration access to the material . It is also shown by [ the applicant \u2019s ] written reply on DATE to [ the Vice - Chancellor ] .", "Through [ the Vice - Chancellor ] the university had instructed [ the applicant ] to release the material to the university , so that it could be moved to premises where K and E could examine it . In view of this , ORG , like ORG , does not consider that [ the applicant ] can be held culpable because he refused to hand over the documents in person . However , it was incumbent upon him to make the documents available for removal in accordance with the instructions he had received from the university .", "[ The applicant ] has protested that he did not consider that there was any serious intent behind the instruction he received from the [ Vice - Chancellor ] on DATE . Here he has referred in particular to the meeting on DATE and to the fact that P did not follow up his visit to the department and that he received no new directive to make the material available .", "[ The Vice - Chancellor ] , however , has stated that on no occasion did he withdraw the instructions issued on DATE , and that it must have been quite clear to [ the applicant ] that they continued to apply , even though they were not explicitly repeated . According to the Vice - Chancellor , nothing transpired at the meeting on DATE that could have given [ the applicant ] the impression that these instructions no longer applied or that they were not intended seriously . [ The Vice - Chancellor \u2019s ] statement in this respect has been confirmed by the Director at the Vice - Chancellor \u2019s office , W. It is further borne out by the fact that after the meeting on DATE W was given the task of drawing up a complaint to ORG for Higher Officials on the subject of [ the applicant \u2019s ] refusals and that the latter was aware that a complaint of this kind was being considered . In addition , it can be seen from a number of e - mails from [ the applicant ] to [ the Vice - Chancellor ] that during the entire autumn he considered that he was required to hand over the documents and that he maintained his original refusal to obey his instructions . It has also been shown that when ORG met on DATE , [ the Vice - Chancellor ] was still considering making a complaint to ORG . Finally , [ a witness , AW ] has testified that at a meeting with [ the applicant ] shortly after DATE , when asked whether he still persisted in his refusal , he confirmed that this was the case .", "All things considered , ORG finds that it has been shown that [ the applicant ] was aware that the instructions to make the material available to the administration applied during the entire period from when he learnt about the judgments of ORG on DATE . It was incumbent on him to take the action required to comply with the judgments .", "[ The applicant ] has stated that he was never prepared to participate in the release of the documents to K and PERSON His actions were , in other words , intentional and their result was that K and E were categorically denied a right that is guaranteed by the LAW and that is also of fundamental importance in principle . All things considered , ORG finds that [ the applicant \u2019s ] conduct means that he disregarded the obligation that applied to him as head of department in such a manner that the offence of misuse of office should be considered . [ The applicant ] has however also objected that his conduct should be regarded as excusable in view of the other considerations that he had to bear in mind .", "He has thus claimed that in the situation that had arisen he was prevented by medical ethics and research ethics from disclosing information about the participants in the study and their relatives . He referred in particular to international declarations drawn up by ORG and to the Convention .", "The nature of the international declarations agreed on by ORG is not such as to give them precedence over NORP law . [ The applicant \u2019s ] objections on the basis of the contents of these declarations therefore lack significance in this case .", "LAW lays down that everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family life , and that this right may not be interfered with by a public body except in certain specified cases . The provisions of LAW are intended , in accordance with LAW , to protect individuals from the disclosure to others of information about their personal circumstances in cases other than those that can be regarded as acceptable with regard to the right to insight into the workings of the public administration . These regulations must be considered to comply with the requirements of the LAW , and the judgments of ORG lay down how they are to be interpreted in this particular case . [ The applicant \u2019s ] objection that his conduct was excusable in the light of the LAW can not , therefore , be accepted .", "[ The applicant ] has also asserted that he risked criminal prosecution for breach of professional secrecy if he released the documents to [ K and E ] . However , the judgments of ORG determined once and for all that the secrecy LAW permitted release of the documents . For this reason there was of course no possibility of prosecution for breach of professional secrecy , which , in the opinion of ORG , [ the applicant ] must have realised .", "[ The applicant ] has also stated that he was bound by the assurances of confidentiality he had given to the participants in the study in accordance with the requirements established for the research project . The assurances were given in DATE , in the following terms : \u201c All data will be dealt with in confidence and classified as secret . No data processing that enables the identification of your child will take place . No information has been provided previously or will be provided to teachers about your child except that when starting school she / he took part in a study undertaken by ORG and its present results will , as was the case for the previous study DATE , be followed up . \u201d A later assurance of confidentiality had the following wording : \u201c Participation is of course completely voluntary and as on previous occasions you will never be registered in public data records of any kind and the data will be processed in such a way that nobody apart from those of us who met you and have direct contact with you will be able to find out anything at all about you . \u201d", "The assurances of confidentiality given to the participants in the study go , at least in some respects , further than the Secrecy Acts permits . ORG notes that there is no possibility in law to provide greater secrecy than follows from LAW and that it is not possible to make decisions on issues concerning confidentiality until the release of a document is requested . It follows therefore that the assurances of confidentiality cited above did not take precedence over the law as it stands or a court \u2019s application of the statutes . [ The applicant \u2019s ] objections therefore have no relevance in assessing his criminal liability .", "Finally , [ the applicant ] has claimed that his actions were justifiable in view of the discredit that NORP research would incur and the decline in willingness to participate in medical research projects that would ensue if information submitted in confidence were then to be disclosed to private individuals . ORG notes that there are other possibilities of safeguarding research interests , for example by removing details that enable identification from research material so that sensitive information can not be divulged . What [ the applicant ] has adduced on this issue can not exonerate him from liability .", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] actions were therefore not excusable . On the contrary , for a considerable period he failed to comply with his obligations as a public official arising from the judgments of ORG . His offence can not be considered a minor CARDINAL . [ The applicant ] shall therefore be found guilty of misuse of office for the period after DATE , when he was informed of the judgments of ORG . The offence is a serious one as [ the applicant ] wilfully disregarded the constitutional right of access to public documents . On the question of the sentence , ORG concurs with the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The principle of public access to official documents ( offenlighetsprincipen ) has a history of DATE in GPE and is CARDINAL of the cornerstones of NORP democracy . CARDINAL of its main characteristics is the constitutional right for everyone to study and be informed of the contents of official documents held by the public authorities . This principle allows the public and the media to exercise scrutiny of the ORG , the municipalities and other parts of the public sector which , in turn , contributes to the free exchange of opinions and ideas and to efficient and correct management of public affairs and , thereby , to maintaining the legitimacy of the democratic system ( see ORG . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . The principle of public access to official documents is enshrined in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of the Freedom of the Press Act . Thus , every NORP citizen is entitled to have free access to official documents , in order to encourage the free exchange of opinion and the availability of comprehensive information ( LAW , LAW ; foreign nationals enjoy the same rights in this respect as NORP citizens , LAW , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A document is official if it is held by and is regarded as having been received or \u201c drawn up \u201d by a public authority ( LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL , of the Freedom of the Press Act ) . A document is \u201c drawn up \u201d when it is dispatched by an authority . A document that is not dispatched is \u201c drawn up \u201d when the matter to which it relates is finally settled by the authority in question . If the document does not relate to any specific matter , it is \u201c drawn up \u201d when it has been finally checked or has otherwise received its final form . As research is considered to be an activity in its own right ( faktiskt handlande ) ( see , for example , the Chancellor of ORG , DATE p. CARDINAL ) , it can not be said to relate to any specific matter . This means , in turn , that research material , as a rule , is \u201c drawn up \u201d and thereby official , as soon as it has been finally checked or otherwise received its final form . It could be added that preliminary outlines , drafts , and similar documents enumerated in LAW , LAW , of the Freedom of the Press Act are not deemed to be official unless they introduce new factual information or have been accepted for filing . Finally , there is no general requirement that a document be filed in order to be considered official , and registration does not affect the issue of whether a document is official or not ( cf . LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . An official document to which the public has access shall be made available on request forthwith , or as soon as possible , at the place where it is held , and free of charge , to any person wishing to examine it , in such form that it can be read , listened to , or otherwise comprehended ; a document may also be copied , reproduced or used for sound transmission ( LAW , LAW ) . Such a decision should normally be rendered DATE or , if the public authority in question has to consider whether the requested document is official or whether the information is public , within DATE ( see , for example , ORG decision of DATE in case no . DATE ) . A certain delay may also be acceptable if the request concerns very extensive material . If a document can not be made available without disclosure of such part of it as constitutes classified material , the rest of the document shall be made available to the person requesting access in the form of a transcript or copy ( Section CARDINAL ) . A public authority is under no obligation to make a document available at the place where it is held if this presents serious difficulty .", "CARDINAL . An unlimited right of public access to official documents could , however , result in unacceptable harm to different public and private interests . It has therefore been considered necessary to provide exceptions . These exceptions are laid down in LAW , LAW ( first paragraph ) , of the Freedom of the Press Act , which reads as follows :", "The right of access to official documents may be restricted only if restriction is necessary having regard to CARDINAL . the security of the ORG or its relations with another ORG or an international organisation ; PERSON . the central DATE , monetary or currency policy of the ORG ; CARDINAL . the inspection , control or other supervisory activities of a public authority ; CARDINAL . the interest of preventing or prosecuting crime ; CARDINAL . the economic interest of the public institutions ; CARDINAL . the protection of the personal or economic circumstances of private subjects ; CARDINAL . the preservation of animal or plant species .", "CARDINAL . According to paragraph CARDINAL of the same provision , restrictions on the right of access to official documents shall be scrupulously specified in a provision of a special act of law or , if this is deemed more appropriate in a particular case , in another act of law to which the special act refers ( see , for example , Govt . PERSON pp . CARDINAL et seq . and Govt . PERSON , Part A , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) . The special act of law referred to is LAW . Pursuant to such a provision , the Government may issue more detailed provisions for its application in an ordinance ( f\u00f6rordning ) . Since the mandate to restrict the right of public access to official documents lies exclusively with ORG ( PERSON ) , it is not possible for a public authority to enter into an agreement with a third party exempting certain official documents from the right of public access , or to make similar arrangements .", "CARDINAL . LAW contains provisions regarding the duty to observe secrecy in the activities of the community and regarding prohibitions against making official documents available ( LAW , LAW ) . The latter provisions limit the right of access to official documents provided for in the Freedom of the Press Act ( Tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen , ORG ) . They relate to prohibitions on disclosing information , irrespective of the manner of disclosure . The question of whether secrecy should apply to information contained in an official document can not be determined in advance , but must be examined each time a request for access to a document is made . Decisive for this issue is whether making a document available could imply a certain risk of harm . The risk of harm is defined in different ways in LAW , having regard to the interests that the secrecy is intended to protect . Thus , the secrecy may be more or less strict depending on the interests involved . The secrecy legislation has been elaborated in this way in order to provide sufficient protection , for example , for the personal integrity of individuals , without the constitutional right of public access to official documents being circumscribed more than is considered necessary . In the present case , ORG , in its judgments of DATE , found that secrecy applied to the research material under LAW , DATE , DATE and DATE , of LAW ( Chapter CARDINAL deals with secrecy with regard to the protection of the personal circumstances of individuals ) .", "CARDINAL . If a public authority deems that such a risk of loss , harm , or other inconvenience which , pursuant to a provision on secrecy , constitutes an obstacle to information being communicated to a private subject , can be removed by imposing a restriction limiting the private subject \u2019s right to re - communicate or use the information , the authority shall impose such a restriction when the information is communicated ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . As an example of such a restriction , the preparatory notes mention prohibiting the dissemination of the content of a document or the publication of secret information contained in a document ( see Govt . PERSON , Part A , p. CARDINAL ) . An individual who has been granted access to a document subject to a restriction limiting the right to use the information may be held criminally liable if he or she does not respect that restriction ( see LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . A request to examine an official document must be made to the public authority which holds the document ( LAW , LAW , of ORG , of LAW ) . As mentioned above , there are specific requirements of promptness regarding the handling of such requests . A decision by an authority other than ORG or the Government to refuse access to a document is subject to appeal to the courts DATE as a general rule , an administrative court of appeal \u2013 and , further , to ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , LAW , of ORG ; LAW , LAW , of LAW CARDINAL and DATE LAW ( ORG ; SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) . Leave to appeal is required in the last - mentioned court . Only the person seeking access has a right of appeal . Thus , if ORG \u2013 contrary to the public authority holding the document in question \u2013 decides that a document must be made available , its judgment is not open to appeal by the public authority in question , or by private subjects who consider that harm would be inflicted on them as a consequence of access to the document being granted ( see R\u00c5 DATE note CARDINAL and R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL ) . The reason why the right of appeal has been narrowly limited is that once the competing interests have been considered by a court the legislator has given priority to the principle of public access to official documents over other private and public interests ( see , for example , Govt . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL p. CARDINAL and R\u00c5 DATE ref . CARDINAL , which concerned an institution \u2019s request for relief for substantive defects ) .", "CARDINAL . The principle of public access to official documents is applicable to all activities within the public sector and every public official is obliged to be acquainted with the laws and regulations in this area . This is in particular the case where a certain official \u2013 following a special decision or otherwise \u2013 has the duty to examine requests for access to official documents ( LAW , LAW , second paragraph of LAW ) . Formally , the head of the public authority has the primary responsibility to ensure that such requests are duly examined . However , the task may be delegated to other office holders within the authority and this is what is usually done in practice for the purposes of the authority \u2019s DATE activities . Such delegation has to be in accordance with the regulations of the authority ( Section CARDINAL of the former ORG , PERSON , applicable at the relevant time ) . Irrespective of a public official \u2019s particular competence or power under the regulations of the authority in question , he or she has a general duty to perform the tasks that are part of his or her official duties . As previously mentioned , this duty involves the obligation to assist in making official documents available forthwith , or as soon as possible , to persons who are considered to have the right of access to them under the legislation described above .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of LAW , LAW , of LAW a person who , in the exercise of public authority , by act or by omission , intentionally or through carelessness , disregards the duties of his office , will be sentenced for misuse of office ( tj\u00e4nstefel ) . The provision reads as follows :", "\u201c A person who , in the exercise of public authority , by act or by omission , intentionally or through carelessness , disregards the duties of his office , shall be sentenced for misuse of office to a fine or a maximum term of imprisonment of DATE . If , having regard to the perpetrator \u2019s official powers or the nature of his office considered in relation to his exercise of public power in other respects or having regard to other circumstances , the act may be regarded as petty , punishment shall not be imposed . If an offence mentioned in the first paragraph has been committed intentionally and is regarded as serious , the perpetrator shall be sentenced for gross misuse of office to a term of imprisonment of DATE and at DATE .

The functions and powers of the CARDINAL Parliamentary Ombudsmen are laid down in particular in LAW , LAW ( ORG ) and in LAW with Instructions for the Parliamentary Ombudsmen ( ORG med instruktion f\u00f6r PERSON ombudsm\u00e4n ; SFCARDINAL CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . Their main task is to supervise the application of laws and other regulations in the public administration . It is their particular duty to ensure that public authorities and their staff comply with the laws and other statutes governing their actions . An Ombudsman exercises supervision , either on complaint from individuals or of his or her own motion , by carrying out inspections and other investigations which he or she deems necessary . The examination of a matter is concluded by a decision in which the ORG states his or her opinion whether the measure taken by the authority contravenes the law or is otherwise wrongful or inappropriate . The Ombudsmen may also make pronouncements aimed at promoting uniform and proper application of the law . An ORG \u2019s decisions are considered to be expressions of his or her personal opinion . They are not legally binding upon the authorities . However , they do have persuasive force , command respect and are usually followed in practice . An ORG may , among many other things , institute criminal proceedings against an official who has committed an offence by departing from the obligations incumbent on him or her in his or her official duties ( for example , as in the present case , misuse of office ) . The ORG may also report an official to the competent authority for disciplinary measures .
