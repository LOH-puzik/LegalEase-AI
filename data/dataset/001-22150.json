POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals , a married couple who were born on DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant is a mother of CARDINAL children : Em . PERSON , born DATE , Ew . ORG , born in DATE , PERSON . PERSON , born in DATE , GPE . PERSON , born in DATE , PERSON , born in DATE , PERSON , born in DATE , PERSON , born in DATE , PERSON , born in DATE and PERSON , born in DATE .", "On DATE the ORG divested the first applicant of her parental rights in respect of her then CARDINAL children : Em . PERSON , NORP . PERSON . PERSON , GPE . PERSON , PERSON and PERSON Later on , PERSON and PERSON were adopted by another family , and for Em . PERSON , NORP . PERSON . PERSON and GPE . PERSON the court established a foster family , the first applicant 's parents , the grandparents of the children .", "On DATE the first applicant 's first husband PERSON , the father of CARDINAL of her children : PERSON . PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , died .", "On DATE the ORG restricted the exercise of the applicant 's custody rights in respect of the other CARDINAL children , PERSON and PERSON , in such a manner that the court appointed a guardian to monitor the family . In both decisions , given in DATE and in DATE , the court considered that the mother had been manifestly neglecting her parental duties towards the children and abused alcohol .", "In DATE PERSON was born . Later on , PERSON . was established to be the father of this child in a judgment of ORG of DATE .", "In DATE PERSON , the first applicant 's parents , requested ORG to divest the first applicant of her parental rights and establish them grandparents as a foster family also for PERSON , ORG and PERSON", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court divested the first applicant of her parental rights in respect of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , decided to place them in public care and appointed guardians for all CARDINAL children . The court also refused to appoint the grandparents as the foster family .", "The court first recalled the decisions of DATE and DATE as the background of the case . The case - files of these CARDINAL sets of the proceedings were before the court . It further noted that even after the decision of DATE had been given , the first applicant exercised her parental rights in a manner open to criticism - she abused alcohol , was promiscuous and did not take proper care of the children , who were dirty and did not have adequate clothes . The efforts of the guardians , the local social assistance worker and the police to make the applicant comply with her parental obligations had proved successful only for short periods of time , after the talks they had with her .", "After PERSON . , the father of PERSON , had died on an unspecified date , the applicant began a relationship with another man , PERSON At the beginning she slightly improved her ways towards the children , but later on they started to drink alcohol together , PERSON battered the first applicant and her children , and on several occasions the police intervened .", "It further noted that on DATE the first applicant left home without leaving any contact address . PERSON and her parents took care of the CARDINAL children . The grandparents had been unable to take proper care of the older CARDINAL children , in respect of whom they had been appointed foster parents in DATE . The flat was dirty and they lacked basic personal hygiene habits . The flat was also relatively small and disorderly and the children did not have any table on which to do their homework . Despite the fact that the foster family had an income of CARDINAL ORG , which could not be considered small , this was not reflected in the quality of material conditions of the children 's lives . The grandparents also had a certain tendency to abuse alcohol , and did not deny , when asked by the court , that from time to time they liked to drink . They were unwilling to co - operate with the guardians appointed by the court . In particular the first applicant 's mother had tried to hide from the guardians the educational problems she had with the eldest daughter Em . , whose behaviour had begun to resemble that of her mother . They also failed to comply with the guardian 's suggestions to try to isolate the children from the pathogenic influence of the mother .", "Since the CARDINAL children had been placed in public care , their older siblings , grandparents and mother visited them very often . These children were nervous , seriously retarded in their emotional and intellectual development and wet their beds during TIME .", "It further considered that the conduct of the first applicant towards her children was such as to justify the conclusion that she had been consistently neglecting them . This was highlighted by , inter alia , the fact that in DATE she had left home - not for the first time - for DATE , leaving no contact address and leaving the children under the care of her then partner , who had beaten them in the past . The court observed that the first applicant must have had strong sexual urges , as shown by the number of children she had by different men . She had often and casually taken up new relationships with men and was entirely absorbed by her personal life , to the detriment of the children . This demonstrated that she lacked the responsibility and maturity which were necessary for ensuring a proper care for her children and for ensuring that they were brought up in an atmosphere of love and stability . The court stressed that it had been the first applicant 's parents themselves who had requested that she be divested of her parental rights . The first applicant , in the light of her consistent conduct , had not given any guarantees that she would mend her ways . The prior decisions of the courts to divest her of parental rights were proved to be correct , and the same decision in respect of the further CARDINAL children was called for .", "The court further considered the request of the first applicant 's parents to appoint them as a foster family . The court referred to the best interest of the CARDINAL younger children , who , in view of their state needed conscientious professional care . The ageing grandparents were clearly unable to ensure such care for them , as shown by the fact that their care in respect of the older children had already proved inadequate . They limited their role to ensuring basic living conditions , but their educational skills left much to be desired .", "The court acknowledged that the first applicant 's parents loved their grandchildren , but the emotional state of the younger children and the delays in normal development warranted their placing in public care . This solution was dictated by their best interests : they should be permanently separated from their mother so that she would not have any detrimental influence on their education . Thus , the placing of the children in public care , with a view to a possible adoption , would ensure their normal and healthy development .", "The following evidence was relied on : the testimony of the first applicant 's parents , her own testimony , the case - files of the previous proceedings , the testimony of the guardian appointed to monitor the family , the reports she had prepared from the monitoring exercise and the report on the children drafted by the staff of the local emergency public care centre in which the CARDINAL children had been placed .", "The court relied on LAW , item CARDINAL , of ORG .", "The first applicant and her parents appealed against this decision .", "On DATE ORG upheld the contested decision . The court observed that the lower court , when taking its decision , had primarily had regard to the best interests of the children and had carefully reasoned its decision . It had had regard to the opinion prepared by the local public care centre as to the children 's state , which certified that they had been badly neglected . It had also questioned the guardian , who stated , in particular , that the first applicant 's parents used to drink occasionally , as they had themselves confirmed before the court . The lower court had further taken into consideration that the first applicant 's parents lacked parenting skills as shown by the difficulties they had with the older children : Em . had schooling problems and was very often absent , PERSON . was in a school for retarded children and therefore needed special attention , PERSON . was neglected , dirty , and also had school problems and was , as a result , ostracised by other pupils .", "It was stressed that the placing of the children in a public care did not mean that all contacts with their family would be cut . It remained open to them to visit the children at the children 's home , and to take them for holidays , if the family court decided that this was appropriate .", "It further examined the first applicant 's appeal . It noted that she had stated that she had a new partner whom she wished to marry . This , in the court 's opinion , did not amount to a convincing argument that she would mend her ways : in the past it was primarily the applicant 's new relationships with her successive partners which had made her focus entirely on her personal life and neglect her mothering obligations . Thus , the fact that she had a new partner did not guarantee in itself that she would take adequate care of her children . It also noted that the new partner , the second applicant , did not himself provide any guarantees in this respect , given that he had allowed her to live with him for DATE and had disregarded the fact that she left her children for DATE without any information about her whereabouts .", "The court concluded that the decision of the lower court , upheld by ORG , was lawful and justified .", "ORG PERSON i GPE ) of DATE provides :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the interests of a child are in danger , the court shall issue a relevant order .", "CARDINAL .

If the grounds on which the parental rights had been withdrawn , cease to exist , the court may restore the rights to the parents .", "Under LAW , the duties and rights connected with carrying out the day - to - day care and educational obligations in respect of the children who have been placed in a public care institution or with a foster family , are carried out by the institution or by the foster family .", "According to LAW , the family court shall , if the best interest of the child so requires , prohibit access to the child by parents who have been divested of their parental rights ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
