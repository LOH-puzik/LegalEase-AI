The first applicant , Mr ORG PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in PERSON in DATE . The second applicant is PERSON , a NORP national who was born in DATE . The third applicant is their daughter , PERSON , who was born on DATE . The second and third applicants reside in GPE , GPE , as did the first applicant , before he was expelled to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant lived in GPE as from DATE until he went to GPE , where he arrived on DATE , without passport or other identity document . On DATE he applied for asylum .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE he met the second applicant . The couple started cohabiting in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant 's asylum application was rejected by ORG on DATE . He appealed to ORG and , pending a decision of his appeal , he was granted a stay of execution of his expulsion and a temporary work permit .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants got engaged on DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal , stating inter alia", "\u201c This administrative decision means that the appellant is obliged to leave the country voluntarily . If the appellant does not leave the country voluntarily , the police shall implement the decision ; see sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Shortly thereafter ORG of LAW sent a notification of the decision to the first applicant 's lawyer , giving the first applicant until DATE to leave GPE . The notification further stated :", "\u201c Your client must contact ORG as soon as possible to make arrangements for his departure from GPE . If we have not been contacted by the time the deadline expires , the decision will be implemented in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW . This could result in his arrest without further notice . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested ORG to stay his expulsion , which ORG refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . No judicial appeal was lodged against the above decisions , which became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and second applicants got married .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for a work permit on the ground of family reunification . ORG rejected the application on DATE and ordered him to leave GPE while indicating that the decision could be appealed against and that the police could set a time - limit for asking for respite of the expulsion . The decision was notified to him by local police on DATE with an order to leave the country by DATE . The ORG considered that the first applicant fell within a group of persons who were granted work permit for the purpose of family reunification under section CARDINAL of LAW ( and LAW ) ) but rejected the application on the ground that it was not documented that he had fulfilled the condition of ensured means of subsistence ( LAW ) . In the view of the ORG , there were no particularly strong human considerations warranting an exception being made from this condition in the instant case ( LAW ) ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant again appealed and requested stay of execution . ORG rejected the request and local police notified him thereof on DATE with an order to leave GPE by DATE .", "CARDINAL . Concurrently with ORG examination of the first applicant 's appeal of DATE , ORG on DATE warned him that it was contemplating to expel him pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of LAW . It referred to his registered gainful employment since DATE and to his having worked in breach of section CARDINAL of LAW since the rejection of his asylum application on DATE . Moreover , the ORG referred to his defiance of his obligation to comply with the time - limit for leaving the country after the rejection of his asylum request . The ORG considered that he had seriously contravened the provisions of the LAW and had evaded implementation of the order to leave the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to expel the applicant pursuant section CARDINAL ) of LAW . It found that the applicant 's alleged ignorance of the unlawfulness of his gainful occupation was no excuse and that it would not be disproportionate to expel him despite his marriage with the second applicant . It decided to prohibit the first applicant from re - entry into GPE for DATE , with a possibility of re - entry on application - normally only after DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG rejection of his request for family reunification and its decision that the basic conditions for expelling the first applicant under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW were fulfilled ; for DATE he had been in gainful occupation without a work / residence permit . ORG also noted that he had avoided the implementation of the decision refusing him asylum and obliging him to leave the country . ORG found that his expulsion would not be disproportionate or otherwise contrary to LAW . It also dismissed his appeal against the ORG 's rejection of his application for a work permit .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE as being invalid .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG observed that it found it obvious that the basic condition for expelling the first applicant \u2013 that he had seriously or repeatedly violated LAW or had defied implementation of the decision that he should leave the country \u2013 had been fulfilled . The question then was whether expulsion would be a disproportionate measure vis - \u00e0 - vis the first applicant and his close family .", "CARDINAL . In this regard ORG observed that , although the first applicant had failed to comply with CARDINAL of the conditions for contracting marriage in GPE , namely lawful residence in the country ( sections DATE ) and CARDINAL ( k ) of LAW DATE ) , he had had reason to believe ( as from DATE ) that he had a right to stay and to apply for a work permit and a residence permit . While he had failed to respect CARDINAL time - limits for leaving the country ( DATE and DATE ) , he could not be criticised for having exceeded such deadlines after DATE as the information furnished to him by ORG had been unclear as to the time - limits set for his leaving the country compared to those set for asking respite and the replies given to his requests for respite . He had worked unlawfully for DATE and had resided unlawfully for DATE . This was , relatively speaking , not a very serious offence , which fact counterbalanced his relatively weak links to GPE . To impose a prohibition on re - entry for DATE would constitute a disproportionate measure towards the applicant and his family in the sense of section CARDINAL of LAW . It could easily lead to the dissolution of the family . The second applicant would presumably have great difficulties of adaptation in the first applicant 's home country . Even if the first applicant could apply for re - entry after DATE , he would most probably only be granted permission to come for shorter visits . ORG found it unnecessary to examine whether the disputed decision violated LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the ORG against ORG judgment , ORG reached a different conclusion . By a judgment of DATE , it found that the first applicant 's omission to leave the country voluntarily , although not the same as going under ground , meant that he had avoided compliance with the order to leave the country , meaning that the basic conditions for his expulsion under LAW of LAW were fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted from the outset that the first applicant had acknowledged that he had seriously or repeatedly infringed the provisions of LAW and that the formal conditions for expulsion were fulfilled . The first applicant disputed that he had evaded a decision to leave the country and had only omitted to voluntarily comply with the decision . However , ORG considered that also such an omission constituted evasion for the purposes of the act , although it was less serious than going under ground .", "CARDINAL . The High Court found it established that the applicant had stayed lawfully in GPE from DATE to DATE . It was undisputed that his stay was unlawful from DATE or DATE until DATE when he applied for family reunification . It was further undisputed that he had worked unlawfully without a work permit for DATE , from CARDINAL September/CARDINAL DATE until DATE , when ORG warned him about expulsion . Thus the formal grounds for expulsion according to LAW ( as defined in Circular CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) were fulfilled .", "CARDINAL . The High Court observed that the central issue was the CARDINAL of proportionality . In this regard it noted that the first applicant 's links to GPE were very limited . He had arrived in GPE aged DATE , without any links to the country . At the time of the impugned decision he had lived there for DATE , parts of the time unlawfully . Already after DATE he had been warned of expulsion . His stay in GPE had been very short and could not have given him any legitimate expectation of being able to live there . This was not significantly altered by his marriage to the second applicant , which had been entered into shortly before the disputed decision and in breach of the provisions on marriage . It was not uncommon for a person whose expulsion had been decided to marry a NORP citizen and use this as an argument to have the expulsion order invalidated . In such a situation expulsion would inevitably interfere with an established family situation . In this case there was no indication that expulsion would entail extra burdens of any kind beyond what followed from the separation .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that the first applicant 's links to GPE were particularly strong and far more so than his links to GPE . In GPE he had lived from DATE until DATE , had studied at university for DATE , and had CARDINAL brothers with whom he was still in contact . Nor were there any concrete factors suggesting that , because he sought asylum in GPE , he would encounter particular problems with the NORP authorities upon return .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second applicant , ORG observed that at the time that they married she must already have been aware of the uncertainty of the first applicant 's stay in GPE . Moreover , she was used to living abroad , having lived for several periods in GPE . LANGUAGE was also the official language of GPE . In the view of ORG , she would not face insurmountable problems by settling in GPE for a shorter or longer period , should she so wish .", "CARDINAL . As to the first applicant 's violations of LAW , ORG found them to be of a certain degree of seriousness but did not find them particularly aggravated . However , having regard to the tenuous character of his links to GPE , ORG considered that the balance of interest was not in his favour . Were it to be otherwise , expulsion would be possible only in very rare cases , with the consequence that this would have for the implementation of adopted immigration policies . The only countervailing consideration was his marriage to the second applicant . However , this could not be decisive ; otherwise it would leave open a practice which would completely undermine the authorities ' implementation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Relying essentially on the same considerations as mentioned above , ORG , taking into account ORG case law , did not find that the disputed decision would be incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal , finding it obvious that the appeal had no prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the first applicant had submitted a new application for a work permit on the ground of family reunification with the second applicant . ORG rejected his application on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the couple had a child , PERSON , who is the third applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected an appeal by the first applicant against ORG refusal of DATE . ORG found that quashing the refusal of re - entry was not required in the interest of the third applicant , inter alia noting that the child had been conceived after a final expulsion order and referring to the circumstances of the entry into marriage . It would be possible for the second and third applicants to live with the first applicant for shorter or longer periods in his home country . Although the fact that the first and second applicants had had a child together substantially altered the assessment of the proportionality of the prohibition of re - entry , ORG still did not find that the measure would be disproportionate . Neither LAW nor LAW could imply a different solution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to stay the applicant 's expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , represented by a lawyer , submitted an application under the Convention , which was received at ORG . They complained that the first applicant 's expulsion would entail a splitting of the family in breach of LAW . It would not be possible for the second and third applicants to accompany him to GPE . They submitted that , having regard to the minor character of his breaches of LAW , the enforcement of the expulsion order would constitute a disproportionate interference with the applicant 's family life . Any such enforcement should await a final decision by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the Section decided , in the circumstances , not to indicate to the Government of GPE , under LAW , the interim measure requested . The circumstances underlying the application were not of the kind to which , in the ORG 's practice , Rule CARDINAL was applied . On DATE the applicants ' lawyer informed the ORG that they wished to maintain their application notwithstanding the refusal to apply Rule CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the first applicant against a rejection by ORG of DATE of a renewed request by the first applicant for family reunion with the third applicant . The request had been made on the basis of a provision in ORG which was applicable to cases of unmarried parents and therefore did not cover the applicants ' case . Nor did the Board see any other reason for altering its earlier decision in the case .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG of LAW expelled the first applicant back to GPE .", "CARDINAL .
