He arrived in the GPE on DATE where , on DATE , he applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . On DATE , assisted by an interpreter , he was interviewed by an official of ORG about the reasons for his asylum request . By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant submitted his corrections and additional remarks to the record of this interview .", "The applicant stated that he had left his hometown for GPE on DATE . He had been apprehended and questioned by the authorities in DATE on suspicion of having transported ORG members . He was released after having convinced the authorities of his innocence . He further stated that , on CARDINAL occasions DATE , he had been apprehended and questioned by the authorities in relation to his son \u2019s refusal to do military service , and that he had been beaten during interrogation . However , this had not been his reason for leaving . He had left because he was being sought by the authorities . He explained that , together with another person , he had owned a bus , and on CARDINAL occasions - i.e. in DATE and DATE respectively - the ORG had forced him to transport ORG members . The ORG members he had been forced to transport in DATE had carried out a bomb attack on the PERSON Anti - Terror Branch office . According to the applicant , the authorities were looking for him since he had transported ORG members in DATE . As he had already been suspected of a similar act in DATE , the applicant decided to flee .", "On DATE the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) in which he complained that his request for asylum or a residence permit had not been determined speedily . On DATE he submitted the grounds for his objection .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) accepted the applicant \u2019s objection that his request for asylum or a residence permit had not been determined speedily , but rejected the applicant \u2019s request . The ORG Secretary noted that the applicant had declared , inter alia , that together with another person , he had owned a bus and that on CARDINAL occasions - i.e. in DATE and DATE respectively - the ORG had forced him to transport ORG members . Furthermore , DATE and his departure from GPE the applicant alleged that he had been questioned and beaten by NORP officials on QUANTITY occasions in relation to his son \u2019s evasion of military service , that he did not belong to or sympathise with any prohibited organisation in GPE and that he had not undertaken any activities against the NORP authorities . The ORG Secretary held that the mere fact of belonging to the NORP minority in GPE was an insufficient ground for granting asylum and that it had not appeared that the applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities . Moreover , as the applicant had stated that the reason for his departure from GPE was not the fact that he had been questioned on QUANTITY occasions about his son , but that he feared that he was wanted by the NORP authorities for having transported ORG members , the ORG Secretary held that the applicant \u2019s fear remained entirely unsubstantiated .", "The ORG Secretary further decided that the applicant was not to be allowed to remain in the GPE pending the examination of a possible objection against this decision .", "On DATE the applicant filed an objection against the decision of DATE . On DATE , he filed a request with the President of ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) for an injunction to suspend his expulsion pending the outcome of the proceedings on the objection .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary reminded the applicant that he was not allowed to await the outcome of the objection proceedings in the GPE . The applicant \u2019s request for an injunction was heard on DATE . The court \u2019s examination of the request was deferred for an indefinite period , given that uncertainties had arisen with respect to the position of NORP .", "The applicant \u2019s objection against the decision of DATE was rejected on DATE by the ORG Secretary . The latter stated that the applicant remained eligible for expulsion .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG sitting in GPE . The applicant further requested this court to issue an injunction against his expulsion pending the appeal proceedings .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG in GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and request for an injunction . It held , inter alia :", "\u201c ... There are no concrete indications that the NORP authorities will persecute the < applicant > upon his return . It is true that , in DATE , he had been detained for DATE on suspicion of having transported terrorists , but was able to convince the authorities of his innocence . He was later unconditionally released . It has not appeared nor has it been found established that he has encountered further problems in this connection .", "< The applicant > further states that since DATE he was questioned CARDINAL times in relation to the refusal of his son PERSON to perform his military service and that on the last occasion on DATE the authorities had given him DATE to report on his son . He did not do so ; nor did he await the consequences of his failure to do so since he left for GPE .", "In addition < the applicant > states that in DATE and DATE he had been forced to transport ORG fighters . During his stay in GPE , < the applicant > learned that in the meantime the authorities had become aware of this . His wife and children were questioned by the authorities because they were looking for < the applicant>. His children would have been ill - treated during those interrogations .", "Whatever may be the case , < the applicant > has not made out a plausible argument that he is in fact wanted by the NORP authorities for his alleged activities . There is no concrete information about his alleged persecution . The letters of family members submitted by < the applicant > can not serve as such . These letters can not be regarded as emanating from an objective verifiable source . Noting the fact that the applicant has already been residing in the GPE for a certain period of time , he could be expected to have substantiated his alleged fear of persecution by way of documents or other means . He has not done so , and that seriously undermines the plausibility of his allegations .", "... it has not been established that the applicant has attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities . ... This leads to the conclusion that < the applicant > has not made out a plausible case that he can claim with justification admission to the GPE as a refugee .", "... From what has been considered in relation to the applicant \u2019s request for asylum , it follows that ... in < the applicant \u2019s > case no facts or circumstances have appeared which can be considered grounds on which it could be held that he runs a real risk , if forcibly expelled to GPE , of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW or comparable provisions in other treaties ; he is not eligible , accordingly , for a residence permit on those grounds . \u201d", "On DATE an order for the applicant \u2019s expulsion was issued to ORG ( vreemdelingenpolitie ) in the applicant \u2019s place of residence .", "The applicant \u2019s opposition ( verzet ) against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was rejected on DATE by ORG sitting in GPE . The applicant \u2019s further request for an injunction against his expulsion pending the outcome of the opposition proceedings was rejected on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant left his then place of residence , which was known to the immigration authorities , for an unknown destination . On DATE , after a police officer had reported a public order disturbance , the applicant was apprehended and detained so that his residence status could be checked . When it appeared that his asylum request had been rejected , the applicant was placed in GPE detention with a view to his expulsion . On DATE the applicant filed a second request for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . On DATE he filed an appeal with ORG against the decision to place him in GPE detention .", "On DATE the applicant was interviewed by an official of ORG about the reasons for his second asylum request . On that occasion the applicant stated that he based his second request on the same grounds as those advanced in support of his first asylum request .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision to place him in GPE detention . It noted that the applicant \u2019s second asylum request was lodged after he had been placed in GPE detention . The court held that prima facie the request did not appear to have much chance of success . Noting that the applicant did not hold either a valid residence permit or a valid proof of identity and that he did not have sufficient means of subsistence , the court ruled that GPE authorities\u2019 fears that the applicant would seek ways to prevent his expulsion could not be considered unfounded . It noted in this connection that his presence in the GPE was illegal and that he had removed himself from the control of the immigration authorities . The court concluded that his placement in GPE detention had been in accordance with the law . It further did not find it established that there were no prospects for the applicant \u2019s expulsion within a reasonable time . Given that the applicant could not be expelled pending a determination by the ORG Secretary on the applicant \u2019s second asylum request and that , according to the relevant statutory provision , this decision had to be taken within DATE , ORG held that in these circumstances it was not unreasonable to prolong the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention until the decision had been taken .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant \u2019s second request for asylum and ruled that the applicant was not allowed to await the outcome of a possible appeal in the GPE . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG and requested this court to issue an injunction against his expulsion pending the examination of his appeal . In his submissions of DATE the applicant mentioned that his cousin ORG had been a vice - president of the political party ORG and had been murdered in DATE by counter - guerrilla forces , that his other cousin ORG , who had played a leading role in politics , had also fled from GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a second appeal with ORG against the decision to place him in GPE detention . On DATE , ORG rejected this appeal . It held that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s arguments , his second asylum request had no apparent chance of succeeding and there were therefore prospects that he would be expelled within a reasonable time . Assuming that the request for an injunction against the applicant \u2019s expulsion would be examined diligently , ORG considered that a continuation of the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention could not be regarded as unlawful or unreasonable .", "On DATE the applicant filed a third appeal with ORG against the decision to place him in GPE detention .", "On DATE , in the proceedings on a second asylum request lodged by ORG , a brother of ORG and ORG and to whom the applicant claimed to be related , ORG held that - in the light of new information submitted by ORG about problems encountered in GPE by the widow of his brother GPE - the ORG Secretary could not have rejected ORG \u2019s second asylum request on the mere basis of a reference to the findings in ORG \u2019s first asylum proceedings . It considered that ORG should be requested to substantiate his alleged family ties with ORG , who was a prominent leader of the ORG , and with ORG \u2019s other brother ORG , who had already been granted a residence permit in the GPE . Consequently , ORG accepted ORG \u2019s appeal as well - founded and ordered the ORG Secretary to take a new decision on ORG \u2019s second asylum request . It further granted ORG \u2019s request for an injunction against his expulsion pending a new decision by the ORG Secretary .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s third appeal against the decision to place him in GPE detention . It held that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s arguments , his request for an injunction against his expulsion did not have a sufficient chance of succeeding . It therefore held that the ORG Secretary could consider that the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention needed to be maintained .", "By letter of DATE the GPE branch of ORG requested ORG of ORG to be given access to the applicant so as to conduct an examination of his physical condition and the specific circumstances of his case . ORG further requested that the applicant should not be expelled during this examination . In this letter , ORG expressed its concerns about the applicant \u2019s situation in that he belonged to a politically active family , that his cousin - vice - president of the political party ORG which together with the DEP party had merged into the political party HADEP - had been murdered in GPE , that CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s sons had refused to do military service and that his son PERSON had been admitted to hospital in GPE with a broken back . On DATE the GPE Branch of ORG repeated its request for access to the applicant .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG sitting in GPE rejected the applicant\u2019 appeal against the decision of DATE as well as his request for an injunction against his expulsion . It ruled that the applicant \u2019s second request for asylum was not based on any new facts or circumstances , and recalled its decision of CARDINAL DATE in which it had held that it had not been established that the applicant was wanted by the NORP authorities . Insofar as the applicant had argued that ORG , on DATE , had unjustly held that it was for the applicant to substantiate his alleged fear of persecution , ORG considered that a new asylum procedure was not meant to be a disguised form of appeal against a recent decision having obtained the force of res iudicata . According to the court , the applicant \u2019s submissions on this point did not concern facts or circumstances that could not have been raised in the course of the proceedings on his first asylum request . This was not altered by the applicant \u2019s allegation that this failing was caused by inadequate assistance by various legal aid advisers .", "Insofar as the applicant could be considered as relying on the ruling of CARDINAL DATE in the case of ORG , ORG noted that in that decision ORG had been ordered to prove his alleged family tie with ORG The court considered that in the present case there was no reason to issue such an order as the applicant had never invoked a similar family tie in his first asylum request , insofar as a family tie with ORG could be assumed at the outset . ORG agreed with the ORG Secretary that it was strange that the applicant , who claimed to have travelled with ORG to the GPE , had not relied on his kinship in the proceedings on his first asylum request .", "ORG found nothing in the applicant \u2019s submissions that could lead to a different finding than the one reached on his first asylum request . It was noted in this connection that , during his first interview , the applicant had stated that he was not involved in politics , that he had been forced on CARDINAL occasions to transport ORG supporters and that it had appeared that he had little knowledge about the NORP flag and anthem . As the applicant had based his second asylum request on grosso modo the same grounds as his first request , ORG concluded that the appeal was ill - founded . ORG did not find it established that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would face a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW .", "On DATE the applicant filed a third request for asylum . On DATE , he filed a fourth appeal against the decision to place him in GPE detention with a view to his expulsion . This appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE , holding inter alia ;", "\u201c ORG is of the opinion that the submissions made on behalf of the alien can not lead to the finding that the placement in GPE detention must now be considered unlawful .", "It is established that ORG sitting in GPE , by decision of DATE , has declared the applicant \u2019s appeal ill - founded and that the second asylum proceedings of the alien have thereby ended .", "In view of the foregoing , the alien is , in the court \u2019s opinion , eligible for expulsion . This is not altered by the fact that the alien has filed a third asylum request as it has not been established that this request would be automatically granted .", "ORG further finds that the decisions of ORG and of ORG Human Rights > concerning cousins of the alien in themselves do not imply that the alien is currently not eligible for expulsion , or that after a further review of his third asylum request would not be eligible for expulsion . Also , the intention to request ORG for an injunction against the alien \u2019s expulsion does not imply that the prospects of expulsion should now be regarded as absent . Insofar as new asylum proceedings are running , a decision must follow within DATE .", "It has not appeared that the < ORG Secretary > has not been diligent as to the procedure for expediting the investigation .", "Account has been taken of the fact that , in connection with the alien \u2019s second asylum request , the < ORG Secretary > could not present the alien earlier < to the NORP authorities > but will now do so on DATE . The < ORG Secretary > can not be held responsible insofar as this can not take place in connection with the alien \u2019s third asylum request . As there is no indication that the applicant \u2019s presentation to the NORP authorities is chanceless , ORG is of the opinion that this investigation needs to be awaited .", "It has further not been established that the alien has any mental / psychic problems such as would warrant the lifting of his placement in GPE detention . ORG further notes that the applicant \u2019s placement has at this stage not exceeded DATE . The argument raised on this point therefore lacks foundation .", "It has not been established that the application or execution of the placement in GPE detention in respect of the alien is in violation of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) or , after balancing all interests involved , in all reasonableness must be considered unjustified . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant was medically examined by an ORG doctor . In the course of this examination , the applicant stated that , as a result of having been tortured in detention in DATE , his feet were injured to such an extent that , after his release , he required medical treatment . He stated that he had received this treatment from Dr PERSON in ORG .", "On DATE the GPE branch of ORG informed ORG of ORG that , according to the findings of its doctor , the applicant had been subjected to torture .", "On DATE with the assistance of an interpreter , the applicant was interviewed by an official of ORG on the grounds given for his third request for asylum .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant \u2019s third asylum request . The applicant was further informed that he was not allowed to remain in the GPE pending the outcome of a possible appeal .", "By letter of DATE , the GPE branch of ORG informed ORG of ORG that it considered that the applicant \u2019s case had been insufficiently examined and , for that reason , it could not be excluded that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would be exposed to a real risk of human rights violations contrary to the DATE LAW . It further transmitted a copy of the provisional report dated DATE of the doctor who had examined the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG of ORG against the decision of DATE . He further requested ORG for an injunction against his expulsion pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings .", "On DATE the applicant filed a fifth appeal with ORG against the decision to place him in GPE detention .", "On DATE the GPE branch of ORG transmitted the report dated CARDINAL DATE on the applicant \u2019s medical examination of DATE to ORG of ORG . According to this report , the applicant \u2019s account of ill - treatment was consistent and understandable and the doctor \u2019s findings on the basis of the medical examination were consistent with long - term effects of the acts of torture described by the applicant .", "On DATE ORG rejected the fifth appeal filed by the applicant against the decision to place him in GPE detention with a view to his expulsion . It held , inter alia :", "\u201c ORG considers as regards the issue of diligence < as to the applicant \u2019s expulsion > that the alien could not be expelled earlier on grounds of the requests filed by him for admission as a refugee and < requests for an > for the issue of an injunction against his expulsion .", "It is true that the < applicant \u2019s > placement in GPE detention has now exceeded a period of DATE . However , ORG is of the opinion that the applicant is partly to blame for this long duration . Indeed , a third request for asylum has been filed in the meantime and as long as no decision has been taken on that request , no acts can be undertaken aimed at the alien \u2019s expulsion . In the court \u2019s opinion , the < ORG Secretary > can not be blamed for the fact that these matters a long time .", "Noting the contents of the case - file and the < ORG Secretary \u2019s > submissions during the hearing , ORG finds that in casu there are sufficient prospects for the applicant \u2019s expulsion . Account has been taken in particular of the fact that the alien was presented to the NORP authorities on DATE and that the latter have taken the application for an laissez - passer into consideration .", "Therefore , at this juncture ORG sees no reason for finding that the placement in GPE detention , in all reasonableness , can no longer be regarded as justified . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant filed a sixth appeal against the decision to place him in GPE detention . This appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "By letter of DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer requested ORG to adjourn the hearing on the applicant \u2019s appeal and injunction request filed on DATE scheduled for DATE , as for various reasons set out in her letter she had not yet had an adequate opportunity to prepare satisfactorily the case with the applicant", "On DATE the ORG Secretary requested ORG to suspend the examination of appeals , including requests for injunctions against expulsions filed by asylum seekers of NORP origin , as it had appeared that CARDINAL such asylum seekers had encountered serious problems after they had been expelled to GPE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a seventh appeal against the decision to place him in GPE detention .", "On DATE the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , given reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsions of NORP nationals of NORP origin . On DATE , ORG heard the applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL DATE , declared it founded and lifted the detention order . The applicant was consequently released from GPE detention .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , the Acting President of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE as well as the applicant \u2019s request for an injunction against his expulsion . The President held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It must be assumed at the outset that the situation in GPE is not such that aliens coming from that country can be considered in general and automatically as refugees . The applicant must therefore make out a plausible case that there exists facts and circumstances directly relating to him personally that justify his fear of persecution within the meaning of refugee law .", "The applicant has not succeeded in doing so . In agreement with the < ORG Secretary > the President finds that no credence can be attached to the alleged acts of torture . These acts were raised by the applicant for the first time in the context of his third asylum request as an essential basis for that request , whereas it remains unexplained why he scarcely devoted any attention to this < element > during his interviews held on DATE and DATE . Also , in the context of his opposition to the decision of ORG of DATE he entirely passed over the acts of torture which he now puts forward . The medical reports submitted do not enhance the credibility of his allegations . The note of the medical adviser contains only a reproduction of the subjective ( not objectively verifiable ) account of the applicant , and his conclusion that the scars \u201c could fit \u201d the alleged acts of torture does not provide a decisive answer .", "The question to what extent the applicant \u2019s account is comparable to that of his CARDINAL cousins has already been examined in the decision of this court of DATE . Unlike the cited cousins , the applicant has not or hardly been politically active , so that no reliance on the principle of equality can be placed . It has also not been established that the applicant would have become involved in any way with the political acts of his cousins .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the above , the President finds that the < ORG Secretary > in the challenged decision has justly maintained his refusal to grant the applicant asylum .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW it must be examined whether it is plausible that the applicant will face a real risk of being subjected to torture , or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .", "Having regard to consideration CARDINAL . it has not been established that the forced return of the applicant to GPE would result in a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
