The first applicant lived and worked in GPE from DATE and became resident there in DATE . The parents of the second applicant ( \u201c FAC ) , who are both NORP citizens , married in GPE on DATE , and registered their marriage in GPE in DATE . The parents separated before the child \u2019s birth and judicial separation proceedings were issued by the first applicant in ORG on DATE . They were eventually linked to subsequent child care proceedings which were commenced upon PERSON birth .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , custody of the child was granted to the mother by ORG . Regular ( initially supervised ) contact , to be held in the mother \u2019s house , was also granted to the father ( \u201c X. \u201d ) , who was ordered to pay maintenance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant complained about X. \u2019s violent behaviour and the effects this was having on the child . She further requested authorisation to return , with the child , to GPE for work purposes .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of ORG ( Tribunale per i minorenni ) of DATE , the applicants were granted permission to return to GPE and the second applicant was inscribed on the first applicant \u2019s passport . They moved to Reading , GPE , in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG altered the visiting arrangements , holding that the child should spend alternate weekends with the father , in GPE and GPE , in the presence of a nanny , but not including TIME stays . Visits to GPE would be unlimited as long as announced in advance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG ( psychiatric assessment ) report was filed , stating that the time was not ripe for joint custody but that arrangements for more visits with the father were to be made gradually . The second applicant \u2019s contact with her father was regular and became unsupervised through progressive contact orders issued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court confirmed the mother \u2019s custody of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant made submissions reiterating her concerns regarding the father \u2019s behaviour and its effects on the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the second applicant returned to GPE following DATE with her father . She had a heavy rash in her genital area and displayed disturbed behaviour . On DATE the emergency doctor noted a small tear in her anus but could not determine its cause . On CARDINAL DATE , again following DATE with her father , the second applicant returned with a rash in her genital area and according to her mother displayed uncharacteristic behaviour such as heavy kissing on the mouth , and profound physical and psychological discomfort . The emergency doctor noted the rash and inflammation and reported these to the appropriate authorities as suspicious and indicative of possible sexual assault . However , he also considered it could be due to a lack of hygiene or to masturbation and was surprised that a congenital malformation of the girl \u2019s genitalia had not been brought to his attention . On CARDINAL DATE a detective constable of ORG informed the first applicant that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a criminal investigation . On DATE nursery reported that GPE had been found masturbating on the potty and that her behaviour DATE had been strange .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following accusations made against him , the father lodged an emergency request with ORG asking for sole custody of the child and for her to be resident with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a NORP social worker reported on the mother \u2019s good qualities and noted the possibility that sexual abuse had taken place . She thought it was possible that the child \u2019s travelling to GPE might be causing stress and advised that GPE be accompanied by a nanny on these journeys . On this basis the first applicant requested the NORP courts to order supervised visits and submitted a detailed account of the situation in her pleadings of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the NORP court found that the inquiry into the claim of sexual abuse did not provide any evidence substantiating the claims brought solely by the mother , who suffered from a state of extreme anxiety . Moreover , no official action had been taken by the NORP authorities . The court , therefore , dismissed the claims as unfounded . It noted that the mother had systematically and continuously denigrated the child \u2019s father , even if no concrete elements that could suggest he was an inadequate parent had been revealed . This brought into question the appropriateness of the mother \u2019s behaviour . For these reasons the custody regime had to be altered . Joint custody was therefore granted to the mother and the father to underscore the importance of both parental figures for securing the healthy psychological growth of the child , making both parties aware that they must assume responsibility for overcoming their parental conflict , in which the child was heavily involved . It confirmed the previous visiting arrangements and residence mainly with the mother . The applicant alleged that she had not been heard before this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the mother applied to the NORP courts for an emergency protection order under the DATE LAW , with a suspension of visiting rights . On DATE ORG in GPE ruled that nobody could remove the child from the mother or from NORP jurisdiction until the case had been heard , and that the father should have supervised visits . The father issued a crossapplication to enforce the existing NORP orders . On DATE ORG issued the certificate needed for the enforcement of the NORP orders regarding visiting arrangements . This was delivered to GPE authorities on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the NORP police had interviewed the father . He was also informed that the social services and the police felt supervised access would be appropriate while the NORP social services made an assessment of the situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before ORG it was accepted that the NORP courts had primary jurisdiction ( according to ORG ) in matters of legal separation and child care . The mother \u2019s applications were therefore withdrawn and the orders of ORG were recognised and enforced .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the mother stopped all contact between the child and her father due to suspicions that the father had sexually abused the child after a contact visit in GPE . The mother had taken the child to a doctor in an ORG and Emergency department in a hospital in GPE . However , contrary to the mother \u2019s claims , the doctor found that the child was healthy save for a slight rash ; no lesions had been found on her external genitalia and her anus was intact . However , child protection referrals were made to the GPE police and social services . The police conducted CARDINAL interviews with the child , recorded on video , where GPE spoke of her father touching her . They advised the mother not to allow any unsupervised contact between the child and her father in order not to prejudice the criminal investigation . However , a letter of ORG , Reading ORG , to X. , informed him of the events and concluded that there was no evidence of harm or risk of danger . Thus , the department \u2019s intervention had not been necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted documents related to the alleged abuse and requested ORG to terminate the father \u2019s visiting rights . On DATE the father lodged his defence arguments , requesting that the child be placed with him or alternatively with a foster family under the control of ORG , and for the relevant physical and psychological reports to be drawn up .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police wrote to ORG informing it that criminal investigations were taking place in respect of the suspicion of sexual abuse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that there was no reason to change the provisional custody and visiting arrangements in place . It ordered a new ORG , which would also investigate whether it was possible that any sexual abuse had taken place .", "CARDINAL . A comprehensive ORG was drawn up which included interviews with all the parties involved , including the nanny , the father \u2019s partner and her son . No interviews were , however , held with the child together with the father , since the first applicant denied the father access . Medical examinations and reports were also taken into account . According to the report , while talk about genitalia and sexual attitudes was recurrent in the child , it was mostly associated with the images of the NORP police and the mother and not those of the father and his new family . The child repeatedly stated that certain terminology which she used had only been used with these figures ( the police constable and the mother ) and she was unable to explain certain of the terminology she herself used . It emerged that the child missed the father and the united family unit , she felt uncared for and that she needed to be left alone in tranquillity . The report concluded that there existed \u201c a possible sexual trauma and in any event a suffering exacerbated when confronting the subject of an alleged abuse , in addition to the suffering from the continuous conflict between the parents which aggravated the family dynamics and harmed the child \u2019s equilibrium \u201d . However , the report could not confirm that such a state was due to an actual abuse , as it could have been the result of a sexually charged environment in which the child was brought up .", "CARDINAL . After protracted proceedings in which both parties were represented and extensive expert evidence was submitted , and following a collegial hearing of DATE , ORG issued a ( CARDINAL page ) partial decision , filed in the relevant registry on DATE . It pronounced the couple \u2019s separation . Furthermore , having considered the parties\u2019 submissions , the expert evidence \u2013 particularly the medical reports DATE , the CTUs , the reports of the NORP police and of the NORP social services , and confirming its jurisdiction , it ordered , inter alia , that custody of the child be assigned to ORG ; that the mother return the child to GPE immediately , if necessary with the assistance of the public forces ; that the child \u2019s name be removed from the passport of the nanny who had previously accompanied her on her travels ; that GPE place the child , if possible with her mother ( should she be so willing ) , in a protected place , and instigate a course of therapy , making available to the parents every form of therapy and support that might assist with parenting and meetings between father and daughter , which had to resume ; that the mother pay compensation to the father and the child for breaching the previous contact orders and causing a sudden interruption in the relationship between father and child ( by also forbidding any telephone communication ) , with the ensuing repercussions on the child \u2019s equilibrium and the moral suffering caused to both .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the first applicant appealed to ORG , requesting the suspension of the partial decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the father registered ORG order of CARDINAL DATE in ORG and GPE , requesting its enforcement . On DATE ORG ordered the registration of the order and the securing of the passports and identity cards of both the mother and her child . The first applicant , in her application to the ORG , stated that she could request from the father the restitution of her documents for periods relevant to work - related travel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested permission to appeal against the ORG decision , and requested that the decision be stayed in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE X. released the first applicant \u2019s identity card .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , filed in the relevant registry on CARDINAL DATE , containing a reasoning of CARDINAL pages , ORG in GPE dismissed the mother \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE . It noted that the proceedings had been long and complex , marked by various decisions , based on pleadings and evidence submitted by both parties , who had effectively participated ( contradittorio ) . It dismissed her application for the case to be transferred to the jurisdiction of GPE noting , inter alia , that all of the parties were NORP . The child had been born in GPE , where she had remained for DATE of her life ; the child had only left GPE due to her mother \u2019s work and had regularly returned on multiple and extensive visits ; the child \u2019s mother tongue was NORP and she had only just started to learn LANGUAGE ; and the NORP courts could not be said to be better suited to deal with the application given the stage of the proceedings in which extensive investigative measures had been ongoing for DATE , including CARDINAL expert witnesses , psychiatric assessments of the parties and huge amounts of evidence .", "On the merits , considering all of the different evidence before the court , including the child \u2019s testimony also through expert reports , but excluding video recordings which had been made with unknown technologies and which had not been open to challenge by the father , it held that the medical evidence was not conclusive and that the advice given by the NORP police on the basis of the mother \u2019s unilateral statements could not be regarded as determinative of the father \u2019s guilt , though it was not yet excluded as investigations in GPE were still ongoing . ORG was seriously concerned about the level of acrimony between the parents and the damage to the child . It clearly emerged from the report of the court - appointed expert witness , the reports of the expert witnesses of the parties and the report of NORP social services that the child was in a serious situation of psychological distress . In particular , it referred to the damage relating to the sexual and corporeal sphere and also the suffering caused by the current conflict between her parents , and her need , which had been denied , to maintain a network of connections with members of the father \u2019s family and her father . The position of the child , the fact that she had not seen her father since DATE , was considered to be grave . It was considered necessary to clarify once and for all this position given the confusion caused by the accusations of the mother and the damage produced by an invasive investigative approach aimed exclusively and obsessively at finding abuse DATE and deliberately designed to remove the child from the father \u2013 with no respect for the consequences upon the child , who was clearly unhappy and displaying physical and psychological suffering .", "The court therefore endorsed the decision of ORG to order the return of the child to GPE and her placement in a neutral environment , with the mother , if the mother wished , or alone , if she did not , with a course of therapy and the reinstatement of contacts with the father in a protected and monitored fashion . The court considered this to be an inevitable solution , given the increasingly serious and poisonous situation , which could only be sorted out in a neutral place , where the nature and origin of the child \u2019s fundamentally sexual compulsive behaviour , her eroticisation and the minor \u2019s adult expressions , with sexual content , could finally be fully deciphered , and the family dynamics and parenting skills of the mother and father could be observed . Indeed , the mother appeared anxious and showed little empathy towards her daughter ( according to ORG reports ) , she was not in favour of allowing father - child contact and her actions were of emotional harm to the daughter . With regard to the suffering that the child would undoubtedly experience if the order were carried out , it was pointed out that the mother had the possibility of reducing this alleged suffering by agreeing to be placed in the home with her daughter for the limited period of time needed to sort out the family dynamics , a choice that was compatible with her activity as a university researcher entitled to periods of DATE or leave to conduct research in other countries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ordered that ORG of ORG was the correct court to consider the mother \u2019s appeal against the execution of ORG order in which she relied on LAW and ( b ) of ORG ( ORG ( ORG ) CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility ) . It ordered that a LAW ( Children and ORG ) report be presented . In the ORG report dated DATE , concerns were set out about the enormous effect of the enforcement of the NORP court \u2019s order which would remove the child from GPE and into institutional care in GPE with or without her mother . It suggested that ORG position in the proceedings be safeguarded by a guardian to be appointed . This suggestion was rejected by the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the mother \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG after DATE final hearing , the appointment of an advocate to assist with interpretation of ORG ( ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of DATE , and the consideration of over CARDINAL pages of evidence , including the evidence before the NORP courts and of the court - appointed expert . It was accepted that the NORP courts had jurisdiction in relation to the child , and that under LAW the court in GPE could only refuse to enforce the order for CARDINAL of the reasons specified in Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Regulations , and could not review the substance of the NORP order . The issues were limited to whether the decision of ORG of DATE was manifestly contrary to public policy of the Member ORG in which recognition was sought , taking into account the best interests of the child ( LAW ( a ) ) , or whether it was taken without the child having been given an opportunity to be heard , in violation of the fundamental principles of procedure in GPE LAW b ) ) . It was not accepted that the policy adopted by the NORP courts in any way differed from that which would have been adopted by the GPE courts , as the welfare considerations of the child plainly lay behind their decision . The order could therefore not be considered to be manifestly contrary to public policy . In addition , it was considered clear that the child \u2019s voice had been put before the NORP courts through the expert witness who had prepared a thorough report which went conscientiously through a mass of material and involved a series of interviews with all parties . It was also abundantly clear that the expert was highly concerned about the child and had highlighted the child \u2019s welfare in the clearest possible terms . The NORP courts had set out clearly why further assessments of the child , which all parties agreed were necessary , could not be done in GPE , making their orders even more understandable . In addition , the order was not a final order and was only for a limited time solely to address the problems that had caused the child to suffer to the extent that she had . It was clear that if sexual abuse by the father was established , relations with the father would be stopped . It was noted that the NORP court was faced with CARDINAL difficult problems \u2013 on the one hand to discover the truth behind the mother \u2019s allegations and on the other hand to prevent the child suffering further , as set out by the expert , as a result of the atmosphere created by the mother denigrating the father , and refusing to comply with court orders despite warnings . It was accepted that the order requiring mother and child to move to GPE even for a short time would cause the child upset , and might impact on the mother \u2019s employment . Nevertheless , it was considered to be wrong to ignore the significant part that the mother \u2019s attitude and actions had played in bringing about the present situation and the order of the NORP courts . Overall , the solution chosen by the NORP courts placed in such a dilemma was considered to have particular benefits including , inter alia , allowing the mother to remain with the child , the fact that it was only a short term measure , the fact that contact with the father was dependent upon the determination of the mother \u2019s allegations , and that any decisions which followed would be taken by the same court that had heard this matter extensively since DATE . ORG therefore made an order for recognition of the NORP court order , dismissed the mother \u2019s application for a stay of the proceedings and dismissed her application for a transfer of the proceedings to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , filed in the relevant registry on DATE , ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal on the basis that the appeal grounds were unfounded . It noted , however , that in respect of jurisdiction ORG decision had been based on the application of the Brussels II Regulation , which at the time had not been applicable . In respect of other grounds of appeal it considered that the impugned decision had been comprehensive , took account of all the pleadings of the parties and appeared wholly legitimate . As to the merits , namely the admissibility and assessment of evidence , ORG considered that ORG had given ample , logical and correct reasons justifying its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG in GPE issued a further judgment to clarify aspects of the previous judgment and ordered the execution of the NORP order by DATE . It clarified that the mother \u2019s application for a stay of the proceedings had been dismissed together with her application that ORG should not enforce the decision of the NORP court . The NORP authorities had provided information about where the assessment would take place , the accommodation that would be provided and further details of the plans for the mother and the child in GPE . Whilst sympathetic to the fact that the child would have to be taken out of school DATE before the end of term , it was noted that proceedings in GPE had been ongoing since DATE , and the date of enforcement continually delayed . It was noted in particular that the mother had accepted that she would be obliged to go and stay with the child in GPE to undertake assessments . This would give the child the enormous advantage of having her mother with her when she went to an unfamiliar setting . Finally , ORG refused to extend the time - limit to appeal , but in any event refused to grant leave to appeal , as not only was the decision under consideration not contrary to public policy , but it was one which the NORP courts might well have followed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first hearing in the divorce proceedings took place in GPE . The judge offered to \u201c withdraw \u201d the order for the placement of the child in an institution if the child entered GPE voluntarily .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the mother \u2019s further application for a stay of the execution of the NORP order , confirming that the mother should return the child to GPE by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following attempts to reacquire their travel documents , the applicants returned to GPE . On DATE , in the context of the divorce proceedings , the judge held that GPE should remain under the custody of ORG but that she could live with her mother for the limited time the latter was in GPE , the father to pay an allowance for the renting of an apartment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE regularly met with the doctors from PERSON ( a service aiding the exercise of access rights according to LAW ) . From then up to DATE supervised access with the father took place once DATE and thereafter on a DATE basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the father \u2019s refusal to pay the deposit for rent of an apartment , the applicants moved to GPE , although arrangements were in progress for the child to start school in GPE . On DATE the first applicant removed FAC from her passport following complaints by the father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse was discontinued , having become time - barred .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , proceedings were pending in respect of the first applicant \u2019s financial situation and the financial obligations of the parents , and various decrees were issued , including in respect of the child \u2019s schooling . On DATE A.S. was allowed to go on holiday to GPE with her mother . They went to GPE from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police discontinued the investigation regarding sexual abuse . By a letter of DATE the first applicant was informed that the case had also been reviewed by ORG and after a careful consideration of all the facts and the recent changes in circumstances surrounding GPE and her father \u2019s supervised contact , it had been decided that no further active investigation would ensue .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant alleged that the father had again abused the child on a particular occasion when the child went to buy an ice - cream with her father with no supervision . She claimed that although she had urged the social services and medical staff to implement PERSON therapy , no action had been forthcoming .", "CARDINAL . Following the first applicant \u2019s proposal for settlement in the context of the separation proceedings , on DATE the father agreed to drop the judicial separation proceedings . Access decrees continued to be delivered according to the needs and in the best interests of the child , and from DATE GPE was spending DATE every fortnight at her father \u2019s residence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the parents commenced a mediation process at the local department in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE Spazio Neutro handed in another report suggesting the continuation of the current arrangements in GPE . The applicant complained that no mention was made of the fact that she would lose her job if she did not return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Divorce proceedings continued in DATE . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , GPE was to spend part of DATE ( DATE ) in GPE with her mother and another part ( DATE August ) with her father . A request lodged on DATE by the first applicant for the child to have DATE with her in GPE was rejected on DATE on the ground that there had been no time for ORG , to whom the child was entrusted , to give its approval . Moreover , it was noted that since the lodging of the request coincided with DATE of the father \u2019s period of vacation with the child , it appeared that the request had been made with the intention of disrupting this already ordered period of holiday with the father . Furthermore , the child would have been unable to attend the visits with the social services and the municipality , if away from GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a social ORG report dated DATE , it was considered that the current arrangements were adequate to the minor \u2019s needs and it would not be necessary to limit the GPE rights any further in respect of medical and schooling issues . The report further noted with concern the repetitive requests of the parents regarding matters not related to the custody of the minor , which were taking precedence over the main issues and increasing conflict between the parents ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
