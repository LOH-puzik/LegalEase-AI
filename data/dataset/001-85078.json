On DATE , on the basis of the final reports from the NORP district office ( PERSON ) dated DATE , the GPE of GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office issued CARDINAL orders discontinuing the proceedings against the CARDINAL defendants . With regard to the offence of disturbing the repose of the dead , the public prosecutor \u2019s office considered that CARDINAL of the constituent elements of the offence \u2013 the mens rea of the defendants \u2013 had not been established . With regard to the inappropriate transport of the child \u2019s body , the public prosecutor \u2019s office acknowledged that the municipality \u2019s registrar of births , marriages and deaths had made a mistake of law . The accused were however ordered to pay some of the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged CARDINAL appeals against the orders of CARDINAL August DATE before ORG ) of GPE . She argued that the CARDINAL accused had disturbed the repose of the dead through \u201c recklessness \u201d ( PERSON ) and that they should therefore be held criminally liable . In the context of the appeal concerning the registrar of births , marriages and deaths , the applicant complained more specifically of a violation of her personal freedom and the right to a decent burial , as individual rights protected by LAW , due in particular to the fact that she had not been invited to attend the burial of her child . Lastly , as regards the transport of the child , the applicant challenged the contentions of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , which had acknowledged a mistake of law .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL judgments of DATE ORG declared the appeals inadmissible . With regard to the offence of disturbing the repose of the dead , it considered that the constituent elements of the offence had not been made out in that case , but considered , nevertheless , that by ordering the child to be buried without a ceremony , the CARDINAL accused had been in breach of the relevant legislation . Indeed , both LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the order concerning funeral services in the GPE of LOC and LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the regulations governing cemeteries and funerals in the municipality of Buchs permitted burial DATE after DATE of the birth of the stillborn child . Furthermore , paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL of the regulations governing cemeteries and funerals in the municipality of Buchs made provision for a ceremony to be organised ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG therefore considered that there had been a prima facie violation of the applicant \u2019s right to hold a ceremony . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s mental and physical state would not have prevented her from attending her child \u2019s burial , since it was on precisely that date that she had left hospital . ORG stated , however , that it would have been possible to conduct a ceremony after the burial ( LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the regulations governing cemeteries and funerals in the municipality of LOC ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) but that the applicant had made no such application .", "CARDINAL . As regards the complaint relating to the transport of the child , ORG acknowledged that the registrar of births , marriages and deaths had acted in breach of LAW since no authorisation , as provided for in paragraph QUANTITY thereof , had been granted . It considered however that the mistake committed by the official , who had little experience in such matters , had to be put in perspective , as did the actual effects ( NORP ) of his conduct . Therefore , in accordance with the principle of discretionary prosecution , the public prosecutor \u2019s office had legally entitled to discontinue prosecution of the accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged CARDINAL public - law appeals and CARDINAL applications for judicial review with ORG ( PERSON ) . As regards the offence of disturbing the repose of the dead , the applicant claimed that all the elements thereof , both objective and subjective , had been made out in the case at hand . She then submitted that her arguments concerning the right to a decent burial and the violation of personal freedom had not been properly considered by the lower courts . On that point , she asked ORG to transfer the part of her appeal concerning the right to a decent funeral to ORG , the only authority having jurisdiction in the matter . As regards the violation of her personal freedom , the applicant submitted that for the family of a deceased person , the mourning process was an essential manifestation of personality development , according to the relevant case - law of ORG . Lastly , she challenged the reasoning of the cantonal authorities concerning the inadequate transport of the child .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL judgments of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed all CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s appeals . It declared the ground based on the right to a decent funeral inadmissible and determined that her application to transfer part of her appeals to ORG was vexatious ( geradezu mutwillig ) , pointing out that a specific type of appeal to that court existed for complaints of that nature .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , leaving aside the matter of whether the objective elements of the offence of disturbing the repose of the dead had been met , ORG held that whatever the circumstances , mens rea on the part of the accused had not been established . Lastly , as regards the violation of personal freedom complained of by the applicant for having been prevented from completing her mourning process , and the violation of the right to a decent funeral , ORG held that these claims were well - founded , or at least could have been , but that they were not relevant in the context of the proceedings at issue , in which the only matter to be decided was whether or not the perpetrators were guilty of the acts complained of .", "CARDINAL . Under the federal law on assistance to victims of crime , the applicant lodged a parallel application for payment of compensation for the non - pecuniary damage suffered as a result of the infringement of her personality rights .", "CARDINAL . That application was rejected first by the social services of the GPE of GPE , then by ORG of that canton and , lastly , by ORG on DATE . While acknowledging that an offence committed by negligence could , as the case may be , fulfil the requirements of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the federal law on assistance to victims of crime even if it were not , as such , punishable as a crime because it lacked the requisite mens rea , ORG held that the offence in question in the present case , namely , misuse of authority , inherently fell outside the scope of that law .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the Buchs municipal council authorised the child \u2019s body to be exhumed at the expense of the municipality . The exhumation took place on DATE and the body was transferred to the applicant \u2019s new home in GPE where it was buried following a NORP ceremony .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant married her partner .", "CARDINAL . Before DATE , when LAW came into force , LAW made no specific provision for the protection of the private sphere . However , in a judgment of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL I CARDINAL ) the ORG afforded it constitutional value as an element of personal ( or individual ) freedom .", "CARDINAL .
