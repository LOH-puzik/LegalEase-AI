As to PERSON \u2019s guilt", "It is established that on TIME CARDINAL January CARDINAL Ngo , who played an important part in the importation of the heroin , was driven by PERSON in his ORG car to buy hydrochloric acid in various shops to blend the pure heroin brought into GPE by PERSON and PERSON .", "PERSON was present in the flat at CARDINAL boulevard de la Chapelle at TIME when the QUANTITY of caffeine were delivered there by an NORP who was said by the other defendants to be the head of the trafficking network .", "He agreed to drive PERSON and GPE to their rendezvous with PERSON and PERSON .", "At the time he was arrested , he was waiting for PERSON to get into his car so that he could drive him to PERSON \u2019s flat in the boulevard de la Chapelle .", "He was therefore on the point of being in possession of the smuggled goods , which only the intervention of the police prevented from being placed in his vehicle .", "The customs authorities therefore rightly argued that the attempt is regarded in the same way as the offence itself , that it was for reasons beyond his control that PERSON did not physically come into possession of the heroin that was going to be placed in his car and that the fact of his having driven in his own vehicle CARDINAL traffickers who were on the point of taking delivery of the prohibited goods warranted the assertion that he had an interest in customs evasion .", "He did not claim to have acted from necessity , and the circumstances in which he was implicated in the operation and arrested do not allow him to maintain that he acted as a result of an unavoidable mistake . \"", "CARDINAL .

Where it was possible for an official assignment to be made , he would appoint a member of the Bar to study the file ; the latter would report to the Chairman , and if he had identified a ground of appeal , the appointment to study the file would be informally converted into an official assignment .", "This preliminary study corresponded to the preliminary study made by ORG , and the same resources were available .", "Where a ground of appeal could be set out at length , the appointed member of the Bar would produce pleadings on a voluntary basis .", "Secondly , counsel was not automatically appointed following an application .", "A study of the file was ordered as of right where there had been a conviction by an assize court and in the event of a case being remitted to an assize court or of a prison sentence being passed by a criminal court where the applicant was in custody pending trial . Study of the file was also ordered in the cases of those convicted by a criminal court of first instance or appeal who were not in custody but whose sentence was above a certain level , the level apparently having varied over time .", "In all cases , if the Chairman indicated that he was unable to appoint a colleague , he qualified this by saying that he would have the file studied by CARDINAL of his colleagues if his attention was drawn to a point of law that could be submitted for review by ORG . Study of the file was in fact ordered fairly generously once counsel before a court of trial or of appeal had drawn the attention of the Chairman of the Bar to a specific point .", "It is to be noted that such precautions were necessary , not only because of the small size of the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat and ORG but also because appeals to ORG in criminal cases ( except in respect of judgments in associated civil - party proceedings ) have a suspensive effect . It was important that the hearing of appeals that could not be sustained should not be systematically delayed on the ground that the file was being officially studied ( or that counsel had been officially assigned to it ) .", "It must not be overlooked that when a file is allocated to counsel , he is given a deadline . Moreover , when pleadings are produced , ORG is obliged to give a reasoned judgment , after the case has been examined by a reporting judge ; whereas when an appeal is not supported in that way , the case is automatically entered in a list known as the \u2018 formal list\u2019 because ORG essentially considers only whether the impugned judgment is free from any formal defect ; in actual fact , it also satisfies itself that the statutory maximum sentence has not been exceeded .", "In DATE the Chairman of the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat and ORG who had then been elected became concerned about the increasing number of applications made to him for official assignment of counsel and the number of official appointments he had to make for study of files in accordance with the foregoing criteria ; the number of such appointments had indeed increased from CARDINAL in DATE to CARDINAL in DATE .", "He felt it his duty , on his own initiative , to make a slight alteration if not to the actual criteria , at least to the letter previously sent to those applying for an official assignment of counsel or to lawyers applying for it on their behalf . In these replies he ceased to mention automatically that counsel would be officially instructed to study the file if a point of law was brought to his attention ; and he also changed the criterion for an official appointment , in respect of applicants who were not in custody , to a DATE prison sentence ( instead , apparently , of DATE previously ) .", "When a point of law was notified to him , he did in fact order an official study of the file , as in the past ; the same applied when it was justified by the applicant \u2019s psychological state .", "These measures reduced the number of appointments made for study of files from CARDINAL in DATE to CARDINAL in DATE .", "The Chairman who was elected in DATE took a decision to order study of all files without any distinction when an application for official assignment of counsel was made to him ; the number of files studied rose from CARDINAL in DATE to CARDINAL in DATE , and reached CARDINAL in DATE , falling back to CARDINAL in DATE .", "... \"", "CARDINAL .
