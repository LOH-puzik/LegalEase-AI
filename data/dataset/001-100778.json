He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE and GPE , respectively .", "The applicant is a military officer of the NORP PERSON holding the rank of a Lieutenant Colonel ( Oberstleutnant ) .", "On DATE the applicant published an article in the journal \u201c PERSON \u201d . \u201c PERSON \u201d is a journal for politics , culture and economy which is published bi - DATE with a print run of CARDINAL copies per issue . It is available in selected bookshops , by subscription and on the internet . The article was titled \u201c Spirit or evil spirit of the general officers \u201d ( \u201c Geist oder ORG der ORG \u201d ) and criticised the process of coming to terms with the army 's past and the NORP generals ' role in the GPE conflict .", "Extracts of the article read as follows :", "\u201c It can be ruled out that the general officers , for reasons of intellectual deficiency , could not realise what was going on . ( ... ) As stupidity can thus be ruled out , only the second alternative remains as an explanation , which is : opportunism , cowardice , unscrupulousness . ( ... )", "If the NORP generals had just CARDINAL spark of sense of honour , justice and morals , the Inspector General and the generals of the different services would have refused to obey ORG orders which breached international law and were unconstitutional . \u201d", "The journal mentioned the applicant 's military rank with the addition that the article exclusively contained the author 's personal views .", "On DATE the applicant 's supervising officer imposed a disciplinary fine of CARDINAL on the applicant for having published statements which were suited to debase his superior generals in a defamatory way .", "On DATE the applicant 's disciplinary appeal was rejected .", "On DATE ORG ( Truppendienstgericht S\u00fcd ) rejected the applicant 's further appeal . That court considered that the applicant had the right publicly to express his opinion even in an exaggerated and polemic way . However , this right had to cede if the statement infringed on another person 's human dignity . ORG found that the applicant 's statements did not fall within the ambit of the right to freedom of expression ( LAW , see \u201c relevant domestic law \u201d , below ) , because they infringed on the concerned generals ' human dignity . It followed that the applicant had disrespected his duties to exercise self - restraint , to respect the dignity , the honour and the rights of his comrades , to maintain discipline and to respect his superiors ' rank even when off duty ( Articles QUANTITY and DATE , DATE ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ORG ( GPE ) , see \u201c relevant domestic law \u201d , below ) .", "On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant 's constitutional complaint for adjudication for lack of prospect of success . Contrary to ORG finding , ORG did not consider that the impugned statements infringed on the concerned generals ' human dignity ; neither did they amount to abusive insult ( Schm\u00e4hkritik ) . The right to freedom of expression protected value judgment and statements of facts as a prerequisite to form one 's opinion . The statements made by the applicant were an expression of opinion which clearly fell within the ambit of that right .", "It followed that the courts had to balance the competing interests in the light of the aim pursued by the relevant provisions of LAW , which was to preserve the proper functioning of the GPE . This aim had to be preserved by the military officers both in their professional and in their private conduct . The functioning of the LOC could be jeopardised by private statements which were suited to demoralise and undermine discipline within the army . Under these circumstances , the right to freedom of expression had to cede . According to ORG , ORG had respected these principles when applying the relevant provisions of LAW . ORG had assumed that the applicant had violated his duty to exercise self - restraint with regard to the impugned statements . This could lead to undermining the applicant 's own authority and put into question his loyalty . The applicant 's statements , in which he denied the generals any sense of honour , justice and morals , were suited to debase the generals and to expose them to derision . This could jeopardise military cooperation , mutual trust and the readiness to stand by one another . Furthermore , the applicant had breached his legal obligation to preserve his superiors ' authority , as the terms employed exceeded any form of rational criticism . To preserve the superiors ' authority was necessary for the ORG 's internal order . ORG considered that this weighing of interests was not objectionable from a constitutional point of view . There was no doubt that the manner the applicant chose for expressing his opinion , in particular the personal attacks , was suited severely to disturb the Bundeswehr 's functioning . It did not violate the right to freedom of expression if such behaviour was not permitted , but was treated as a disciplinary offence .", "This decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on DATE .", "LAW ) , insofar as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech , writing , and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources .
