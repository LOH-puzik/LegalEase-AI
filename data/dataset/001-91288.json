On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant lodged a claim against the municipality with the Zielona ORG , seeking ORG CARDINAL in compensation for the alleged difference between the actual size of the property and the CARDINAL declared in the notarial deed . He claimed that due to the fact that the plot was in fact smaller he could not construct a special sanitary tank there and consequently could not open a bakery , which he had originally planned to do . He also sought exemption from the entire amount of court fees which were set at ORG CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that his DATE income was only an invalidity pension of ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL . He submitted that after paying rent for his cooperative flat , his net income amounted to LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG requested the applicant to supplement his declaration of means .

He claimed that he had purchased the ORG property using his savings and family loans , and that he intended to use it to create employment for him and his family .

It held , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c Pursuant to LAW from court fees may be sought by a party who is unable to bear them without entailing a substantial reduction in his or her standard of living . The plaintiff does not satisfy this requirement . It is evident to the court that the plaintiff has a substantially higher income than the declared pension which he knowingly does not disclose , in that his retail outlet and his van must generate profits . These profits must be substantial because otherwise he could not have a cooperative flat and CARDINAL other properties and could not invest MONEY in other business projects and maintain them . The plaintiff continuously conceals his real profits and they are substantial , because nobody could believe that he lives on PLN CARDINAL per month .", "Exemption from court fees is a privilege serving to legally protect the indigent , and the plaintiff is a very affluent person in NORP terms \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

It held , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c The appeal should be considered unfounded . In particular , the first - instance court was right when holding that the applicant \u2019s declaration of means was unreliable . In that declaration of means the applicant did not state , inter alia , that he was conducting a business activity , and he explained that circumstance only in the appeal proceedings . It is also not difficult to notice the differences between the applicant \u2019s declared income and the value of his assets . It is a well - established principle in the case - law that being an owner of ORG immovable ] property excludes the possibility of granting exemption from court fees ( judgments of ORG of DATE , no . ORG and of DATE , no . C II CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant can pay the court fees for his action since he has considerable assets and given that he has recently , as he claims , invested ORG MONEY in CARDINAL of his properties . What is more , the fact at the origin of the dispute , namely that the property acquired by the applicant from the municipality is in fact smaller than declared in a notarial deed , has been known to the applicant since DATE . Thus , he could have made savings with a view to funding his litigation . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
