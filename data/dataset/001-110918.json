The first applicant is Mr LOC born in DATE , the second applicant is PERSON born in DATE , and the third and fourth applicants are their sons , born in DATE and DATE . They are currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are of GPE descent and lived in the village of GPE . Following the outbreak of war in DATE , the first applicant refused to participate in the fighting and hid from the armed forces . Due to this , the other applicants were subjected to threats and beatings by NORP military . Finally , they were driven out of their home by NORP militia . They fled by train to ORG , another village in GPE . On their way , they lost a bag containing their passports and identification papers . They hid at a friend \u2019s home , where they remained completely isolated from the world until they travelled to GPE in DATE . They had felt harassed in GPE because of their being GPE , but they had not been subjected to any persecution , allegedly due to their isolation . They applied for asylum and permanent residence permits on arrival .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected their applications . First , the ORG found that the applicants had not proved their identity . By submitting an UNMIK certificate on their residency in GPE , they had made it plausible that they were from GPE or GPE . However , the ORG found that neither the general situation in GPE nor that in GPE was such that it in itself constituted grounds for granting asylum . Also , the ORG found that the applicants were not to be considered as refugees or as in need of any other specific protection . In regard to the applicants\u2019 GPE ethnicity , the ORG noted that the first applicant \u2019s mother was NORP , that none of the family members spoke PERSON or had any contact with other GPE . In GPE , they had lived in NORP areas and had only socialised with NORP . In the ORG \u2019s view , it was difficult to conclude in these circumstances that the applicants would be seen as GPE upon return . Noting , furthermore , that they had not been subjected to any persecution because of their ethnicity previously , ORG concluded that they had failed to show that there was such a risk upon return .", "CARDINAL . The Board went on to assess whether the applicants\u2019 personal situation could constitute a ground for granting residence permits . The first , second and third applicants submitted that they suffered from medical problems .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant claimed that he was hypertonic . ORG found that this was a common medical condition and that he would not be subject to any medical risk if he were to return to GPE or GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant claimed that she suffered from psychological problems and submitted a certificate issued by a nurse on DATE and extracts from her medical records covering the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . ORG found that the certificate had not been issued in accordance with NORP regulations and did not contain any prognosis . Therefore , it was not able to assess fully the gravity of her condition or what type of care she needed . Nevertheless , it found that her condition was not life - threatening and thus could not constitute a ground for granting a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant claimed that he also suffered from psychological problems and submitted a medical certificate issued by a senior physician on DATE . ORG found that the medical certificate did not contain any diagnosis and that it therefore could not assess whether or not the applicant could receive appropriate medical care in GPE or GPE . ORG noted that treatment for depression was offered both in GPE and GPE . It further noted that the applicant \u2019s health had not improved after he had received treatment in GPE and that his condition would probably only improve if he were in a more secure and stable environment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) in GPE where they held to their earlier submissions and added the following . The whole family moved to a children \u2019s home in DATE , when the authorities decided that the parents did not have the ability to take care of their children under the existing circumstances . The applicants also submitted several medical certificates regarding the first , second and third applicants . According to the certificates regarding the first and second applicants , there was a risk that they might commit suicide if they were to be expelled from GPE . Regarding the second applicant , it was stated that she had earlier attempted suicide and that she showed clear signs of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the certificate regarding the third applicant , issued on DATE by PERSON , specialist in youth psychiatry , he was in a very bad state on arrival in GPE . He was depressed and could hardly interact with other persons . During DATE , he was in contact with the Children and ORG ( Barn- och ungdomspsykiatrin ) in PERSON , which found that he suffered from depression . His condition improved when he started school and began to play football and also had a contact person assigned . However , after ORG decision in DATE , his depression became worse again . He isolated himself at home and became apathetic . In DATE , he attempted suicide by overdose of anti - depressants . He was committed to hospital , but discharged after DATE . When the family arrived at the children \u2019s home in DATE , he was in very poor condition , refused to eat solid food and stayed in bed most of the time . There would be a serious risk of another suicide attempt if he were to be expelled from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , upholding the ORG \u2019s reasoning and conclusion , adding the following . The third applicant would soon be DATE . Although he suffered from severe depressive devitalisation , it could not be assumed that his psychosocial development would be damaged if he were to be expelled from GPE . Also , psychiatric care was available in both GPE and GPE , at least for those who could pay . Therefore , neither the third applicant \u2019s health nor his personal situation were enough to justify granting him a residence permit . This reasoning also applied to the other applicants , who were all in better health . CARDINAL of the lay judges delivered a dissenting opinion finding that the third applicant \u2019s health constituted a sufficient reason to grant him a residence permit . Applying the principle of respect for family life , they also found that the rest of the family should be granted a right to stay .", "CARDINAL . The applicants proceeded to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) and submitted that they had been subjected to persecution in GPE due to their ethnicity and that this had caused their health problems . Their possibilities to receive proper care if sent back were limited , especially regarding the third applicant . Also , they would not have access to the health care system due to their ethnicity . Their health had deteriorated , as allegedly shown by several medical certificates submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . Regarding the third applicant , the court found that the medical certificates showed that he suffered from severe mental illness , that he was unlikely to get better in the foreseeable future and that the necessary treatment presupposed that he was in a safe , secure and stable environment . Furthermore , it found that health care was available in both GPE and GPE , but that the applicant \u2019s health issues had arisen due to events taking place there . Considering all this , the court quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and granted him a permanent residence permit . Regarding the other applicants , it upheld the lower court \u2019s reasoning and decision .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL dissenting opinions were attached to the appellate court \u2019s judgment . In the first , CARDINAL of the judges held that the third applicant had recently turned DATE , that he therefore should be regarded as an adult and that his circumstances should be assessed separately from the other applicants . Taking this into account , and also the fact that proper health care would be available to him in GPE or GPE , the judge found that he had no right to remain in GPE . He should therefore be expelled together with the other applicants .", "CARDINAL . In the second dissenting opinion , another judge held that the medical certificates clearly showed that the first , second and third applicants in particular suffered from severe mental illness . The documents available also showed that the condition for the third applicant \u2019s well - being was a safe , secure and stable environment . Although he had turned DATE , the family \u2019s situation had to be taken as a whole . Therefore , all of the applicants should be granted permanent residence permits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a new request for residence permits on the basis that there were impediments to the enforcement of their deportation order . They submitted new medical certificates and argued that their conditions had worsened . On DATE ORG rejected the request as it found that the applicants had invoked no new circumstances of importance and that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the first , second and fourth applicants\u2019 deportation order . Moreover , as the third applicant had reached the age of majority , they could no longer be granted residence permits on account of family ties to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of the first , second and fourth applicants\u2019 deportation to GPE or GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants submitted new medical certificates concerning the first , the second and the third applicants . The certificates were issued jointly by PERSON , specialist in youth psychiatry , ORG , psychologist and psychotherapist , and PERSON , trained social worker and psychotherapist and were dated DATE .", "The medical certificate regarding the first applicant stated that he suffered from grave depression , insomnia and eating disorders . He had suicidal tendencies , but had not made any suicide attempts out of concern for his children . The diagnosis was grave depression and complex PTSD . According to the medical certificate regarding the second applicant , her condition was serious and possibly fatal and she would not be able to cope with a separation from her son . The prognosis was that all treatment presupposed a safe , secure and stable environment . She was diagnosed with grave depression , depressive devitalisation and complex PTSD . The medical certificate regarding the third applicant stated that he was in need of professional therapy to be able to deal with his traumatic experiences . It was not possible for him to cope without the support of his family . If his parents and his brother were to be returned to GPE or GPE , there was a grave risk that his depression would become worse and that his rehabilitation would be compromised . He was diagnosed with grave depression , depressive devitalisation and complex PTSD .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants submitted new medical certificates issued by PERSON and dated DATE . According to these , the first applicant had been feeling slightly better since the family had moved from the children \u2019s home to an apartment in GPE in DATE . However , he still suffered from feelings of futility and despair . The second applicant had been feeling better since the ORG \u2019s decision not to deport them until further notice . However , she had recently been feeling worse again due to her fear of a possible deportation . She still suffered from severe depression and PTSD and was worried about the third applicant \u2019s health . The third applicant had gradually been feeling better since he had been granted a residence permit . However , his positive development had been halted by the threat of disruption of the family and he showed clear signs of falling into depression again . The fourth applicant had , due to his young age , been spared the traumatic experiences in GPE . However , according to the medical certificate , a disruption of the family could be expected to cause him a severe trauma .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the Aliens Act \u201d ) , as amended on DATE . The following refers to LAW in force at the relevant time .", "CARDINAL . LAW , LAW , of LAW stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so .

ORG , states , inter alia , the following regarding the situation in GPE :", "\u201c Institutional and societal discrimination persisted against ORG , ORG , and NORP communities in employment , education , social services , language use , freedom of movement , the right to return , and other basic rights . Members of the GPE PERSON and NORP communities also complained of discrimination , while GPE PERSON and GPE Montenegrin communities were nominally acknowledged through appointment of their representatives to the GPE president \u2019s ORG . GPE ORG leaders continued to complain that many of their community members continued to depart the country as a result of discrimination and , increasingly , an absence of economic opportunities . Members of the GPE , NORP , and NORP communities were subject to pervasive social and economic discrimination ; often lacked access to basic hygiene , medical care , and education ; and were heavily dependent on humanitarian aid for survival . Reports of violence and other crimes directed at minorities and their property persisted . There were clashes between groups of GPE NORP and GPE NORP during DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The International Organisation for Migration \u2019s report \u201c Returning to GPE , country information \u201d from DATE provides the following :", "\u201c The public health care system in GPE is still in a phase of post - war reconstruction . The rehabilitation of the mental health system is one of the priorities of the PERSON [ ... ] . However , the system faces many challenges . The number of mental health professionals is very limited and the present educational system for mental health is underdeveloped . Existing institutions also have limited access modern know - how in psychiatry . Nevertheless , there is a favourable environment for accelerating reforms , supported by ORG DATE of the MoH.", "The mental health needs of the severely traumatised population are very high but there is CARDINAL psychiatrist for CARDINAL inhabitants and CARDINAL mental health worker for CARDINAL inhabitants . There are CARDINAL clinical psychologists and a small number of social workers . The psychiatric treatment provided is biologically - oriented , using pharmaceuticals and hospitalisation as the main , if not the only , tools .", "This sector suffers also from the destruction of medical equipment during and since the conflict in DATE . Treatment of post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , which became a matter of the greatest importance after the wars in GPE and the turmoil in GPE in DATE , is in desperate need of improvement . Some calculations suggest that CARDINAL people ( CARDINAL of the population ) are suffering from PTSD . The mental health care system in GPE simply does not have sufficient resources of people or facilities to respond to the need for treatment for mental health disorders .", "Because of the lack of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists , there is almost no time for psychotherapy . The extreme lack of beds for chronically mentally ill people , and the lack of forensic psychiatry services aggravate the problem . There is CARDINAL child psychiatrist in the public health service to provide adolescent mental health services for a population that is overall very young . Drug addiction is also a growing problem without an adequate solution because of the lack of specialised professionals and institutions .", "However , with international support , new facilities , called \u201c ORG , have been opened in ORG , ORG , PERSON , PERSON / a and ORG . These facilities offer protected apartments for people with minor mental health problems , as well as therapeutic and psycho - social support .

In addition to the proof of insurance ( employment contract , decision on the right to pension , etc . ) , one needs to present an ID card or a birth certificate ( for minors ) in order to register for insurance and issuance of a health booklet . The request is submitted at the branch office of ORG ( ORG ) as per place of permanent / temporary residence . ORG identifies GPE , who do not have a registered permanent / temporary residence in GPE , as a category of persons for whom contributions are paid from the budget of the Republic . However , the Rulebook on the Method and Procedure of Exercise of Rights from Mandatory Health Insurance in effect until DATE stipulated that when applying for registration to health insurance , GPE must give a statement on belonging to this population , and the proof of temporary residence registration in addition to it .", "As the said regulation was in contravention of ORG , ORG sent a request to ORG to assess the legality of this regulation . In DATE , the Rulebook on Amendments to the Rulebook on the Method and Procedure of Exercise of Rights from Mandatory Health Insurance stipulating that the GPE who do not have permanent / temporary residence registered on the territory of the municipality they truly live in , may register health insurance by giving only a statement about the address at which they truly live in addition to the statement on belonging to the GPE minority . The implementation of these changes in the LAW was not uniform . Partly due to inadequate levels of information of employees in ORG branch offices throughout GPE , partly due to resistance to the concrete novelties and lack of sensitivity , the branch offices in certain municipalities refused to enable GPE to exercise the right to health insurance and issue health booklets under the above stated conditions . On behalf of its clients , ORG intervened repeatedly and pointed to the changed regulations , managing to have its clients registered . Also , as the impossibility to register permanent residence makes obtaining ORG cards impossible , the ORG branch offices request that GPE submit at least birth certificates instead of ID cards . Returnees on the basis of the readmission agreements with travel documents are allowed only access to urgent medical care for which the Republic budget funds are allocated , until regulation of the status of an insured person or until the expiry of the validity of the travel document . Returnees who fail to obtain ID cards or birth certificates for children born within the period of validity of the travel document ( e.g. re - registration into registry books or registration in birth registry book abroad was not done ) will remain outside the health care system .
