He was represented before the ORG by PERSON J.P. GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr P. Clerides , Attorney - General of GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE as a visitor .", "On DATE the applicant applied to the office of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees in GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) for asylum .", "On DATE he was granted a temporary residence permit pending the examination of his asylum application . The permit was valid from CARDINAL DATE to DATE and was continuously renewed until DATE on the basis of the ORG \u2019s instructions . He was , however , permitted to stay in GPE even after DATE since his asylum application had not yet been decided .", "On DATE his application was dismissed . The ORG concluded that the applicant did not have \u201c a well - founded fear of persecution \u201d on the grounds laid down in LAW relating to LAW ( DATE ) .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision .", "His appeal was dismissed on DATE . The ORG considered that the reasons put forward by the applicant in his appeal did not warrant a departure from the first decision . The grounds for reconsidering the application did not contain any new elements that could alter their decision and he was not therefore a person of concern to the ORG . His file was thereupon closed , no further review being possible . The ORG informed ORG of their decision .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant applied for the renewal of his residence permit .", "By a letter dated DATE the immigration authorities informed the applicant that he had to leave GPE within DATE from receipt of the letter .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a new asylum application to ORG ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) . On DATE ORG decided to dismiss the application on the ground that the applicant did not fulfil the requirements of LAW of DATE , namely , he had not shown \u201c a well - founded fear of persecution for reasons of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular group or political opinion or a well - founded fear of serious and unjustified harm for other reasons \u201d . However , the authorities were not able to serve the applicant with the letter of dismissal as he could not be found at the address he had given them . As a result , further steps in the applicant \u2019s file were discontinued .", "On DATE , at TIME , the applicant was stopped for a police check while driving his car in GPE . The applicant , who had committed certain traffic offences , had no papers on him proving his identity . He was therefore taken to the police station where it was ascertained that he had been staying in GPE illegally .", "On DATE the applicant was arrested and taken to ORG .", "On DATE detention and deportation orders were issued by the Director of ORG under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(k ) of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON ( PERSON . CARDINAL as amended ) on the ground that the applicant was a prohibited immigrant . The applicant was served with a letter informing him of these orders . However , he refused to sign the letter .", "By a letter dated DATE , the Director of ORG informed ORG that the applicant did not have a return ticket and that his passport had not been found . Furthermore , by a letter dated DATE , the Director informed ORG that the applicant had been taken to ORG but had refused to give the necessary information allowing the ORG to issue travel documents . The Director requested ORG to contact ORG for the purpose of ensuring the prompt issuance of the required travel documents .", "The applicant submitted that the authorities had taken him to ORG upon his arrest for the purpose of issuing him with travel documents and had unlawfully informed that ORG about his asylum application .", "According to the documents submitted by the Government , on DATE the applicant was taken by CARDINAL police officers to ORG for an interview for the purpose of securing travel documents . The applicant , however , refused to give the information required and the ORG could not as a result issue travel documents .", "In the meantime , by a letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer informed the authorities that his client \u2019s asylum application was still pending and requested the applicant \u2019s release .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer that the examination of the applicant \u2019s file had been discontinued since the applicant , without good reason , had not informed the authorities , as required , that he had changed address and had not notified them of his new one . Therefore they had been unable to serve the letter concerning his application .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG decision . This was dismissed on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant brought a recourse before ORG ( first - instance revisional jurisdiction ) under LAW challenging the decision of ORG to close his asylum file .", "This was dismissed on DATE as in the meantime the applicant had lodged his appeal with ORG see above ) and then a recourse against the dismissal of that appeal ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; see below ) . ORG added that , in any event , the applicant \u2019s recourse was out of time and that it was completely unsubstantiated .", "On DATE the applicant brought a recourse before ORG ( first - instance revisional jurisdiction ) under LAW challenging the decision of ORG . He also challenged the lawfulness of the detention and deportation orders issued against him pursuant to that decision .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the recourse . First it upheld ORG decision to close the applicant \u2019s file . It observed that it had been for the applicant to inform ORG of any change of address and not for the authority to try to find him for the purpose of serving any relevant documents . Second , the court noted that it could not examine the lawfulness of the detention and deportation orders of DATE ( see below ) as the recourse had only been filed against ORG which was not the authority that had issued the orders .", "The applicant did not appeal .", "On DATE the applicant had also brought a recourse before ORG ( first - instance revisional jurisdiction ) under LAW challenging the detention and deportation orders of DATE . He claimed , inter alia , that the orders had been issued unlawfully and contrary to the LAW and LAW as the right facts had not been taken into account . He further maintained that if deported to GPE he would be tortured and killed due to his past involvement in student meetings condemning ORG for human rights violations .", "In his affidavit the applicant stated that he had been a student in GPE at ORG in the city of ORG . In DATE he had participated in a meeting held by students , concerning human rights violations , which the authorities had violently dissolved . Many students had been arrested and some had disappeared . The applicant had been injured but had managed to get away and had gone into hiding in GPE since the secret police were looking for him . Subsequently the applicant had learned that he had been dismissed from GPE . The applicant also claimed that he had been on the NORP authorities\u2019 \u201c stop list \u201d but had managed , after secretly bribing an official , to have his name taken off and get a passport .", "Finally , in his affidavit , the applicant stated that since ORG did not allow NORP nationals to apply for asylum , he was in even more danger , the NORP authorities now being aware , after being informed by the immigration authorities , that he was in GPE . This was disputed by the respondents . In his affidavit CARDINAL of the officers stated , on behalf of the respondents , that the police had not mentioned anything about the applicant \u2019s asylum application to the personnel of ORG .", "On DATE the applicant filed an application seeking an interim order to suspend the decision taken concerning his detention and deportation .", "On DATE the Director of ORG suspended the execution of the deportation order pending the examination of the above application .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the application for an interim order . As the execution of the deportation order had already been suspended , the court focused on the applicant \u2019s request concerning his detention . In this connection , the court found that the applicant had not established \u201c manifest illegality \u201d in his detention or shown that it had caused him irreparable damage . It therefore held that his application had been unsubstantiated . It also observed that the applicant had not shown that his allegation that the authorities had informed ORG about his asylum application was connected with the lawfulness of the orders that had already been issued by that time .", "On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s recourse and annulled the detention and deportation orders . It held that these orders had been issued on the basis of an inadequate inquiry and misconception about the facts . In this respect , the court noted , amongst other things , that the applicant had not received the letter from the asylum authorities rejecting his application and that the authorities had not conducted an effective investigation in this connection . It further observed that the applicant was refusing to cooperate with the authorities for the issuance of travel documents .", "The applicant was released on DATE .", "Following ORG judgment of DATE the applicant , on DATE , brought civil proceedings against the Attorney - General before ORG of GPE , claiming damages in respect of unlawful arrest and detention from DATE until DATE .", "These proceedings are still pending .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant filed a habeas corpus application before ORG ( first instance ) . This was dismissed on DATE . The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to examine the lawfulness of the detention and deportation orders ; as decided by the court in numerous cases , this could only be examined in the context of an administrative recourse brought under LAW and not a habeas corpus application . The court noted that such a recourse was actually pending and that the judgment had been reserved ( namely , recourse DATE , see above ) . In these circumstances the court held that the application constituted an abuse of judicial procedure . Further , the court observed that the continuing detention of the applicant was due to the fact that there was a pending recourse against the deportation order and that he did not have the necessary travel documents .", "The applicant did not appeal against this judgment .", "On DATE , following the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s appeal by ORG , the Director of ORG issued new detention and deportation orders against the applicant under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(k ) of the Aliens and Immigration PERSON , on the ground that he was a prohibited immigrant .", "The applicant was arrested on DATE while at ORG . The applicant has submitted that he had gone there in order to collect his new residence permit .", "On an unspecified date the applicant filed a habeas corpus application before ORG ( first instance ) . The applicant claimed , inter alia , that his protracted detention without deportation was unlawful , arbitrary and contrary to his fundamental human rights . He relied on ORG judgment in the case of PERSON ( habeas corpus application CARDINAL/CARDINAL , judgment of DATE ) .", "The application was dismissed on DATE . ORG held that it did not have jurisdiction to examine the lawfulness of the detention and deportation orders against him : these could only be examined in the context of an administrative recourse and not a habeas corpus application . The applicant would have the right to apply for a habeas corpus order in the event of his being successful in such a recourse but not released .", "As to the length of the applicant \u2019s detention , the court found that on the basis of the evidence before it the delay in the applicant \u2019s deportation was solely due to the applicant himself , as he was deliberately refusing to cooperate with the authorities of his own country for the issuance of travel documents . Although the applicant had been taken to ORG he refused to apply for travel documents without giving any explanation in this regard . Noting that in her affidavit to the court the Director of ORG had suggested that the applicant \u2019s aim was that without travel documents his detention would be extended and at one point he would be released , ORG found that the respondents were doing everything possible to execute the applicant \u2019s deportation and did not bear any responsibility for the delay . It therefore concluded that it could not be said that the applicant \u2019s length of detention had exceeded what was reasonable .", "The applicant did not appeal against this judgment .", "On DATE the applicant complained to the police that he had been ill - treated by police officers .", "According to the relevant police report dated DATE the applicant was arrested on DATE . On arrival at the central prisons , the applicant managed to run away and climb onto a metallic water - tower in the prison courtyard . The police officers succeeded in immobilising him on the tower \u2019s ladder and , eventually , the applicant climbed down .", "On DATE the applicant was taken to GPE police station where he was visited by his lawyer . In the presence of the officer in charge he showed his lawyer some scratches he had on his body and informed him that these had been inflicted on him at the immigration department and at FAC at FAC .", "The applicant was immediately taken to the first aid unit of ORG of GPE where he was examined by a doctor , a forensic surgeon and , further , a private doctor who had been sent by the applicant \u2019s lawyer . According to the reports of the first CARDINAL doctors , the applicant had some scratches on the chest and back , weals on the right arm and a scratch on the left arm , weals on the chest and in the area in front of the neck and also swelling in the right part of the cheek - bone area .", "On DATE the police took statements from the applicant and some of the police officers who had been involved .", "Following an ill - treatment complaint by the applicant , through his lawyer , to the Attorney - General , the ORG and the Chief of Police , an investigation was carried out by the police .", "In their report of CARDINAL DATE the police concluded that the applicant \u2019s complaint was unfounded and suggested that the file be closed .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant was transferred to the GPE detention facilities in GPE .", "On DATE the file was transmitted to the Attorney - General , who instructed the police to close it .", "The file was returned to the police and was closed .", "In a letter dated DATE the ORG informed the applicant that she had been informed by the police that on the instructions of the Attorney - General the police had carried out the investigation . This had concluded that the applicant \u2019s allegations had been unsubstantiated and as a result the Attorney - General had closed the file . Consequently , the ORG observed that she did not have the competence to intervene .", "On DATE the applicant was transferred to FAC .", "On TIME the police authorities of GPE carried out the transfer of certain detained aliens to various detention facilities in other districts .", "On DATE , at TIME , police officers went to FAC in order to transfer the applicant to the detention facilities in GPE . At the time , the applicant had been on hunger strike from DATE .", "In a statement given to the police on DATE the applicant claimed that he had been sleeping on a table in \u201c an open space used by all the prisoners \u201d when a group of police \u201c commandos \u201d had woken him up and asked him to follow them as they were going to take him to another detention centre . The applicant refused to be transferred and resisted . They then took him to an office and asked him to sign a document which was in NORP . When he refused , CARDINAL of the officers attacked him and then the officers handcuffed him by using force and put him in a police car .", "The applicant was transferred to the GPE detention facilities .", "In his statement he alleged that when he arrived at the detention centre he spoke to another prisoner who told him that no force had been used against him as he had consented to his transfer . He also complained about his transfer and the force used against him by the police .", "At TIME the applicant was taken to the first - aid unit of ORG where he was examined by a doctor . According to the entry in the hospital record the applicant had complained to the doctor who examined him for blows . The doctor noted that the applicant had superficial scratches on the \u201c upper limbs and shoulder blade \u201d .", "The applicant gave his statement to the police TIME and TIME DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG against the Police ( \u201c IAIACAP \u201d ) concerning the use of force by the officers in carrying out his transfer ( complaint CARDINAL ) .", "The Vice - President of the ORG took over the investigation .", "The applicant gave a supplementary statement to the police on DATE . In this the applicant stated that on DATE he had been attacked by CARDINAL immigration and police officers because he wanted to stay in GPE and continue his hunger strike and had therefore resisted his transfer to GPE . He stated that the officers had insisted that he go with them and as he resisted they had resorted to violence and thus managed to transfer him to GPE .", "On DATE the Vice - President of the ORG visited the applicant in LOC and took a statement from him .", "In this statement the applicant stated that on DATE , at TIME while he was sleeping in his \u201c room \u201d , QUANTITY police \u201c commandos \u201d had entered and asked him to get out of the \u201c room \u201d . They took him downstairs to the common office on the ground floor where there were another QUANTITY police officers and CARDINAL \u201c commandos \u201d . He was the only detainee in that office . They showed him a letter in NORP and asked him to sign it . When he refused CARDINAL of the officers grabbed him by the hair and hit his head on a table . The officer then threw him to the ground and with CARDINAL persons started beating him on the back with their knees . While he was on the ground they handcuffed his hands behind his back . They pulled him up but then threw him down onto the ground again . They then put him into a police van and transferred him to GPE . He complained there to the officer in charge and was then taken to hospital . The applicant also noted that he had asked to be taken back to hospital on DATE . The entry of CARDINAL DATE in the hospital record reports weakness caused by a hunger strike .", "While detained in GPE the applicant complained DATE about his detention there and threatened to harm himself if he was not transferred .", "He was eventually transferred back to ORG on DATE .", "Following the appointment of the Vice - President of ORG to a ORG post , on DATE the ORG appointed CARDINAL criminal investigators and an observer member . DATE and CARDINAL DATE statements were taken from the CARDINAL police officers who were in charge of guarding and transferring the applicant and from the police officer in charge at FAC . Upon conclusion of the investigation , the investigators submitted their report to the ORG on CARDINAL DATE . A report was then also prepared by the member who acted as an observer .", "The following account was given to the investigators by CARDINAL police officers who had been responsible for guarding the applicant and transferring him to GPE :", "On DATE , at TIME , police officers went to ORG in order to carry out the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE . The applicant refused to be moved and would not get out of his bed . The officers lifted him out of his bed and took him from the first floor , where his cell was , to the ground floor . The applicant resisted and was violent . The officers tried to handcuff him but he was resisting , kicking and pushing the officers away . In the end they managed to handcuff him but he refused to go to the police car and fell onto the ground in resistance . The police officers pulled him and took him to the car . At TIME the officers put the applicant inside a police van and transferred him to FAC .", "The applicant refused to take his personal belongings with him .", "The officer who was in charge at the GPE detention centre mentioned in his statement that , upon receiving the applicant at the centre and after removing the applicant \u2019s clothes , in a special room , in order to carry out a body search , he found minor scratches on the applicant \u2019s hands and shoulder blade which he recorded on the centre \u2019s personal detainee sheet . When he asked the applicant how these scratches had been caused , the applicant replied that they had been caused by the police officers in FAC when he resisted his transfer to GPE . He did not complain at the time .", "In their report the investigators concluded that from the evidence given the applicant \u2019s claims had been unfounded . In particular :", "( a ) According to the medical report the applicant had superficial scratches on the \u201c upper limbs and shoulder blade \u201d . If the police officers had , as the applicant claimed , thrown the applicant onto the ground and then kicked him in the back while he was handcuffed , and then lifted him up and thrown him down again , he would have had more serious injuries .", "( b ) A number of police officers had taken part in the transfer of detainees to other districts under the supervision of the Deputy Director of the Police of GPE . It could not reasonably be maintained that certain police officers would single out the applicant to attack and beat him during such an operation", "( c ) According to the evidence , the applicant persistently refused to cooperate with the police . In his statement to the police he admitted that the officers had used force in order to carry out his transfer . It appears therefore that the minor injuries were caused when the officers tried to handcuff him and carry out his transfer .", "Furthermore , the investigation carried out by the police authorities themselves did not find anything to reproach in the conduct of the officers involved .", "The investigators therefore concluded that the force used by the officers had been necessary in the circumstances to achieve the applicant \u2019s secure transfer and suggested that the case be closed .", "The observer member examined the facts and findings of the investigators as set out in their report . In her report she agreed with the conclusions and suggestions . She noted that despite delays in the initial stage of the investigation , the criminal investigators , following their appointment , had speedily concluded the investigation .", "By CARDINAL letters dated DATE the ORG informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer and the Attorney - General respectively about the conclusions of the investigation .", "On DATE the applicant filed a complaint through his sister with the Ombudsman concerning his continuing detention .", "In CARDINAL letters to the Minister of the ORG , dated DATE , DATE and DATE , the ORG addressed the question of the extended length of detention of aliens in detention facilities on the basis of detention and deportation orders issued under LAW ( PERSON .
