SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON PERSON PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE a bank filed a bankruptcy petition before ORG ( PERSON tingsr\u00e4tt ) against the limited company PERSON ORG ( \u201c the company \u201d ) . At the time , all shares in the company were owned by the applicant . The court found that the company had no duly appointed representative and served the petition and summons to the bankruptcy hearing on the company \u2019s registered auditor ( registrerad revisor ) . At the hearing , held on DATE , the auditor appeared but no representative for the company . ORG found that the mentioned documents had been legally served on the company through its auditor and that , therefore , there existed no impediment to proceeding with the hearing . In a decision DATE , ORG declared the company bankrupt and appointed an official receiver ( konkursf\u00f6rvaltare ) for the bankruptcy estate .", "The company appealed against the decision to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) , requesting in the first place that the declaration of bankruptcy be quashed and the case be remitted back to ORG for re - trial or , in the alternative , that the decision be reversed . It submitted , inter alia , that it was not insolvent and that the summons to appear before ORG had not been correctly served . In the latter respect , it argued that it had been incorrect to serve the summons on the auditor since the company had a board of directors ( styrelse ) at the time and since the auditor had been dismissed from his mandate .", "In a decision of DATE ORG found , inter alia , that no board of directors had been registered by the company with the register of limited companies ( Aktiebolagsregistret ) . Similarly , the register had not shown that the auditor had been divested of his mandate . ORG found that the summons to appear before ORG had been correctly served on the company and that it had not substantiated that it was solvent . It therefore upheld the lower court \u2019s decision in full .", "In DATE the official receiver issued a formal report concerning the bankruptcy and the estate ( f\u00f6rvaltarber\u00e4ttelse ) . According to the receiver , the company had been insolvent since DATE . Moreover , it was noted in the report that most of the company \u2019s assets had been transferred shortly before the bankruptcy decision without accounting for and , seemingly , without receiving any compensation in return , that the company had lacked DATE reports and other complete bookkeeping , that there had been no ongoing activity in the company at the time of the bankruptcy decision and that , at the same point in time , the company had had MONEY ( SEK ) in assets and MONEY CARDINAL in debts . During the bankruptcy period , the official receiver sold the bankruptcy estate \u2019s assets and made prepayments to its creditors , including the creditor bank .", "The company appealed against ORG decision to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) before which it maintained its claims . ORG granted leave to appeal and , in a decision of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , found that it was not possible to serve a summons on a limited company without an appointed board of directors through its auditor . As , therefore , the summons to the bankruptcy hearing had not been correctly served on the company , ORG quashed the declaration of bankruptcy and remitted the case back to ORG for re - trial .", "Following the decision of ORG , the company transferred its possible right to damages from the ORG due to the erroneous bankruptcy decision to a third party .", "On DATE new bankruptcy proceedings , at which the company was represented , were held before ORG . In these proceedings , the creditor bank referred to the mentioned prepayments from the bankruptcy estate and submitted that , out of its original claim , MONEY remained unpaid . The company \u2019s representative declared that he personally guaranteed the alleged remaining debt . On DATE the court rejected the bankruptcy petition on the grounds , inter alia , that the present claim concerned only a small amount and that it had been guaranteed by the representative . The court further obliged the bank to reimburse the company \u2019s legal costs and decided that its bankruptcy costs amounting to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL should be paid by the ORG .", "The applicant sued the ORG before ORG , requesting the court to declare that the ORG was liable for damages incurred on the company by ORG and ORG erroneous declaration of bankruptcy . The applicant claimed that the ORG was obliged to pay compensation , firstly , in accordance with LAW , LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , since ORG and ORG were guilty of wrongful acts or omissions in connection with the exercise of public authority . In the alternative , he requested that ORG should create a general legal principle ( r\u00e4ttsgrundsats ) giving a right to compensation in cases like the instant one . The applicant referred to , inter alia , the LAW and its protection of property rights .", "The ORG disputed that there had been any wrongful acts or omissions in connection with the exercise of public authority which had given rise to an obligation for the ORG to pay compensation . It stated that the question of how to serve summonses on limited companies in cases such as the one at issue had been made clear only by the decision of ORG in DATE . There existed neither any previous case - law on the matter , nor any comments in the preparatory works that could be construed in a way that precluded the possibility of serving a summons on a limited company through its auditor . Finally , there was no guidance to be found in the doctrine . Therefore , the ORG argued , the decisions by the lower courts had not constituted a clear breach of the law , such as could be construed prior to ORG decision .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . It stated that now , after its decision in the case ORG DATE p. CARDINAL , it was clear that a summons could not be served on a limited company through its auditor and that , consequently , the lower court \u2019s decisions had been wrong . However , it observed that , when the ORG was held liable for alleged errors concerning legal and evidential issues , a flawed assessment by a court was not sufficient for liability for damages ; only manifestly erroneous assessments could constitute grounds for liability . In this respect , ORG found that the correct interpretation of the relevant provision concerning the serving had not been obvious and that no such wrongful act or omission as to cause liability had been committed . ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s alternative request .", "The company was declared bankrupt on its own request on DATE .", "References in this section are made to LAW ( ORG , ORG ) , unless otherwise indicated .", "A debtor who is insolvent , that is who can not pay his debts as they become due and whose inability in this regard is not merely temporary , shall be declared bankrupt at the request of the debtor himself or by a creditor ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . By means of bankruptcy , all creditors collectively and compulsorily take the total assets of an insolvent debtor for payment of their claims . During bankruptcy , the bankruptcy estate takes care of the debtor \u2019s assets on behalf of the creditors ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "The administration of a bankruptcy estate is managed by CARDINAL or more official receivers appointed by ORG ( Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , and LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "Bankruptcy decisions are immediately enforceable ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . In the event of a higher court quashing the bankruptcy decision , all conducted administrative measures are to be interrupted forthwith and the case referred back to ORG for concluding measures .", "In the case where a higher court quashes the bankruptcy decision , the assets of the estate are restored to the debtor to the extent that they are not required for the defrayal of the bankruptcy costs and other costs that the estate has incurred ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "The latter provision implies that the estate is liable to pay the bankruptcy costs even if a declaration of bankruptcy is later quashed . However , by decision of ORG of DATE ( NJA DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , it was established that the ORG may be held liable to pay the bankruptcy costs when the declaration of bankruptcy is quashed due to a grave procedural error . The case concerned a bankruptcy decision that was quashed due to ORG having summoned the debtor to its hearing in an incorrect manner .", "It follows from LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( Skadest\u00e5ndslagen , ORG ) that the ORG is liable to pay compensation , inter alia , for financial loss caused by a wrongful act or omission in connection with the exercise of public authority .", "ORG has in several judgments clarified that it is not sufficient for liability for damages that a court \u2019s assessment of a legal issue is erroneous . Only manifestly erroneous assessments can be considered as wrongful acts or omissions within the meaning of the said provision ( see , for example , ORG DATE p. CARDINAL , DATE p. CARDINAL and NJA DATE p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
