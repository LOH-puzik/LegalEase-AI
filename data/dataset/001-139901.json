The choice of the reporting technique was the applicant company \u2019s prerogative . As regards the impugned articles in particular , it was clear that they concerned suspicions and not proven facts . Although some turns of phrase indicated a degree of journalistic exaggeration and provocation , the context and the content of the articles in its entirety left no one in doubt as to the real facts . Moreover , A. had been given the opportunity to comment .", "CARDINAL . In a further submission the applicant company produced a detailed analysis of the behaviour of ORG which , according to the applicant company , had given rise to a suspicion that he had been cheating .

In the view of ORG , the use of expressions such as \u201c seemingly \u201d , \u201c perhaps \u201d , and \u201c suspicion \u201d did not free the publisher from \u201c accountability for the truthfulness of the published material \u201d and it made no difference whether the applicant company was quoting statements made by others or expressing its own opinions , just as it did not matter whether it intentionally published untruths or negligently relayed the findings of someone else .

The applicant company had failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the truthfulness of the suggestion that ORG had been cheating in the quiz , since none of the witnesses had been able to confirm that he had , and they had all referred only to suspicious behaviour by GPE , the suspicion had not even been confirmed by the police ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , ORG found that the criminal complaint by the TV station could have been a certain form of retaliation for the attempts by A. to get back into the game . In the court \u2019s view , in the given circumstances , the standing of A. as a public figure was of no consequence .", "CARDINAL . ORG held specifically that", "\u201c it [ was ] irrelevant whether [ A. ] was a public figure or not , since ... even if the articles could be considered as polemic and containing value judgments , as long as they were based on matters about which untruths were being published , they constituted a palpable unjustified interference with the claimant \u2019s right to protection of his personal integrity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As to the amount of the damages , ORG noted that the libellous articles had been published in a DATE with a large readership and that some of them had been printed on the front page . Although the claimant had failed to show that he had suffered any loss of esteem among his family and friends , or that he had suffered any loss of business customers , it was accepted that his dignity had suffered in general terms .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed , repeating its previous arguments and adding , inter alia , that the impugned articles implied nothing but suspicions , for which in any case there was a solid factual basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) upheld the contested judgment . It concurred with the applicant company that through his participation in the TV quiz A. had become a public figure and that the level of protection of personal integrity he merited was thereby reduced . However , this reduced standard of protection only applied as long as the published material was truthful and any value judgments had a basis in reality .", "CARDINAL . ORG also concurred with the applicant company that the articles were polemical in nature and related to suspicions . Nevertheless , in terms of ORG judgment , the impugned articles were", "\u201c objectively capable of interfering with the plaintiff \u2019s rights , because they did not have a truthful basis , and that is why they did not enjoy protection . The firstinstance court rightly concluded that the evidence taken did not show that the claimant had cheated at the game ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the statement of the eyewitness cited in the article of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that it was presented as a statement of fact , which left the reader with no option of reaching another conclusion than that A. had been cheating . It was irrelevant that that article followed and was based on the previous articles because merely by citing a source the applicant company could not rid itself of its liability for the unjustified interference .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company challenged ORG judgment by way of a complaint under LAW , alleging a violation of LAW , recapitulating all its previous arguments with detailed references to Convention case - law , and claiming that the ordinary courts had failed to give any answer to a significant number of its substantive arguments ..", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) declared the complaint inadmissible as manifestly - ill founded . It found no constitutionally relevant arbitrariness , unlawfulness , deficiency or irregularity in the courts\u2019 reasoning . Moreover , it reiterated that , pursuant to its established case - law , a general court could not bear \u201c secondary liability \u201d for a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms of a substantive nature unless there had been a violation of procedural rules .
