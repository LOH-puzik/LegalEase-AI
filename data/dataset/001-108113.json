De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is the elder brother of the applicant in the case of PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE .", "CARDINAL . The present applicant appears to have travelled from GPE to GPE with his family in DATE . He was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain in GPE as the dependant of his parents . There is some dispute as to whether he remained continuously in GPE after his arrival , but it is clear that he returned to GPE at least twice prior to his deportation and that he married there in DATE . His current marital status and the whereabouts of his wife are not known .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s mother and siblings still live in GPE and are all naturalised NORP citizens . The applicant claimed , furthermore , that his mother was in poor health with diabetes and a heart condition and as such was more than normally dependent on the applicant and her other children . The applicant has CARDINAL children , all of whom were born in GPE , by CARDINAL separate partners . His children are aged DATE . At the time of his deportation , the applicant claimed to be in a relationship not with either of the mothers of his children but with a third NORP citizen , whom he had started seeing whilst in immigration detention in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was convicted of having sexual intercourse with an underage female and of CARDINAL counts of attempted robbery . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in a young offenders\u2019 institution . On DATE , he was convicted for the theft of a vehicle and sentenced to TIME of community service . On DATE , the applicant was convicted of driving whilst disqualified and without insurance and sentenced to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment . He was also disqualified from driving for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appears to have spent DATE in GPE in DATE . On DATE , he was convicted of CARDINAL counts of battery and of resisting or obstructing a constable , and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE , following a conviction for dangerous driving and other related offences , the applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , disqualified from driving for a further DATE , and disqualified until he passed a driving test .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was convicted of robbery , for which he was initially sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The sentence was reduced to DATE on appeal . As a result of this conviction , deportation proceedings against the applicant commenced and on DATE , he was notified of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s intention to make a deportation order against him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not exercise his right of appeal against the decision to deport him and the deportation order was signed on DATE . The applicant was convicted of a further driving offence in DATE . Directions were set for his removal to GPE on DATE , but cancelled when the applicant sought judicial review . The judicial review application was withdrawn by consent following agreement that further consideration would be given to the applicant \u2019s case on human rights grounds . A decision was made on DATE to refuse to revoke the deportation order but to grant the applicant an in - country right of appeal against this decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE . The appeal was argued purely on the grounds of LAW . The ORG accepted that the applicant enjoyed family life in GPE . Although there were no insurmountable obstacles to his CARDINAL partners , both of whom were of NORP origin , and his children accompanying him to GPE , it was accepted that it would be unreasonable to expect them to do so , given that all were NORP citizens and the children had been educated in GPE . There was little evidence before the ORG as to the impact that the applicant \u2019s deportation would have on his children , since neither of the CARDINAL mothers of his children nor any third party had attended the hearing to give evidence . In any event , it was noted that the applicant had not seen any of his children since he had been remanded in custody in DATE , though he claimed to speak to all of them by telephone DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG did not believe the applicant \u2019s claims not to have returned to GPE since his arrival in GPE and not to have married there , since there was evidence to the contrary . It was not therefore accepted that he had no connections in GPE . No serious difficulty for the applicant in re - establishing himself in GPE was envisaged .", "CARDINAL . The ORG accepted that LAW would be engaged by the applicant \u2019s deportation , since he would inevitably be separated from his partners and children . However , the interference with his family life would be proportionate , having regard on the one hand to the applicant \u2019s persistent offending and the high risk he posed to p ublic safety , as assessed by his probation officer , and , on the other , to the lack of evidence as to a meaningful relationship between the applicant and his children over DATE .", "CARDINAL . An application for reconsideration of the ORG \u2019s decision was refused on CARDINAL DATE . Directions were again set for the applicant \u2019s removal , but cancelled when he claimed asylum on DATE . The basis of his claim was that his GPE families in GPE might seek to harm him because they had disapproved of his GPE love marriage and their emigration to GPE ; and that the relatives of CARDINAL women with whom he had had relationships in GPE were also after him . It is not clear who the women concerned were . His asylum claim was refused on DATE , since the applicant had had no direct contact with any of those persons whom he claimed to fear and it was not believed that any of them would recognise him , or know that he had returned to GPE , or be able to trace him . In any event , there was found to be a sufficiency of protection against the actions of non - state actors available in GPE . The applicant \u2019s asylum claim was certified as clearly unfounded , meaning that he had no further right of appeal from within GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made further representations on DATE and CARDINAL and DATE , claiming that he feared his current partner \u2019s ex - husband , who had recently been deported to GPE , and that he was taking medication , namely methadone and various sleeping tablets , which would not be available to him once deported . His representations were rejected on DATE , as the applicant had not raised any new issues regarding his fear of return and his family life had previously been considered by the ORG . As to his concerns regarding his health , there were mental health facilities available in GPE . In any event , the applicant had been assessed by medical staff at the immigration detention centre as being fit to fly and had not been noted as having any particular medical problems .", "CARDINAL . Directions were set on DATE for the applicant \u2019s deportation to GPE on DATE . The applicant sought permission to apply for judicial review of the decision to set removal directions , but his application was refused by ORG on DATE . In the meantime , the applicant had also sought interim measures from this ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG on DATE , to prevent his deportation which had been reset for DATE . His application for interim measures was refused on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was deported to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW DATE ( as amended by ORG ) provides that a person who is not a NORP citizen shall be liable to deportation from GPE if the Secretary of ORG deems his deportation to be conducive to the public good .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE provide for a right of appeal against this decision , inter alia , on the grounds that the decision is incompatible with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that , in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right , courts and tribunals must take into account any case - law from this ORG so far as , in the opinion of the court or tribunal , it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Immigration Act DATE provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending , the decision maker will consider any further submissions and , if rejected , will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim . The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered . The submissions will only be significantly different if the content :", "( i ) had not already been considered ; and", "( ii ) taken together with the previously considered material , created a realistic prospect of success , notwithstanding its rejection . \u201d", "A fresh claim , if it is accepted as such by the Secretary of ORG , and if refused , gives rise to a fresh right of appeal on the merits . If submissions are not accepted as amounting to a fresh claim , their refusal will give rise only to a right to seek judicial review of the decision not to treat them as a fresh claim ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
