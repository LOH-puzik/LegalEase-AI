Carrillo Salcedo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Autronic AG is a limited company incorporated under NORP law and has its head office at GPE ( GPE of GPE ) . It specialises in electronics and in particular sells QUANTITY - diameter dish aerials for home use .", "CARDINAL . ORG Its application relates to the reception in GPE of uncoded television programmes made and broadcast in GPE . They are transmitted to the NORP satellite ORG ( also called PERSON ) , which sends them back to receiving earth stations on NORP territory , and these in turn distribute them to users . The satellite is a telecommunications satellite and not a direct - broadcasting CARDINAL : it provides a fixed point - to - point radiocommunication service ( number CARDINAL of LAW - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and uses the frequencies allotted to radiocommunications . It also transmits telephone conversations , telexes or telegrams and data .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the only television broadcasts by satellite that could be received in GPE by means of a dish aerial were those from ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE applied to ORG of ORG of the national ORG ( PTT ) . It requested permission to give a showing at ORG ( GPE ) from CARDINAL to DATE of the public television programme that it received direct from ORG by means of a private dish aerial , its object being to give a demonstration of the technical capabilities of the equipment in order to promote sales of it .", "CARDINAL . The ORG wrote to GPE embassy in GPE , which on DATE conveyed the NORP authorities\u2019 consent for the duration of the fair .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG made a similar approach in order to give demonstrations at the ORG exhibition , which was to be held in GPE from DATE to CARDINAL DATE and covered the latest developments in radio , television and electronics .", "CARDINAL . ORG again applied to the NORP embassy , but did not receive a reply . On CARDINAL and DATE and on DATE it informed ORG that without the express consent of the NORP authorities it could not allow reception of the ORG broadcasts and that ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) required it to prevent such reception .", "CARDINAL . As Autronic AG was anxious to give further demonstrations , it applied to ORG , on CARDINAL DATE , for a declaratory ruling ( GPE ) that , in particular , reception for private use of uncoded television programmes from satellites such as ORG should not require the consent of the broadcasting ORG \u2019s authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant company relied on several arguments : the confidentiality of a programme could not depend on the use of particular frequencies ; numbers DATE of ORG gave no indication of which kind of broadcast was to be kept confidential ; reception of radio and television programmes intended for and accessible to the general public could be made subject only to the award of a licence under NORP law , which was available to everybody ; and , lastly , the reception in question did not infringe NORP legislation on intellectual property , because while programmes taken individually could have the status of \" works \" , the same was not true of a whole schedule .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s application , stating that it could not grant a receiving licence without the consent of the broadcasting ORG \u2019s authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG noted that only duly approved earth stations were entitled to receive signals from telecommunications satellites . In this connection it referred to number CARDINAL of ORG , under which each national authority could assign certain frequencies to point - to - point radiocommunications provided that the broadcasts were not intended for direct reception by the general public .", "It also stressed the difference between broadcasting satellites and telecommunications satellites . The former transmitted radio and television programmes to an undefined number of receiving stations within a given area , on frequencies expressly reserved for direct reception , while the latter were covered by the secrecy of broadcasts which all member GPE were obliged to ensure under LAW and numbers DATE of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . It added , lastly ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" As to whether a broadcast is intended for direct reception by the general public , the decisive factor is accordingly not the content of the radiocommunication transmitted ( a television programme , for example ) but the mode of its transmission , in other words its classification as a telecommunication . It follows that radio or television programmes transmitted via a telecommunications satellite can not be received in a country unless the telecommunications authority of the broadcasting ORG ... has given its permission to the telecommunications authority of the receiving ORG . This will ensure compliance with the provisions on the secrecy of telecommunications . There is no apparent reason why telecommunications authorities should not be able to keep certain radiocommunications secret since they are under an obligation to ensure that the provisions of ORG and of ORG are complied with . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE lodged an appeal ( Beschwerde ) against ORG decision but this was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "ORG began by holding that it had jurisdiction and that the company had an interest , worthy of protection , in having the disputed decision set aside under section CARDINAL of LAW .", "It went on to set out its reasons for dismissing the appeal . Protection of the material information could not depend on whether the broadcasts were intended for the general public , since as a rule it was not known , at the time of transmission by telecommunications satellites , which broadcasts were intended for general use . Furthermore , LAW secured only the right to receive information from generally accessible sources , which telecommunications satellites were not . Lastly , it was irrelevant that the broadcasts were ultimately intended for general use , as the obligation to keep the transmitted data secret subsisted at the time of broadcasting .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE lodged an administrative - law appeal with ORG against the decision of ORG of the PTT . It applied to have that decision set aside and sought a judgment which would clarify the legal situation for the future ; it asked the court in particular to rule that reception for private use of uncoded broadcasts emanating from telecommunications satellites and intended for the general public should not be subject to the broadcasting ORG \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . ORG In reply to a request for information made by ORG of ORG of the NORP PTT , ORG GPE said the following in a telex of DATE :", "\" With reference to your letter of DATE , we should like to inform you that the programmes transmitted by \u2018 ORG CARDINAL\u2019 [ ORG ] are not satellite broadcasts intended for foreign countries . The programmes are intended for NORP television viewers and are our internal affair . On the other hand , we have no technical means of preventing them from reaching other countries , particularly GPE . As regards the international use of the signal , only discussion and settlement of the problem at world level will provide a solution . \"", "CARDINAL .

ORG gave judgment on DATE and served the text on ORG on DATE .", "The court held that the appellant company was seeking a review in the abstract of the legal position , whereas in reality it could only complain of the ban on receiving the disputed broadcasts during the PERSON exhibition . There was , however , no point in ruling on the admissibility of the appeal , since at all events the company had failed to show that it had an interest worthy of protection .", "Apart from ORG , there was no other satellite over LOC at the time whose broadcasts were receivable by means of a domestic dish aerial . ORG picked up the signals from the NORP satellite because there was no alternative source . As long as this situation continued , there would be practically no market for such equipment and only \" eccentrics \" ( GPE ) would be inclined to buy it . Although CARDINAL other satellites - CARDINAL NORP and CARDINAL NORP - were to be launched , it remained unclear how they would be used and it was impossible to assess either the interest that direct reception of their broadcasts would arouse or the number of dish aerials that would come into use .", "ORG concluded that as it had failed to adduce evidence of any direct economic interest , the applicant company had no interest worthy of protection . It therefore refused to determine the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL .
