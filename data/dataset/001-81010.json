{"ITEMID": "001-81010", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "KERN v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in PERSON and lives in GPE .", "The applicant is an environmental engineer ( ORG ) who had been employed with the PERSON municipality since DATE . His contract had been subject to the collective bargaining contract for federal employees ( Bundesangestelltentarifvertrag ) .", "The applicant is a member and the local chairman of the right - wing extremist collaboration PERSON . On DATE , the day after the terrorist attacks on ORG in GPE and the ORG in GPE ) , he issued a press release on behalf of the B\u00fcndnis Rechts which he both published on the internet and distributed to the press in GPE . Extracts from the press release read as follows :", "\u201c How long can one carry on to exercise terrorism against peoples worldwide , stir up terrorism , sponsor civil wars , apply sanctions against peoples etc . , like GPE has done for DATE with its \u2018 CARDINAL world - idiocy\u2019 in order to bring them to their knees for the interest of a NORP oligarchy , so that the situation ended in an act of liberation against the GPE which had been overdue for a long time and in which human beings unconditionally sacrificed themselves in their fight for liberty ?", "Now that GPE has noted that it is no longer invulnerable as a world power and war monger , the moaning and whining is wide and it condemns as usual before investigating , instead of admitting its mistakes , because the act of violence was certainly not in the first place directed against civilians , but against the political leadership which , viewed under closer scrutiny , has to take responsibility for it . One does not have enemies by coincidence , but one has to make enemies and GPE has already done a lot in this respect .", "...", "Regarding the events , rejoicing is as inappropriate as the voicing of solidarity with the state GPE as the \u2018 guardian of the western community of PERSON . The strikes should rather serve as a warning to GPE perhaps not to act as the policeman of the world on all continents and finally to ensure that less control is being accorded to certain power constellations within GPE !", "The B\u00fcndnis Rechts fiercely condemns all terrorist attacks no matter by whom and expresses its condolences to all innocent , civil victims of such attacks . Terrorist attacks , no matter against whom , are basically unacceptable and intolerable .", "...", "Therefore , a differentiated view is appropriate . Emotions are understandable , but they can not play a role when assessing the situation objectively . \u201d", "After having consulted the staff council , the PERSON municipality informed the applicant about the extraordinary , alternatively ordinary termination of his employment on DATE . After having obtained the staff council \u2019s approval on DATE , the municipality repeated the extraordinary , alternatively ordinary , dismissal on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG declared that the employment relationship between the applicant and the municipality had neither been terminated by the extraordinary nor by the ordinary dismissal of CARDINAL and DATE . It found that the dismissal of DATE had been unlawful because the staff council had not yet approved it , as required by the applicable law , whereas the extraordinary dismissal of CARDINAL DATE had been unlawful because the municipality had exceeded the required time - limit of DATE since it took note of the events . Moreover , ORG considered the ordinary dismissal of CARDINAL DATE to be unlawful because it was not socially justified within the meaning of LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law ) . The press release of DATE did not constitute a sufficient reason for the applicant \u2019s dismissal as he did not exceed his obligation to recognise the free democratic order within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Law on Contracts for ORG ( see Relevant domestic law ) . ORG considered that the applicant , when writing the first paragraph of the press release , was at the borderline of a permissible exercise of an employee \u2019s freedom of expression . However , having regard to the remainder of the press release , it could not be said that the applicant had approved of the terrorist attacks . The applicant had considered the attacks as terrorist acts , he had basically condemned all terrorist attacks and expressed his sincere condolences to all innocent victims of the attacks . Therefore , it could not be said that the applicant had made a malicious statement with regard to the numerous victims or that he had approved of the attacks . He had merely expressed his anti - american feelings which could neither be qualified as a lack of loyalty towards the municipality nor as a refusal to recognise the free democratic order .", "Having found that the dismissal was unlawful , ORG however dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for continued employment until the labour proceedings had been completed . In this respect , ORG took note of a further extraordinary dismissal of DATE in view of the applicant \u2019s criminal conviction of the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations ( section ORG of LAW ) and reasoned that that dismissal outweighed the applicant \u2019s interest for continued employment . Even though the applicant had brought an objection against the dismissal of DATE which was pending in a different set of proceedings before the labour courts , ORG found that the dismissal with regard to the above conviction was at least not manifestly void .", "On DATE , on appeal by the municipality , the Schleswig - Holstein Labour Court of Appeal partly quashed the judgment of DATE and declared that the employment relationship between the applicant and the municipality had neither been terminated by the extraordinary dismissals of CARDINAL and DATE nor by the ordinary dismissal of DATE . However , it considered that the ordinary dismissal of DATE was lawful and that consequently the employment had ended on DATE . ORG noted that , according to section QUANTITY of ORG , the applicant was required to recognise the free democratic order within the meaning of LAW and act accordingly , even outside of his workplace . The above provision had to be interpreted in the light of freedom of expression which protected statements that were polemic or offending , but which were on its part subject to limitations such as section LAW which mirrors other provisions applicable to public servants . An employee was therefore required , when publicly commenting on current political affairs , to do so in a careful manner in order not to damage the public confidence in his impartial , just and welfare - oriented performance .", "The Schleswig - Holstein Labour Court of Appeal found that the press release issued by the applicant exceeded the above limits . The core proposition in the first paragraph of the press release was that the GPE exercised terrorism and pursued a \u201c NORP oligarchy \u201d . ORG found the latter expression objectionable . While the notion \u201c NORP \u201d as such did not have a negative meaning , the combination with \u201c oligarchy \u201d had a negative notion as it suggested world domination by the NORP living in the GPE . Moreover , the applicant had approved of the terrorist attacks by stating that they were \u201c an act of liberation against the GPE which had been overdue for a long time \u201d . While the second paragraph of the press release stated that \u201c the act of violence was certainly not in the first place directed against civilians \u201d , the applicant did not consider the fact that the majority of the victims had been civilians ( but also soldiers working in the ORG ) . Consequently , he had tried to downplay the attacks . When stating in the sixth paragraph that \u201c the strikes should rather serve as a warning to GPE perhaps not to act as the policeman of the world \u201d , the applicant had again approved of the attacks in the sense of \u201c you deserved it \u201d .", "The Schleswig - Holstein Labour Court of Appeal continued that the impression which the applicant had created with the above passages of the press release could not be removed by DATE . Even assuming that readers would in fact read the press release until the end , it could not be established that the applicant condemned the attacks as he restricted his condolences to the civilian victims and disregarded the considerable number of military victims in the ORG . The last paragraphs therefore could not serve as a revocation of his former statements . While the applicant could not be accused of having been disloyal to his employer when expressing his anti - american attitude , his approval of the attacks was in contempt of human dignity of the victims and therefore in breach of the free democratic order . A balancing of the diverging interests in the present case suggested that the interest of the municipality to terminate the employment outweighed the applicant \u2019s interests to keep his position as an environmental engineer . Even though ORG recognised the applicant \u2019s difficulties in finding a new employment given his age of DATE , it reasoned that it was unacceptable for the municipality to continue the employment as it could not expect the applicant to respect the free democratic order in the future .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion to be granted leave to appeal on points of law . ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( GPE ) provides that a termination of an employment relationship by the employer is unlawful if it is socially unjustified . According to LAW ) of the LAW , a termination shall be socially unjustified unless it is based on grounds relating to the employee himself or to his conduct .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Law on Contracts for Federal Employees ( Bundesangestelltentarifvertragsgesetz ) provides that employees must act as it is expected from employees and that they must recognise the free democratic order within the meaning of LAW and act accordingly . ORG applies to employees at the federal , state ( ORG ) and municipal level alike ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
