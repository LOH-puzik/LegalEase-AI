On DATE Mr PERSON , a member of the local group advocating the NORP / NORP version of NORP ( see , concerning this group , PERSON v. GPE and GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) , attacked ORG in GPE . CARDINAL police officer was severely wounded in the attack . In DATE Mr GPE and CARDINAL other members of the group were indicted in relation to that event . Mr GPE was eventually convicted of terrorism and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The other CARDINAL defendants were acquitted . The relevant part of the first - instance judgment rendered in that case , depicting the religious community to which the applicant also belonged , reads as follows :", "\u201c In his ORG and at the main trial , the expert witness Prof . PERSON clarified the notions of \u2018 Wahhabism\u2019 and \u2018 Salafism\u2019 from a scientific perspective :", "\u2018 ...", "Salafi communities in GPE , like the CARDINAL in GPE ( in which the accused lived at the time of the attack ) , are often isolated and inaccessible . The choice of remote and isolated locations to establish settlements is often informed by the belief that true believers who live in a non - believer ( or secular ) country need to resort to hijrah DATE emigration or withdrawal from the surrounding ( non - believers\u2019 ) world , following the example set by PERSON and his followers , who moved from GPE to GPE in CARDINAL to establish the first NORP community .", "Despite mutual differences , most of the NORP Salafi groups share some common traits that are not inherent in NORP organisations ( or religious sects ) only . In practice , they confirm the tendencies of certain traditional religious communities to isolate from other believers and define their holy community through their disciplined opposition to both non - believers and CARDINAL - hearted believers . This pattern is inherent in fundamentalist movements and sects within almost all religious traditions . Such movements as a rule have similar characteristics despite the differences in theological doctrines , size and social composition , the scope of their influence or their tendency towards violence . Yet these fundamentalist and puritan groups mostly do not encourage or approve violence , whether it is aimed against members of the same group or against the outer world .", "According to the available sources and their own declarations , members of the community in GPE oppose the concept of a secular ORG , democracy , free elections and any laws that are not based on Sharia . The positions taken by this group are , inter alia , available at a number of web sites , including www.putvjernika.com , while part of its followers live in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and other countries.\u2019", "...", "CARDINAL NORP Punishment of the accused ( Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure )", "Having been called by the court officer to stand up when ORG entered the courtroom at the first hearing , the accused refused to do so . Also , the accused GPE and Fojnica were wearing skullcaps , which the ORG could correlate with clothing details indicating their religious affiliation . Pursuant to LAW , all those present in the courtroom must stand up upon the call from a court officer . The President of ORG asked the accused to explain both their refusal to stand up and the reasons why they had entered the courtroom wearing skullcaps . The accused stated that they only respected Allah \u2019s judgment and that they did not want to take part in rituals acknowledging man - made judgment . ORG thereupon warned the accused that standing up was a statutory obligation of the accused and that under LAW , disruptive conduct constituted contempt of court , which the ORG would punish by removing them from the courtroom .", "After the warning , the President adjourned the hearing and provided the accused with a reasonable period of time to consult their attorneys in order to change their minds .", "When ORG returned to the courtroom , the accused did not stand up , and therefore the President removed them from the courtroom . The transcript from the hearing was subsequently delivered to the accused .", "At a new hearing , the accused ORG and ORG again did not want to stand up on being called by the court officer , while the accused ORG refused to enter the courtroom . The President therefore asked the accused to respond whether it was their definite decision to act in the same way until the completion of the trial . The accused confirmed that , until the completion of the trial , they had no intention of showing any respect , by standing up , for ORG , which they did not recognise . The ORG found that to continue to bring the accused to scheduled hearings would unnecessarily expose the ORG to significant expense . Therefore , the ORG decided to remove the accused from the trial until its completion , with a warning that they would be notified of any scheduled hearing , and that , prior to it , they could notify the ORG if they changed their mind , in which case the ORG would allow them to come to the hearing . The accused ORG and ORG then changed their mind and regularly appeared before the ORG , while the accused PERSON did so only at the following hearing . The ORG delivered to the accused the audio - recordings and the transcripts from the hearings they had not attended in order to allow them to agree with their defence attorneys on their defence strategy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the context of that trial , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) summoned the applicant , who belonged to the same religious community , to appear as a witness on DATE . He appeared , as summoned , but refused to remove his skullcap , notwithstanding an order from the president of the trial chamber to do so . He was then expelled from the courtroom , convicted of contempt of court and sentenced to a fine of MONEY ( BAM ) under LAW . The relevant part of that decision reads as follows :", "\u201c The ORG has examined the situation encountered in the courtroom with the utmost care . The ORG is aware that the witness belongs to a religious community , organised under special rules in the village of GPE , of which the accused are also members . In view of that , the ORG has acquainted the witness with the provisions of LAW of LAW and the obligations of the parties in the judicial institutions , which ban visitors from entering these buildings in clothing that is not in accordance with the generally accepted dress codes within the professional environment of the judicial institutions . In addition , the ORG has pointed out to the witness that , in public institutions , it is not acceptable to display religious affiliation through clothing or religious symbols , and that the ORG is obliged to support and promote values that bring people closer , not those that separate them . The ORG has particularly emphasised that the rights of the individual are not absolute and must not jeopardise common values .", "The witness \u2019s attention has especially been drawn to the fact that people of various religious beliefs , belonging to different religious groups , appear before the court and that it is necessary to have confidence in the court . Thus , the court is not a place where religious beliefs can be expressed in a way that discredits certain common rules and principles in a multicultural society . That is why the law obliges everyone who appears before the ORG to respect the ORG and its rules .", "The ORG finds the witness \u2019s refusal to accept the rules of court and to show respect to the ORG by accepting its warnings , to be a flagrant breach of order in the courtroom . The ORG has found that this behaviour is connected to a number of other identical cases before it , in which the members of the same religious group behaved in the same manner , publicly indicating that they did not recognise this ORG . The frequency of such disrespectful behaviour and contempt of court is producing dangerous criminogenic effects and undoubtedly presents a specific threat to society . It is not necessary to particularly substantiate how this behaviour impairs the ORG \u2019s reputation and confidence in the ORG . A legitimate conclusion may be that it is essentially directed against the ORG and basic social values . Therefore , a severe and uncompromising reaction on the part of the ORG , taking all existing repressive measures , is crucial for dealing with such behaviour . Restraint on the part of the ORG in cases of this or other types of extremism can have serious consequences for the reputation of the judiciary and the stability of society in GPE .", "Bearing in mind the frequency , seriousness and gravity of this type of breach of order in the courtroom and its damaging consequences , the ORG has decided to punish the witness by imposing the maximum fine of BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Such a severe penalty should be a message to all the parties in the courtroom that contempt of court is unacceptable . The ORG must be respected and the level of respect for the ORG is the same as for ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE an appeals chamber of the same court reduced the fine to CARDINAL and upheld the rest of the first - instance decision . It held that the requirement to remove any and all headgear on the premises of public institutions was CARDINAL of the basic requirements of life in society . It further held that in a secular ORG such as GPE , any manifestation of religion in a courtroom was forbidden . The relevant part of that decision reads :", "\u201c The ORG observes that it is obvious and well known that skullcaps , hats and other headgear should be removed when entering any LOC , and notably the LOC of ORG and other public institutions , as there is no longer a need to wear them and removing a skullcap or a hat is an expression of respect for this institution and its function . The duty to remove headgear exists not only in this court but also in other courts and institutions in GPE as well as in other GPE . Such rules and duties apply to all persons without exception , regardless of religious , sexual , national or other affiliation .", "Indeed , this is a duty of all those who visit ORG in whatever capacity , as explained in more detail in LAW of LAW : \u2018 Visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial institutions . Visitors shall not wear miniskirts , shorts , t - shirts with thin straps , open heel shoes and other garments that do not correspond to the dress code applicable to judicial institutions\u2019 .", "It would appear from the case file that the judge in charge of this specific case first directed the witness to remove his skullcap in the courtroom , and then gave him TIME to think about it as well as about the consequences of rejecting that order . As the witness had nevertheless failed to remove his skullcap , showing thereby wilful disrespect for the authority of the court , the President of ORG fined him in accordance with LAW .", "It follows from the aforementioned that the judge in charge did not invent the duty of removing the skullcap when addressing the court , as claimed in the appeal . This is indeed a matter of a generally accepted standard of behaviour in the courtroom which applies not only to this ORG but also to other courts ; furthermore , it has always been applied . This duty stems from Rule CARDINAL of LAW cited above . Therefore , the allegations made by the lawyer PERSON in the appeal are not only unjustified but totally inappropriate .", "The allegation in the appeal that the witness was punished simply because he was a believer who was practising his religion , and that he had thereby been discriminated against , is also unsubstantiated . The duty of removing headgear and behaving decently applies without exception to anyone visiting the court LOC . All persons visiting the ORG , regardless of their religion , nationality , sex or other status , have the same rights and obligations and are obliged , among other things , to remove their skullcaps , hats and other headgear . This was explained to the witness . Any behaviour to the contrary has always been interpreted and is still interpreted as disrespectful towards the court , and the appellant is aware of that . GPE , as mentioned in the impugned decision , is a secular ORG in which religion is separate from public life . The ORG therefore holds that the premises of the ORG can not be a place for the manifestation of any religion .", "It clearly follows from the aforementioned that the witness PERSON was not deprived of his right to freedom of religion and freedom to manifest religion at his home or any other place dedicated for that purpose , but not in the courtroom . Therefore , the allegations by the lawyer PERSON of a violation of the rights guaranteed by the LAW and LAW , and of discrimination on religious grounds , are unsubstantiated .", "Having found that the witness \u2019s punishment was justified and that his appeal was ill - founded in that part , ORG then examined the amount of the fine and decided that it was excessive .", "As noted in the appeal , BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL is the maximum fine for contempt of court . The maximum fine should be imposed in the most serious cases .", "Turning to the relevant criteria , the nature and the seriousness of the conduct must certainly be taken into consideration . However , the appellant is wrong in claiming that his means should have also been taken into account , as the fine for contempt of court is not a criminal sanction , but is of a disciplinary nature .", "While the witness showed a high level of determination in disrespecting the court ( he again failed to remove his skullcap after a pause of TIME given to him to reflect ) and this fact definitely affected the amount of the fine , the act itself ( failure to remove headgear ) is not the most serious case of contempt of court which would justify the maximum fine . Since the witness did not use offensive language , there was no need to impose the maximum fine . This is notwithstanding the fact that members of the same religious group have lately shown a pattern of disrespectful behaviour . While it is true that the general prevention is CARDINAL of the aims of sanctions , including disciplinary ones , disciplinary sanctions are primarily directed at individuals . Everyone should therefore be held responsible and adequately punished for his / her conduct only , and not for that of other members of any group . This follows from LAW .", "In the circumstances of this case , and having regard to the nature and the intensity of contempt of court committed by this witness , the appeals chamber finds that a fine in the amount of BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL is appropriate . The appeal by the lawyer PERSON is therefore partially accepted and the impugned decision amended . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had failed to pay the fine , on DATE the fine was converted into CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to LAW . That decision was upheld on DATE and the applicant served his prison sentence immediately .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found no breach of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW , fully accepting the reasoning of ORG . At the same time , it found a breach of LAW because of the automatic way in which fines were converted into imprisonment and ordered that LAW of LAW of GPE be amended . However , it decided not to quash the decision converting the fine into imprisonment in this case , relying on the principle of legal certainty .", "The relevant part of the majority decision reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG notes that the present case concerns a specific situation where the universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution intertwines with the right of the appellant to manifest in a courtroom , contrary to that standard , affiliation with his religious community . The appellant claims that ORG did not have a basis in law for imposing a fine for his failure to comply with a court order , as LAW does not contain a provision prescribing any such measure , for which reason his right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion was violated .", "CARDINAL . Starting from the main objection raised by the appellant , that the limitation in the case at hand was not prescribed by law , ORG notes that ORG ( ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) has held that CARDINAL requirements flow from the expression \u2018 prescribed by law\u2019 in DATE . \u2018 Firstly , the law must be adequately accessible : the citizen must be able to have an indication that is adequate in the circumstances of the legal rules applicable to a given case . Secondly , a norm can not be regarded as a \u2018 law\u2019 unless it is formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct : he must be able - if need be with appropriate advice - to foresee , to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances , the consequences which a given action may entail.\u2019 In addition , the wording of many statutes is not absolutely precise . The need to avoid excessive rigidity and to keep pace with changing circumstances means that many laws are inevitably couched in terms which , to a greater or lesser extent , are vague . The interpretation and application of such enactments depend on practice ( see ORG , cited above ) .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , as concerns the issue of whether ORG , in adopting the challenged ruling , acted in accordance with the law , ORG observes that the provision of LAW provides that the judge or the presiding judge may order that a party to the proceedings who disrupts order in a courtroom or disobeys court orders be removed from the courtroom and be fined in an amount of up to BAM CARDINAL,CARDINAL . ORG also observes that the cited provision , on which ORG relied , does not prescribe a list of all types of conduct which may be regarded as disruption of order in a courtroom , but rather each court , in the circumstances of a given case , decides whether some type of conduct may be considered disruptive or not , which falls within the scope of that court \u2019s margin of discretion ( see the ORG decision no . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . This is a universally accepted standard of conduct of the courts in GPE , which is in accordance with the position of ORG , referred to in the ORG judgment , that the interpretation and application of such enactments that are couched in vague terms depend on practice .", "CARDINAL . ORG notes that ORG relied also on LAW of LAW , providing that \u2018 visitors must respect the dress code applicable to judicial ORG , as an internal act of ORG and other judicial institutions . ORG observes likewise that the mentioned provision does not specify what that dress code is . However , ORG in the case at hand kept in mind that the universally accepted standard of conduct in a civilised society required that upon entering the premises of a public institution one should remove one \u2019s headgear out of respect for that institution and its function . Likewise , ORG is aware that the said ORG Rules were not published , but that is not a problem since the present case concerns a universally accepted and usual standard of conduct in a judicial institution in a civilised and democratic society that GPE and GPE aspires to become . ORG also holds that the standard in issue could and should have been known to the appellant . In addition , ORG observes that ORG clearly and unequivocally warned the appellant of that universally accepted standard of conduct , which is indeed mandatory for all visitors of judicial institutions , irrespective of their religion , sex , national origin or other status .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , ORG clearly warned the appellant of the consequences of such conduct and , although it was not required to do so , accorded him an additional time to reconsider his position . This is clearly in accordance with the stance taken by ORG in relation to the notion \u2018 prescribed by law\u2019 ( ORG , cited above ) . Indeed , ORG clearly and unequivocally informed the appellant of the applicable rules in the judicial institutions and of the consequences of disobeying the rules . Moreover , at his own request , the appellant was granted additional time to think about all this . ORG especially emphasises the fact that the limitation in question applied only while the appellant was in the courtroom , that is , during his testimony before ORG . ORG holds that ORG did not thereby place an excessive burden on the appellant , given that it simply requested that the appellant adjust his conduct to LAW , which applied to all visitors , and only in the courtroom . Bearing in mind all the aforementioned , ORG holds , in the circumstances of this particular case , that ORG , using the margin of discretion referred to in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , acted in accordance with the law , and that , contrary to the appellant \u2019s opinion , the interference , which was of a limited nature , was lawful .", "CARDINAL . As to the question whether the interference in the present case had a legitimate aim , ORG notes that ORG simply relied on a universally accepted standard of conduct in a judicial institution , which requires all the visitors of judicial institutions to respect \u2018 the dress code applicable to judicial ORG . That court further relied on the inadmissibility of the manifestation in public institutions of religious affiliation and religious symbols which were contrary to the usual standards of conduct , and in so doing it took into account its obligation to support the values that bring people closer and not those that separate them . ORG notes that ORG underlined in that regard that GPE was a secular ORG where religion was separated from public life and that therefore no one could manifest his / her religion or religious affiliation in a courtroom . Considering the position of ORG that in democratic societies in which several religions coexist ( as is the case of GPE ) it may be necessary to place restrictions on the freedom of religion ( ORG , cited above ) , in the context of the obligation of an independent judicial institution to support the values that bring people closer , and not those that separate them , ORG holds that the restriction in the present case , which was of a temporary nature , aspired to achieve legitimate aims . Finally , ORG reiterates that LAW is primarily designed to allow ORG unhindered and effective conduct of proceedings . A judge or the president of a chamber is thereby given the possibility of imposing a fine for any inappropriate behaviour which is directed at disrupting order in a courtroom or at damaging the reputation of ORG . In the present case , ORG considered the repeated refusal of the appellant to comply with an order of the court to be damaging to the reputation and the dignity of a judicial institution . Therefore , the Constitutional Court finds that the restriction in issue , which was of a limited nature , was in accordance with the legitimate aim of maintaining the dignity of a judicial institution for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as to the question whether the decision was necessary in a democratic society in order to achieve CARDINAL of the legitimate aims under LAW , ORG reiterates that , according to the settled case - law of ORG , GPE have a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of the need for interference , but this margin is subject to NORP supervision , embracing both the law and the decisions applying it , even those given by independent courts ( GPE , cited above ) . Furthermore , under the well - established case - law of ORG , the ORG is called upon to establish whether the measures undertaken at the national level were justified in principle \u2013 that is , whether the reasons given by the national authorities to justify them were \u2018 relevant and sufficient\u2019 and whether the measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ( ORG , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "of Criminal Procedure enabling the courts to fine participants in proceedings who refuse to obey court orders , with a view to conducting proceedings efficiently and maintaining the authority and dignity of courts . ORG took into account the fact that owing to his failure to pay the fine , the appellant \u2019s fine was converted to a prison sentence pursuant to LAW . However , ORG will examine that factor in the following paragraphs of this decision concerning the right to a fair trial . Therefore , in view of the above and the circumstances of this particular case , ORG holds that the impugned restriction did not constitute an excessive burden for the appellant , that the measure undertaken by ORG pursued legitimate aims within the meaning of LAW , and that there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the restriction and the legitimate aim pursued .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , ORG concludes that the impugned decision did not breach the appellant \u2019s right to manifest his religion under LAW ( g ) of LAW and LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL judges of ORG appended dissenting opinions . They disagreed with the majority as concerns Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . In particular , given that the applicant had appeared as summoned and had stood up while addressing the court , they considered that his conduct had not been disrespectful . They further maintained that , unlike public officials , private citizens , such as the applicant , did not owe a duty of neutrality . Therefore , the applicant \u2019s punishment for refusing to remove a religious symbol in a courtroom constituted , in their opinion , disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of religion ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["9"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["9-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
