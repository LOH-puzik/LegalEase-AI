The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the first applicant left GPE for GPE , where he met and married the second applicant . The couple subsequently moved to GPE , where they lived for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the couple and their children left GPE for GPE and from there took a boat to GPE . According to the findings of the NORP police and the identification forms annexed to the observations of ORG , the applicants ( the couple and their CARDINAL oldest children ) landed on the coast of GPE on DATE and were immediately subjected to the ORG identification procedure ( taking of photographs and fingerprints ) after supplying a false identity . DATE the couple and the CARDINAL children were placed in a reception facility provided by the municipal authorities of ORG ( GPE province ) , where they remained until DATE . On that date they were transferred to ORG ( Centro di Acoglienza per PERSON , \u201c ORG \u201d ) in PERSON , in the GPE region , once their true identity had been established .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , living conditions in the centre were poor , particularly on account of the lack of appropriate sanitation facilities , the lack of privacy and the climate of violence among the occupants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants left the ORG in PERSON without permission . They subsequently travelled to GPE , where on DATE they were again registered in the ORG system . They lodged an application for asylum in GPE which was rejected . On DATE GPE submitted a request to take charge of the applicants to the NORP authorities , which on CARDINAL DATE formally accepted the request . On an unspecified date the applicants travelled to GPE . On DATE the NORP authorities informed their NORP counterparts that the transfer had been cancelled because the applicants had gone missing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants applied for asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first and second applicants were interviewed by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and stated that living conditions in GPE were difficult and that it would be impossible for the first applicant to find work there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG requested the NORP authorities to take charge of the applicants . In their respective observations the NORP and ORG agreed that the request had been tacitly accepted by GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 asylum application and made an order for their removal to GPE . The administrative authority considered that \u201c the difficult living conditions in GPE [ did ] not render the removal order unenforceable \u201d , that \u201c it [ was ] therefore for the NORP authorities to provide support to the applicants \u201d and that \u201c the NORP authorities [ did ] not have competence to take the place of the NORP authorities . \u201d On the basis of these considerations it concluded that \u201c the file [ did ] not contain any specific element disclosing a risk to the applicants\u2019 lives in the event of their return to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG . In support of their appeal they submitted that the reception conditions for asylum seekers in GPE were in breach of LAW and that the federal authorities had not given sufficient consideration to their complaint in that regard .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , upholding the ORG \u2019s decision in its entirety . The court considered that \u201c while there [ were ] shortcomings in the reception and social welfare arrangements , and asylum seekers [ could ] not always be taken care of by the authorities or private charities \u201d , there was no evidence in the file capable of \u201c rebutting the presumption that GPE complie[d ] with its obligations under public international law . \u201d With more particular reference to the applicants\u2019 conduct it held that \u201c in deciding to travel to GPE , they [ had ] not given the NORP authorities the opportunity to assume their obligations with regard to [ the applicants\u2019 ] situation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested the ORG to have the proceedings reopened and to grant them asylum in GPE . They submitted that their individual situation had not been examined in detail . The ORG forwarded the request to ORG , which reclassified it as a \u201c request for revision \u201d of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and rejected it in a judgment dated DATE , on the ground that the applicants had not submitted any new grounds which they could not have relied on during the ordinary proceedings . The applicants had based their request mainly on a more detailed account of their stay in GPE and the fact that their children were now attending school in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE which reached ORG CARDINAL May , the applicants applied to this ORG and sought an interim measure requesting ORG not to deport them to GPE for the duration of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In a fax dated CARDINAL DATE the Registry informed ORG Agent that the acting President of the Section to which the case had been assigned had decided to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG that the applicants should not be deported to GPE for the duration of the proceedings before the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
