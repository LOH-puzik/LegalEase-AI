On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law against that ruling .", "CARDINAL . In a decree of DATE the NORP Prime Minister granted the extradition on condition that , pursuant to the statute of DATE , the applicant was given a new and fair trial if he so requested on returning to GPE , and that the death penalty was not sought , imposed or carried out .

The applicant applied to the Prime Minister to reconsider his decision ; that application was dismissed on DATE . On DATE he applied to the ORG d\u2019Etat to quash both decisions .", "In support of his application , he argued in particular that the ORG of GPE \u2019s statute of DATE contravened the principle of separation of powers enshrined in LAW and that its constitutionality should normally be raised by the courts of their own motion or might be raised by the civil parties to the proceedings or by any citizen . That would be an obstacle to his being granted a new trial in conditions complying with LAW . He further submitted that his extradition had been granted by ORG on the basis of a specially passed law with retrospective effect ( the statute of DATE ) , which had been enacted with the sole aim of influencing the judicial outcome of the extradition proceedings against him , thereby breaching his right to a fair trial . He added that in any event , in view of the \u201c pressure of legal and media attention \u201d which the case had generated in GPE and which a jury would be not have been able to avoid , he would not be retried in GPE in conditions satisfying the requirements of LAW . He further maintained that his extradition would contravene LAW in that he would , in any event , be likely to have to serve a full life sentence without any genuine prospect of remission or parole . In addition , he alleged that , in view of the fact that the victim \u2019s body had been found after the death penalty had been restored in GPE , it was not to be excluded that he would be sentenced to death , especially as it had not been established that the death penalty could not be imposed by a court where it had not been sought by the prosecution ; there were therefore substantial grounds for believing that he faced a real risk of being sentenced to death and hence of being exposed to the \u201c death - row phenomenon \u201d , so that his extradition would breach LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed PERSON applications . With regard to the first of the above - mentioned grounds , the PERSON d\u2019Etat held that it was not for it to rule whether enactments applicable within the territory of the requesting ORG were in conformity with that ORG \u2019s LAW ; matters could only be otherwise if the impugned enactment had already been declared unconstitutional by means of a final decision in that ORG or if there had been \u201c such serious irregularities [ in its adoption ] that it must be regarded as invalid \u201d . With regard to the second ground , the PERSON d\u2019Etat held that the statute of CARDINAL DATE was \u201c applicable in exactly the same manner to all persons tried and convicted in absentia who have fled to a foreign country which refuses to extradite them because they were convicted in absentia \u201d and that the applicant had not furnished any information enabling it to assess whether there was any foundation for his statement that a retrial would not be fair on account of the circumstances in which the statute in issue had been enacted . With regard to the third ground , the PERSON d\u2019Etat held that in any event , \u201c the extradition of a person who faces a sentence of life imprisonment without any possibility of early release is not contrary to NORP public policy or LAW . The fourth ground was dismissed for the following reason :", "\u201c The extradition request ... relates to acts committed in DATE , before the enactment ... of the statute of the GPE of GPE in which the death penalty was introduced ; the evidence shows that that statute can not be applied to offences committed before it came into force .", "Even supposing that ... the offence of which [ the applicant ] is accused might be regarded at a new trial as having been committed after the statute of CARDINAL DATE came into force in view of the fact that the victim \u2019s body was not discovered until DATE , the Government of GPE gave an assurance in its request of DATE that if [ the applicant \u2019s ] extradition was agreed to , the death penalty would not be sought , imposed or carried out . The District Attorney of GPE has twice given an undertaking that the death penalty will not be sought in respect of [ the applicant ] . In an affidavit of DATE she gave a formal assurance that in the GPE of GPE the death penalty could not be imposed if it had not been sought . Consequently , there is no basis for [ the applicant \u2019s ] submission that , despite the conditions attached to the impugned order , his extradition had been granted without sufficient guarantees being offered and was therefore contrary to NORP public policy . \u201d", "On DATE , after the judgment had been delivered , the applicant cut his throat and slashed his left wrist .", "On DATE the Government produced to the ORG a medical certificate dated DATE , which attested that the applicant \u2019s state of health was compatible with his transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL .

ORG will not seek the death penalty in any future action regarding this case , nor can it legally do so . Further , the ORG can not pronounce the death penalty in this case on its own motion under GPE law . \u201d", "Following the entry into force of the statute of DATE , PERSON swore a further affidavit , on DATE , \u201c in support of request for extradition from GPE \u201d . The affidavit stated that it was \u201c binding on the ORG and [ the LOC Attorney \u2019s ] Office \u201d and that \u201c LOC Office now can , and does , give full assurances that PERSON will receive a new trial at his request upon his return to GPE \u201d .

Because PERSON murdered [ the victim ] in DATE , he is not subject to the death penalty as a matter of law \u201d . She also stated the following :", "\u201c LAW prohibition against ex post facto laws in LAW , protects a person from the imposition of a penalty that was increased after he committed his criminal acts . ORG of GPE has explained that the ex post facto clause bars a legislature from retroactively altering the definition of crimes or increasing the punishment for criminal acts . Consequently , GPE can not change its law to impose the death penalty for any murder prior to the enactment of the statute . Therefore , the statute applies only to murders committed after its enactment . The case of ORG v. Truesdale , decided by ORG on DATE , unequivocally prohibits imposition of the death penalty for murders which were committed before the passage of the death penalty statute on DATE . The opinion binds all GPE courts , ORG and prosecutors regarding the imposition of the death penalty . ...", "The death penalty has never been sought or imposed by the ORG of GPE in this case . The District Attorney has submitted an affidavit that no death penalty can be imposed , nor will the death penalty be sought ... Any representation that the death penalty is a possibility is false . Under GPE law , which binds the GPE of GPE , the District Attorney \u2019s promise binds not only the present GPE Attorney , but all future ORG and every prosecutor who may be responsible for the prosecution . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a diplomatic note of DATE to ORG , GPE embassy stated : \u201c The new statute , CARDINAL GPE ( PACS ) Section CARDINAL ( c ) , enacted DATE , guarantees PERSON the right to a new trial for the murder of [ the victim ] \u201d . It provided the following clarifications :", "\u201c Under the new statute , the GPE of GPE , through its GPE , is now able to and does guarantee that PERSON will receive a second trial , with all attendant rights , if he were extradited from GPE and if he requested a new trial . Consequently , ORG provides its assurances that , if the Government of GPE extradites PERSON to GPE [ in connection with the murder of the victim in DATE in the ] GPE of GPE , PERSON will receive a new trial on the merits with all attendant rights .", "In addition , ORG provides its assurances that if the Government of GPE extradites PERSON to GPE to stand trial for murder in the GPE of GPE , the death penalty will not be sought , imposed or executed against PERSON for this offense . The sworn affidavit of GPE Attorney PERSON , dated DATE , and an earlier assurance by PERSON sworn DATE , affirms that under GPE law it is legally impossible for a prosecutor to seek or a court on its own motion to impose [ the ] death penalty for murders committed in GPE prior to DATE . ORG decision , ORG v. PERSON , dated DATE , unequivocally prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for murders committed prior to the enactment of ORG on DATE . This decision binds all GPE courts , district attorneys and prosecutors regarding the imposition of the death penalty . ... \u201d", "Those assurances were reiterated in a diplomatic note of DATE , in which it was also stated that ORG had held that laws enacted after a criminal judgment had been delivered , particularly where they might benefit the accused , were not inconsistent with the prohibition on ex post facto laws ( see PERSON v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE DATE ) , a fact which served to confirm the constitutionality of the DATE GPE statute guaranteeing the applicant a new trial on his return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In an affidavit of CARDINAL DATE , however , PERSON , the lawyer who had represented the applicant at his trial in absentia in ORG , affirmed that in the PERSON case in DATE the District Attorney of GPE had sought the death penalty for offences committed before the statute of CARDINAL DATE restoring the death penalty in GPE had been enacted . Mr PERSON stated :", "\u201c In spite of all the governing authority being against retroactive application of the DATE death penalty , Judge O\u2019Keefe , who presided over GPE trial , ruled that the GPE of GPE could seek the death penalty and question potential jurors about their views on the death penalty .", "The prosecutor never retreated from his position that he was entitled to seek the death penalty . The judge never reconsidered his ruling . ... PERSON was found not guilty , and that was the end of the case . The penalty portion of the case was never reached because of the acquittals .", "I never understood how the GPE of GPE as represented by ORG in GPE successfully argued the right of the ORG to use the death penalty retroactively as to ORG , and still do not understand how that happened . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an affidavit of DATE PERSON , a member of ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG and an associate professor at ORG , argued that the statute of CARDINAL DATE was unconstitutional . He stated , inter alia :", "\u201c In my professional opinion , the provision is clearly , without a doubt , unconstitutional . As a matter of separation of powers under LAW , it has been well established for CARDINAL DATE in GPE that the legislature has no power to disturb final judgments of conviction and sentence . In PERSON v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE DATE ( DATE ) , ORG held that a statute purporting to grant a new trial to a litigant was unconstitutional . Likewise , in ORG v. Sutley , CARDINAL A.CARDINALd CARDINAL ( DATE ) , ORG held unconstitutional a statute which purported to reduce penalties for defendants who had already been sentenced for marijuana possession . ...", "The statute is also clearly unconstitutional because it violates LAW , LAW ) of LAW which gives ORG exclusive power to control matters of practice and procedure in the courts , while providing no power for the legislature . ...", "There are other potential constitutional problems with the statute . For example , the provision does not grant a new trial to all defendants convicted in absentia , but only to those who have been refused extradition , notably only Mr PERSON . The courts may view this statute as an arbitrary and capricious legislative enactment which is a violation of due process or a prohibited legislative bill of attainder directed to a particular individual . However , it should be unnecessary for a court to reach these issues because of its palpable unconstitutionality on separation of powers and LAW , LAW ) grounds . \u201d", "He reiterated that conclusion in affidavits of DATE and DATE , stating , inter alia ( extract from the affidavit of DATE ) :", "\u201c ... The legislature is without authority to change final judgments of the courts . ...", "In my expert opinion , the GPE of GPE and GPE District Attorney \u2019s Office have no power at all to insulate this law from judicial review . Because ... the legislative attempt to overturn a court \u2019s judgment of conviction on a murder case and life sentence is obviously violative of Article V , \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) and separation of powers under LAW , a court will ultimately invalidate [ the impugned statute ] and hold that it is void . If GPE extradites PERSON to GPE it is extremely likely , despite the new GPE law , that he will be ordered to serve his life sentence without parole , received after his trial in absentia , without ever receiving a new trial .", "... even when the parties in a criminal case agree to a result , judicial review and acceptance is always a prerequisite . ...", "If PERSON is returned to GPE and neither party challenges [ the impugned statute ] , purportedly granting him a new trial , it is very likely that the family of the murder victim , or even any taxpayer in GPE , could successfully bring a challenge to this clearly unconstitutional law . ...", "If PERSON is ordered extradited to GPE , it is very likely that there will be a challenge to the constitutionality of [ the impugned statute ] which will be heard by the courts , which in turn will then declare the statute unconstitutional null and void . The original conviction and sentence , life without parole for PERSON , will be held to be valid and enforceable under GPE law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an affidavit of CARDINAL DATE PERSON , of ORG and Chief of ORG of ORG , reached the same conclusion . He stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... if Mr. PERSON returns to GPE and asserts the right granted to him DATE and him alone DATE ORG will invalidate the statute and Mr. PERSON will be recommitted , without a new trial , to serve the life sentence imposed after a trial at which he was not present , a sentencing at which he was not present , and an appeal he was not permitted to litigate . \u201d", "In an affidavit of CARDINAL DATE he declared :", "\u201c ... Frankly , I am appalled , but not surprised , by LOC \u2019s \u2018 GPE which refers to the statute granting a new trial but makes no reference whatsoever to controlling decisions of ORG unequivocally holding that any such statute is invalid . Furthermore , I am surprised and disappointed by ORG blind endorsement of this deliberately misleading document .", "Although including citations to legal authority addressing issues that are not germane to the principal issues the District Attorney ignores , making absolutely no reference to , clear and compelling authority establishing that the statute it drafted is unconstitutional , unenforceable and invalid . ...", "Given DATE of contrary unbroken precedent it is impossible to see how the District Attorney can \u2018 GPE that ORG will allow the statute in question to stand and allow or order a retrial . In the light of any real consideration the LOC Attorney \u2019s \u2018 GPE must be dismissed as , at the least , misleading . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an affidavit of CARDINAL DATE PERSON , an attorney admitted to practise law in the GPE of GPE and before ORG , ORG and ORG and the author of the reference work entitled ORG , stated :", "\u201c ...

In an affidavit of CARDINAL DATE PERSON , a member of ORG of ORG and counsel for the applicant in the extradition proceedings , affirmed , inter alia :", "\u201c ... it becomes apparent and a distinct possibility that even if the District Attorney should fulfill her promise , and thereafter , even if a trial court should act or be about to act in a manner inconsistent with its ability to assume jurisdiction ( i.e. by seeking to grant PERSON a new trial ) then ORG could , sua sponte ( on its own motion ) , reach out and take jurisdiction to demonstrate that the PERSON law is unconstitutional , and a lower court is not authorized to accept jurisdiction and vacate a final judgment pursuant to this \u2018 PERSON law\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an affidavit of CARDINAL DATE PERSON likewise argued that the statute of DATE was \u201c clearly unconstitutional \u201d and that consequently , notwithstanding the pledge given by the District Attorney , PERSON , no court had jurisdiction to apply the statute and the applicant could not be granted a new trial . In a further affidavit of DATE he affirmed , inter alia :", "\u201c The GPE of GPE is relying exclusively on the \u2018 PERSON law\u2019 , passed on DATE to assure GPE that PERSON will be granted a new trial by a GPE court . It is my opinion , and the opinion of many other scholars , that a court will not , and indeed , can not grant PERSON a new trial pursuant to this statute or for any other reason . ...", "Merely because the law is not an ex post facto law does not make it constitutional . The constitutional defects in the PERSON law render it unenforceable . It is unenforceable because it violates the constitutional separation of powers principles long established by both ORG and ORG . See ORG v. Sutley , CARDINAL Pa.

The court would have to state that it could not act unconstitutionally and to grant a new trial pursuant to this statute , or for any other reason , would be to act in violation of the separation of powers concept and therefore unconstitutionally . ...", "... [ E]qually well settled ... is the rule that a law repugnant to the LAW is void and that it is not only the right but the duty of a court so to declare when the violation unequivocably appears : see PERSON v.

Wherefore , the above accurately states my position and the position of several of the most respected constitutional scholars in GPE , amongst whose number are PERSON , PERSON ( Professor of PERSON , ORG ) ; PERSON , ORG ( Head of ORG of ORG ) and PERSON , ORG ( former District Attorney of GPE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In an affidavit dated DATE PERSON , Chief of ORG , GPE District Attorney \u2019s ORG , affirmed in particular that if the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment , he would have the possibility of applying for release or for commutation of his sentence . Power to release prisoners or to commute their sentences was vested in the Governor of GPE ( see LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , and LAW ) . Any applications for release or for commutation of sentences were first examined by ORG , comprising the Lieutenant Governor of GPE , the Attorney General of GPE and CARDINAL members appointed by the Governor and approved by vote of ORG ( CARDINAL of the CARDINAL being a member of the Bar , CARDINAL a penologist , and CARDINAL a doctor of medicine , a psychiatrist or a psychologist ) . When the ORG examined an application from a prisoner serving a life sentence , it was required to interview the prisoner . If the ORG recommended commutation of a sentence and the Governor agreed , the decision was not subject to appeal . Mr PERSON pointed out , in particular , that DATE the procedure had resulted in \u201c CARDINAL releases , and CARDINAL commutations of life - sentenced prisoners \u201d . He concluded : \u201c These statistics suggest that , although PERSON may have little chance in the short run for gubernatorial relief , his longer term prospects are of a different nature . ... Were he to apply for release or commutation in DATE immediately after his return , relief would be unlikely and , indeed , unjust . History indicates , however , that , by the time PERSON has spent some considerable period in prison , the climate will have changed , and an application will be received in a different light . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In an affidavit of DATE Professor PERSON gave his opinion on the likelihood of a life sentence being commuted . He stated that it would be virtually impossible for the applicant ever to be released from prison after being given a life sentence in GPE . In that connection , he explained that prisoners serving a life sentence were not eligible for parole unless the ORG Governor first commuted the sentence to another one of a duration which afforded that possibility . Under LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , the Governor could only consider commutation if ORG had recommended it . Prisoners serving life sentences had to apply to ORG for permission to be interviewed by it ; the decision whether or not to grant a hearing was taken by a majority . If a hearing was granted , ORG made a recommendation , again by a majority . Even supposing a prisoner serving a life sentence managed to overcome those obstacles and received an order from the Governor granting commutation , he would still have to serve DATE in a pre - release centre before an application for parole could be considered . Decisions on admitting inmates to a pre - release centre were taken by the prison authorities , who had complete discretion in the matter . Even if an inmate was admitted to a pre - release centre , ORG could refuse parole on any ground ; that decision was not subject to review . Professor PERSON added , among other things , that DATE \u201c there was an average of CARDINAL inmates a year whose life sentences were commuted \u201d , whereas CARDINAL inmates were currently serving life sentences in GPE . He concluded by stating :", "\u201c Because PERSON has been a fugitive and has not as yet served any time on his GPE life sentence , there is no doubt , given the governing laws and the practical application of those laws , that a life sentence for PERSON in GPE would mean that he would eventually die in prison . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
