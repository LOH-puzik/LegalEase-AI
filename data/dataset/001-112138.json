According to information provided by the Government , the applicant was dissolved on DATE . The application was lodged on CARDINAL DATE by PERSON NORP GPE , a director of the applicant company . The applicant was advised by PERSON A. ORG and Ms. PERSON , barristers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was contacted by a ORG pilot , NORP , who was approaching the retirement age of DATE and was seeking advice regarding his pension fund . NORP had already been advised by a financial services company linked to the ORG association against leaving his employer \u2019s occupational pension scheme , since this would entail \u201c enormous risk \u201d . There were several exchanges of correspondence between NORP and PERSON in DATE as well as a long meeting at the company \u2019s LOC . NORP indicated he was prepared to accept a \u201c medium \u201d degree of investment risk , and signed a checklist prepared by PERSON to indicate that he and his wife had been made fully aware of the risks associated with the income drawdown scheme being proposed . PERSON provided figures showing that by transferring his pension funds , NORP could obtain an appreciably higher DATE income . Also , the benefits payable in the event of NORP \u2019s death before DATE would be much greater . For its assumed growth projections , ORG used a central projection rate of PERCENT , rather than PERCENT indicated by the regulator DATE . NORP acted on ORG \u2019s advice and transferred his pension fund .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , NORP had become dissatisfied with his investments and , taking new advice , transferred his funds elsewhere . In DATE he made a formal complaint to ORG that he had lost PERCENT ( \u00a3 MONEY ) of the amount originally transferred . He complained as well that the PERCENT assumed rate of growth had been presented to him as a \u201c worst - case scenario \u201d , and that ORG had taken no action in response to the concerns he had expressed at the time about stock market movements . PERSON rejected the complaint , leading NORP to file a complaint with ORG ) in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The procedure followed by the ORG was an entirely written one , with submissions from NORP and from PERSON . The latter \u2019s requests for an oral hearing and for the opportunity to cross - examine NORP were refused . The ORG considered this to be unnecessary in the circumstances , and observed that the complaints process was an inquisitorial one , not an adversarial one .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Ombudsman gave a provisional decision on DATE . He considered that in view of the relative security provided by NORP \u2019s occupational pension scheme , PERSON should have demonstrated that transfer would be clearly advantageous . He observed that responsibility for advice rested completely with the adviser and was not diminished by recommendations or warnings given by other firms . The causal link was established here since PERSON had recommended transfer and NORP had done so . Although the firm argued that there had been a respectable school of thought among financial advisers that would have agreed with their advice to NORP , the witness statement they relied on indicated the contrary . The ORG considered that to be consistent with good industry practice , the firm should have assumed a growth rate of PERCENT . There was , however , no evidence in the file that the consequences of a lower growth rate had been explained to NORP Instead , PERSON had made repeated references to higher growth rates achieved in DATE . He also took the view that PERSON had not explained the investment risk in terms that NORP would have understood properly . He concluded that the overall risks associated with the income drawdown arrangement were greater than was advisable for NORP in his circumstances , and that had this been given sufficient prominence in the firm \u2019s advice NORP would not have transferred his pension funds . The most suitable advice would have been to remain in his employer \u2019s pension scheme .", "CARDINAL . HME made detailed submissions on these findings . Its arguments were considered and dismissed in the ORG \u2019s final decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The firm argued first that it had received legal advice that NORP \u2019s", "CARDINAL . HME maintained there was no causal link between its advice and NORP \u2019s decision to transfer his pension fund . The ORG reiterated the position taken in the provisional decision .", "CARDINAL . Regarding R. \u2019s attitude to risk , the ORG held that NORP \u2019s pension fund , which constituted a very significant part of his overall wealth , should not have been placed at risk , there being no need to do so in the particular circumstances . The fact that NORP had signed the checklist did not make the transfer more suitable , nor did it negate PERSON \u2019s duty to explain very clearly the risks involved .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Ombudsman reiterated that PERSON had not acted consistently with good industry practice when it used the rate of PERCENT for its projections . While this did not necessarily make the firm \u2019s advice more or less suitable , it incorrectly made the option of transferring look more attractive than it would otherwise have been . Although NORP was concerned to make adequate provision for his son in the eventuality of the untimely death of himself and his wife , the ORG was not satisfied that this should have been given greater weight than the security of their retirement income . Other arrangements could have been made to ensure their son \u2019s welfare , such as life insurance . In light of these considerations , he concluded that the appropriate advice should have been not to transfer his pension fund . He directed PERSON to arrange for a loss assessment to be carried out . NORP accepted the decision , making it binding on PERSON . In DATE the firm paid out the statutory maximum amount ( \u00a3 MONEY ) to NORP", "CARDINAL . HME applied to ORG for judicial review of the ORG \u2019s decision . The application was rejected on the papers on DATE . The firm renewed its application , which was heard and dismissed by Judge PERSON on DATE . CARDINAL grounds were relied on \u2013 the ORG \u2019s refusal to hold a hearing , and a lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the ORG . On the first ground , the judge noted that comprehensive written evidence of the parties\u2019 dealings had been available to the ORG . It would have been pointless to cross - examine NORP on what action he would have taken had PERSON advised against transfer , it being probable that he would not have left his employer \u2019s scheme . The procedure followed by the ORG had been a fair one , allowing ORG to put its case fully in writing . A hearing would not have added anything . Although the firm alleged that the ORG \u2019s decision contained errors , judicial review was essentially concerned with procedural fairness . Moreover , it did not appear that any facts had been plainly ignored .", "CARDINAL . On the second ground , the judge rejected PERSON \u2019s arguments about the supervisory role of ORG ( ORG ) in relation to the ORG , and its reference to evidence in another case in which the ORG was found by an independent assessor to have effectively solicited complaints against companies . The judge was satisfied that the ORG scheme involved an independent and impartial tribunal .", "CARDINAL . HME applied for leave to appeal . This was refused on the papers by PERSON , following which the firm renewed its application , which was dealt with orally and dismissed by PERSON on DATE . He noted that Judge PERSON had found both grounds to be without merit and agreed with that view . On the issue of an oral hearing , he stated that whether the facts were or were not as alleged by the firm was beside the point . Rather the issue was whether the refusal of a hearing before the ORG was procedurally unfair or unreasonable . He did not consider it so , or that the will of ORG had been subverted in this respect . Regarding the second ground , he found it to be without substance .", "CARDINAL .
