On DATE ORG ( Family and Juvenile Section ) instituted inquiry ( post\u0119powanie wyja\u015bniaj\u0105ce ) with a view to determining whether the applicant had committed the offences at issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC decided to place the applicant in a shelter for juveniles ( schronisko dla nieletnich ) for a period of DATE . It found that , in view of the available evidence , there existed a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed CARDINAL armed robberies and CARDINAL attempted armed robbery and some other offences . The court also noted that the applicant was lacking in moral character and that the nature of the offences with which he had been charged militated in favour of placing him in a correctional facility ( zak\u0142ad poprawczy ) . It also noted that there was a risk that he might go into hiding or put pressure on witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He argued , inter alia , that there had been no risk of fleeing or interfering with witnesses .

On DATE ORG upheld the decision of the lower court .

He argued that in accordance with LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Juvenile Act the decision on prolongation of the placement in a shelter for juveniles could be taken only by a court after summonses had been sent to the parties and counsel . The applicant \u2019s counsel obtained information from the court \u2019s registry that in practice such decisions were not given , and that it sufficed for the court to issue an order for the case to be examined in correctional proceedings .
