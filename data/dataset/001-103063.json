THE UNITED KINGDOM (NO. 2)", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . He is currently detained at FAC . He was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE with FAC .", "On DATE at ORG the applicant was convicted of the murder of PERSON and sentenced to life imprisonment . Mr PERSON had been the applicant \u2019s business partner . He was shot and killed at their business LOC on DATE by PERSON , who left the scene of the crime in a car driven by PERSON . The applicant was charged with murder jointly with GPE , Gray and CARDINAL other men who had allegedly provided money to pay for the killing of PERSON . The ORG \u2019s case was that the applicant had paid Runham and Gray MONEY ( ORG ) to kill PERSON . NORP The applicant \u2019s defence was that he had only hired LOC and Gray to break one of PERSON \u2019s limbs . NORP and Gray pleaded guilty to murder . Gray gave evidence for the prosecution against the applicant concerning the alleged murder conspiracy .", "In DATE , following a review of the prosecution \u2019s duty of disclosure , CARDINAL \u201c actions \u201d in the criminal investigation , which were contained in the police \u2019s \u201c PERSON \u201d computer system , were disclosed to the applicant . Full disclosure of material gathered in the course of a separate fraud inquiry was also made . Prior to an appeal by the applicant to ORG , he was served with a schedule of what material was still being withheld from him ; this included a document numbered CARDINAL , a letter from ORG \u2019s solicitors to a GPE police officer , which discussed a prison transfer and the possibility of the police supporting his early release from prison . Document no . CARDINAL subsequently came into the applicant \u2019s possession , though , in proceedings before ORG ( see section CARDINAL below ) , there was a dispute between the parties as to whether the applicant had received it before the appeal hearing .", "Following the dismissal of the applicant \u2019s appeal , an application was introduced with this ORG and , in its judgment of DATE , the ORG found that there had been a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial . ORG was not persuaded that the Government had shown that document no . CARDINAL , relevant to the applicant \u2019s defence , was made available to his counsel in time for use at the appeal . It went on to state that this finding was not , however , essential to its reasoning as , in any event , it was not in dispute that other documents were not disclosed at this time , on the basis , inter alia , of the prosecution \u2019s assessment that public interest immunity was applicable to them . Moreover , a request to ORG that it review the undisclosed material was not to be regarded as an adequate safeguard as ORG would neither have been assisted by defence counsel \u2019s arguments as to its relevance nor have been able to draw on any first - hand knowledge of the evidence given at trial .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG to have his case referred back to ORG but asked the Commission to defer its report until this ORG had given judgment . On DATE the Commission informed the applicant of its final decision not to refer his case to ORG .", "In its examination of the case , the ORG exercised its powers under LAW of LAW DATE ( see relevant domestic law and practice below ) to obtain and examine the undisclosed material , including document no . CARDINAL . It concluded that , aside from document no . CARDINAL , nothing seen by the Commission was thought to be either prima facie disclosable or to impact upon the safety of the applicant \u2019s conviction . In the absence of any further undisclosed information that could have undermined the prosecution case or assisted the applicant \u2019s defence , the Commission confined its consideration to whether or not the non - disclosure of document no . CARDINAL , along with this ORG \u2019s assessment of that nondisclosure , gave rise to a real possibility that ORG would quash the conviction . In the ORG \u2019s view , it did not . Despite the expiry of the tariff period of his life sentence , Gray remained in custody at the time of the ORG \u2019s report ; there was nothing in ORG files that would have undermined his evidence at trial and the Commission had not uncovered any material that could have been used by the applicant \u2019s defence team to more effectively cross - examine him . There was nothing remarkable in the fact that Gray had been given a degree of protection by the authorities before trial and document no . CARDINAL would not have led to any line of cross - examination that was not already open to the applicant . At paragraphs CARDINAL.CARDINAL and CARDINAL of its report the ORG gave its final conclusion as follows :", "\u201c The ECtHR has itself pronounced that the material non - disclosure was a breach of Mr LOC \u2019s rights , a factor that has been weighed heavily by ORG The Commission can only conclude that LAW was a letter showing that PERSON was being held in isolation from his co - defendants , that the police were facilitating visits for his wife and that he was hopeful for relatively favourable treatment ( compared , at least , to his co - defendants ) in terms of his life sentence . In the view of the Commission , this new information , taken in any combination with any other frailties in the prosecution case , is not sufficient to lead the Commission to believe that there is a real possibility that any properly directed jury might reasonably have reached a different decision in Mr LOC \u2019s case . \u201d", "The applicant sought judicial review of the ORG \u2019s decision . On DATE , this was refused by ORG . Mr ORG observed :", "\u201c [ The ORG was plainly entitled to reach the view that it did and so to refuse to refer . For those reasons I would dismiss this application for judicial review ; but , before doing so , it is useful by way of a check to analyse what might happen if , contrary to the view that I have expressed , the Commission were to refer this case to ORG .", "As the GPE court demonstrated in this case and as it has done in other circumstances and in other cases , for example PERSON v GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL , procedures in an appellate court can cure a defect in a trial at first instance . Thus , for example , as in PERSON , the ability to cross - examine a witness not available at first instance but available on appeal may cure that defect . In this case , as the GPE court held , the opportunity for ORG to review , in the light of submissions made by the defence , documents that have been disclosed to the defence cured the defect in disclosure in the court below . It must therefore follow that , on a reference , document NORP , available to the defence and to the court , would be open to be considered by the court in circumstances in which its consideration would cure the failure to disclose in the court below . Likewise , in relation to the documents only listed but still not disclosed , CARDINAL possibilities exist for the defect in the court below to be cured . The ORG might decide that , after the lapse of DATE , it was no longer necessary to maintain public interest immunity in respect of the documents . Alternatively a special advocate might be appointed to examine them on behalf of the claimant .", "In either event , the defect below would potentially at least be curable . Accordingly , the effect of a reference by the ORG in this case , if its judgment is right , would be that an otherwise perfectly safe conviction would not only be upheld but also would be upheld in circumstances in which the claimant \u2019s LAW rights would ultimately be fully vindicated by the appeal process . To embark on that course , if the judgment of the Commission is right , would be an academic exercise only . In my view there would be no purpose of justice to be served by requiring the Commission and ORG to undertake it . \u201d", "Lord Justice Laws added :", "\u201c A conviction would not be upheld if and only if ORG were to consider it unsafe . Unless the finding by ORG a violation of Article CARDINAL necessarily entails the conclusion that the verdict is unsafe , the impact of that finding was for the ORG to evaluate in the course of their consideration of the section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) question [ see relevant domestic law below ] . It seems to me that their treatment of it is beyond the reach of sensible challenge in court .", "I agree with my Lord [ Mr Justice GPE ] that not every criminal case where there has been a finding of violation of LAW yields the conclusion that the verdict is unsafe and I adopt with gratitude his summary of the relevant learning . While any breach of LAW is plainly a cause of concern , and instances of such breaches in cases where the conviction is nevertheless safe may be few and far between , in this area one would not expect to see a rigid rule with no exceptions but a case by case approach with much emphasis laid on the gravity and effect of a particular violation . \u201d", "At its CARDINALth meeting from DATE ORG , having taken note of the proceedings before ORG and ORG judgment , decided to close its examination of the case .", "ORG is regulated by LAW DATE . Where a person has been convicted on indictment , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) gives the Commission the power to refer at any time the conviction to ORG . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , any such reference is to be treated for all purposes as an appeal by the person concerned against conviction . LAW sets the conditions for making references . It provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A reference of a conviction , verdict , finding or sentence shall not be made under any of sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL unless \u2014", "( a ) the Commission consider that there is a real possibility that the conviction , verdict , finding or sentence would not be upheld were the reference to be made ,", "( b ) the ORG so consider\u2014", "( i ) in the case of a conviction , verdict or finding , because of an argument , or evidence , not raised in the proceedings which led to it or on any appeal or application for leave to appeal against it , or", "( ii ) in the case of a sentence , because of an argument on a point of law , or information , not so raised , and", "( c ) an appeal against the conviction , verdict , finding or sentence has been determined or leave to appeal against it has been refused .", "( CARDINAL ) Nothing in subsection ( CARDINAL)(b)(i ) or ( c ) shall prevent the making of a reference if it appears to the Commission that there are exceptional circumstances which justify making it . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) This section applies where the Commission believe that a person serving in a public body has possession or control of a document or other material which may assist the ORG in the exercise of any of their functions .", "( CARDINAL ) Where it is reasonable to do so , the ORG may require the person who is the appropriate person in relation to the public body\u2014", "( a ) to produce the document or other material to the ORG or to give the ORG access to it , and", "( b ) to allow the ORG to take away the document or other material or to make and take away a copy of it in such form as they think appropriate ,", "and may direct that person that the document or other material must not be destroyed , damaged or altered before the direction is withdrawn by ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The documents and other material covered by this section include , in particular , any document or other material obtained or created during any investigation or proceedings relating to\u2014", "( a ) the case in relation to which the ORG \u2019s function is being or may be exercised , or", "( b ) any other case which may be in any way connected with that case ( whether or not any function of the Commission could be exercised in relation to that other case ) .", "( CARDINAL ) The duty to comply with a requirement under this section is not affected by any obligation of secrecy or other limitation on disclosure ( including any such obligation or limitation imposed by or by virtue of an enactment ) which would otherwise prevent the production of the document or other material to the ORG or the giving of access to it to the ORG . \u201d", "On DATE , at the CARDINALth meeting of ORG , ORG Recommendation No .
