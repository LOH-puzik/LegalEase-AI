FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is a maritime broker .", "He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "A.", "In DATE , the applicant started a relationship with T. They began living together in DATE and became engaged to be married on DATE . In DATE it was confirmed that T was pregnant . According to the applicant , he and T had deliberately decided to found a family . In DATE their engagement and cohabitation ended .", "On DATE , T married a person called NORP In DATE , T gave birth to a daughter called J.", "The applicant claims to be the biological father of J. On DATE , on his own initiative , he recognised J as his child before ORG ( lastenvalvoja , barnatillsyningsman ) of GPE .", "By virtue of section CARDINAL of the Paternity Act ( isyyslaki , lagen om faderskap ) , the matter of the approval of his recognition came before the ORG Judge ( kihlakunnantuomari , h\u00e4radsh\u00f6vding ) of GPE . In his decision of DATE , the Judge noted that J was born in wedlock whereby followed a legal presumption of the husband \u2019s paternity . In the written proceedings T denied the applicant \u2019s paternity and maintained that she had already had a relationship with her husband around the time of J \u2019s conception . On the basis of these circumstances , the Judge found that the applicant was not J \u2019s father . According to section CARDINAL of LAW , no appeal lay from the Judge \u2019s decision .", "The Judge \u2019s decision was written on a form designed for decisions concerning the recognition of paternity . On the back of the form was attached information for the man about , inter alia , the legal consequences of the recognition .", "T refused the applicant \u2019s offer to pay for a voluntary DNA test . The applicant \u2019s attempts to see J have been fruitless , apparently due to T \u2019s opposition thereto .", "On DATE , the applicant took legal action seeking a determination of whether he was the biological father of J or not . In doing so , he referred to LAW .", "The mother T and the child J were summoned to ORG ( kihlakunnanoikeus , h\u00e4radsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON . During the first hearing on DATE , they objected to the trial , stating that the applicant had no right of action . Furthermore , they based their objection on the failure to summon ORG \u2019s other guardian R to the court . Subsequently , R was also summoned .", "On DATE , ORG held a second hearing in which it considered the matter of the applicant \u2019s right of action . Both parties submitted to ORG an expert opinion , respectively , concerning the issue of the applicant \u2019s legal standing . The parties disagreed over whether it was at all possible to start legal proceedings concerning only the determination of whether a person was a natural father or not , or whether the action should include a request for the establishment or annulment of paternity .", "On DATE , ORG decided that the claim was not , as such , formulated in a manner that would be contrary to LAW . It found that LAW gave the courts an opportunity merely to declare whether a man and a child were , in reality , close relatives without , at the same time , establishing a legal father - child relation between them . However , ORG also found that , according to LAW , a man claiming to be a father did not have the right of action as regards paternity proceedings relating to a child born in wedlock . ORG considered Articles CARDINAL of LAW No . DATE to the LAW as well as LAW DATE . It concluded that the applicant had no right of action regarding the determination of whether he was PERSON father or not . ORG then dismissed the applicant \u2019s action without examining it on the merits .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . He emphasised that the child \u2019s fundamental right to know her origins could not be denied on the grounds that the other biological parent had opposed it . From the applicant \u2019s point of view , the focus of his action was whether a woman , who had become pregnant while living in a relationship similar to marriage , had the right to prevent the examination of the paternity and judicially to kidnap the child on the formal ground that she had married somebody else . The applicant stated that he had only requested that the fact that he was the father of J be confirmed , without asking to establish a legal father - child relation . The applicant had a very strong need for the protection of law in the case . He argued that it was in the best interest of the child that the matter be solved before she herself reached DATE , thereby obtaining the right of action of her own . He requested that ORG judgment be quashed and the case be referred back to ORG .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It reached the same conclusion as ORG but its reasoning differed from that of the latter . ORG noted that the applicant had only requested that it be determined whether or not he had fathered the child born when T was married to PERSON paternity , as a fact separate from the kinship , did not in itself create any rights or obligations for the man or the child . Furthermore , the establishment of such a fact without the consent of the child \u2019s parents would disturb relations in the child \u2019s family . The best interests of the child did not require that biological paternity should be determined separately from the kinship . ORG found that the action was not based on LAW . Furthermore , since the action in reality included a request for the annulment of the presumption of the husband \u2019s paternity , it was contrary to the aim of LAW . ORG found that the applicant had no legal interest to have determined the biological paternity of J on any other grounds either . Lastly , ORG found that the international conventions referred to in ORG judgment did not include provisions pursuant to which the applicant would have had the right to the examination in issue .", "The applicant requested leave to appeal . He referred , inter alia , to LAW .", "On DATE , ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "B.
