{"ITEMID": "001-23319", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "AFONSO and ANTONIO v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and her daughter PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in FAC . They are represented before the ORG by Mr J.J. Eizenga , a lawyer practising in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the first applicant married Mr GPE in a traditional ceremony in GPE . They had CARDINAL children , PERSON ( born in DATE ) , PERSON ( born in DATE ) and the second applicant .", "In DATE , Mr GPE fled from GPE to the GPE , where he applied for asylum . He was eventually granted a residence permit on grounds of a policy of tolerance ( gedoogdenbeleid ) , i.e. where expulsion would entail undue hardship given the general situation in the country of origin . The first applicant and the CARDINAL children continued to live in GPE ( GPE ) .", "On DATE , the CARDINAL applicants travelled from GPE to GPE for which country they had obtained an entry visa . On DATE , they travelled from GPE to the GPE , where on DATE they applied for asylum . The CARDINAL other children , PERSON and PERSON , remained in GPE in the care of a friend . When interviewed on DATE by a GPE immigration official on the reasons for her asylum request , the first applicant stated that she had applied for asylum in the GPE because her husband was living there , of which fact she had become aware in DATE .", "On DATE , ORG requested that GPE accept responsibility for the applicants\u2019 asylum request pursuant to LAW . On DATE , the NORP authorities accepted that responsibility . The GPE Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) subsequently declared inadmissible the applicants\u2019 asylum request . The ORG appeal was rejected in a final decision taken by ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) on DATE .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the first applicant applied for a residence permit to stay with her husband . She also made this application on behalf of the second applicant . Holding that the first applicant had not established the existence of a legally valid marriage with Mr GPE by way of authenticated official documents , and that Mr GPE did not comply with the minimum income requirement under the applicable immigration rules ( i.e. the equivalent of MONEY per month ) , the Deputy Minister of ORG rejected this request on DATE and issued an order for the applicants\u2019 expulsion .", "On DATE , the first applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision with the Deputy Minister and , on DATE , requested the President of ORG to issue an interim measure to the effect that she would not be expelled pending the proceedings on her objection .", "On DATE , Mr GPE was granted GPE nationality .", "On DATE , considering that the Deputy Minister had considerably exceeded the statutory time - limit for determining the applicant \u2019s objection , and thus apparently attached no great importance to an expulsion at short notice , the President of ORG granted the interim measure requested by the first applicant .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG withdrew the policy decision in force since DATE to stay expulsions to GPE given the general situation there . The decision to withdraw this moratorium was based on the official reports ( ambtsberichten ) of DATE and CARDINAL DATE of ORG , according to which the general situation in GPE had improved .", "According to a further official report of DATE of ORG , the security situation in GPE had considerably improved since DATE when the warring NORP Government forces and the ORG rebel forces signed an official ceasefire agreement in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding in order to pave the way for further negotiations on a political level . The report stated that both the Government and ORG forces respected the ceasefire agreement . However , some incidents of armed plundering , mostly caused by hungry former ORG fighters , had still occurred , which incidents could not always be effectively countered by the NORP police forces . Certain former unsafe areas could therefore not yet be classified as secure . Areas now classified as safe were the capital GPE , the coastal areas of the provinces ORG , PERSON , PERSON and ORG , and all the provincial capitals .", "On DATE , the applicant was heard on her objection before an official committee ( ambtelijke commissie ) . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection and ordered her expulsion from the GPE . On DATE , the first applicant filed an appeal ( beroep ) against this decision with ORG and , on DATE , requested the President of ORG to issue an interim measure allowing her to remain in the GPE pending the proceedings on her appeal .", "In its decision of DATE , following a hearing held on DATE , ORG sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal ( beroep ) against the decision of DATE .", "It noted at the outset that the first applicant had failed to substantiate her marriage with Mr GPE with authenticated documents . It further noted that , pursuant to the applicable statutory immigration rules and the pertaining immigration policy guidelines , it was a material condition for the admission of foreign spouses that the existence of a marriage be shown by official and authenticated documents .", "As the first applicant had failed to submit such documents and had failed to undertake any attempts to contact her parents , other relatives or the ( local ) authorities in GPE in order to obtain official and authenticated documents proving her marriage with Mr GPE , ORG concluded that the Deputy Minister had correctly rejected the first applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit on the grounds of her purported marriage . This finding was not altered by the recording of her marital status , on the basis of an affidavit given by the first applicant , in the municipal personal records database ( gemeentelijke basisadministratie ) of the town where she lived in the GPE , as the statutory provisions on such municipal databases could not be regarded as a specific regulation aimed at implementing statutory immigration rules .", "Insofar as the first applicant complained that the refusal to grant her a residence permit was contrary to her rights under LAW , ORG held :", "\u201c It is not disputed that in casu there is family life within the meaning of LAW between [ the first applicant ] , her ( purported ) spouse PERSON and their daughter , PERSON .", "The [ Deputy Minister ] has correctly considered that there has been no interference as to the right to respect for family life as meant by LAW as the refusal to allow residence [ in the GPE ] did not entail depriving [ the first applicant ] of a residence title enabling her to enjoy family life .", "The question thus arises whether there are facts and circumstances of such a nature that the right to respect for family life would give rise to a positive obligation for the [ Deputy Minister ] nevertheless to grant [ the first applicant ] residence [ in the GPE ] . In order to answer that question , the interests of the [ Deputy Minister ] must be balanced against the interests of [ the first applicant ] . It is of primary importance to attain a \u201c fair balance \u201d between those interests , in which the [ Deputy Minister ] enjoys a certain margin of appreciation . An important aspect of this balancing of interests is the question whether it is possible to exercise family life in the country of origin .", "ORG is of the opinion that the [ Deputy Minister ] could find in all reasonableness that the [ first applicant \u2019s ] interests did not outweigh the general interest . In this finding it is important that neither for [ the first applicant ] nor for the other members of her family are there any objective obstacles to the exercise of family life outside the GPE or in GPE , the [ first applicant \u2019s ] country of origin . In this connection it is equally relevant that the ( purported ) spouse of [ the first applicant ] , who has not been admitted to the GPE as a refugee , also originates from that country . Noting the official reports ( ambtsberichten ) of the Minister of ORG of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the situation in GPE also does not form an obstacle .", "As to the [ first applicant \u2019s ] argument , based on the judgment of ORG August CARDINAL ... ( LOC v. GPE ) ... , that in her case it should also be examined whether in all reasonableness it can be expected from her husband , in view of his GPE nationality , that he returns to GPE or goes [ with her ] to GPE , ORG considers that it can in all reasonableness be expected of the ( purported ) spouse that he returns to GPE or goes [ with the first applicant ] to GPE to exercise family life there in view of the fact that he ( originally ) comes from GPE and that no objective obstacle has become apparent . Also the health problems advanced by [ the first applicant ] do not necessarily constitute an obstacle to the exercise of family life outside the GPE or in the country of origin as the family \u2019s separation was [ partly ] the cause of the [ first applicant \u2019s ] health problems . Furthermore , CARDINAL children of the family still reside in GPE . Also on that ground , ORG fails to see why family life could not be exercised there .", "In view of the above considerations , ORG is of the opinion that the [ Deputy Minister } could in all reasonableness conclude that there was no positive obligation to grant [ the first applicant ] residence in the GPE on the grounds of LAW . \u201d", "On DATE , the provisional measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG sitting in \u2018 PERSON rejected the first applicant \u2019s request for an interim measure as her appeal against the decision of DATE had been rejected by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
