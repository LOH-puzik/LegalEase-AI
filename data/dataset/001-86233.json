The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The facts of the case as submitted by the parties are as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant and his wife became joint tenants of a CARDINAL - bedroom family house owned by ORG ( \u201c the local authority \u201d ) . They were also secure tenants under the provisions of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The marriage broke down DATE and the applicant \u2019s wife moved out of the house with the CARDINAL children . On DATE , following a contested hearing at which the applicant was not represented , the court made a DATE non - molestation order and an ouster order requiring the applicant to leave the house , which he did . PERSON and the children moved back into the house , but moved out again when on DATE the applicant turned up at the house , used a crowbar to force entry and allegedly assaulted PERSON and her friend . Criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant following this incident , but resulted in an acquittal when no evidence was put forward .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON submitted to the local authority an application to be rehoused on grounds of domestic violence . On DATE she returned the keys to the local authority with a note saying that she was giving up the tenancy . She and the children moved into another council house which had been allocated to them in accordance with the local authority \u2019s domestic violence policy . The local authority visited the house and found that most of the fixtures had been removed so that in excess of MONEY would be required to make it habitable . Thereafter , as far as the local authority was concerned , the property was uninhabited .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant returned to the house and did a considerable amount of work to renovate it . His relationship with PERSON improved and she supported his application for an exchange of accommodation with another local - authority tenant , as the CARDINAL - bedroom house was too big for him but he still required a home in the area so that his children could visit .", "CARDINAL . That application , dated DATE , was completed at the local - authority housing office . On DATE , a housing officer , having realised that the property was not in fact empty , and having taken legal advice , visited PERSON and asked her to close the tenancy by signing a notice to quit . ORG judge who heard the local authority \u2019s claim for possession found as a fact that PERSON was not advised and had no understanding that the notice to quit would have the effect of extinguishing the applicant \u2019s right to live in the house or exchange it for another localauthority property ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . CARDINAL DATE PERSON wrote to the local authority seeking to withdraw the notice to quit , but it nonetheless remained effective .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was informed that the tenancy had come to an end , and he was given notice to vacate . On DATE the local authority \u2019s ORG decided , inter alia , that in accordance with the domestic violence policy , the applicant would not be granted the right to accede to the former tenancy of the house and that , in any event , the applicant , who had no dependants living with him , would not qualify for a dwelling originally allocated to a qualifying family which had been rehoused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local authority brought possession proceedings against the applicant in ORG , which he defended on the basis that it was contrary to his right to respect for his home under LAW to be evicted on the basis of the notice to quit .", "CARDINAL . In his judgment of DATE , ORG judge held that under the common law and LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , the applicant had no defence to the authority \u2019s claim for possession . Under LAW , however , he cited previous case - law which held that in such cases , generally , the interest of the local authority as landlord and of other persons in need of social housing had been taken into account by the applicable common law and legislation , and that , provided that the local authority had acted lawfully , it was not open to a court to put aside a claim for possession , except in exceptional circumstances where it appeared that the former tenant \u2019s LAW had not been properly considered . He noted the circumstances in which PERSON had signed the notice to quit and observed that , if she had not been induced to sign it , the local authority would have had to apply for a possession order under LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It would then have been open to the applicant to seek to persuade the court that it would not be reasonable to grant the order ; he and PERSON could have given evidence regarding the alleged domestic violence ; and he could in addition have raised such issues as his own housing needs and the need to provide accommodation for the children when they visited . In the circumstances , the judge held that the local authority had not acted as required by LAW and he dismissed the claim for possession .", "CARDINAL . The authority \u2019s appeal to ORG was adjourned pending the outcome of proceedings before ORG in GPE of GPE v. PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . On DATE Lord Justice Mummery gave the judgment of ORG in the present case , holding as follows :", "\u201c ... DATE is not available as a defence to the possession proceedings , even though the premises in question were the \u2018 home\u2019 of the occupant for the purposes of the LAW . The ORG acted lawfully and within its powers in obtaining the notice to quit , which had the effect of terminating the secure tenancy . There was no dispute but that the tenancy had been brought to an end by [ the applicant \u2019s wife \u2019s ] notice to quit . Under ordinary domestic law the ORG had an unqualified right to immediate possession on proof that the tenancy of the LOC had been brought to an end . The statutory procedure in section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , which is available to a localauthority landlord for terminating a secure tenancy , does not apply to a case where the secure tenancy has been terminated by the tenant \u2019s notice to quit . That notice to quit was effective , even though the notice was signed without appreciating the consequences for the occupier of the LOC .", "This is not a \u2018 wholly exceptional\u2019 case where , for example , something has happened since the service of the notice to quit , which has fundamentally altered the rights and wrongs of the proposed eviction and the ORG might be required to justify its claim to override LAW CARDINAL right ( see PERSON at paragraph CARDINAL [ paragraph CARDINAL below ] ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for judicial review of the local authority \u2019s decision of DATE to procure a notice to quit from his wife , and of its decision of DATE to issue possession proceedings . The application was refused on DATE . The judge found , inter alia , that the local authority had acted within its powers in seeking , through the wife \u2019s notice to quit , to formalise the situation as regards the tenancy and that its decision to apply its domestic violence policy where domestic violence had been established by the existence of a non - molestation injunction and ouster clause was neither unlawful nor outside the range of decisions properly open to the local authority in all the circumstances . He concluded :", "\u201c I agree ... that ORG effectively decided the relevant issues between Mr PERSON and the ORG and that this application is an attempt to resurrect them a second time . The ORG is entitled to possession and this application for judicial review fails . ...", "As for the generality , whether or not a decision can be challenged as a matter of law does not mean that it is not appropriate for a public authority to be as open as it can be . There is no reason why the ORG \u2019s policy should not be absolutely explicit , spelling out that the consequence of an application for rehousing will be a requirement to give notice to quit of the existing tenancy which will affect the rights of the remaining tenant or occupier and thereafter providing notice to that person . In that way , clarity will prevail and some of the concerns that have been expressed in this case avoided . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Permission to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was evicted from the house on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In common law , where a valid notice to quit is given by CARDINAL joint tenant , it has the effect of bringing the joint tenancy to an end , whether or not the other joint tenant knew of or consented to the service of the notice to quit ( GPE and ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL ) . Once a tenancy has been validly brought to an end , a former tenant remaining in the property is in law a trespasser and the landlord has a right to immediate possession .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , a secure tenant of a local authority or other public authority , such as the applicant , has security of tenure . Under section PERSON ) of the LAW , a court shall not make an order for possession of a dwelling house let under a secure tenancy except on CARDINAL or more of the grounds set out in Schedule CARDINAL to the LAW . LAW ) of Schedule CARDINAL gives a ground of possession where a couple live in a dwelling - house , CARDINAL or both is a tenant , CARDINAL partner has left because of violence or threats of violence by the other , and the court is satisfied that that partner who has left is unlikely to return . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that the court shall not make an order for possession on CARDINAL of these grounds \u201c unless it considers it reasonable to make an order \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG", "( \u00a7 MONEY ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Where a relationship has broken down the tenant who is leaving the property must be asked to sign a relinquishing form . This has the effect of closing the \u2018 ORG tenancy .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the property remains suitable for the family left , [ a new ] tenancy can be granted .", "CARDINAL . NORP If the property is not suitable ( e.g. too large ) , the tenant should be offered alternative accommodation ... \u201d", "However , where there has been domestic violence , ORG provides ( \u00a7 CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Domestic violence is included in ORG revised ORG as a breach of the tenancy agreement . Action will be taken [ against those ] who have been found to have subjected another person to domestic violence . This could include perpetrators losing their home or being classed as intentionally homeless . \u201d", "It would be open to a person who has been made homeless following an allegation of domestic violence to challenge the truth of the allegation and claim that he has been made unintentionally homeless and that the local authority has a statutory duty to rehouse him .", "CARDINAL . GPE of GPE v. PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL similarly concerned the making of a possession order in respect of a council house held under a joint tenancy of a husband and wife . The marriage broke down and the joint tenancy came to an end when PERSON served a notice to quit . Mr PERSON was refused a sole tenancy by the local authority , but he nonetheless remained in occupation with his new family , and sought to resist possession proceedings on the ground that they constituted an interference with the right to respect for his home under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG were unanimous in holding that , despite the fact that the tenancy had come to an end , the property continued to be Mr PERSON \u2019s home and LAW was therefore engaged . However , the majority ( Lords Hope of PERSON , PERSON and ORG ) held that LAW could not be relied upon to defeat the local authority \u2019s proprietary or contractual rights to possession . Since the local authority had an unqualified right to immediate possession , there was no infringement of PERSON right to respect for his home under LAW and so no issue arose under LAW as to justification . Alternatively , the effect of the authority \u2019s proprietary or contractual rights was that any assessment under LAW would inevitably be determined in the local authority \u2019s favour . The majority variously referred to a number of decisions of the Commission in which similar complaints , regarding the eviction of a former joint tenant from localauthority property after the joint tenancy had come to an end , had been declared manifestly ill - founded ( see PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , Decisions and Reports ( GPE ) CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ; NORP v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , unreported ; and PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Commission decision of DATE , unreported ) .", "Lord Hope , having held that DATE was applicable , continued :", "\u201c ... [ I]n my opinion it does not follow that , on the facts of this case , there is an issue which must be decided within the domestic legal order by remitting the question whether any interference is permitted by LAW for decision by ORG . ...", "I do not say that the right to respect for the home is irrelevant . But I consider that such interference with it as flows from the application of the law which enables the public - authority landlord to exercise its unqualified right to recover possession , following service of a notice to quit which has terminated the tenancy , with a view to making the premises available for letting to others on its housing list , does not violate the essence of the right to respect for the home under LAW . That is a conclusion which can be applied now to all cases of this type generally . ... It follows that the question whether any interference is permitted by LAW does not require , in this case , to be considered by ORG . \u201d", "Lord PERSON similarly held that :", "\u201c ... In my opinion LAW is not ordinarily infringed by enforcing the terms on which the applicant occupies LOC as his home . LAW does not give a right to a home , but only to \u2018 respect\u2019 for the home . \u201d", "As regards the balancing exercise envisaged by LAW he stated :", "\u201c ... [ N]o such balancing exercise need be conducted when its outcome is a foregone conclusion . In the present case ... the local authority had an immediate right to possession . The premises were Mr PERSON \u2019s home , and evicting him would obviously amount to an interference with his enjoyment of the premises as his home . But his right to occupy them as such was circumscribed by the terms of his tenancy and had come to an end . Eviction was plainly necessary to protect the rights of the local authority as landowner . Its obligation to \u2018 respect\u2019 for Mr PERSON \u2019s home was not infringed by its requirement that he vacate the premises at the expiry of the period during which it had agreed that he might occupy them . There was simply no balance to be struck . ... \u201d", "Lord PERSON concurred with ORG and PERSON , although on somewhat different grounds :", "\u201c In my opinion , ORG , having correctly held that Mr PERSON had an LAW , should have held that his rights under LAW could not prevail against the ORG \u2019s admitted and undoubted right to possession under the ordinary housing law . I would , for my part , have said that LAW was not , in these circumstances , applicable . But it could also be said that a possession order was \u2018 in accordance with the law\u2019 and was necessary in order to protect and give effect to the ORG \u2019s right to possession . ... But it comes to the same thing . Article CARDINAL can not be raised to defeat contractual and proprietary rights to possession . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the question of remedies in exceptional cases , Lord Hope referred ( in paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment ) to ORG v. Smart [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL , where ORG had held , in a case where a non - secure council tenant was evicted following nuisance proceedings , that a challenge under LAW to the local authority \u2019s decision to serve notice to quit could be made by judicial review within the appropriate time - limits . Lord Hope continued by observing that ORG in Smart had further held :", "\u201c ... that in the rare situation where something wholly exceptional happened after service of the notice to quit which fundamentally altered the rights and wrongs of the proposed eviction the judge in ORG who was hearing the claim for possession might be obliged to address it in deciding whether the making of a possession order could be justified ... I wish to reserve my opinion as to whether it would be open to the tenant , in a wholly exceptional case , to raise these issues in ORG where proceedings for possession were being taken following the service of the notice to quit by the housing authority , bearing in mind as Lord PERSON points out that its decision to serve the notice to quit would be judicially reviewable in ORG so long as the application was made within the relevant time - limit . The situation in the present case is different , as it was a notice to quit served by CARDINAL of the joint tenants that terminated the tenancy . \u201d", "Lord PERSON also stated :", "\u201c In the exceptional case where the applicant believes that the local authority is acting unfairly or from improper or ulterior motives , he can apply to ORG for judicial review . The availability of this remedy , coupled with the fact that an occupier can not be evicted without a court order , so that the court can consider whether the claimant is entitled as of right to possession , is sufficient to supply the necessary and appropriate degree of respect for the applicant \u2019s home . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The dissenting minority ( Lords GPE of NORP and PERSON ) held that , where there was a proposed interference with a person \u2019s right to respect for his home , the question of justification , if raised , did fall to be considered and should , in the instant case , be remitted to ORG . Both cited with approval the following extract from the judgment of ORG in ORG v. Smart ( cited in paragraph CARDINAL above ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... \u2018 Home\u2019 is an autonomous concept for the purpose of ORG [ the Convention ] , and does not depend on any legal status as owner . Thus in these cases , the premises in GPE and GPE were without question the women \u2019s homes . Since the effect of the possession orders would be to throw them out , I think it inescapable that those orders amounted to an interference with the appellants\u2019 right of respect of their homes . I have said that the case is all about LAW ; more precisely , it is all about LAW .", "CARDINAL . Before proceeding to the issues arising under LAW , I should make it clear that I entertain what is perhaps a deeper reason for my view that the case can not be concluded by a judgment that there is no violation of LAW . It concerns the relationship between the CARDINAL paragraphs of DATE . I have held that eviction of these appellants would constitute a prima facie violation of their right to respect for their homes . But this conclusion is not simply an instance of that everyday judicial process , the application of a statute \u2019s correct construction ( here , LAW ) to a particular set of facts . Rather it has a purposive quality . The court has to arrive at a judicial choice between CARDINAL possibilities , a choice which transcends the business of finding out what the legislation \u2019s words mean . The first choice ... would entail a judgment that the Convention requirement was met at the LAW stage ... The second choice ( accepting a prima facie violation of LAW ) , which I prefer , entails a judgment that the more rigorous and specific standards set out in LAW have to be met if the court is to hold that the evictions are compatible with the appellants\u2019 Convention rights . The LAW is , as it were , much more remotely engaged in the fabric of our domestic law if the first , rather than the second , choice is taken . Part of the court \u2019s task is to decide how close that engagement should be in the context in hand . Thus I do not eschew the first choice merely because I take the view that the second more naturally reflects the ordinary sense of the words used in LAW . I consider as a matter of substance that the vindication and fulfilment of the Convention rights , for which purpose [ LAW DATE ] was enacted , require that the domestic law procedures involved in these appeals should be subjected to scrutiny for conformity with LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL standards . Such a process is demanded by the fullness of our municipal law of human rights . \u201d", "Lord PERSON nonetheless emphasised that the administration of public housing under various statutory schemes was properly entrusted to local housing authorities and that the occasions on which a court would be justified in declining a possession order would be highly exceptional . He concluded :", "\u201c If ( contrary to the ruling of the majority of the ORG ) effect were to be given to my opinion , I am confident that the housing authorities acting in good faith in implementation of schemes prescribed by statute and administered by them need apprehend no significant increase in their litigious burden . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. GPE of GPE ; ORG v. Price , DATE , [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , ORG constituted itself as a CARDINAL - judge committee ( rather than CARDINAL judges as usual ) in order to revisit its decision in PERSON in the light of the ORG \u2019s judgments in ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) and GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ; the latter judgment was subsequently referred to ORG which found , on DATE , that because domestic remedies had not been exhausted , it was unable to take cognisance of the merits of the case ) . The ORG were unanimous in limiting their consideration to cases were the landlord was a public authority .", "CARDINAL . The majority ( Lords Hope , ORG of ORG - under - Heywood and ORG of GPE ) held that the judgment in ORG was not incompatible with the view of the majority in PERSON that there was no need for a review of the issues raised by LAW to be conducted by ORG if the case was of a type where the law itself provided the answer , as in that situation a merits review would be a pointless exercise . In such a case , an LAW , if raised , should simply be struck out . However , in the light of the judgments in ORG it was necessary to emphasise that a person evicted might have a defence to possession proceedings in exceptional cases , namely ( a ) where he challenged the domestic law as itself being incompatible with LAW as in ORG ) ; or ( b ) where he challenged the action of the public - authority landlord on public law grounds , on the basis that the authority \u2019s actions constituted an abuse of power .", "CARDINAL . The minority ( Lords GPE , PERSON of GPE and ORG ) held that a defendant to possession proceedings brought by public authorities should be permitted in principle to raise an Article CARDINAL defence during the ORG possession proceedings . Lord PERSON expressed it as follows :", "\u201c I do not accept , as the appellants argued , that the public authority must from the outset plead and prove that the possession order sought is justified . That would , in the overwhelming majority of cases , be burdensome and futile . It is enough for the public authority to assert its claim in accordance with domestic property law . If the occupier wishes to raise an LAW to prevent or defer the making of a possession order it is for him to do so and the public authority must rebut the claim if , and to the extent that , it is called upon to do so . In the overwhelming majority of cases this will be in no way burdensome . In rare and exceptional cases it will not be futile . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
