GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . She lodged the application also in the name of her daughter PERSON ( second applicant ) , a NORP national born in DATE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "The second applicant , PERSON ( J. ) , is the daughter of the first applicant and PERSON She was born out of wedlock on DATE . Pursuant to the statutory provisions ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) the first applicant had sole custody of J. who has been living with her mother since her birth .", "At DATE , PERSON was diagnosed with a general development and autistic disorder and with retrogressive speaking capacities . She was not admitted to an ordinary nursery school .", "On DATE ORG lodged a motion with ORG ( no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to restrict the first applicant \u2019s custodial right to decide on her daughter \u2019s whereabouts and health care and to appoint ORG as special curator ( Erg\u00e4nzungspfleger ) to deal with these issues .", "On DATE the GPE ORG appointed PERSON , a lawyer , as J. \u2019s curator ad litem to represent her interests the custody proceedings .", "On DATE the ORG refused to change its decision to appoint a curator ad litem on the first applicant \u2019s motion , arguing that no appeal lay against such an interim decision . In any event , the appeal would also be ill - founded , as the first applicant failed to give convincing reasons against Ms L .- K. \u2019s appointment . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision .", "On DATE ORG , having heard the first applicant , her daughter \u2019s curator ad litem and a representative of ORG , restricted the first applicant \u2019s sole custody over her daughter pursuant to section DATE of LAW . It ruled that the first applicant was no longer entitled to choose which nursery school or school her daughter should attend and had no right to determine her daughter \u2019s whereabouts . It appointed ORG as special curator to decide on these issues . The court authorised ORG to enforce the child \u2019s surrender , if necessary with the help of the police , in order to secure the execution of the court \u2019s decision .", "Having regard to the report of a doctor working for the city of GPE dated DATE , earlier medical reports and its own attempt on DATE to hear PERSON ( with whom , however , a communication had proved impossible ) , ORG found that it was almost certain that J. suffered from a severe development disorder and showed clearly autistic behaviour . Therefore , PERSON was in need of care in a specialised institution . The first applicant was acutely endangering her daughter \u2019s mental welfare by refusing to accept her daughter \u2019s illness and to send the child to an institution responding to her needs . Instead , the first applicant insisted on sending her daughter to an ordinary ( nursery ) school or to a school merely treating speaking irregularities . Her custody of J. therefore had to be restricted in respect of these issues .", "ORG observed that it was in PERSON \u2019s best interests to attend an institution individually educating children with autistic behaviour while living with her mother . However , should the first applicant continuously refuse to send her daughter to a suitable institution it was necessary , as a last resort , to separate mother and daughter and to place J. in a home providing her with the necessary individual care .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s motions to rectify the protocol of the court \u2019s hearing . It found that the changes proposed by the first applicant concerned additional information she had not yet given in the hearing itself .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision dated DATE , as no appeal lay against this decision .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint against the decisions of DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "In DATE J. attended test lessons in an ordinary school together with her mother and grandmother . At the outset PERSON was crying and shouting loudly and refused to stay in the classroom . She only calmed down after she had been running up and down the corridor with her mother and both had been shouting for TIME . Back in the classroom , she refused to follow any of the teacher \u2019s instructions and did not react to any questions . She then wrote the alphabet on the blackboard and , when interrupted , had a rage attack and was jumping around in the classroom to calm down . She did not speak a single word during the lessons and did not establish contact with anyone . In further test lessons at DATE PERSON was only running around in the classroom , did not react to any instructions and frightened other children by running closely towards them uttering inarticulate sounds . In view of this , the school director and teachers informed the first applicant that it was impossible to educate J. and respond to her needs in an ordinary school .", "On DATE J. was taken away from her mother with the help of the police on the motion of ORG , acting as PERSON \u2019s special curator , as her mother had refused to allow her to attend a specialised school taking account of her educational needs . She was placed in an open youth home DATE the location of which was not disclosed to the first applicant DATE in which she subsequently attended a school furthering its pupils\u2019 learning progress individually .", "On DATE ORG , having heard the first applicant , the second applicant \u2019s curator ad litem and a representative of ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision dated DATE , which thereby became final .", "On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint with ORG ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) against the impugned decisions of ORG dated DATE and of ORG dated DATE .", "In CARDINAL letter dated DATE ORG invited the first applicant to contact ORG in order to set up a visiting arrangement . However , no contacts between mother and daughter could be built up .", "A subsequent action for damages brought by the first applicant with the GPE civil courts against ORG curator ad litem because of her conduct in the custody proceedings was to no avail . ORG refused to admit the first applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint concerning these decisions on DATE ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) against the decisions of DATE of DATE .", "On DATE the first applicant lodged a motion with ORG ( no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to be surrendered her daughter . She argued that the separation from her and her daughter \u2019s placement in a youth home constituted an illegal deprivation of liberty . Moreover , her daughter \u2019s right to be integrated in an ordinary school as protected by the LAW had been breached .", "In its report dated DATE ORG stated that PERSON had settled well in the institution for disabled children she lived in since DATE . While her father was visiting her regularly since DATE her mother had not reacted to several attempts made in letters addressed to her by ORG in DATE to re - establish contacts with her daughter and showed no real interest in being informed about her daughter \u2019s development . Sending J. back to live with her mother would not be in ORG \u2019s best interests .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing , in which it heard the first applicant , a representative of ORG and the child \u2019s father PERSON It did not hear J. in person , because , as confirmed by PERSON , a verbal communication with her was impossible , as had also been found by the court itself in its hearing on DATE in the custody proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s motion to surrender her daughter to her . It found that the first applicant did not have a right to be rendered her daughter pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code . The court noted that ORG decision dated DATE restricting the first applicant \u2019s custody of her daughter had become final . ORG , acting as ORG \u2019s special curator , had therefore been entitled to order her full - time placement in a home and to take the child away from her mother , as had been done on DATE . In particular , a child \u2019s right to attend an ordinary school was subject to his or her physical and mental ability to meet its demands . As had been found by the civil courts in previous decisions , J. could not meet these demands due to her illness and could not be expected to do so in the future .", "ORG further found that there was nothing to indicate that it was in PERSON \u2019s best interests to re - award custody in all respects to her mother . In particular , J. \u2019s placement in a youth home which furthered her adequately in view of her illness had clearly proved to be beneficial to her . As long as her mother was unable to accept that her daughter would be absolutely overstrained in and could not be integrated in an ordinary school , the child could not be taken care of in her mother \u2019s home .", "In an obiter dictum ORG noted that it could not understand why ORG refused the first applicant any contacts with her daughter whose whereabouts still had not been disclosed to her . It considered it indispensable for the child \u2019s welfare to organise visits of her mother as soon as possible .", "On DATE ORG ( no . CARDINAL UF CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , following the first applicant \u2019s appeal , heard the first applicant , PERSON \u2019s curator ad litem and a representative of ORG . The latter stated that she had now informed the first applicant about her daughter \u2019s whereabouts and offered to organise contacts either at the first or the second applicant \u2019s place of residence . The first applicant stated that she had not visited her daughter yet because she feared that ORG could again assert that she was endangering her daughter \u2019s welfare which , in her view , amounted to an allegation that she had abused or ill - treated her daughter .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal as ill - founded . It found that ORG had acted legally in taking away the child from her mother and placing the child in a youth welfare institution , as its decision could be based on ORG decision dated DATE .", "ORG observed that pursuant to the statements of a child psychiatrist dated DATE it was clear that J. showed severe signs of autism so that intensive care was necessary which her mother could not provide and which made it impossible for her to attend an ordinary school for the time being . As the first applicant was unable to understand her daughter \u2019s needs it was necessary to uphold the partial deprivation of her custody .", "On DATE the first applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against the decisions of ORG dated DATE and of ORG dated DATE . She argued in particular that the continuous restriction of her custody and the failure to surrender her daughter , who was kept in a care institution and had to attend a school for disabled children , violated her parental rights and her daughter \u2019s right to liberty and education as guaranteed by LAW .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the first applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit another constitutional complaint lodged by the applicants against , inter alia , the decisions of ORG dated DATE and of ORG dated DATE ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE E. , the father of the second applicant , brought a motion with ORG ( no . CARDINAL F CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to be granted access to his daughter .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s motion for bias against ORG judge MONEY On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision as ill - founded . In the court \u2019s view , the fact alone that judge ORG had already sat in earlier cases brought by the first applicant in FAC in accordance with the court \u2019s internal assignment of functions did not warrant the conclusion that he was biased . The applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against these decisions was to no avail ( decision no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "On DATE ORG , having heard the first applicant and the child \u2019s father PERSON and having consulted ORG , granted PERSON a right of access to his daughter for TIME once in DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision as inadmissible . It argued that the first applicant was not prejudiced by the decision as she had expressly claimed not to object to the access order , but merely complained against the court \u2019s reasoning referring to her daughter as being a \u201c sick child \u201d .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the first applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the latter decision ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed as inadmissible the applicants\u2019 motion for a judicial decision on the refusal of ORG to institute criminal proceedings for fraud against P. It observed that the applicants failed to set out in a comprehensible manner facts which could warrant the conclusion that PERSON , a representative of ORG , had committed fraud .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG dismissed as inadmissible the applicants\u2019 motion for a judicial decision on the refusal of ORG to institute criminal proceedings for having threatened another person with the commission of a crime against PERSON", "It found that the applicants\u2019 motion was in any event ill - founded as there were no sufficient grounds for suspicion that an offence had been committed by the impugned representatives of ORG and policemen when separating PERSON from her mother on DATE . A further identical motion lodged with ORG was to no avail .", "On DATE and on DATE ORG refused to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaints against ORG decisions ( nos . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Pursuant to section DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code , parental custody encompasses the right to legal representation of the child . It is uncontested that the scope of the right to legal representation is identical to the \u2013 possibly restricted \u2013 scope of a parent \u2019s right of custody .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the right to personal custody comprises the right to claim the surrender of the child from anyone illegally withholding the child from one or both parents .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that the family courts are entitled to take the necessary measures to avert dangers to the physical , mental or spiritual welfare of a child caused by an abusive exercise of parental custody , by neglecting the child or by unintentional failure of the parents if the parents are unwilling or unable to avert the dangers .
