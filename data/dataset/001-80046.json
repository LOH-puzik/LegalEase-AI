The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts , as found by Mr Justice PERSON ( \u201c Wall J \u201d ) , who heard the parties\u2019 oral evidence ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , are as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her partner , J. ( born in DATE ) , commenced treatment at ORG ( \u201c the clinic \u201d ) . The applicant had been referred for treatment at the clinic DATE , when she was married , but had not pursued it because of the breakdown of her marriage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and J. were informed , during an appointment at the clinic , that preliminary tests had revealed that the applicant had serious pre - cancerous tumours in both ovaries , and that her ovaries would have to be removed . They were told that because the tumours were growing slowly it would be possible first to extract some eggs for in vitro fertilisation ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , but that this would have to be done quickly .", "CARDINAL . The consultation of DATE lasted TIME in total . A nurse explained that the applicant and PERSON would each have to sign a form consenting to the ORG treatment and that , in accordance with the provisions of ORG \u201c the DATE LAW ) , it would be possible for either to withdraw his or her consent at any time before the embryos were implanted in the applicant \u2019s uterus ( see paragraph DATE below ) . The applicant asked the nurse whether it would be possible to freeze her unfertilised eggs , but was informed that this procedure , which had a much lower chance of success , was not performed at the clinic . At that point PERSON reassured the applicant that they were not going to split up , that she did not need to consider the freezing of her eggs , that she should not be negative and that he wanted to be the father of her child .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , the couple entered into the necessary consents , by signing the forms required by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Immediately beneath the title to the form appeared the following words :", "\u201c NB \u2013 do not sign this form unless you have received information about these matters and have been offered counselling . You may vary the terms of this consent at any time except in relation to sperm or embryos which have already been used . Please insert numbers or tick boxes as appropriate . \u201d", "J. ticked the boxes which recorded his consent to use his sperm to fertilise the applicant \u2019s eggs in vitro and the use of the embryos thus created for the treatment of himself and the applicant together . He further ticked the box headed \u201c Storage \u201d , opting for the storage of embryos developed in vitro from his sperm for the maximum period of DATE and also opted for sperm and embryos to continue in storage should he die or become mentally incapacitated within that period . The applicant signed a form which , while referring to eggs rather than sperm , essentially replicated that signed by PERSON , she ticked the boxes providing for the treatment of herself and for the treatment \u201c of myself with a named partner . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the couple attended the clinic and CARDINAL eggs were harvested and fertilised . CARDINAL embryos were created and consigned to storage . On DATE the applicant underwent an operation to remove her ovaries . She was told that she should wait DATE before attempting to implant any of the embryos in her uterus .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the relationship broke down . The future of the embryos was discussed between the parties . On DATE J. wrote to the clinic to notify it of the separation and to state that the embryos should be destroyed .", "CARDINAL . The clinic notified the applicant of ORG withdrawal of consent to further use of the embryos and informed her that it was now under a legal obligation to destroy them , pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Schedule DATE CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant commenced proceedings in ORG , seeking an injunction requiring ORG to restore his consent to the use and storage of the embryos and a declaration , inter alia , that he had not varied and could not vary his consent of DATE . Additionally she sought a declaration of incompatibility under LAW DATE to the effect that section CARDINAL of , and Schedule CARDINAL to , LAW breached her rights under LAW , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention . She also pleaded that the embryos were entitled to protection under ORG and DATE . Interim orders were made requiring the clinic to preserve the embryos until the end of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge , Wall J , heard the case over DATE and took evidence from , among others , the applicant and J. On DATE , in a CARDINAL-page judgment ( PERSON v. ORG and Others [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Fam ) ) , he dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims .", "CARDINAL . He concluded that under the terms of LAW , and as a matter of public policy , it had not been open to J. to give an unequivocal consent to the use of the embryos irrespective of any change of circumstance , and that , as a matter of fact , PERSON had only ever consented to his treatment \u201c together \u201d with the applicant , and not to her continuing treatment on her own in the event that their relationship ended . Wall J thus rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that PERSON was estopped from withdrawing his consent , finding that both the applicant and PERSON had embarked on the treatment on the basis that their relationship would continue . On DATE J. had been doing his best to reassure the applicant that he loved her and wanted to be the father of her children ; giving a truthful expression of his feelings at that moment , but not committing himself for all time . Wall J observed that in the field of personal relationships , endearments and reassurances of this kind were commonplace , but they did not \u2013 and could not \u2013 have any permanent , legal effect . In undergoing ORG with ORG , the applicant had taken the only realistic course of action open to her . Wall J continued :", "\u201c However , even if I am wrong about that , and even if an estoppel is capable of existing in the face of the LAW , I do not , for the reasons I have given , think it would be unconscionable to allow [ J. ] to withdraw his consent . It is a right which the LAW gives him within the clear scheme operated by ORG . It was the basis upon which he gave his consent on DATE . It is perfectly reasonable for him , in the changed circumstances which appertain , not to want to father a child by PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s Convention claims , Wall J held in summary that an embryo was not a person with rights protected under the ORG , and that the applicant \u2019s right to respect for family life was not engaged . He accepted that the relevant provisions of LAW interfered with the private life of both parties , but held that it was proportionate in its effect , the foundation for the legislation being a treatment regime based on the twin pillars of consent and the interests of the unborn child . He considered it entirely appropriate that the LAW required couples embarking on ORG treatment to be in agreement about the treatment , and permitted either party to withdraw from it at any time before the embryo was transferred into the woman .", "CARDINAL . Wall J emphasised that the provisions of Schedule QUANTITY ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) applied equally to all patients undergoing ORG treatment , irrespective of their sex , and concluded with an illustration of how the requirement for joint consent could similarly affect an infertile man .", "\u201c If a man has testicular cancer and his sperm , preserved prior to radical surgery which renders him permanently infertile , is used to create embryos with his partner ; and if the couple have separated before the embryos are transferred into the woman , nobody would suggest that she could not withdraw her consent to treatment and refuse to have the embryos transferred into her . The statutory provisions , like Convention rights , apply to men and women equally . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s appeal to ORG was dismissed in a judgment delivered on DATE ( PERSON v. Amicus ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) .", "The court held that the clear policy of LAW was to ensure the continuing consent of both parties from the commencement of treatment to the point of implantation of the embryo , and that \u201c the court should be extremely slow to recognise or to create a principle of waiver that would conflict with the parliamentary scheme \u201d . Like Wall J , ORG found that PERSON had only ever consented to undergoing \u201c treatment together \u201d with the applicant , and had never consented to the applicant using the jointly created embryos alone . Once the relationship had broken down , and PERSON had indicated that he did not wish the embryos to be preserved or used by the applicant , they were no longer being treated \u201c together \u201d . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that J. had concealed his ambivalence , thereby inducing her to go forward with him into couple treatment , holding this to be an unjustified challenge to the finding of the trial judge who had had the obvious advantage of appraising the oral evidence of the applicant , PERSON , and the other witnesses ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG was also informed by ORG counsel that ORG clear position in withdrawing his consent was CARDINAL of fundamental rather than purely financial objection .", "CARDINAL . While there was an interference with the private lives of the parties , ORG Justices PERSON and PERSON found it to be justified and proportionate , for the following reasons .", "\u201c The less drastic means contended for here is a rule of law making the withdrawal of [ J. \u2019s ] consent non - conclusive . This would enable [ the applicant ] to seek a continuance of treatment because of her inability to conceive by any other means . But unless it also gave weight to [ J. \u2019s ] firm wish not to be father of a child borne by [ the applicant ] , such a rule would diminish the respect owed to his private life in proportion as it enhanced the respect accorded to hers . Further , in order to give it weight the legislation would have to require the [ ORG ] or the clinic or both to make a judgment based on a mixture of ethics , social policy and human sympathy . It would also require a balance to be struck between CARDINAL entirely incommensurable things . ...", "... The need , as perceived by ORG , is for bilateral consent to implantation , not simply to the taking and storage of genetic material , and that need can not be met if CARDINAL of the consent is no longer effective . To dilute this requirement in the interests of proportionality , in order to meet [ the applicant \u2019s ] otherwise intractable biological handicap , by making the withdrawal of the man \u2019s consent relevant but inconclusive , would create new and even more intractable difficulties of arbitrariness and inconsistency . The sympathy and concern which anyone must feel for [ the applicant ] is not enough to render the legislative scheme ... disproportionate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lady ORG stated , by way of introduction :", "\u201c The DATE Act inevitably uses clinical language , such as gametes and embryos . But it is clear that LAW is concerned with the very emotional issue of infertility and the genetic material of CARDINAL individuals which , if implanted , can lead to the birth of a child . ... Infertility can cause the woman or man affected great personal distress . In the case of a woman , the ability to give birth to a child gives many women a supreme sense of fulfilment and purpose in life . It goes to their sense of identity and to their dignity . \u201d", "She continued :", "\u201c Like PERSON and PERSON , I consider that the imposition of an invariable and ongoing requirement for consent in LAW in the present type of situation satisfies LAW . ... As this is a sensitive area of ethical judgment , the balance to be struck between the parties must primarily be a matter for ORG has taken the view that no one should have the power to override the need for a genetic parent \u2019s consent . The wisdom of not having such a power is , in my judgment , illustrated by the facts of this case . The personal circumstances of the parties are different from what they were at the outset of treatment , and it would be difficult for a court to judge whether the effect of [ J. \u2019s ] withdrawal of his consent on [ the applicant ] is greater than the effect that the invalidation of that withdrawal of consent would have on [ J. ] . The court has no point of reference by which to make that sort of evaluation . The fact is that each person has a right to be protected against interference with their private life . That is an aspect of the principle of self - determination or personal autonomy . It can not be said that the interference with [ J. \u2019s ] right is justified on the ground that interference is necessary to protect [ the applicant \u2019s ] right , because her right is likewise qualified in the same way by his right . They must have equivalent rights , even though the exact extent of their rights under LAW has not been identified .", "... The interference with [ the applicant \u2019s ] private life is also justified under LAW because , if [ the applicant \u2019s ] argument succeeded , it would amount to interference with the genetic father \u2019s right to decide not to become a parent . Motherhood could surely not be forced on [ the applicant ] and likewise fatherhood can not be forced on [ J. ] , especially as in the present case it will probably involve financial responsibility in law for the child as well . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the issue of discrimination , ORG Justices PERSON and PERSON considered that the true comparison was between women seeking ORG treatment whose partners had withdrawn consent and those whose partners had not done so ; Lady ORG considered that the real comparators were fertile and infertile women , since the genetic father had the possibility of withdrawing consent to ORG at a later stage than in ordinary sexual intercourse . The CARDINAL judges were nevertheless in agreement that , whatever comparators were chosen , the difference in treatment was justified and proportionate under LAW same reasons which underlay the finding of no violation of LAW . ORG further refused leave to appeal against ORG finding that the embryos were not entitled to protection under LAW , since under domestic law a foetus prior to the moment of birth , much less so an embryo , had no independent rights or interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The birth of the first child from ORG in DATE prompted much ethical and scientific debate in GPE , which in turn led to the appointment in DATE of ORG under the chairmanship of the philosopher Dame PERSON to \u201c consider recent and potential developments in medicine and science related to human fertilisation and embryology ; to consider what policies and safeguards should be applied , including consideration of the social , ethical and legal implications of these developments ; and to make recommendations \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reported in DATE ( Cmnd CARDINAL ) . At that time , the technique of freezing human embryos for future use was in its infancy , but the ORG noted that it had already occurred and had resulted in CARDINAL live birth , and recommended that clinical use of frozen embryos should continue to be developed under review by the licensing body ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) . It went on , however , to recognise the potential problems arising from the possibility of prolonged storage of human embryos , and recommended that a couple should be permitted to store embryos for their own future use for a maximum of DATE , after which time the right of use or disposal should pass to the storage authority ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . It further recommended that where , as a result , for example , of marital breakdown , a couple failed to agree how the shared embryo should be used , the right to determine the use or disposal of the embryo should pass to the storage authority ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Consistent with its view that there should be no right of ownership in a human embryo ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , ORG did not consider that CARDINAL party to the disagreement should be able to require use of the embryo against the wishes of the other .", "CARDINAL . ORG recommendations , so far as they related to ORG treatment , were set out in a Green ( consultation ) Paper issued for public consultation . It was noted in the Green Paper ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that few comments had been received about the ORG \u2019s recommendation that the storage authority should assume the rights of use or disposal of an embryo where there was no agreement between the couple , and stressed that although this situation was unlikely to arise very often it was important that there should be a \u201c clear basis \u201d for its resolution .", "CARDINAL . After receipt of representations from interested parties , the proposals on ORG were included in a ORG ( report ) , ORG : ORG , published in DATE ( Cm CARDINAL ) . The White Paper recorded ORG recommendation that the right of use or disposal of a frozen embryo should pass to the storage authority in the event of disagreement between the couple concerned ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) , but continued :", "\u201c Broadly , those who believe storage should be permitted were content with the ORG recommendations . There were some , however , who considered that the \u2018 storage authority\u2019 should not have the right of use or disposal unless specifically granted this by the donors . The Government shares this latter view and has concluded that the law should be based on the clear principle that the donor \u2019s wishes are paramount during the period in which embryos or gametes may be stored ; and that after the expiry of this period , they may only be used by the licence holder for other purposes if the donor \u2019s consent has been given to this . \u201d", "The White Paper indicated the ORG \u2019s decision that the maximum storage period for embryos should be DATE ( paragraph DATE ) . Then , in a section entitled \u201c ORG \u2019s Consent \u201d , it set out the policy that a donor should have the right to vary or withdraw consent to the transfer of an embryo to a woman at any time before the embryo was used :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The complexities connected with storage underline the importance of ensuring that , when couples embark on ORG treatment , or when gametes are being donated , the individuals involved have given their consent to the uses to which their gametes or embryos will be put .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON will provide that gametes or embryos may only be stored with the signed consent of the donors ; and may be used only by the licence holder responsible for storage for the purposes specified in that consent ( e.g. for therapeutic treatment , [ or for research ] ) . Those giving consent should be provided with information about the techniques for which their gametes / embryos might be used and about the legal implications of their decision . As a matter of good practice , counselling should also be available to them .", "CARDINAL . Donors would have the right to vary or withdraw their consent before the gametes / embryos were used , but the onus would be on them to notify any change to the licence holder . A licence holder receiving notice of such a change will have a duty to inform any other licence holder to whom he has supplied the donor \u2019s gametes . ( This situation might arise , for example , if a sperm bank supplied sperm to CARDINAL or more treatment centres . ) In the absence of any notification to the contrary , or notification of death , the licence holder must assume that the original consent still holds , and must act accordingly during the storage period . When this ends , he may only use or dispose of the embryos or gametes in accordance with the specified wishes of the donors . If these are not clear , the embryo or gametes should be removed from storage and left to perish .", "CARDINAL . As far as embryos are concerned , these may not be implanted into another woman , nor used for research , nor destroyed ( prior to the expiry of the storage time limit ) in the absence of the consent of both donors . If there is disagreement between the donors the licence holder will need to keep the embryo in storage until the end of the storage period , after which time , if there is still no agreement , the embryo should be left to perish . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following further consultation , ORG and Embryology Bill DATE was published , and passed into law as ORG Embryology Act DATE . The PERSON substantially reflected the terms of the White Paper . The provisions dealing with consent did not prove controversial during its passage through ORG .", "CARDINAL . In NORP v. Secretary of ORG ex parte ORG ( on behalf of ORG ) [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , Lord PERSON described the background to and general approach of LAW as follows .", "\u201c ... There is no doubting the sensitivity of the issues . There were those who considered the creation of embryos , and thus of life , in vitro to be either sacrilegious or ethically repugnant and wished to ban such activities altogether . There were others who considered that these new techniques , by offering means of enabling the infertile to have children and increasing knowledge of congenital disease , had the potential to improve the human condition , and this view also did not lack religious and moral arguments to support it . Nor can one doubt the difficulty of legislating against a background of fast - moving medical and scientific development . It is not often that ORG has to frame legislation apt to apply to developments at the advanced cutting edge of science .", "... The solution recommended and embodied in LAW was not to ban all creation and subsequent use of live human embryos produced in vitro but instead , and subject to certain express prohibitions of which some have been noted above , to permit such creation and use subject to specified conditions , restrictions and time limits and subject to the regimes of control ... It is ... plain that while ORG outlawed certain grotesque possibilities ( such as placing a live animal embryo in a woman or a live human embryo in an animal ) , it otherwise opted for a strict regime of control . No activity within this field was left unregulated . There was to be no free for all . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , no person shall bring about the creation of an embryo , or keep or use an embryo except in pursuance of a licence . The storage or use of an embryo can only take place lawfully in accordance with the requirements of the licence in question . The contravention of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) is an offence ( created by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , \u201c the statutory storage period in respect of embryos is such period not exceeding five years as the licence may specify \u201d . This provision was amended by ORG Regulations CARDINAL , which came into force on DATE , and which provide , inter alia , that where , in the opinion of CARDINAL medical practitioners , the woman in whom the embryo may be placed , or , where she is not CARDINAL of the persons whose gametes are used to create the embryo , CARDINAL of those persons , is or is likely to become completely infertile prematurely , the storage period is extended until that woman is CARDINAL . Where , in the opinion of a single medical practitioner , the woman in whom the embryo may be placed , or CARDINAL of the gamete providers , has or is likely to have significantly impaired fertility or has a significant genetic defect , the storage period is extended to DATE , or until that woman is DATE , whichever period is the shorter .", "Both of the persons whose gametes are used to create the embryos are required to confirm in writing that they do not object to extended storage for the purposes of future treatment . The woman in whom any such embryo may be placed must be under CARDINAL when storage commences .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The storage of embryos , for varying lengths of time , appears to be permitted in all GPE where ORG is regulated by primary or secondary legislation , except GPE and GPE , where in CARDINAL cycle of treatment CARDINAL embryos may be created which are , in principle , to be implanted together immediately , and GPE , where the law permits the freezing of embryos only on exceptional , unforeseen medical grounds .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE and GPE , the right of either party freely to withdraw his or her consent at any stage up to the moment of implantation of the embryo in the woman is expressly provided for in primary legislation .

In GPE and GPE the man \u2019s consent can be revoked only up to the point of fertilisation , beyond which it is the woman alone who decides if and when to proceed . In GPE , the man \u2019s right to revoke his consent is recognised only where he is married to and living with the woman .

In addition , the parties referred the ORG to case - law from GPE and GPE . The field of medically assisted reproduction is not regulated at federal level in GPE and few GPE have introduced laws concerning the subsequent withdrawal of consent by CARDINAL party .

In PERSON v.

If their wishes can not be ascertained , or if there is dispute , then their prior agreement concerning disposition should be carried out .

Ordinarily , the party wishing to avoid procreation should prevail , assuming that the other party has a reasonable possibility of achieving parenthood by means other than use of the pre - embryos in question . If no other reasonable alternatives exist , then the argument in favor of using the pre - embryos to achieve pregnancy should be considered . However , if the party seeking control of the pre - embryos intends merely to donate them to another couple , the objecting party obviously has the greater interest and should prevail .", "But the rule does not contemplate the creation of an automatic veto ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. PERSON ( CARDINAL GPE . TIME ) , the couple had signed an agreement with the clinic which stipulated that , \u201c in the event that we ... are unable to make a decision regarding the disposition of our frozen pre - zygotes \u201d , the embryos could be used for research . When the couple separated , PERSON sought to overturn the agreement and proceed to implantation . Although she prevailed at first instance ( the court reasoning that just as a woman has exclusive control over her reproduction so should she have the final say in the area of ORG ) , ORG decided that the existing agreement was sufficiently clear and should be honoured .", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. GPE ( DATE CARDINAL Mass. CARDINAL , CARDINAL N.E.CARDINALd CARDINAL ) there was again a previous written agreement , according to which , in the event of separation , the embryos were to be given to the wife , who now wished to continue with the treatment , contrary to the wishes of the husband . However , ORG considered that the arrangement should not be enforced because , inter alia , as a matter of public policy \u201c forced procreation is not an area amenable to judicial enforcement \u201d . Rather , \u201c freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life \u201d should prevail .", "CARDINAL . This judgment was cited with approval by ORG , in PERSON ( DATE PERSON ) . Here , it was the wife who sought the destruction of the embryos while the husband wanted them either to be donated to another couple or preserved for use by him with a future partner . Although constitutional arguments were advanced on behalf of the wife , the court declined to approach the matter in this way , reasoning that it was in any event not sure that enforcing the alleged private contract would violate her rights . Instead , having taken into account the fact that the father was not infertile , the court subscribed to the view taken in the ORG case regarding public policy and ordered that the wife \u2019s wishes be observed .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in Litowitz v. Litowitz ( DATE , CARDINAL ) the woman , who had had children before undergoing a hysterectomy , wished to use embryos created with her ex - husband \u2019s sperm and donor eggs for implantation in a surrogate mother . The ex - husband , however , wished the embryos to be donated to another couple . At first instance and on appeal the husband \u2019s view prevailed , but in DATE ORG of GPE decided by a majority to adopt a contractual analysis and to honour the couple \u2019s agreement with the clinic not to store the embryos for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In Nachmani v. Nachmani ( CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) P.D. CARDINAL ( GPE ) ) , a childless NORP couple decided to undergo ORG and then to contract with a surrogate in GPE to bear their child because the wife would not be able to carry the foetus to term . The couple signed an agreement with the surrogate , but not with the ORG clinic regarding the disposal of the embryos in the event of their separation . The wife had her last CARDINAL eggs extracted and fertilised with her husband \u2019s sperm . The couple then separated , before the embryos could be implanted in the surrogate , and the husband , who had gone on to have children with another woman , opposed the use of the embryos .", "ORG found in favour of the wife , holding that the husband could no more withdraw his agreement to have a child than a man who fertilises his wife \u2019s egg through sexual intercourse . A CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG reversed this decision , upholding the man \u2019s fundamental right not to be forced to be a parent . ORG reheard the case as a panel of CARDINAL judges and decided , CARDINAL , in favour of the wife . Each judge wrote a separate opinion . The judges in the majority found that the woman \u2019s interests and in particular her lack of alternatives to achieve genetic parenthood outweighed those of the man . CARDINAL of the minority judges , including the Chief Justice , reached the opposite conclusion , emphasising that the wife had known that her husband \u2019s consent would be required at every stage and that the agreement could not be enforced after the couple had become separated .
