RUSSIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants are NORP nationals . The first applicant , Mr PERSON GPE ( application no . DATE , lodged on DATE ) , was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON ( application no . CARDINAL lodged on DATE ) , was born in DATE and lives in ORG , GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the cases , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sued the ORG authorities in domestic courts and obtained judgments in their favour .", "CARDINAL . In the case of GPE , ORG of GPE on CARDINAL DATE awarded the applicant CARDINAL lump sums , of CARDINAL and MONEY ( RUB ) , plus the sums of RUB CARDINAL and DATE , to be paid on a DATE basis on account of the applicant 's participation in the cleaning - up operations following the GPE disaster . The court ordered that the DATE payments be subsequently adjusted ( index - linked ) in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . In the case of ORG , ORG of GPE on DATE awarded the applicant a lump sum of RUB CARDINAL in salary arrears on account of his service on a territory subject to emergency rule .", "CARDINAL . The judgments in the applicants ' favour became binding and enforceable on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively but remain unexecuted , either fully or in part . According to Mr GPE , the DATE payments have not been index - linked by the debtor authority ( ORG ) , contrary to the court order . In the case of PERSON , the defendant authority ( ORG of GPE ) failed to pay any of the judgment debt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered the Burdov pilot judgment ( see PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ... ) . The pilot judgment ordered the respondent ORG , inter alia , to set up an effective domestic remedy which would secure adequate and sufficient redress for non - enforcement or delayed enforcement of domestic judgments . The ORG also decided to adjourn , for DATE from the date on which the judgment became final , the proceedings in all cases concerning solely the non - enforcement and/or delayed enforcement of domestic judgments ordering monetary payments by the ORG authorities ( see PERSON ( no . CARDINAL ) , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and point CARDINAL of the operative part ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , like numerous other persons in the same position , Mr PERSON and PERSON PERSON were informed by letters of CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively that their cases would remain adjourned until DATE and that the subsequent procedure would be determined in the light of the implementation of the pilot judgment by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government informed the ORG that in response to the pilot judgment CARDINAL federal laws had been enacted , introducing a new domestic remedy in respect of lengthy judicial proceedings and delayed enforcement of domestic judgments against the ORG . The laws entered into force on DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d , see part B below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG informed the applicants in the present cases and all other applicants in the same position of the new remedy , advising them to make use of it within the DATE time - limit set by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE Mr PERSON informed the ORG in response that he had brought proceedings under LAW and obtained a judgment in his favour . On DATE ORG granted the applicant 's claim in part . It found that the NORP authorities had violated his right by delaying the enforcement of the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and awarded him RUB CARDINAL in compensation . The court took account of the amount of outstanding arrears due ( RUB CARDINAL ) , the applicant 's claims ( RUB MONEY ) , the ambiguity of the domestic case - law concerning the index for adjustment of court awards , considerations of reasonableness and equity and judgments of ORG in similar cases .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG against that decision , considering , inter alia , that the compensation award was insufficient and that the regional court had failed explicitly to acknowledge a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE , Mr PERSON indicated that he would lodge a claim with the domestic court under LAW and keep the ORG informed of any new fact .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding these developments , the applicants explicitly maintained their applications before the ORG . They challenged the capacity of the new remedy to provide adequate redress . The new domestic remedy at best allows , in their view , some inadequate compensation for delays but does not ensure the ORG 's ultimate compliance with the judgment . Mr ORG argued , in addition , that the compensation award made on DATE by the domestic court was substantially lower than the amounts awarded by the ORG in similar circumstances . More generally , he submitted that the consideration of his case by the ORG would remedy the uncertainty of the indexation requirements stemming from the ambiguous domestic case - law in this area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a ORG , no . CARDINAL-\u0424\u0417 , \u201c On Compensation for Violation of the Right to a Trial within a Reasonable Time or the Right to Enforcement of a ORG within a Reasonable Time \u201d ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) . On DATE the ORG adopted LAW , no . CARDINAL-\u0424\u0417 , introducing a number of corresponding changes to the relevant federal laws . Both laws entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . LAW entitles a party concerned ( \u201c an applicant \u201d ) to bring an action for compensation of the violation of his or her right to a trial within a reasonable time or of the right to enforcement within a reasonable time of a judgment establishing a debt to be recovered from the State budgets ( LAW , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Such compensation can only be awarded if the alleged violation took place independently of the applicant 's own actions except those taken in the circumstances of force majeure . A breach of the statutory time - limits for examination of the case does not amount per se to a violation of the right to a trial within a reasonable time or right to enforcement of a judgment within a reasonable time ( Section CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . A compensation award is not dependent on the competent authorities ' fault ( Section CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The compensation is awarded in monetary form ( LAW , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The amount of the compensation should be determined by courts according to the applicant '", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL sets out the rules of jurisdiction and procedure . It states in particular that a claim for compensation on account of lengthy enforcement of a judgment may be lodged prior to the end of the procedure for enforcement of a judgment but not DATE after the expiry of the statutory time - limit for enforcement and not DATE after the termination of the procedure for enforcement .", "CARDINAL . A court decision granting compensation is subject to immediate enforcement ( LAW , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . It may be appealed against in accordance with the procedural legislation in force ( Section CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The costs of payment of compensation awards are included in the federal budget , in the budgets of federal entities and in local budgets ( Section CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . All individuals who have complained to ORG that their right to a trial within a reasonable time or to enforcement of a judgment within a reasonable time has been violated may claim compensation in domestic courts under LAW within DATE of its entry into force , provided ORG has not ruled on the admissibility of the complaint ( LAW CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
