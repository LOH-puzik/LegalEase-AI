At Colony No CARDINAL , the supervising prosecutor indicated that , during his inspections , he was usually accompanied by senior staff members and prisoners would normally not request to meet him in private \u201c because they know that all complaints usually pass through the colony \u2019s administration \u201d .", "In the light of the above , the ORG reiterates its recommendation that the NORP authorities review the application of complaints procedures , with a view to ensuring that they are operating effectively . If necessary , the existing arrangements should be modified in order to guarantee that prisoners can make complaints to outside bodies on a truly confidential basis . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
