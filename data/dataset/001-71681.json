The applicant was born in DATE and lives in Cork . He is a medical doctor . In DATE a formal complaint was made to the police by a former female patient that she had been indecently assaulted by the applicant and that he had made video recordings . On DATE a search warrant was obtained . On DATE his home , clinic and consulting rooms were searched . Videos were found reflecting matters similar to those about which the woman had complained . Pills obtained by a prescription made out to , and using the medical card of , another patient were found although that patient knew nothing of the pills . A replica pistol and blank ammunition were found . The applicant was questioned . He admitted that he had obtained pills in that manner for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) was informed of a number of complaints against him by CARDINAL former female patients and , in DATE , the police confirmed to the ORG that they were investigating allegations of indecent assault by the applicant . In DATE the ORG received written complaints from those CARDINAL patients alleging sexual assault and blackmail . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Committee \u201d ) of the ORG decided that there was a prima facie case for the holding of an enquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made an order ( unpublished ) restraining him from practising pending the outcome of the inquiry . On DATE ORG ordered the removal of the applicant \u2019s name from the register of practitioner \u2019s and restrained him from practising pending the inquiry and all consequent proceedings . ORG also agreed that the ORG could make public the \u201c sequence of events \u201d including the orders of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . ORG issued a press release on DATE which included the applicant \u2019s name , the terms of those CARDINAL ORG orders and details of how an individual could complain to the ORG about a medical practitioner . Further complaints ( CARDINAL ) were then received from other former female patients of the applicant , of which CARDINAL made formal statements to the police .", "CARDINAL . The applicant left GPE for DATE to avoid the publicity but kept in contact with the police through his solicitor . On DATE he attended with his solicitor , and by prearranged appointment , at a police station to enquire as to whether there were criminal charges pending against him . He claims that he was informed that no charges were pending . However , on DATE when he voluntarily attended the same police station with his solicitor , his solicitor insisted on attending the interview , the police refused and , given the dispute , arrested the applicant ( under LAW DATE \u2013 for the proper investigation of a crime - on suspicion of sexual assault of a former patient ) during which period the applicant saw his solicitor . The period of lawful detention expired that TIME : that TIME he appeared voluntarily before a High Court judge in his habeas corpus application . That application was later determined against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief State Solicitor advised the applicant that certain summonses had issued against him . The applicant was served at his solicitor \u2019s office . The charges concerned the pills , replica pistol and ammunition found . On DATE these charges were , pursuant to his application , struck out for lack of evidence .", "CARDINAL . On unspecified dates , certain former patients , also complainants in the criminal proceedings , initiated civil actions against the applicant alleging sexual assault . These proceedings are defended by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the ORG that the criminal proceedings had been favourably disposed of and that the pending civil actions against him ( by patients who had not complained to ORG ) would be vigorously defended : he asked for the resumption of the disciplinary inquiry . A hearing was held on DATE and the ORG rejected his request to hold the inquiry in public . The applicant \u2019s request for leave to apply for judicial review of that decision was rejected by ORG but was granted by ORG ( DATE ) . ORG ( DATE ) and then ORG ( DATE ) rejected the substantive judicial review application and appeal , respectively . When it became subsequently clear that sexual assault charges would be pursued against him , the ORG proceedings were stayed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was served with a routine summons under LAW DATE ( in order to allow them to dispose of the blank ammunition and the replica pistol ) . That summons lapsed as it was returnable for a bank holiday .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on foot of a warrant ( issued on DATE ) in respect of an alleged sexual assault of a former patient on a date between DATE and CARDINAL DATE . A list of all charges concerning CARDINAL complainants was read to him later in the police station : he was thereby formally charged with CARDINAL offences of a sexual nature . He was brought before ORG TIME to considerable media attention . Bail was opposed but granted on condition that he report to a police station every DATE TIME . His passport was impounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he unsuccessfully applied for a copy of the statement grounding the application for his arrest warrant . On DATE he was given leave to apply for judicial review for an order prohibiting his prosecution on CARDINAL grounds , including \u201c gross and inexcusable delay \u201d . A stay on prosecution was granted pending the determination of the judicial review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the respondents submitted a statement of opposition and CARDINAL affidavits . On DATE an order for discovery was made against the respondents . In DATE , DATE and DATE the proceedings were adjourned on the application of the respondents . In DATE the respondents filed their first affidavit of discovery and in DATE the applicant requested further discovery . The proceedings were adjourned CARDINAL times DATE at the respondents\u2019 request . On DATE the respondents requested the hearing of the substantive matter ; on DATE they filed a further affidavit of discovery ; on DATE the applicant issued a motion requesting further and better discovery ; and on DATE the respondents requested that a date be fixed for the substantive hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to file an affidavit listing those documents over which he disputed the respondents\u2019 assertion of privilege . The applicant filed an affidavit on DATE but it was later found not to have complied with the order of CARDINAL DATE . In response , the respondents filed affidavits on DATE . On DATE the High Court heard the applicant \u2019s motion for further discovery , ordered the respondents to make further discovery by DATE and the matter was adjourned to DATE . On DATE the applicant filed an affidavit complaining , inter alia , about delay in the case . On DATE , and further to the respondents\u2019 submission that another affidavit and discovery would be soon ready , the matter was adjourned to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that a further adjournment would be applied for by the respondents . On DATE the adjournment was accorded by ORG ( until DATE ) . The applicant filed an affidavit on that date again complaining about delay . The respondents filed further affidavits in DATE and DATE as did the applicant on DATE . On DATE a further adjournment was accorded , with the applicant \u2019s consent on the basis that the respondents furnish him with all non - contested documents by DATE . On DATE ORG ordered him to clarify within DATE the documents in respect of which he contested the privilege claimed by the respondents . On DATE the applicant filed a further affidavit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hearing of the application for further and better discovery resumed . At this hearing the applicant indicated that he disputed privilege in relation to the ORG statements and the medical reports . The court ordered the respondents to make the ORG statements available to the applicant ( with addresses blocked out ) . It made no order as regards the respondents\u2019 medical reports and indicated that it would provide the first available date for the hearing of the substantive judicial review matter .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the substantive judicial review hearing was fixed for DATE . However , on DATE , the respondents filed another CARDINAL affidavits . As a result , the substantive hearing had to be adjourned . Both parties were in agreement that the case should not be re - listed until ORG had given judgment in a case which was relevant to one ( not delay ) of the grounds of review ( \u201c the related case \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the procedural disputes continued . The applicant disputed the claimed privilege during a hearing from CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE . During a hearing on DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant sought further inspection of the respondents\u2019 documents . On DATE ORG refused this application . It noted that , while the respondents had been \u201c grossly in delay \u201d in filing the affidavits in DATE , the information contained therein had not added anything material to the case . It also noted that the applicant had not complied with ORG order of CARDINAL DATE to specify which of the documents , in which the respondents were claiming privilege , were being disputed .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment in the related case in DATE . The applicant \u2019s substantive hearing was set down for DATE . It ended on DATE and judgment was reserved .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court delivered its judgment refusing the relief ( prohibition of prosecution ) sought by the applicant . It found that both parties were at fault for the delay caused by the discovery process : the applicant for not being more focused as to the documents he required ( and in particular not complying with the order of CARDINAL DATE ) ; the respondents for being slow to furnish discovery . It also stated that the respondents had been entirely to blame for the adjournment of the proceedings on DATE . However , it considered that this default had not caused any significant delay because the proceedings had to be adjourned anyway to await the judgment in the related case . Accordingly , by judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG removed the stay on prosecution and ordered the applicant to pay the ORG \u2019s costs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant appealed ( against the refusal of the prohibition order and the order for costs ) . In DATE ORG heard the appeal . On DATE it rejected the appeal concerning the refusal of the prohibition order . It considered that some of the delay in the judicial review proceedings was the fault of the applicant ( for not complying with the order of CARDINAL DATE ) ; some was necessary ( in order to await the judgment in the related case ) ; some was caused by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) ( in particular the adjournments they sought during the protracted discovery process ) ; and some was caused by ORG ( in failing to deliver judgment for DATE ) . It held that it could only take into account the delay for which the ORG was responsible .", "CARDINAL . As to the \u201c considerable delay \u201d of ORG in delivering judgment , it said :", "\u201c ... it is a complete misunderstanding of the decision of ORG in PERSON v. GPE [ no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALX ( extracts ) ] to treat it as authority for the proposition that , in a case such as the present , the right of the public , as represented by the ORG , to the trial of serious offences can be defeated by a delay for which the prosecuting authorities bore no responsibility . The decision of the majority of the [ C]ourt in PERSON ... does not have the effect of entitling a party in the domestic courts to relief which would otherwise not be available to him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG affirmed the costs order of ORG and required the applicant to pay the respondents\u2019 costs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was informed by the police that , in light of ORG judgment , the prosecution would proceed before ORG on DATE . On DATE , the prosecutor withdrew charges concerning CARDINAL complainants but maintained the charges of sexual assault concerning CARDINAL complainants . The prosecution sought and was granted an adjournment ( until DATE ) to allow it to prepare a Book of Evidence after which it was envisaged that the charges would be transferred for trial on indictment . On DATE ORG lifted his bail conditions . It ordered the transfer of the charges to ORG for trial on indictment . ORG refused to conduct a preliminary examination of the charges under Part II of LAW DATE ( which provision had been repealed by Part III of LAW DATE in DATE ) . On DATE the High Court granted leave to seek judicial review of this refusal by ORG .", "A medical report dated DATE concluded that the applicant \u2019s advanced age and the ongoing prosecution \u201c have affected his physical and mental condition to such an extent that at this point in time his capacity to defend himself is impaired \u201d . ORG disciplinary proceedings and the civil assault actions have been adjourned pending the criminal proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
