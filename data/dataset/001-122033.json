Her whole family , with the exception of the youngest boy , was suffering from depression . The second applicant in particular was very ill , uncommunicative , and suffered from headaches . The first applicant claimed that her husband was registered as a suspect with the NORP military services . As a result , he had gone into hiding in the mountains . The first applicant and her family had been repeatedly threatened , to induce them to disclose the whereabouts of her husband \u2019s hiding place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) rejected the asylum requests in line with LAW ) in conjunction with LAW of LAW , and ordered the applicants\u2019 transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) quashed those decisions and noted that the statements made by ORG regarding the health of the second applicant were insufficient and that the authority had failed to establish that the second applicant was fit to be transferred to GPE ( GPE ) . Furthermore , the authority had failed to evaluate information regarding access to medical treatment in GPE . Finally , since the applicants must be considered vulnerable persons , the authority needed to get assurances from the NORP authorities regarding housing , related support and access to medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG responded to the NORP request for information concerning the reception conditions by stating in general terms that the reception and lodging of asylum seekers in GPE was guaranteed in governmental asylum centres ( ORG or ORG ) .

Therefore , to ensure appropriate medical and welfare support for such vulnerable groups , the NORP authorities were requested to submit detailed information for each individual case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again rejected the applicants\u2019 asylum request pursuant to the DATE LAW and LAW , and ordered their expulsion to GPE .

NORP In substance it found that the applicants had not sufficiently proved that they would not have access to medical treatment in GPE . Furthermore , the applicants had not even lodged an asylum request in GPE , which weakened their criticism of the NORP asylum system . The general information available to the authority would not warrant the opinion that the applicants would be subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if they were returned to GPE . Acknowledging the fact that the second applicant , and also the first applicant , who had less serious symptoms , was suffering from psychological impairments , ORG found that they had to accept the possibility that their health would deteriorate and that their opportunities to receive medical treatment would be reduced if they were transferred , which was in line with the ORG \u2019s case - law . Furthermore , the NORP authorities would treat the transfer as \u201c problematic \u201d and thus provide medical assistance during the removal attempt .

Those reception conditions were also guaranteed to GPE - returners . This category received a preliminary form of reception upon arrival when the services present in the main airports were activated ; subsequently they were accommodated in government reception centres . When the transferring country reported an asylum seeker as belonging to a vulnerable category , appropriate medical measures were taken in the centres , intended to provide appropriate reception .
