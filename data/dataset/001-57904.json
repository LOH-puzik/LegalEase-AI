It held that in spite of the justified wish of PERSON and PERSON to have biological realities officially recognised , their request had to be refused since , under the law as it stood , PERSON was the legitimate child of Mr M\u2019Hallem - Driss . There were only limited exceptions to the rule that the husband of the mother was presumed to be the father of a child born in wedlock . This was justified in the interests of legal certainty , which were of great importance in this field , and by the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others . The law as it stood was therefore not incompatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article DATE ) of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG Relying again on Articles DATE and CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article DATE ) , PERSON and Mr PERSON appealed to ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "ORG rejected the appeal on CARDINAL DATE . It held that LAW article CARDINAL) was applicable but had not been violated . The restrictions imposed on the mother \u2019s right to deny the paternity of her husband satisfied the requirements of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article LAW ) . There had , however , been a violation of LAW taken together with LAW ) , since there was no sound reason for the difference of treatment which the law established between husband and wife by not granting the latter the possibility , available to the former , of denying the husband \u2019s paternity . Nevertheless the appeal could not be allowed ; it was not open to the court to grant the ORG request , as that would require the creation of new GPE law , including administrative procedure , and would therefore go beyond the limits of the judiciary \u2019s powers to develop the law . Only the legislature could decide how best to comply with LAW as regards the possibility of denying paternity of a child born in wedlock .", "CARDINAL . PERSON and Mr PERSON then lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( PERSON ) .", "They argued , firstly , that ORG had violated LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW by holding that the limitations imposed by section PERSON on the mother \u2019s possibility of denying her husband \u2019s paternity - more particularly the fact that she might do so only in respect of a child born after the dissolution of the marriage - satisfied the requirements of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article LAW ) . ORG had not properly weighed up the interests involved . It ought to have considered the relative weight of , on the one hand , the interests of the biological father and his child and , on the other , the interests protected by the legislation . ORG should have given priority to the former interests , which in the case before it were best served by severing the legal ties between PERSON and Mr M\u2019Hallem - Driss and establishing such ties between PERSON and PERSON , who were entitled , under LAW article CARDINAL) of the LAW , to have their family relationship recognised .", "In addition , they suggested that it followed from ORG finding of a violation of LAW ) that the interference concerned could not under any circumstances be covered by LAW CARDINAL ( article LAW ) .", "Secondly , they argued that , by holding that it was not empowered to grant the ORG request as that would require the creation of new GPE law , ORG had violated Articles DATE and CARDINAL ( article DATE ) taken together . In the applicants\u2019 submission , there was no reason to consider that only the legislature was able to remove the discrimination which ORG had rightly found to exist ; it was sufficient to disregard the requirement that the child must have been born after the dissolution of the mother \u2019s marriage .", "CARDINAL . ORG Following the advisory opinion of ORG , ORG rejected the appeal on DATE .", "ORG did not rule on the question whether section PERSON violated Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL) , or Article CARDINAL taken together with Article CARDINAL ( article DATE ) . It considered that it was not necessary to do so , because it agreed with ORG that , even if there had been such a violation , solving the problem of what should replace section PERSON went beyond the limits of the judiciary \u2019s powers to develop the law . This finding was based on the following reasoning :", "\" In this connection , it should not be overlooked that if a possibility were to be created for the mother to deny [ her husband \u2019s ] paternity [ of a child born ] during marriage , the question would immediately arise as to what other limitations should apply in order not to jeopardise the child \u2019s interest in certainty regarding its descent from its legitimate parents , which interest the child generally has and which is part of the basis for the present system . Such limitations have therefore also been written into LAW ( Wetsvoorstel PERSON ; PERSON van de ORG to ORG of ORG - , DATE , DATE , sections CARDINAL et seq . ) , which is now before ORG ... [ I]t is not certain whether [ these limitations ] will be retained , added to or withdrawn in the course of the further parliamentary discussion , many variations being conceivable , regard also being had to the need to ensure equal treatment of the father and the mother , in so far , at any rate , that unequal treatment is not justified . \"", "The judgment of ORG was reported in PERSON ( GPE Law Reports - \" GPE \" ) , DATE , CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .
