The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant deposited CARDINAL new roubles ( \u201c roubles \u201d ) in a savings account with the commercial bank PERSON ( \u201c the bank \u201d ) offering an interest rate of PERCENT per annum . DATE he withdraw MONEY , representing interest that had accrued on that account . After the bank announced that it was changing the interest rate , the applicant requested the closure of his account in DATE , but the bank informed him that it was unable to repay him his capital plus interest as its funds were insufficient .", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought proceedings against the bank , seeking repayment of the capital he had deposited , together with interest , a penalty payment at PERCENT per day and compensation for pecuniary damage ( in connection with the construction of a house ) and for non - pecuniary damage ( on account of health problems ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the town of GPE partly upheld his claims . It established that on the closure of his account the bank owed the applicant MONEY , representing the capital deposited and the interest due for DATE . After calculating the index - linked sum , it ordered the bank to pay the applicant MONEY . It further ordered a penalty payment of MONEY and awarded MONEY for non - pecuniary damage , making a total of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was upheld at last instance on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of the Oktyabrskiy court of DATE , the above - mentioned judgment debt was raised to MONEY in view of the failure to pay MONEY and the rate of inflation .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , at the request of ORG and ORG , ORG for the FAC region declared the bank insolvent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the insolvency procedure was opened by that court and a liquidator was appointed to oversee the liquidation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved the provisional statement of affairs based on the bank \u2019s financial situation at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of that statement the committee of creditors of the bank decided on DATE and DATE to distribute the assets in the first place to certain categories of creditors . Accordingly , disabled persons , Second World War veterans , individuals in need and persons having taken an active part in the liquidation process , that is to say CARDINAL persons in total ( PERCENT of creditors ) , were reimbursed by the liquidator at PERCENT of the index - linked amount of their capital together with interest . It was decided to reimburse the other creditors in the same manner , as and when further assets became available .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sent the liquidator a request for the repayment of the MONEY owed to him . In response to that request , the sum of MONEY was paid to him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged , before ORG , the fact that other creditors had received repayment at PERCENT , whereas he , as a preferential creditor , had received MONEY . Relying on sections DATE of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , he sought the repayment of the remainder of the sum owed to him in accordance with the principle of proportional distribution . LAW provided that , where a company \u2019s assets were insufficient to satisfy all creditors , creditors of the same class would be paid in proportion to their respective claims . In the present case , at the date of the applicant \u2019s request , MONEY had been collected in the liquidation process and these funds had been used for PERCENT repayment to creditors in the various categories mentioned above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s action was dismissed at first instance on the ground that the amount owed to him ( MONEY ) represented PERCENT of the assets totalling MONEY which , having been collected in the liquidation process , had been used to repay certain categories of creditor . According to the principle of proportional distribution he was therefore entitled to receive PERCENT of MONEY , i.e. MONEY . That sum had already been paid to him on DATE , whilst the remainder would be paid as and when more funds became available in the course of the ongoing liquidation process .", "CARDINAL . Hearing the case on appeal , ORG held on DATE that , contrary to the requirements of section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , the liquidator \u2019s list of creditors had not identified those that had priority or the corresponding sums to be paid to them separately . On the basis of the documents produced by the liquidator it was not possible to establish the applicant \u2019s level of priority in relation to the other creditors , and the liquidator himself had stated orally that the applicant belonged to the fifth level of priority . ORG took the view that , in deciding to repay certain categories of creditors at PERCENT , the PERSON committee had overstepped the limits of its remit under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act . By enforcing that decision and distributing the assets accordingly , the liquidator had , in turn , disregarded the requirements of sections CARDINAL and QUANTITY . Pointing out that section CARDINAL of the LAW was not open to a broad interpretation of its provisions , ORG ordered the liquidator to redress the violations thus observed within DATE and to inform it of the measures taken in that connection .", "CARDINAL . NORP The liquidator appealed on points of law to ORG for the LOC , arguing that he had distributed the assets pursuant to a decision of the PERSON committee , that the distribution had complied with LAW and that it had not therefore been in breach of the requirements of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) . On DATE his appeal on points of law was dismissed . Upholding the decision of CARDINAL DATE , the court stated that the liquidator should not have enforced a decision by the PERSON committee that was in breach of the law .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement of the decision of CARDINAL DATE and , in particular , the redressing of the applicant \u2019s financial situation , were not possible on account of the lack of assets .", "CARDINAL . In view of the failure to enforce the decision of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant filed a complaint with ORG on DATE , subsequently supplementing it with a complaint of DATE . He requested that the liquidator in person repay him the index - linked amount of the remainder of his award of MONEY , with interest and compensation for the non - pecuniary damage caused by his unlawful action .", "CARDINAL . NORP The complaints in question were examined in the context of the insolvency procedure opened against the bank .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request on the ground that , on DATE and DATE , ORG had awarded the applicant the sum of MONEY to cover his claim and damages , and that it was not possible to rule on the same request a second time . ORG established that the applicant appeared in the list of creditors under the number CARDINAL and that , in respect of the actual capital deposited , the bank owed him a residual amount of MONEY . The court pointed out that this sum could be paid to him under the conditions laid down in DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE judges of ORG , hearing the case on appeal , upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE and pointed out that , in accordance with LAW of DATE that was in force at the time the applicant \u2019s complaints were examined , only those debts that had accrued in the course of the bank \u2019s operations could give rise to repayment . Accordingly , the requests for the payment of various sums to which the applicant was allegedly entitled after the bank \u2019s insolvency and during its liquidation could not be granted . The appellate court found that , by virtue of the judicial decisions , the applicant had secured a judgment debt of MONEY , which corresponded to the damage caused to him by the bank before it became insolvent . It added that the applicant would be able to recover this sum once sufficient assets had been realised in the liquidation process . The applicant \u2019s complaint was confined , in the appellate court \u2019s view , to the seeking of the above - mentioned sum together with penalties for non - payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG for the LOC dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law on the following grounds :", "\u201c The decision of the PERSON committee and the liquidator \u2019s action concerning the PERCENT repayment of debts to CARDINAL creditors ( out of the bank \u2019s CARDINAL creditors , whose claims amounted to MONEY ) admittedly breached the principle of proportional payment to creditors at the same level of priority , but did not cause Mr Kotov the damage he alleged , because the PERCENT satisfaction of all first - level creditors was not possible on account of the lack of assets available for distribution . The sum repaid to PERSON was thus calculated in proportion to the amount of his claim and to the assets realised in the course of the liquidation ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court further pointed out that the liquidation process was still pending and that the applicant \u2019s claim could thus be satisfied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the statement of affairs , as presented by the liquidator and approved by the general meeting of creditors , and closed the insolvency procedure on grounds of insufficient assets .", "CARDINAL . After the Government had been given notice of the application , the President of ORG of GPE lodged , on DATE , an application for supervisory review ( protest ) against the decisions of CARDINAL February , DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs DATE above ) , on the ground that they had been given in breach of LAW , which determined the jurisdiction of the commercial courts . Among other things , he stated that the examination of the applicant \u2019s complaints of DATE and DATE , in the context of the insolvency procedure opened against the bank , had been contrary to the DATE LAW such proceedings . Since those complaints had concerned a dispute between the applicant and the liquidator , they were not related to the insolvency procedure as such and the applicant should have submitted them to the courts of general jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On those grounds the President sought the annulment of the decisions at issue and the discontinuance of the proceedings concerning the above - mentioned complaints . On DATE the Presidium of ORG of GPE fully granted those requests , espousing the arguments raised in the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request for revision of the DATE decision to the same ORG . On DATE his request was dismissed as ill - founded by the Vice - President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , after the expiry of the period within which creditors have to file their claims , the liquidation committee draws up a provisional statement of affairs containing information on the bankrupt \u2019s estate , the claims filed by the creditors and the results of the examination of those claims . The statement has to be approved by the body that has taken the decision to wind up the company . If the company \u2019s monetary assets are insufficient to satisfy the LOC claims , the liquidation committee will sell off the estate by auction . The distribution of assets to the creditors may begin in accordance with the interim statement once it has been approved , except in respect of fifth - level creditors who will not be able to receive any money owed to them for DATE following that approval . Once all the payments have been made , the final statement of affairs is drawn up and approved in the same manner . Should the assets prove insufficient , the unsatisfied creditors may request the courts to order the owner of the company to honour their claims out of his own personal funds .", "LAW , as in force prior to DATE , made a distinction CARDINAL classes of creditors , providing that payment could be made to a given class only when the creditors at the previous level had been satisfied . According to this classification the applicant belonged to the fifth class of \u201c other creditors \u201d . Article CARDINAL made no mention of a class of creditors who were pensioners , Second World War veterans or persons in need .", "Under a new provision that was inserted into this LAW DATE , when a bank or other lending institution is wound up , private persons having made deposits with it are to be repaid as a first priority .", "Article CARDINAL further provides that where a legal entity in liquidation has insufficient assets , they must be distributed among creditors at the same level in proportion to their respective claims .", "CARDINAL .

They must not have a criminal record . No persons holding a position of responsibility in a company that is a debtor or creditor may be appointed .

The list must be sent to the creditors within DATE .", "Section CARDINAL establishes the various levels of priority for the distribution of the proceeds of the liquidation . Payment of the sums due to creditors at a given level is made once those at the previous level have been satisfied ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . If not enough assets are realised to pay in full the creditors at a given level , the money that is available will be paid to them pari passu in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . LAW makes no mention of a class of creditors who are disabled , Second World War veterans or persons in need .
