NORP Before DATE men and women had to meet different conditions for entitlement to a widow \u2019s or a widower \u2019s pension , respectively .

On DATE the Survivor \u2019s Pension and Educational Periods Act ( Hinterbliebenenrenten- PERSON ) of DATE , amending the relevant provisions of LAW ( ORG ) , ORG ( PERSON ) and LAW ) , entered into force . LAW , applying to workers , and LAW , applying to employees , together with the reform legislation , namely the Workers\u2019 Pension ( Reform ) Act ( Arbeiterrentenversicherungs - Neuregelungsgesetz ) and LAW ( PERSON ) , formed the basis of the general old age insurance system ( gesetzliche GPE PERSON ) . A widow is entitled to a survivor \u2019s pension after the death of her insured husband , and a widower is entitled to a survivor \u2019s pension after the death of his insured wife . Moreover , pursuant to the new legislation , a survivor \u2019s earned income or income in lieu of earned income is taken into account . According to the explanatory report , the latter rule was justified on account of the maintenance function of a survivor \u2019s pension ( PERCENT of the spouses\u2019 last income ) . The reform only concerned pension cases having occurred as from DATE . Furthermore , for a transitional period until DATE , spouses could opt for the old regime if they had been married before DATE and if they were both DATE at that time . Subsequent reform legislation , including a uniform pension regime for workers and employees , did not affect the substance of the above legislation concerning a survivor \u2019s pension .", "CARDINAL .
