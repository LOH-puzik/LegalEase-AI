A clear pattern of physical ill - treatment of prisoners by custodial staff emerged . The ill - treatment alleged consisted essentially of kicks , punches and truncheon blows to various parts of the body ( excluding the face ) . The ill - treatment was said to have been inflicted principally in the central corridor of the detention facility , usually when prisoners were taken to an investigator 's room for questioning or when they were returned to their cells after such questioning ; apparently , prisoners were also on occasion physically ill - treated in the investigators ' rooms .

More generally , the ORG stressed that it was essential for the NORP authorities to adopt a proactive approach in this area .", "The response of the NORP authorities to this key recommendation was very unsatisfactory ...", "As was stressed in a letter sent to the NORP authorities on DATE , the ORG 's concerns in this regard are all the greater given that in the course of the ORG 's most recent visit to GPE , in DATE , numerous credible and consistent allegations were once again received of severe ill - treatment by Federal forces ; in a number of cases , those allegations were supported by medical evidence . The ORG 's delegation found a palpable climate of fear ; many people who had been ill - treated and others who knew about such offences were reluctant to file complaints to the authorities .
