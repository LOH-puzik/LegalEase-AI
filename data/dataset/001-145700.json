In DATE it emerged that in DATE , while government business was still being conducted on an interim basis by the outgoing government pending PERSON election as Chancellor , guarantees had been signed whereby the NORP government agreed to underwrite a loan of MONEY from CARDINAL NORP banks in favour of ORG and part of the pipeline . Mr PERSON indicated that he had had no knowledge of the signing of the guarantees and ORG stated that it had not made use of them .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE PERSON sought an injunction in ORG prohibiting any further publication of the following passage of the article :", "\u201c PERSON has a monstrous suspicion : \u2018 Did PERSON want to resign because he had been offered lucrative positions ? Did he have personal motives in deciding to call early elections in a politically desperate situation?\u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG granted the injunction . It held in particular that the quotation in issue was neither a factual allegation nor a value judgment but mere speculation in the form of questions , the legality of which was a matter for assessment in the light of the principles established for reporting on suspicions ( GPE ) . According to these criteria , the courts had to assess whether the impugned report concerned a matter of public interest , whether there was a sufficient factual basis for the speculation , whether the newspaper had been sufficiently diligent in carrying out its research and in deciding to publish the report , and whether the nature of the report made it sufficiently clear that what was being reported was speculation and that the factual reality might be different . The regional court held that the publication of the passage in issue in the case before it did not satisfy these criteria in so far as the applicant company had not sought to obtain Mr PERSON \u2019s views on the matter beforehand and had not established a sufficient factual basis to justify publishing the passage in question .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . It held that the publication of the offending quotation breached LAW , in conjunction with LAW ( by analogy ) of LAW and the right to protection of personality rights ( Allgemeines Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrecht \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d ) , because it suggested to readers of the newspaper that Chancellor PERSON had taken the decision to hold early parliamentary elections on the basis of private considerations motivated by self - interest . ORG found it unnecessary to determine whether the quotation in issue amounted to a genuine ( open ) question or a factual allegation in the form of a question , since the applicant company had conveyed a suspicion which could also have been formulated as a question . ORG had thus been correct in applying the criteria for reporting on suspicions .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed that the report published by the applicant company did not merely reproduce what Mr PERSON had said , but the quotation had formed part of a significantly longer article intended to steer readers in a certain direction . It further pointed out that the article had begun by saying that Mr PERSON and the NORP President PERSON had met in DATE , and had then asked whether Chancellor PERSON \u2019s activities on behalf of ORG had been discussed on that occasion . In the court \u2019s view , this encouraged readers to believe that it was possible that an agreement had been reached for PERSON to take up a private - sector post and that he had used the election defeat in GPE as a pretext for triggering a series of events that would lead to his leaving office as Chancellor . It added that this line of thinking was borne out by the CARDINAL questions in the quotation in issue and the use of the phrases \u201c early election gambit \u201d and \u201c must now be seen in a new light \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed that the principles for reporting on suspicions applied to the case before it , although the report in question had not contained any suspicion that Mr PERSON had committed a criminal offence . What was decisive in the court \u2019s view was that the applicant company had conveyed a suspicion entailing a serious and damaging accusation against the former Chancellor . The article had suggested that he had misled the general public and the electorate about the true reasons for his decision to call early elections and that he had prioritised his own financial interests over the common good , which he was required to serve as Federal Chancellor . ORG considered that this was one of the most serious accusations that could be levelled against a person who had formerly held one of the highest ORG offices . In its view , the quotation in issue confirmed the seriousness of the accusation by using the phrase \u201c monstrous suspicion \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that the applicant company had not had due regard to the principles established for reporting on suspicions . According to these principles , any such reports had to concern a matter of justifiable public interest , have a minimum factual basis , set out the facts objectively by indicating both the circumstances supporting the suspicion and those pleading in favour of the person under suspicion , be published , in principle , after obtaining comments about the accusations from the person concerned and be the result of research satisfying the requirements of journalistic rigour .", "CARDINAL . Applying those principles to the case before it , ORG noted firstly that the subject - matter of the report was in the public interest . It also accepted that there had been sufficient material to justify reporting on the suspicions in question . In that connection , it recapitulated the sequence of events forming the background to the article , namely that Mr PERSON had expressed support for the pipeline project throughout his time as Chancellor , that he had met President PERSON at the signing of the declaration of DATE by CARDINAL NORP and NORP private - sector firms , that he had decided to hold early elections at a time when his political party had been in difficulty following its election defeat in GPE , that he had triggered a process resulting in his relinquishing the office of Chancellor and that \u2013 according to ORG \u2013 it had emerged that between the date of the early elections and his DATE as Chancellor , PERSON had secured a very well - paid post in a consortium controlled by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that it was especially legitimate to ask how Mr Schr\u00f6der could have secured that post as the events in question belonged to an area of fundamental importance in shaping public opinion . It pointed out that the requirements for assessing the legitimacy of such a report should not be too stringent . Otherwise , there was a risk that the media would be limited to commenting on ORG conduct only where there was substantial evidence corroborating the suspicions raised . Such a restriction , however , was not acceptable in this sphere . ORG noted that anyone who attracted public attention , such as politicians , had to accept that the threshold beyond which their conduct could be investigated by the media was lower than that applicable to anyone not in the public domain .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that the impugned publication had lacked objectivity and balance . It pointed out that the version of events set out in a report should not amount to a prejudgment ( PERSON ) of the person concerned . This was not only the case where the report gave the impression that the person had in fact done what he or she was suspected of doing , but also when a report was intentionally biased and distorted the facts for sensationalist purposes , without regard to the circumstances militating in favour of the person concerned . In ORG view , this was what had happened in the case of the report in issue , since it had made no mention of any factors casting doubt on the accusations made but had referred solely to circumstances corroborating the suspicions , which to a certain extent were concentrated within the offending quotation .", "CARDINAL . In this connection the Court of Appeal observed that the report did not mention that the DATE election defeat in GPE had considerably weakened the authority of the government majority at federal level and could have constituted a valid reason for asking the electorate , by means of early elections , whether it still supported this majority . Likewise , the report did not mention anywhere that Chancellor PERSON had not adopted an attitude of resignation but rather had been active and combative throughout the election campaign . Lastly , ORG found that at the time of the article \u2019s publication there had been no information from anyone close to Mr Schr\u00f6der to suggest that he had based his decision to call early elections on grounds that were spurious ( sachfremd ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that the applicant company had no basis for arguing that these circumstances were so well known to readers that there was no need to reiterate them in the report , since the entire article had sought to suggest to readers that there were no circumstances casting doubt on the facts as presented . Similarly , the fact that the subject of the report was of considerable public interest could not exempt the applicant company from its duty to present a balanced account of the facts . On this point , ORG emphasised that the applicant company was not prevented from criticising PERSON . However , in view of the extremely serious accusation being made , it could have been expected to indicate that the facts had yet to be established .", "CARDINAL . ORG held , lastly , that the applicant company had not carried out sufficient research before publishing the article . It considered that irrespective of whether the politician quoted in the article should have been required to conduct his own research before raising his questions , the applicant company had had a duty to clarify the facts further before publicly reproducing those questions , which concerned extremely serious allegations . It pointed out that there had been sufficient connecting factors in this regard . For example , the applicant company could have contacted the consortium in GPE , Mr PERSON himself or one of his team to find out when the post for the former Chancellor had been planned or created , when he had discovered the existence of the post and when and by whom the post had been offered to him . ORG added that the fact that other media outlets had reported on similar suspicions could not release the applicant company from its duties . Moreover , the company had not asked PERSON for his views . In ORG opinion , irrespective of whether the views of the person concerned should always be sought when suspicions were being reported , the press had a duty in any event , in order to satisfy the requirements of journalistic rigour , to contact the person concerned when publishing speculation relating to that person \u2019s motives , provided that the person could be reached for comment . ORG concluded that this duty had been all the more compelling in the case before it , in view of the especially serious nature of the allegation being made .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law , holding that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a chamber of ORG decided not to accept for adjudication a constitutional appeal by the applicant company ( no . MONEY ) . It declined to give reasons for its decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
