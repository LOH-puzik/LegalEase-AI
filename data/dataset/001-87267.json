PERSON was thus added to its peat reserves for later extraction . Shortly thereafter , the applicant company commenced the extraction of QUANTITY of PERSON . At the relevant time the extraction was used mainly in the production of peat briquettes , whereas later on it was used for the purposes of peat - based growing media to be sold to professional growers and for hobby gardening .", "On DATE , the parties drew up an addendum to the leasing contract in which a sub - area was excluded and a new area included .", "The applicant company ceased its extraction activities at PERSON in DATE .", "In DATE , LAW ) was passed , subjecting the commercial extraction of raw materials to a permit .

At that time in GPE , CARDINAL raised bogs and an unspecified number of lowland bogs existed . The former were variously owned by the ORG , a natural protection foundation and private persons . The applicant company was the dominant producer of peat in GPE and the only producer of peat from raised bogs . Over DATE it had succeeded in acquiring rights to extract peat in most of the bogs suitable for extraction . The only other company which produced peat in GPE did so from an area which had lost its character as a bog and none of the owners of the remaining CARDINAL raised bogs had demonstrated any intention to extract peat .", "On DATE , ORG for GPE ( ORG for PERSON ) instituted a preservation procedure regarding PERSON , covering QUANTITY , under LAW ( PERSON ) .

In its decision , ORG attached decisive weight to the fact that the southern part of the area in question consisted of unspoiled raised bog , described as nationally unique , geologically as well as biologically . ORG was willing to grant permission , however , as regards the northern area of the bog , which contained PERCENT of the peat . Unlike the southern area , peat had been extracted in DATE in the northern area . Moreover , since the presence of a watercourse meant that there was no direct connection between the northern and southern parts of the bog , it was found that extraction of peat in the northern part would not cause irreparable damage to the bog area as a whole .", "The applicant company appealed against the decision to ORG ( PERSON ) and maintained that the granting of permission to extract peat solely from the northern part of the bog was of insignificant value to it , because only so - called darker peat could be and had been extracted from there . In order to exploit the peat commercially , however , the darker peat had to be mixed with socalled lighter peat , which was in short supply in general , but could be found in the southern part of the bog .", "On DATE ORG upheld the decision by ORG .", "On DATE ORG for PERSON amts sydlige fredningskreds ) issued a preservation order covering an area of QUANTITY of PERSON .

When the latter proved to be in vain , on DATE ORG upheld ORG decision to preserve the bog and to refrain from deciding on the applicant company \u2019s claim for compensation .", "As part of the friendly - settlement negotiations the applicant company was offered the right to extract sphagnum from an area of QUANTITY , which was part of a different State - owned bog called FAC . A lease to that effect was entered into in DATE . At the relevant time the applicant company therefore leased the majority of both ORG - owned and private areas where extraction of peat was possible .", "On DATE the applicant company appealed against ORG decision regarding compensation to ORG for Nature Preservation ( PERSON vedr\u00f8rende PERSON ) , which upheld it on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant company claimed compensation under section CARDINAL of the LAW ( Grundloven ) in the amount of at least DKK CARDINAL .", "On DATE the claim was dismissed by ORG , which found that the amendment to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW did not constitute expropriation of possessions belonging to the applicant company . It added :", "\u201c ... [ the applicant company ] may possibly have a claim for recovery of some of the rent payments which the company has been paying since DATE after deduction of the rent attributable to the area which , after reclamation , is being used for agricultural purposes and the area which is covered by the exemption .

The applicant company \u2019s compensation claim relied on CARDINAL legal bases , namely LAW as then applicable and LAW of the LAW .", "Before ORG , various witnesses were heard . In addition , CARDINAL experts were appointed , who confirmed that extraction solely of the darker peat from the northern area of PERSON was of insignificant value .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG found for the applicant company , stating as follows :", "\u201c The provision of section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW to the effect that alterations of the state of bogs may only be effected with the permission of ORG was inserted into LAW No . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , which entered into force on DATE .", "This provision meant that [ the applicant company ] was unable to exercise its extraction rights at PERSON without permission from ORG from DATE . This also applies even though the extraction rights of [ the applicant company ] had previously been notified in accordance with the rules of the legislation on raw materials and even though the preservation procedure had been instituted before the amending Act entered into force .", "The fact that [ the applicant company ] was already prevented from exercising its extraction rights when the preservation procedure was instituted on DATE can not lead to [ the applicant company \u2019s ] achieving a better position in the determination of possible compensation for preservation than if the preservation procedure had been instituted after DATE as the applicant company had not had the possibility in practice of initiating peat extraction in DATE prior to DATE .", "The provision in LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW must be considered an objectively motivated part of the regulation which has been implemented in view of the general interest in preserving ... the NORP wetlands . The provision applies to everybody and entails only a limited interference as regards [ the use of ] bogs in general .", "The [ applicant company ] , however , whose request for a permit to extract peat [ in PERSON ] had been refused in part , was affected in a substantial and atypically severe manner by the regulation , since the sole purpose of the company \u2019s lease of the bog had been to extract peat , which inevitably would result in a change of the state of the bog .", "On this basis , in relation to the [ applicant company ] , the legislation has the character of expropriation , for which reason compensation must be awarded in accordance with LAW of the LAW .", "The calculation of the amount of compensation takes as its starting point the report of DATE , produced by the managing director ... According to the information provided , since DATE the applicant company has extracted , processed and sold peat from other bogs in GPE as well as abroad , thereby being able to meet its market demands . The profit thus acquired is to be subtracted when determining the loss for which the [ applicant company ] may claim compensation . Having regard to the expert opinion , however , the compensation should not be reduced on account of the fact that the [ applicant company ] has obtained permission by ORG decision of DATE to extract the dark peat north of the stream in accordance .", "Taking all circumstances into account , the [ applicant company ] ... should be awarded compensation in the amount of DKK CARDINAL . \u201d", "On DATE , the ORG and ORG lodged an appeal against the judgment with ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) . The applicant company reiterated its claims and their legal bases , namely LAW as then applicable and LAW of the LAW . Various witnesses and experts were heard , including the applicant company \u2019s managing director , who stated , among other things , that extraction of peat in PERSON had ceased \u201c in CARDINAL \u201d .", "A report of DATE was also submitted , prepared by ORG on bogs in GPE , stating that in DATE raised bogs had covered QUANTITY , whereas in CARDINAL they had covered QUANTITY . CARDINAL examples of raised bogs QUANTITY remained , including PERSON .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG , by a majority of CARDINAL , overturned the judgment of ORG . ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c For the reasons stated by ORG , ORG endorses the finding that it was not the preservation , but the general prohibition in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW that was the reason why [ the applicant company ] was prevented from exercising its right to extract peat ( sphagnum ) from PERSON , and that the [ applicant company ] is therefore not entitled to compensation for preservation under the rules of LAW . \u201d", "Thereafter the majority of ORG ( CARDINAL judges ) found as follows :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , which took effect on DATE , entailed a general prohibition against changing the state of bogs . It follows from the preparatory works that the object of the provision was to introduce a regulation to protect the bogs as \u2018 a highly significant part of our freshwater wetlands\u2019 without having to pay compensation \u2013 see GPE CARDINAL - CARDINAL , Supplement A , p. CARDINAL , and Supplement B , p. CARDINAL .", "The prohibition resulted in [ the applicant company ] being unable as of DATE to exercise its rights of extraction in PERSON without the permission of ORG .", "ORG refusal of CARDINAL DATE to grant permission to continue peat extraction states , inter alia , that \u2018 the southern part of the area in question consists of unspoiled raised bog , which must be described as nationally unique , geologically as well as ORG . When on DATE ORG confirmed the decision , it stated , inter alia , that \u2018 PERSON is nationally of the greatest value in terms of nature preservation\u2019 .", "Whether or not the refusal can justify a claim for compensation for expropriation is to be determined on the basis of an overall assessment of the interference with [ the applicant company \u2019s ] right of extraction .", "The interference was motivated by significant nature and environmental interests . It was part of a general programme to preserve bogs and included a general restriction on the right to extract peat in GPE . This affected all manufacturers of sphagnum , and it has not been shown that [ the applicant company ] , which at the relevant time had not invested in production facilities for the purpose of exercising its extraction rights at PERSON , and which , moreover , had access to the extraction of considerable amounts of peat [ elsewhere ] in this country , was affected in a particularly severe manner .", "Against this background , we find no basis for awarding [ the applicant company ] compensation under LAW of the LAW . Accordingly , we vote in favour of the claims of ORG . \u201d", "The minority of ORG ( CARDINAL judges ) found as follows :", "\u201c It can be established as a fact that GPE has a shortage of sphagnum and that , owing to transportation costs , the import of sphagnum is significantly more expensive than extraction in GPE . On this basis , it can also be established as a fact that the sphagnum which could have been extracted in PERSON represented substantial value to [ the applicant company ] . This applies even though extraction had not commenced on DATE , when the prohibition in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW took effect . In addition , [ the applicant company ] was in an extraordinary situation as LAW allowed the company to extract peat from PERSON and the company had leased the area from the ORG for a period of DATE for this sole purpose . Thus , despite the fact that the prohibition in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW was justified by substantive preservation interests , we find , in concurrence with ORG , that in relation to [ the applicant company ] the legislative interference was to be regarded as expropriation and that , consequently , the [ applicant ] company is entitled to compensation under LAW of the LAW .", "Having regard to the expert opinions submitted before ORG , [ we find it established ] that since DATE [ the applicant company ] has only had limited opportunities for increasing its sale , as compared to its actual sale , at least until DATE . On the other hand , it must be taken into consideration that extraction in PERSON would have reduced the extraction \u2013 and thus increased the reserves \u2013 of peat at the company \u2019s other production sites in GPE . On this basis , and considering the reasons by ORG , compensation must be awarded on a discretionary basis , which we , like ORG , find should be set at DKK CARDINAL .", "Accordingly , ... we vote in favour of upholding the judgment of ORG . \u201d", "Finally , ORG ordered the applicant company to pay costs to ORG in the amount of DKK CARDINAL .", "With regard to the background of the case , it is important to be aware of the difference between lowland bogs , which are sustained by groundwater , and raised bogs , which are sustained exclusively by atmospheric precipitation . In both types of bog , peat is formed primarily from sphagnum , but the remaining flora , and thus also fauna , differs significantly , as raised bogs are nutrient - poor with high acidity .", "As a general rule , the peat in lowland bogs is dark brown with a high degree of decomposition of organic substances . This quality of peat is suitable for use as fuel , although less suitable for soil improvement and horticultural purposes ( referred to below as \u201c soil improvement \u201d as a single category ) .", "In raised bogs , apart from dark peat there is also light raised - bog peat which is suitable for soil improvement , but less suitable as fuel .", "The formation of a peat layer happens over a long period of time . A one- metre - thick layer of light raised - bog peat will form over a period of DATE . A similar layer of dark peat will typically form over a period of DATE .", "Subsequent to peat extraction , it will not be possible to regenerate the quantity of peat that has been removed through nature restoration , and extraction of peat can therefore not be considered to involve sustainable exploitation of natural resources .", "Originally , bogs took up such a big part of the area of GPE that it was considered beneficial to drain and cultivate bog areas . In DATE , land in GPE was so humid that peat had formed on PERCENT of the total area .", "During DATE and DATE a large area of the bogs was drained and cultivated . Furthermore , peat was extracted for use as fuel and , to a lesser extent , for bedding in livestock stables .", "The production of peat for fuel purposes increased rapidly during and just after the CARDINAL world wars , when imports of foreign fuel were limited .", "By DATE , the production of peat for fuel had almost ceased . The total NORP production of fuel peat was thus down to QUANTITY in DATE , whereas the DATE production on average over DATE had reached QUANTITY .", "The production of peat for soil improvement ( including horticultural purposes ) was insignificant until DATE , when it increased and reached QUANTITY DATE by DATE . In DATE , production increased slightly and currently amounts to QUANTITY DATE .", "There is no ongoing registration of the size of NORP bog areas , particularly in the case of raised bogs . A survey carried out in DATE showed that raised bogs , and bogs including areas of raised bog , constituted QUANTITY , or PERCENT of the total surface area of GPE .", "In recent statements under ORG ( GPE ) ORG , a total of QUANTITY , corresponding to PERCENT of the total area of GPE , has been classified under the habitat types \u201c active raised bogs \u201d ( No .

CARDINAL ) .", "Since bogs became a protected habitat type from DATE as a result of the entry into force of Act no . CARDINAL , no permits for extracting from , or any permits to otherwise alter raised - bog areas with natural vegetation have been issued . Until then , peat production took place in the significant areas of peat deposits , which , by DATE , had already lost the characteristics of bogs in their natural state .", "The area of raised bogs in their natural state has thus remained the same from DATE to the present day .", "The majority of the remaining raised bogs are small in area . Larger coherent areas of active raised bog ( areas of QUANTITY ) exist in CARDINAL places in GPE . PERSON is among these .", "Several bog areas are covered by preservation that interferes to a greater or lesser extent with the ORG options for use of the land .", "The possibility of protecting areas through specific rulings on nature preservation has been available in GPE since DATE .", "In DATE general protection of habitat types without compensation was introduced as regards the habitat types of lakes and public streams and in DATE the habitat types of private streams and bogs were added ( for further details as to the latter , see relevant domestic law and practice , chapter CARDINAL ) .", "In most NORP countries , bogs are endangered to about the same extent as in GPE . PERCENT of the original bog area is left .
