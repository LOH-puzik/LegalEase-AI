{"ITEMID": "001-79161", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "SMITH v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen born in DATE and resident in GPE . He is represented by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant was the Managing Director and controlling shareholder of ORG or ORG . At the time DEL was involved in the development of CARDINAL industrial units in GPE . According to the applicant , an oral agreement was reached in a meeting on DATE with PERSON from ORG to the effect that ORG would take over the funding of the development and that the applicant \u2019s personal borrowings and ORG \u2019s borrowings would be secured on the development and also by a mortgage on the applicant \u2019s home . According to the applicant , it was also agreed that the short term bridging loan would be replaced by long term mortgage finance once CARDINAL of the units had been let and CARDINAL had been sold . Transfers and debits of money , flowing from the agreement , were made on ORG \u2019s account . ORG in later proceedings denied the existence of any such oral agreement .", "ORG refused to provide long term financing and in DATE gave notice that they were calling in their loans . This led to protracted litigation in which the applicant was unsuccessful in his claims against ORG which gained possession of his home and , in DATE , made him bankrupt .", "In DATE the applicant traced Mr G , who allegedly disclosed the existence of contemporaneous notes of the meeting in DATE . These notes had never been disclosed in the various proceedings .", "On DATE and DATE , the applicant made application for access to the notes under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , claiming that he was a data subject and that personal data concerning him was either processed or part of a filing system within the meaning of that LAW .", "On DATE , ORG refused to order disclosure of the notes . Mr Justice PERSON noted that it was not in dispute that ORG held no computerised records relating to the applicant and that any such documents that might be retained were in the form of unstructured bundles kept in boxes . There were , it was accepted , some documents which at least mentioned the applicant within the bundles relating to ORG . The applicant \u2019s counsel had conceded that such files were not sufficiently structured to fall within the scope of \" relevant filing systems \" and the judge rejected arguments that sought to bring the notes within the scope of the LAW by reference to the fact that at one time they might have been subject to word processing or could be rendered into a structured form by means of scanning and processing , relying inter alia on indications in domestic and NORP materials that only filing systems , and not unstructured files , were intended to be covered by data protection The judge also considered that the notes did not concern \" personal data \" about the applicant . He cited case - law indicating that not all information retrieved from a search against an individual \u2019s name was personal data ; that mere mention of an individual \u2019s name in a document held by a data controller did not mean that the document contained personal data ; and that in determining whether information was capable of constituting personal data depended on its relevance or proximity to the data subject and that in answering that question it was relevant to consider whether the information was biographical in a significant sense , whether it had the putative data subject as its focus and finally whether the information affected the privacy of the putative data subject . Applying those principles , it was clear that the documents held by ORG and the information contained therein were not personal to the applicant in the relevant sense . The files related to the loans to ORG and the applicant was only mentioned because he acted on behalf of the company . The documents were not biographical about the applicant to a significant extent , dealing with the loan and its terms . Indeed what the applicant was trying to obtain were not documents about himself but documents dealing with the terms of an oral agreement under which ORG were to make GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL available to ORG .", "On DATE , ORG rejected his application for permission to appeal . Lady ORG also found that domestic and NORP legislation did not cover information held in unstructured files as opposed to a processing or filing system . She also rejected arguments that the data were personal to the applicant , noting that if the documents were covered it would mean that whenever an individual was involved in a transaction all the information about the transaction became his personal data . She further referred to judicially - expressed doubts that the LAW was an appropriate means of seeking to compel the disclosure of documents which could not be obtained in legal proceedings for the purpose of obtaining documents to use in legal proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
