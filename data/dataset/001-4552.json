THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , born in DATE , is a NORP citizen , currently residing in the GPE . The second applicant is his wife , PERSON , who was born on DATE and is a NORP citizen resident in ORG , GPE . The applicants are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a solicitor practising in ORG . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "A.", "", "The first applicant arrived in GPE on DATE . When he arrived , he had the status of a citizen of GPE and the Colonies ( PERSON ) by virtue of section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , because the GPE was a NORP colony at the time of his birth . He was given leave to enter as a work permit holder for a period of DATE . When the GPE became independent on CARDINAL DATE , he lost his ORG status and became a citizen of the GPE only . However , since the GPE remained in the ORG , he continued to hold the status of GPE citizen , which status he retains .", "", "The first applicant met the second applicant , who is NORP , in DATE . They started to live together as man and wife and on DATE their twin children , Roseanne and PERSON , were born . On DATE the couple married , and on DATE the first applicant was granted indefinite leave to remain in GPE .", "", "On DATE , the first applicant returned to the GPE to attend to family affairs due to his father \u2019s illness . On DATE he returned to GPE and on DATE he left for the GPE again . On DATE he returned to GPE and on DATE went back to the GPE .", "The first applicant then suffered a series of health and employment problems and found it difficult to save enough money for his flight back to GPE . He and his wife did , however , keep in contact , and he also kept in contact with his children . The first applicant \u2019s father died in DATE .", "On DATE , the first applicant arrived in GPE . The second applicant had come to meet him at the airport . The first applicant told the immigration officer who interviewed him that he sought admission as a visitor for DATE and that he intended to take employment on a farm owned by a friend . In addition , he told the immigration officer that he had a girlfriend in the GPE and to the customs officer he referred to that person as his \u201c wife \u201d . The immigration officer refused him leave to enter as a visitor because he was not satisfied that the first applicant intended to stay for the stated period since he had been unemployed in the GPE and he intended to work in GPE .", "Although the first applicant did not seek entry as a returning resident at the time , the immigration officer and the chief immigration officer who authorised the decision to refuse leave to enter considered his application on that basis and concluded that he did not qualify as a returning resident since he had not been resident in GPE within DATE . Moreover , according to ORG there was no evidence that there had been any intervening devotion between the applicant and his family in GPE . Arrangements were made for his removal on DATE .", "The first applicant applied to ORG for leave to apply for judicial review of the decision to refuse leave to enter . In the application the point was raised that he should be considered as someone having the right of abode in GPE under the Immigration Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . However , it was pointed out that under LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , as amended by LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , only a female GPE citizen who was married to a NORP citizen would have the right of abode and that a male commonwealth citizen who was married to a NORP citizen did not . In addition , it was said that given that the case involved issues arising under LAW in conjunction with LAW , the Secretary of ORG should have exercised his discretion in favour of protecting the relevant Convention rights .", "On DATE the court refused leave to apply for judicial review on the grounds that the Secretary of ORG had exercised his discretion properly .", "The first applicant made a renewed application for leave to apply for judicial review to ORG , raising the same points . On DATE ORG refused leave on the grounds that the facts of the case were not such as to suggest that the discretion should have been exercised in favour of the applicant and that the Secretary of ORG had acted lawfully since he had considered all material factors before him and had exercised his discretion reasonably . In connection with the argument that the Secretary of ORG had failed properly to exercise his discretion as he had not taken full account of LAW considerations , ORG referred to the case of ex parte PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) and a line of subsequent decisions , including NORP v. ORG ex parte ORG QB CARDINAL ) .", "The first applicant was deported to the GPE on DATE .", "", "B. Relevant domestic law", "DATE , section CARDINAL of LAW DATE was applicable .

LAW replaced the concept of \u201c citizenship of GPE and Colonies \u201d with various categories of citizenship , including \u201c NORP citizenship \u201d .
