The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a journalist . He was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the material time the applicant was working for ORG , an NORP periodical dealing mostly with politics . For DATE , he investigated into and reported on the case of PERSON PERSON , a former Vice - Chancellor and Minister of Finance , who was involved in certain criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Mr PERSON had been convicted by ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) of having made false statements as a witness on CARDINAL occasions . The court found that he had , before a parliamentary investigating committee ( LOC ) , wrongly stated that certain amounts of money had been put at his disposal by a Mr S. , whereas in fact they had been transferred from anonymous bank accounts operated by his wife and himself . Furthermore , in the context of criminal proceedings against financial officers charged with abuse of authority , Mr PERSON had stated that several anonymous accounts were held by a Mr S. , whereas in fact they were operated by his wife , his mother and himself .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) , sitting as a court of CARDINAL professional judges and CARDINAL lay judges ( ORG ) , conducted criminal proceedings against Mr Androsch concerning charges of tax evasion . It held hearings , inter alia , on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE Mr PERSON was convicted of having evaded taxes between CARDINAL and CARDINAL . He was sentenced to a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG had published a CARDINAL - page article written by the applicant , relating to the above proceedings . It read as follows :", "\u201c ADJOURNED FOR REFLECTION", "A criminal court sitting with lay judges spent DATE considering PERSON PERSON 's tax evasion . The atmosphere during the trial was glacial .", "\u2018 Above all , there were to be no mistakes during the proceedings . The case was to be handled with common prudence , properly and to the best of our knowledge and belief \u2013 but not with kid gloves!\u2019 ( Mr ORG , tax investigator and witness , when asked what principles had governed the hearing of the PERSON case . )", "On DATE before the trial [ the NORP newspaper ] ORG dropped the bombshell that was meant to shake all GPE . Lawyer PERSON was quoted as saying : \u2018 I \u2019m sure that PERSON will present his case in an impressive manner.\u2019", "The horizon was darkened by this impressive presentation and the earth shook as the accused worsened his lousy position by taking refuge in lapses of memory ( \u2018 I ca n't remember\u2019 \u2013 \u2018 I do n't have any detailed PERSON ) and by attempting to shift the blame onto others ( \u2018 I was represented by tax advisers in all those years\u2019 ) or by playing the animal that has been maltreated ( \u2018 There is not a single large - scale business in the whole of GPE that has been subjected for DATE to as many inspections as I have been\u2019 ) .", "PERSON biggest problem is PERSON . His second biggest problem is his lawyer , PERSON . Together , defending counsel and client are invincible . If blatant scorn could change the temperature , the courtroom would be covered by a thick layer of ice .", "The patient judge , PERSON , enquires , \u2018 So , what exactly happened?\u2019 The blas\u00e9 defendant replies , \u2018 I would ask you to infer exactly what happened from the file . You have the documents in front of you \u2013 I haven't.\u2019", "At another point PERSON said , with a disdainful gesture towards PERSON : \u2018 You , my dear Public Prosecutor ... \u2019 in a tone as if to say \u2018 You wretched worm!\u2019", "PERSON underestimates the judiciary . Once again . Judge PERSON knows the file inside out , as was clear from each of his questions . The public prosecutor , PERSON , is able to find his way around in the dark generated by the \u2018 international legal adviser's\u2019 murky financial deals , and , after all , the prosecuting authorities have been examining the flow of funds to and from PERSON for DATE .", "The accused mistook the excessively polite and markedly accommodating manner of the presiding judge for weakness . He has also known the public prosecutor for DATE and yet still does n't know him properly . PERSON speaks quietly and slowly so that one can follow what he says , and acts in a spectacularly unspectacular manner . Only the arrogant interpret his lack of grand gestures as cluelessness .", "Even the public prosecutor did make CARDINAL mistake , however , when he cited the judgment of ORG in the proceedings against PERSON for giving false evidence ( now concluded ) and referred to \u2018 long - term , ingenious and sophisticated linking of GPE . The alleged tax evasion was perhaps \u2018 long - term\u2019 but by no means \u2018 ingenious and sophisticated\u2019 .", "The opposite was true : anyone venturing into the maze of PERSON 's accounts containing undeclared money is amazed by the structure 's simplicity . It is not only wholly lacking in sophistication but is almost astoundingly crude . Crude not because PERSON lacked intelligence but rather because it was based on the cast - iron foundation of the misplaced loyalty of officials . While PERSON was Finance Minister , until DATE , he could rely on the zealous but unlawful obedience of a number of powerful officials . As soon as PERSON left , those officials had their hands full concealing their complicity in the cover - up . Admittedly , a whole string of other officials , by no means excessively brave but simply law - abiding , attempted again and again to ensure that the law prevailed . They foundered , however , on practicalities . The team led by the NORP tax investigator , PERSON ( DATE ) certainly gathered all the relevant details , but the head of CARDINAL of the GPE tax offices who had been in charge of the case for DATE issued a clean bill of health . And DATE , when they appeared as witnesses , the tax officials PERSON , ORG and PERSON , who reopened the file DATE , were treated by defending counsel PERSON as though they were the accused rather than PERSON .", "It has been known since DATE that PERSON evaded taxes . The legal proceedings which were adjourned on DATE furnished further proof that for DATE the accused escaped prosecution thanks to the zealous obedience of officials . When this was no longer possible as an independent judge was in charge of the investigations , PERSON 's advisers took every opportunity to delay the proceedings . It is both symptomatic and revealing that PERSON told the trial court again and again that \u2018 CARDINAL ORG had been carried out and on each occasion had found in his favour , and that it was very unfair that just the eighth inspection should shatter the ideal world of his illusory innocence . Everyone except him is to blame for this . PERSON has in the meantime become so completely immersed in the role of the innocent victim that he can not subjectively conceive of ever having been the guilty party .", "From an objective point of view , it should be pointed out in PERSON 's favour that there may be several people in GPE who in DATE ( from DATE ) have evaded CARDINAL QUANTITY in tax without , however , being subjected to such intensive publicity . On the other hand , no NORP Finance Minister has simultaneously operated CARDINAL accounts containing undeclared funds . And , as the public prosecutor put it , although the origin of part of the money had been established , QUANTITY were left from unknown sources .", "It was impious of PERSON to wheel out his \u2018 adoptive ORG again at the trial . Admittedly , he argued eloquently that the \u2018 adoptive ORG was actually an \u2018 adoptive ORG , but nonetheless the name of a dead person had been taken in vain . PERSON alarmingly implicated not only his \u2018 adoptive ORG Gustav PERSON but also his father - in - law PERSON in these financial proceedings . Both were induced to sacrifice themselves for PERSON and to assume a responsibility for undeclared funds and fiduciary relationships which they had never had . The investigating judge PERSON ORG and subsequently the tax authorities and other judges ( PERSON and later ORG ) proved long ago that PERSON was lying on this point . The flow of funds into and out of the CARDINAL accounts containing money not declared to the tax authorities allows of no other interpretation than that PERSON was evading taxes . His defence in court was disgraceful ; after so many years one would at least have expected properly constructed arguments . Each time Judge PERSON asked him a specific question he either took refuge in lapses of memory or blamed his \u2018 adoptive ORG . He even trotted out the late Sir PERSON , the explorer of FAC , from whom he claims to have received a legacy .", "No new submissions were made in court DATE either as regards the accounts containing undeclared money or as regards the funding for his villas . Anyone who had expected PERSON to tell all and , as announced in the newspapers , to reveal new facts and adduce convincing arguments in his defence was bitterly disappointed . Only in respect of the charges of \u2018 covert distribution of ORG was there any legal skirmishing .", "Mr ORG told the court that PERSON was a \u2018 victim of PERSON . \u2018 ORG had been ORG against PERSON and his client had always had \u2018 opponents who had gone as far as attempting to destroy PERSON psychologically and physically\u2019 .", "PERSON and others were to blame for this .", "The court kept trying very gently to bring the defendant back down to LOC from his long - winded waffling . And each time he replied \u2018 I ca n't say . After all , I do have other things to do\u2019 ( i.e. than grapple with such stupid questions ) .", "If necessary , the authorities can always be blamed for everything . In the instant case this clich\u00e9 clearly did not apply to Judge PERSON . For TIME he demonstrated drawing - room justice at its best . The judge forced himself to be polite even when he was clearly irritated by the defendant 's bored self - assurance . On DATE of the trial an area of psychological tension built up which the former Minister clearly misinterpreted . From time to time the DATE slipped into the role of a public speaker talking politics . He paid less and less attention to the judge 's questions and treated the public prosecutor with increasingly provocative contempt . He turned to look more and more often at the public in the gallery , seeking approval , and his gestures increasingly reminded one of the self - satisfied , powerful Vice - Chancellor and Finance Minister accustomed to victory .", "In those circumstances serious tactical errors were made . Defence counsel interrupted the judge and PERSON succumbed to his own charm . He talked and talked , a volubility that the ORG mistook for \u2018 brilliant rhetoric\u2019 . In reality the defendant was distancing himself as much as possible from his own responsibility .", "Others were to blame .", "Judge PERSON did not lose control of the situation for a second , however . From time to time , as was apparent from his posture , he had a sharp word on the tip of his tongue , but he never actually uttered it .", "The defendant sensed weakness and made full use of his own \u2013 supposed \u2013 strength ; he forged a link with the public while severing the one with the court .", "Judge PERSON had prepared for this trial keenly and diligently . By citing facts he kept forcing PERSON into corners from which he could only escape by taking refuge in memory lapses .", "In many major trials the sinner has been given a fair chance to DATE . PERSON too had a fair chance DATE ; of CARDINAL defence motions , CARDINAL were dismissed and CARDINAL allowed . The court admitted evidence as to whether in the tax proceedings against PERSON any unlawful influence had been exerted or instructions issued which adversely affected the taxpayer . In the next stage of trial , in DATE or DATE ( the court even took account of defence counsel 's DATE ! ) , officials from ORG and ORG will therefore be heard as witnesses .", "There comes , however , a point in every trial after which the court expects some sign of understanding . It hopes for a trace of humility that may be appraised as a mitigating circumstance .", "The defendant has shown no humility to date , not even for a second . But he now has DATE to consider whether it is consonant with the principles of a ORG based on the rule of law for a Finance Minister and his family to have at their disposal accounts containing CARDINAL in undeclared funds .", "It is now for him to display greatness . The judicial system has uncovered serious matters . The court nevertheless was guided wholly by the principles of fairness up to the very last moment of the trial DATE , when it adjourned the proceedings .", "For reflection . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was charged under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Mediengesetz \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for having exercised prohibited influence on criminal proceedings ( verbotene PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting with CARDINAL judge ( Einzelrichter ) , acquitted the applicant . It found that the text in issue was not capable of influencing the outcome of the proceedings against Mr PERSON and that it was not established that the applicant had acted with such an intention .", "CARDINAL . The court recalled that in DATE Mr PERSON had been convicted of tax evasion ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In establishing whether the impugned article was capable of influencing the result of these proceedings , the court noted that the wording and content of the article as a whole , as well as the development of the proceedings reported upon , the person of the accused , and the person of the applicant had to be taken into account . The article , unlike court reports of the scandal press , analysed the conduct of the presiding judge , the public prosecutor , defence counsel and in particular the accused , Mr PERSON , almost as a psychologist would have done .", "Furthermore , the court found that it was clear for every reader , who was vaguely familiar with the issue , that the applicant , who had been working for ORG for DATE , had intensively dealt with the so - called \u201c Causa Androsch \u201d and had frequently reported on it . It appeared from the article that the applicant assumed that the investigations carried out by the tax authorities were correct . He subjected the statements made by the accused at the trial to a critical psychological analysis . However , his way of writing and the wording used were not capable of influencing these proceedings . Even to a lay judge , the applicant 's person and his activities as a journalist in the PERSON case were well known . Thus he would not expect the applicant to give a neutral account of the proceedings .", "Moreover , it had not been established that the applicant had acted with the intention of influencing the outcome of the proceedings , in particular as it appeared that he was convinced that Mr Androsch would in any event be convicted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a court of CARDINAL professional judges on an appeal by the public prosecutor , held a hearing in the presence of the applicant and his counsel . Mr PERSON was questioned and stated in particular that the first sentence of the incriminated passage , namely that \u201c the flow of funds into and out of the CARDINAL accounts containing money not declared to the tax authorities allows of no other interpretation than that PERSON was evading taxes \u201d , was a quotation from the public prosecutor 's statement during the trial . The latter had also frequently made reference to PERSON PERSON 's conviction for having made false statements as a witness ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the hearing , the operative provisions of the judgment as well as the relevant reasons were read out . The court convicted the applicant of having exercised prohibited influence on criminal proceedings and imposed on him DATE - fines of ORG CARDINAL each , that is ORG CARDINAL , or DATE imprisonment in default of payment . The publishing firm was made jointly and severally liable for payment of the fine .", "CARDINAL . The full text of the judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court held , inter alia :", "\u201c The prosecution appeal is therefore well - founded . It rightly takes as its starting - point that the offence defined in section CARDINAL of LAW must be classified as a potentially endangering offence [ abstraktes ORG ] \u2026", "In general , a potentially endangering offence is defined as conduct typically capable of bringing a dangerous situation into existence , even if in any given case no one is actually exposed to the danger concerned ...", "The law regulates only the offender 's conduct \u2013 in this case comment on the value of evidence \u2013 and links to it the inference that such comment is also capable of influencing the outcome of criminal proceedings . A potentially endangering offence accordingly amounts to conduct which is criminal irrespective of any result it may have [ schlichtes ORG ] ...", "The considerations set out in the judgment at first instance as to the extent to which the comment on Mr PERSON 's defence was capable of influencing the outcome of the criminal proceedings were therefore pointless ...", "The defendant 's replies under examination in criminal proceedings constitute evidence ...", "[ The passage in issue ] constitutes ( unfavourable ) comment on the value of the answers given by PERSON PERSON , not just \u2013 as the court below held \u2013 a critical psychological analysis ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . It observed that \u201c the objective element of the offence defined in section CARDINAL of LAW is constituted not only by unfavourable comment on evidence but also by favourable comment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG also contested ORG assumption that everybody , including the lay judges , knew the applicant 's long - standing commitment in the PERSON case and would therefore not be influenced by his article . It was in no way certain that the lay judges regularly read ORG . On the contrary , in spectacular proceedings like the ones in issue , it happened frequently that lay judges would follow the reports in papers they did not usually read . There was no doubt that , at least with regard to the lay judges , the reading of the incriminated article was capable of influencing the outcome of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The court added :", "\u201c [ The above finding ] is all the more true in the present case because it can be inferred from the article that the accused wished to usurp the position of the judges dealing with the case .", "The objective element of the offence defined in section CARDINAL of LAW is accordingly made out .", "As regards the subjective element , it should be observed that it is hard to understand why the court below should have concluded that there was no intention to influence the outcome of the trial when that intention was , on the contrary , quite obvious . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The court further found that the applicant 's expertise and involvement in the subject matter rather reinforced the impression that he had written the article with the intention of influencing the outcome of the proceedings . He had researched into the case DATE and had written CARDINAL articles about it . From the beginning he had been convinced that Mr PERSON had committed tax evasion . In the article in issue he had not only criticised Mr PERSON 's statement but had also anticipated the outcome of the proceedings , namely the conviction of the accused .", "CARDINAL . The judgment ended as follows :", "\u201c Even the quotation of the answer given by Mr ORG placed at the top of the article \u2013 \u2018 Above all , there were to be no mistakes during the proceedings . The case was to be handled with common prudence , properly and to the best of our knowledge and belief \u2013 but not with kid gloves!\u2019 CARDINAL gives the average reader the impression that the court was being advised and urged to follow the same approach , in other words not to make any mistakes and not to handle Mr Androsch with kid gloves . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
