SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Mr J. S\u00f6dergren , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr B. GPE , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE the applicant has been a member of ORG ( PERSON arbetsl\u00f6shetskassa ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , for some unknown reason , the applicant either did not qualify for unemployment benefit or ceased to qualify for it . Accordingly , in order to discuss different employment programmes , the applicant had a meeting with his unemployment officer at ORG ( ORG ) . The unemployment officer informed the applicant that by virtue of a \u201c re - qualification \u201d option set out in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( NORP om arbetsl\u00f6shetsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the applicant could re - qualify for DATE of unemployment benefit if he worked as a trainee for the municipality for TIME per month for \u201c QUANTITY calendar DATE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the applicant signed a contract and on DATE began work as a trainee for the municipality at a plant for recycling electronic devices . The contract stipulated that the training programme was to end on DATE . During this period it appears that the applicant was paid by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG passed a law ( no . PERSON ) which amended section CARDINAL of LAW , thereby abolishing the re - qualification option through trainee work . The law entered into force on DATE , that is , DATE before the applicant \u2019s training programme was scheduled to end , and had the effect that in future only conventional employment could re - qualify for a further unemployment benefit period .", "CARDINAL . The applicant maintained that during DATE , when he became aware of the amendment to LAW , he tried several times in vain to contact his officer at ORG and ORG , because if the amendment were applied strictly and formally , he would be disqualified from a further period of unemployment benefit . Thus he wanted the finishing date of his trainee work contract , namely DATE , to be brought forward , since in his view , in accordance with the provisions of the original section CARDINAL of LAW , he would have fulfilled the requirement of working TIME per month for \u201c DATE \u201d by DATE .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant had concluded the training programme , he requested a further period of unemployment benefit . His request was refused by ORG on DATE , and again on DATE , because he did not fulfil the criteria set out in section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) in GPE . On DATE his request for an oral hearing in order to hear evidence from the officials at ORG and ORG was refused .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG found against the applicant . It reiterated that , under the transitional provisions of the amendment to LAW , only a training programme completed by DATE could qualify for a further unemployment benefit period . The applicant had completed his trainee work on DATE , thus his situation was not covered by the transitional provisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a further appeal , ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE granted the applicant leave to appeal against the first - instance judgment . The appellate court also requested an opinion from ORG ( ORG f\u00f6r arbetsl\u00f6shetsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring )", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant requested an oral hearing before ORG . He stated that he wanted to hear the head of ORG as regards the date on which the ORG had become aware of the amendment to LAW and its implications . He also wanted to ask him certain questions of a complex nature , for instance whether it would be considered a breach of official duty if an official of the ORG had advance knowledge of legislative amendments but refused to inform a member of the ORG thereof . By a decision of DATE , the court found an oral hearing unnecessary and refused the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made further submissions in writing , including a request for compensation for loss of income caused by the unpredictable decision of ORG to amend the legislation .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG , stating as follows :", "\u201c Firstly , [ the applicant \u2019s ] request for compensation for loss of income must be considered as a claim for damages . As it is not for ORG to examine such a claim , the applicant \u2019s request in this respect is refused .", "The question in the case is how section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW \u2013 [ the requirement ] that the individual must have participated in and , unless hindered by special reasons , completed vocational training mentioned therein \u2013 should be understood . Due to the ambiguity of the notion carried out previously used , the notion completed was chosen to clarify that , in addition to having participated in a training programme , it was a condition that such programme be finished . The purpose of the provision was to prevent that an insured person , when he had participated for a sufficiently long period of time , would be able to cut short the programme in order to obtain unemployment benefit instead ( Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , annex CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . In these circumstances , and since the transitional provision of the amendment which entered into force on DATE unambiguously states that the conditions in section CARDINAL of LAW must have been fulfilled at the date of the entry into force , ORG finds that the appeal must be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A request by the applicant for leave to appeal to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Before the amendments introduced by law no . PERSON , section CARDINAL of LAW stipulated that , in order to become eligible for unemployment benefit , the insured had to \u201c have had gainful employment for DATE and carried out work for TIME per calendar DATE \u201d over a period of DATE immediately prior to the date of unemployment . Section CARDINAL of the Act , entitled \u201c re - qualification requirement \u201d , stipulated that time during which the insured had participated in and completed \u2013 unless hindered by special reasons \u2013 vocational training was equal to \u201c gainful employment \u201d ( as set out in section CARDINAL of the Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The amendments introduced by law no . PERSON abolished the re - qualification option set out in section DATE , which had the effect that trainee work could no longer be considered equal to \u201c gainful employment \u201d unless completed by DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under the transitional provisions , employment programmes which previously re - qualified for a further unemployment benefit period would continue to qualify , if they had been completed by the time the amending law entered into force , and if a request for unemployment benefit had been submitted DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
