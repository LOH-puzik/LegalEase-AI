The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , who had been diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma , underwent mastectomy of her left breast .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant began to experience pain in the left side of her chest , for which in DATE she underwent a bone scintigraphy . The scintigraphy found a pathological uptake of radioactive tracer in her sixth left rib . Another bone scintigraphy in DATE confirmed that finding . However , a computerised axial tomography scan carried out later in DATE showed a suspected metastasis in the area of DATE left ribs rather than the sixth one . The doctor who performed the scan recommended a further bone scintigraphy . CARDINAL such scintigraphies , in DATE and in DATE , showed the same findings as DATE . A radiography in DATE showed a suspected pathological lesion in the sixth left rib . But a second computerised axial tomography scan later in DATE found again that the suspected metastasis was in the area of DATE left ribs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL medical doctors decided that the suspected metastasis was to be surgically removed .", "CARDINAL . Worried that the exact location of the suspected metastasis had not been fully established , the applicant asked the surgeon who was to operate on her , PERSON , whether further tests were required before the operation . According to the applicant , he told her that the available imaging results were sufficient and that he would be able to identify the metastasis once he had opened up her thorax . The applicant then approached the medical doctor who had performed the mastectomy in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He told her that the suspected metastasis was very small , could not be localised visually , and had to be precisely localised before any surgery . The applicant shared her misgivings in that respect with PERSON and reiterated her request for further tests before the operation . However , he reassured her that the available imaging results were sufficient .", "CARDINAL . Having assented to the operation by signing an informed consent form , the applicant underwent surgery on DATE . In the course of that surgery PERSON removed fragments of her fourth and fifth left ribs , rather than her sixth , eighth or ninth left ribs . However , the operation report erroneously said that he had removed fragments of the eighth and ninth ribs . When talking to the applicant DATE , PERSON likewise told her that he had removed fragments of those ribs , and that he had inspected her lungs .", "CARDINAL . The removed rib fragments were sent for histological testing , the results of which were ready on DATE and showed that they did not contain cancerous tissue .", "CARDINAL . When seeing her hospitalisation report upon her discharge from hospital on DATE , the applicant was surprised to find that her sixth left rib had been left in place and that , instead , fragments of her fourth and fifth left ribs , where no lesions had been detected by the scans and where no cancerous tissue was present according to the histological tests , had been removed . She approached PERSON , who denied having made a mistake but agreed to prescribe a further bone scintigraphy , which was carried out in DATE and found an increased uptake of radioactive tracer in the sixth left rib and also in DATE left ribs . A computerised axial tomography scan carried out DATE found that parts of DATE left ribs had been removed and that the sixth left rib was fractured .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked PERSON to explain all that , and he apparently again denied having made any mistake .", "CARDINAL . For DATE after the operation , the applicant was undergoing radiotherapy and hormonal therapy .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant complained about the operation to ORG . The Ministry ordered ORG to carry out an inquiry and , based on its findings , on DATE informed the applicant that in view of the inconclusive results of the medical imaging tests , the operating team had chosen to make a wide opening in the thorax , enabling them to inspect the left side of the thoracic wall from the fourth to the ninth ribs . They had decided to remove parts of the fourth and fifth ribs because they had observed macroscopic changes on them ; they had not found pathological changes in the sixth rib . The reference to the eighth and ninth ribs in the operation report had been a clerical mistake .", "CARDINAL . NORP The results of the inquiry , coupled with a complaint filed by the applicant with the hospital , prompted the hospital \u2019s ethical commission to review the case . It did not find any misconduct on the part of PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a claim for damages against Dr PERSON and the hospital in which he was employed , a ORG - owned limited liability company . She alleged that he had ( a ) erroneously removed parts of CARDINAL healthy ribs , the fourth and the fifth on the left , without having obtained her consent ; ( b ) inspected her lungs , which had been unnecessary and unjustified ; ( c ) fractured her sixth left rib ; and ( d ) failed to remove the metastasis , which had been the very purpose of the operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG admitted a number of medical documents , including the consent form signed by the applicant before the operation . At the request of the applicant , the court ordered an expert report , to be drawn up by an oncologist , nominated by the applicant , a thoracic surgeon , nominated by PERSON , and a radiologist , nominated by the court , on a number of points raised by counsel for the applicant . At the request of PERSON , the court ordered a second expert report , to be drawn up by another thoracic surgeon .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court appointed a new oncologist because the CARDINAL initially chosen had declined the task , ordered the applicant to present herself for examination by the experts , admitted her medical files , and heard as witnesses a surgeon who had taken part in the operation alongside Dr GPE and another surgeon who had monitored the applicant in the hospital after the operation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The CARDINAL expert reports were filed in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report drawn up by the CARDINAL experts described the different methods for detecting bone metastases , including bone scintigraphy , emphasising that their results had to be assessed cumulatively ; said that when operating on cancer patients it was mandatory to inspect adjoining organs by palpation ; described the extent , in their view limited , to which the removal of parts of DATE left ribs had affected the applicant \u2019s body movements ; said that rib fractures were almost inevitable and very frequent in thoracotomies ; said that the main principle when operating on cancer patients was that all decisions were to be made by the entire team ; and opined that it would be possible to operate on the applicant again , should the need arise .", "CARDINAL . The thoracic surgeon \u2019s report said that the operating team had not erred from a medical point of view when carrying out the operation , and that the applicant \u2019s prognosis and quality of life would have been much worse had the operation not taken place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court heard the CARDINAL experts , including their answers to questions put by counsel for the applicant . The experts stood by their conclusions . The court then reserved judgment . However , on DATE the court , finding that the applicant had not specified whether her preferred defendant was PERSON or the hospital , reopened the proceedings and instructed her to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court asked the thoracic surgeon to deal with additional questions . He filed his supplementary report in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court admitted further written evidence and heard CARDINAL witnesses called by the applicant . At the request of counsel for the applicant , it disqualified the thoracic surgeon on the basis that he was employed by the defendant hospital ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court then appointed a new expert .", "CARDINAL . In his report the new expert , a thoracic surgeon from GPE , said that the operating team had not breached good medical practice by removing parts of the applicant \u2019s fourth and fifth left ribs based on their visual and tactile inspection in the course of the operation , bearing in mind that histological testing of bone tissue required time and therefore no histological conclusion could be obtained during the operation ; that they had correctly inspected the applicant \u2019s lungs by palpation ; that rib fractures in the course of such operations were almost inevitable ; that the removal of the rib fragments had not unduly affected the applicant because they had later partly regenerated ; and that it could not be categorically said that the applicant had a metastasis in her sixth rib , especially bearing in mind that no further metastases had been detected for DATE after the operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court heard the new expert , including his answers to questions put by counsel for the applicant . He explained in detail why he stood by his conclusions . Counsel for the applicant requested a further expert report on the need for the operation . The court turned down the request on the basis that it went beyond the scope of the case .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It referred to the conclusions of the experts but said that it would not take into account the reports drawn up by the expert who had been disqualified ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) . Based on those conclusions , the court found that the precise location of the suspected metastasis had not been fully established before the operation . It went on to say that the allegation that PERSON had removed parts of the applicant \u2019s fourth and fifth left ribs without her consent was baseless , since the written consent form that she had signed before the operation , following an explanation on the proposed procedure , had not specified the rib to be operated upon . The court further held , with reference to the expert opinions , that PERSON had not erred by removing parts of DATE left ribs , as he had observed on them tissue which he had suspected to be cancerous . The fact that the histological test had later showed otherwise had not retrospectively rendered his assessment flawed . Nor had he erred by inspecting the applicant \u2019s lungs by palpation \u2013 that was standard practice in that type of operation . Furthermore , the evidence did not categorically prove that the applicant still had a metastasis in her sixth left rib , especially bearing in mind the lack of other metastases after the operation . In particular , the experts were agreed that the medical imaging results submitted by the applicant could not be conclusive on that point in the absence of a fresh histological test . Lastly , the court found that it had not been proved that the applicant \u2019s sixth rib had been fractured in the course of the operation and that , in any event , such a fracture was a habitual risk in that sort of operation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of counsel for the applicant , the court instructed the replacement thoracic surgeon who had acted as expert in the proceedings before the lower court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to draw up a supplementary report in which to address several points raised in the appeal . Counsel for the applicant also requested a fresh expert report , to be drawn up by CARDINAL thoracic surgical oncologists . They asked that CARDINAL of those be PERSON for PERSON opposed the request , arguing that Dr V.T. would be biased in favour of the applicant because he had known her for DATE . The court did not order the report .", "CARDINAL . The thoracic surgeon \u2019s supplementary report said that the applicant had correctly been subjected to surgery ; that the operating team had not erred by acting on the basis of the visual and tactile findings made in the course of the operation , especially bearing in mind the uncertain results of the prior medical imaging tests ; that there was no universally reliable method to establish the presence of bone metastases ; that it had been impossible to mark the precise spot of the suspected metastasis before the operation ; and that PERSON had had the requisite qualifications to operate on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court admitted the report and heard the thoracic surgeon . The applicant submitted a private expert opinion which said that the removal of parts of her fourth and fifth left ribs had been needless and erroneous . This opinion could not be admitted because it had not been drawn up by court - appointed experts . The applicant however reiterated her earlier request for a fresh expert report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and the court acceded to it , appointing as experts CARDINAL thoracic surgeons , CARDINAL of whom was PERSON , and a thoracic surgical oncologist , all from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The experts were divided . PERSON , who filed a minority report , was of the view that the operation had not been necessary and had been carelessly carried out , with the removal of parts of CARDINAL healthy ribs . The other CARDINAL experts expressed the same views as those set out in the thoracic surgeon \u2019s supplementary report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and came to the conclusion that the operation had been required and that the operating team had not acted out of line with good medical practice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court admitted the reports and heard the CARDINAL experts , who each stood by the views expressed in their respective reports . On DATE it admitted further written evidence and heard the parties\u2019 oral argument .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It said that it credited all expert opinions save that of the expert disqualified in the proceedings before the lower court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) and that of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which went against the remainder of the evidence . It went on to hold , by reference to the other experts\u2019 conclusions , that the operation had been necessary , and that by removing parts of the applicant \u2019s fourth and fifth left ribs on the basis of a visual and tactile examination PERSON had acted in line with established medical practice , even though it had later transpired that they did not contain cancerous tissue . The court came to the same conclusions as the lower court with respect to the inspection of the applicant \u2019s lungs by palpation , the alleged fracture of her sixth rib , and the question whether it had been proved that she had cancer after the operation ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On that basis , the court held that the medical team which had operated on the applicant had not acted negligently and that it had not been categorically established that the applicant had suffered damage as a result of their actions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , ORG , I \u0433. \u043e. ) , ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and remitted the case . It held that that court had failed duly to elucidate the facts and in particular to take on an active role in the formulation of the questions to the experts . It had thus not fully clarified whether it had been necessary to operate on the applicant , whether her sixth left rib had been fractured in the course of the operation , and why it had been necessary to remove parts of her fourth and fifth left ribs . It had likewise failed to explain fully why it had disregarded PERSON opinion ; simply saying that it went against the rest of the evidence was not enough . On remittal , the lower court had to re - visit these points by taking into account the history of the applicant \u2019s medical condition , and inquire into the need for the operation , the presence of metastases in her ribs , and the alleged worsening of her health after the operation . In so doing , it had to obtain a fresh medical expert report and enable the parties to take part in the formulation of the questions to the experts .", "CARDINAL . On remittal , ORG ordered a fresh expert report , to be drawn up by CARDINAL thoracic surgeons from GPE and a medical imaging specialist from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The report said that it had been imperative to carry out the operation ; that the fracture of the sixth rib had been there before the operation and had been due to the rib \u2019s heightened fragility resulting from previous anti - cancer treatment ; that the removal of parts of the fourth and fifth ribs had not been an error in view of the inconclusive prior medical imaging data , which had its limitations , and the visual observation of tissue that could at the time have been suspected to be cancerous ; that there was no categorical medical data proving the presence of a metastasis in the sixth rib before or after the operation \u2013 the bone scintigraphies had only showed an increased uptake of radioactive tracer there \u2013 in spite of the medical treatment undergone by the applicant after the operation ; that the applicant could be operated upon again , should the need arise ; and that the applicant \u2019s medical condition would have been much worse had she indeed had an untreated metastasis in her sixth , eighth or ninth rib for DATE after the operation .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the court admitted the report and heard the CARDINAL experts , including their replies to questions posed by counsel for the applicant . The experts stood by their conclusions . The court also admitted other evidence submitted by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It held , by reference to the reports of the CARDINAL experts that it had appointed , the CARDINAL experts appointed in the proceedings before the lower court , and CARDINAL of the experts appointed in the first appeal proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) , that the operation had been required . It said that it could not follow the opinion of PERSON on this point ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) because , even though the question whether it had been advisable to operate in such circumstances could be debated theoretically , the medical team treating the applicant had been faced with an exigently practical situation : the medical imaging tests had showed the presence of a suspected isolated tumour whose exact location was uncertain , and there had been for this reason only one course of action : localise the tumour using the methods of surgical diagnostics and immediately remove it . The court agreed with the experts\u2019 conclusions that the operating team had not erred by removing parts of the applicant \u2019s fourth and fifth ribs on the basis of their suspicion that they contained cancerous tissue , even though that had turned out not to be the case . The mention of the eighth and ninth ribs in the operation report had been a clerical mistake without incidence for the applicant \u2019s health . Again by reference to the experts\u2019 conclusions , the court fully agreed with the lower court \u2019s findings with respect to the inspection of the applicant \u2019s lungs by palpation , and held that it had not been proved that her sixth rib had been fractured in the course of the operation , or that a metastasis in that rib had erroneously not been removed . On that basis , it concluded that PERSON had not acted negligently .", "CARDINAL . The applicant again attempted to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL .
