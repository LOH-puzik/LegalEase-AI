The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in Wodzis\u0142aw .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a local branch of ORG published a political leaflet entitled \u201c Wodzis\u0142awianin \u201d , which contained a following note , written by the applicant :", "\u201c The inhabitants of Wodzis\u0142aw wonder why the lists of the local election commissions [ for the coming DATE presidential election ] have not been made public in the city hall , as used to be the case .", "We have the answer to this question : the composition of CARDINAL election committees was determined in a secret vote held by the [ ORG , and the councillors elected themselves to hold posts [ in these commissions ] . CARDINAL persons [ who were not members of the ORG ] were not elected , including CARDINAL representatives of the lower councils , CARDINAL women [ ... ] who are all respectable citizens .", "The payment for the work in the election commission is PLZ CARDINAL , which is equivalent to CARDINAL of [ unemployment benefit ] , ...", "Inhabitants of Wodzis\u0142aw ! When you go to the polls , remember that the election committee No . CARDINAL in P. will be composed of , among others , Mr [ ... ] and Mr PERSON , which means that [ by receiving their payment ] they would take away from you QUANTITY of coal for DATE , while at the same time they obtain CARDINAL to MONEY of the average national salary as remuneration for their work as councillors of ORG . [ ... ] \u201d", "CARDINAL . A list of other municipal councillors who would participate in the election committees followed , each name accompanied by a designation of certain goods , such as CARDINAL loaves of bread or CARDINAL bus tickets , worth PLZ CARDINAL at that time , which , according to the leaflet , they would thus \u201c take away \u201d from the reader .", "CARDINAL . The note went on to say :", "\u201c Remember ! You could have received this money yourself . That money is to be paid from taxes you have paid .", "The municipal councillors , whom you elected , are poor and concerned , above all , about their own interest and that of their families .", "You , as a lesser member of the local society , should be thankful that your councillor has informed you about the possibility of earning additional income , that he elected himself to the local election committee , that he put his power to a legitimate use in the interest of the community , and that he thereby revealed the truth about himself \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently PERSON lodged with ORG a private bill of indictment against the applicant , complaining that the leaflet was defamatory .", "CARDINAL . At the first hearing , held on DATE , PERSON expressed willingness to settle the case , but the applicant declined to do so . At the hearing on DATE the plaintiff again proposed to settle the matter amicably . The applicant refused .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing the court heard statements from the applicant and the plaintiff . The applicant refused to acknowledge that by publishing the impugned statements he had committed an offence . When interviewed by the court , he confirmed that he had written the contested text .", "CARDINAL . The court examined as witnesses requested by the prosecution a saleswoman from the kiosk where the applicant had left the leaflets to be taken by its clients and PERSON , a journalist who had written an article about the way in which the public had reacted to the leaflet .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested the court to admit in evidence the testimony of GPE as to the contents of the impugned leaflet . He also asked the court to take into consideration CARDINAL articles about the leaflet and the public reaction to it , one published in \u201c ORG \u201d and another one in \u201c S\u0142owo Ludu \u201d , written by ORG also requested that PERSON be heard as a witness to prove that the leaflet had not been understood as amounting to an accusation of theft against PERSON The court allowed his requests in respect of the articles , but declined to call the witnesses requested by the applicant , considering that their evidence would relate to the contents of the leaflet which had already been included in the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of disseminating untruthful information about PERSON in order to denigrate him and to lower him in the public esteem necessary for his function as a municipal councillor , i.e. the offence of libel , punishable under LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court established that PERSON , a headmaster of a public school in P. , had been a municipal councillor in PERSON for DATE . Until DATE he had been the president of ORG . During the presidential election in DATE he had been a member of the election commission in P.", "CARDINAL . In DATE the local branch of ORG , of which the applicant was a member , had published a leaflet co - authored by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The judgment further read :", "\u201c In this leaflet addressed to the inhabitants of Wodzis\u0142aw , the authors stated , among other things , that ' [ ... ] and PERSON would take away from you CARDINAL , QUANTITY of coal for DATE , that the councillors were ' poor and concerned , above all , about their own interest and that of their families ' , that they had ' elected themselves to the local elections committees ' , that they ' put their power to a legitimate use in the interest of the community ' .", "The court considered the following :", "The plaintiff had stated that , in his opinion , the leaflet was slanderous . It implied that he intended to commit theft , that when receiving remuneration for his participation in the election committee he had been acting out of base motives and that he had been using the function of councillor for his personal enrichment . The community of Wodzis\u0142aw understood the leaflet in a similar manner , as had been shown by the testimony given by PERSON", "The court , when assessing the statements in the leaflet , shared the opinion of the plaintiff and of the local community that it amounted to slander . The statements that the councillors had ' elected themselves to the local elections committee ' and that they were ' concerned , above all , about their own interest and that of their families ' related also to the plaintiff .", "It is not open to any doubt that the defendant distributed the leaflet ; he admitted he had . Moreover , K.B. [ when giving evidence ] stated that the defendant had personally brought it to the editorial office of ' S\u0142owo Ludu ' . Despite the fact that CARDINAL copies of the leaflet had been printed , the defendant envisaged that that they would have more readers , as shown by the phrase contained therein : ' If you have read it , pass it on ' .", "Dissemination of information of this kind was , in the court 's view , degrading for the plaintiff ; the accused , when publishing it , had an intention to denigrate the plaintiff ; by distributing it he lowered the plaintiff in public esteem , necessary for him to carry out his work as a councillor . This demonstrates the seriousness of his offence , which must therefore be qualified as slander punishable under LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court imposed on the applicant a fine of ORG MONEY with DATE and DATE imprisonment in default , ordered him to pay ORG MONEY to a local hospital and a further PLN CARDINAL to PERSON and to pay the court costs to the ORG in the amount of PLN CARDINAL . The court further ruled that the operative part of the judgment should be published in the local DATE newspaper . When determining the fine , the court had regard to the fact that the applicant 's financial situation was \u201c very good . His DATE income from his shop was ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL , his wife 's DATE salary was PLN CARDINAL , and he also owned a farm of QUANTITY \u201d . Therefore the sentence imposed on him under LAW read together with LAW was appropriate to the applicant 's situation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . He argued that the court had wrongly established the relevant facts in that it considered that his intention had been to insult PERSON , while he had been acting out of concern for the public interest . It was further argued that the court had wrongly considered credible only the evidence called for the plaintiff , i.e. the testimony of journalist PERSON , whom the court had questioned and whose opinions were unfavourable to the applicant . However , the court had refused to call as a witness on the applicant 's behalf another journalist PERSON , who had also published an article about the applicant 's case , expressing views favourable to the applicant 's stand and sharing the applicant 's conclusions . The court admitted this article as evidence , but had not referred to it in its judgment , and had refused to call PERSON as a witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the contested judgment .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the lower court had carefully assessed the evidence before it and logically explained its reasons in the written grounds of the judgment . It had not been arbitrary in the assessment of the evidence . It was not in dispute between the parties that it was the applicant who had written the impugned text in the leaflet . That text had informed the public in Wodzis\u0142aw that PERSON as the local councillor had elected himself to the election commission , had taken care only of his own interests and that of his family , and had thereby abused his powers .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court considered that the leaflet could undoubtedly lower PERSON in public esteem and divest him of the trust necessary for his work as a councillor . The applicant could not successfully rely on his argument that when publishing the leaflet he had been acting out of concern for a legitimate public interest .", "CARDINAL . It had to be taken into consideration that the offence of aggravated defamation could be committed if the perpetrator knowingly disseminated false information about the victim . Such defamation could not be justified either by good faith or by the public interest . If the perpetrator had any grounds on which he could foresee that the allegations might be untrue , but he or she still disseminated them , he thereby committed the offence of aggravated defamation , punishable under LAW . These elements obtained in the applicant 's case as he had published his allegations about PERSON , acting in bad faith .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the sentence imposed was adequate , having regard both to the social danger of the offence and to the applicant 's personal situation . The court also ordered the applicant to pay ORG MONEY by way of court fee and to reimburse the court fee paid by the plaintiff in the amount of PLN CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . It was first argued that the first - instance court had breached provisions of procedural law in that it infringed the principle that the taking of evidence should be direct . The court had called as a witness for the plaintiff the journalist PERSON and questioned him , but refused to call another journalist PERSON as a witness on the applicant 's behalf . PERSON had written and published an article in which he agreed with the stand taken by the applicant in the leaflet . The opinion about the character of the leaflet and about the public response to it was entirely different in these CARDINAL articles , since PERSON 's article was critical of the applicant . Likewise , the articles written by PERSON and PERSON were divergent as to their assessment of the public reaction to the leaflet . The first - instance court had failed to give any grounds in its judgment to explain why it had chosen not to call PERSON as witness .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the appellant submitted that the contested judgments were in breach of substantive law . This was so because the lower courts had wrongly accepted that the applicant 's acts amounted to a criminal offence of slander . The applicant 's text published in the leaflet should have been regarded as legitimate criticism of public persons , the councillors of ORG , compatible with the applicant 's freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in a decision for which no written grounds were given , dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded and ordered the applicant to pay the court fee for the cassation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW of DATE , applicable at the material time , whoever disseminated untrue statements about other person 's acts or character with an intention of lowering him or her in public esteem or of making him or her lose the public trust necessary for that person to carry out his or her public functions , committed a criminal offence punishable by a prison sentence of DATE .", "CARDINAL .
