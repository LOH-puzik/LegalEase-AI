The second applicant , PERSON , born in DATE , is a journalist employed by the newspaper . The applicants are represented by Mr PERSON Ryssdal and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE and GPE respectively .", "The facts of the case , as described mainly in the national judgments , may be summarised as follows .", "Since DATE PERSON has run PERSON A / S , a clinic of cosmetic surgery ( hereinafter referred to as \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in B\u00e6rum ( near GPE ) , a limited liability company providing mostly liposuction and breast surgery services . For a long while and including the relevant period , Dr PERSON was the ORG \u2019s only permanent doctor . From the beginning he was the ORG \u2019s DATE manager and the chairperson of the company \u2019s governing board . PERSON and his wife each owned PERCENT of the shares until DATE , when his brother acquired PERCENT of the shares . PERSON owned PERCENT and his wife PERCENT of the shares .", "PERSON ( born in DATE ) called the ORG to fix an appointment indicating that the services she desired related to problems with fat and her bust . On DATE Ms J. visited the ORG for a consultation with Dr Dillerud . She was interested in his assistance as she wished to become a model . She subsequently made an appointment for liposuction to be performed on her thighs and hips . Before she could be attended to by Dr Dillerud , PERSON was requested to fill in a medical questionnaire to certify her known medical status . She marked various rubrics indicating that , except for bronchitis and allergy , she had not previously suffered from any illness . She omitted to mention other diseases and positively stated that there were no present or previous illnesses to be noted . At the time she had made a number of suicide attempts , was being treated for general psychiatric problems and eating disorders and had from the age of DATE been unable to study or work . She indicated that she had regularly used contraceptive pills but no other medicines , thereby actively concealing the fact that she was using ORG ( a drug specifically aimed at persons suffering from bulimia ) , anti - depressive drugs and sleeping pills . She gave an affirmative answer to the question whether she had previously been operated on , stating that she had undergone liposuction in DATE , but concealed the fact that she had also undergone CARDINAL other operations of a character which indicated eating disorders . The declaration was dated but not signed . At the time PERSON was being treated for psychiatric problems , including bulimia , and for other complaints by CARDINAL doctors and CARDINAL psychologist , but she did not inform PERSON about this or the fact that she had a long history of suicide attempts .", "On DATE Ms J. again saw PERSON and got further information from him about the operation . She told her doctors and friends about her consultations with PERSON and the planned operation ; they advised her against it . None of these doctors however took any further steps to stop the operation . The doctors included Chief Dr PERSON of the paediatric department of ORG ) , the country \u2019s leading expert on eating disorders . On CARDINAL DATE PERSON called the ORG and cancelled the operation . At the same time she contacted ORG enquiring as to whether the newspaper had anything on Dr Dillerud ; she said she was angry with him because he had failed to understand that she suffered from bulimia . The applicant journalist listened to PERSON story and proposed to prepare an article , to which the latter agreed provided that the article was not published before she had got back the money which she had paid to the ORG in anticipation of the operation . On DATE the journalist interviewed Dr Trygstad about PERSON \u2019s case but without disclosing the identity of PERSON .", "On DATE , the second applicant telephoned PERSON and informed him about the paper \u2019s wish to publish an article on PERSON consultation at the FAC . PERSON pointed out that as long as PERSON had not released him from his duty of confidentiality , he considered himself barred from commenting on the actual consultation but he commented in general terms and denied that he had been aware that the patient had bulimia . It was then agreed that , subject to PERSON releasing Dr. PERSON from his duty of confidentiality , he would be able to comment more specifically . Subsequently , PERSON agreed and signed a declaration to that effect . On DATE ( DATE before GPE ) PERSON received the declaration and tried to contact the second applicant , but in vain , as the journalist had gone on holiday and the report had already been , or was being , printed .", "On DATE , CARDINAL DATE ORG published , as the issue \u2019s main item , a report prepared by the second applicant containing criticism made by PERSON Dr Dillerud The second applicant had based her report on information provided by PERSON and comments obtained from Chief PERSON NORP of ORG ) and Mr PERSON , Secretary General of ORG .", "The front - page was primarily devoted to the story . It carried the title \u201c BULIMIA VICTIM TO BE LIPOSUCTIONED \u201d in large bold capital letters on CARDINAL lines . To the right of the title was the photograph of PERSON wearing trousers and a sleeveless shirt , standing with her back turned towards the camera . Under the heading there appeared in CARDINAL bold prints :", "\u201c For DATE she has fought anorexia and bulimia . Nonetheless , according to the DATE , Dr PERSON in B\u00e6rum had no reservations about performing liposuction on her . Good friends and Chief Dr PERSON of ORG managed to dissuade her from undergoing the operation , which was to cost ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . \u201d", "On pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the paper there was CARDINAL main article and CARDINAL smaller articles and a large photograph , extending over large parts of both pages , of PERSON head as she covered her face with her hands . On the upper right part of the photograph there appeared the following quotation in white bold letters :", "\u201c He also offered to lift my eyebrows , to give my nose a more classical finishing touch , to remove a wrinkle on my forehead and CARDINAL laughter dimples around my mouth . PERSON further considered that my breasts were awry and should be straightened . \u201d", "Under the photograph a caption stated :", "\u201c SICKENING OFFER : The DATE woman suffers from bulimia and is very thin . Nonetheless Dr PERSON offered to perform liposuction on her , in addition to a number of other beauty operations in order to improve her face . \u2013 As she did not say that she was ill , it was impossible for me to know that she was , PERSON comments . \u201d", "The report read :", "\u201c She is young and beautiful DATE and very slim . For DATE she has been fighting against anorexia and bulimia , and she still has a long way to go before she can be considered in good health . Nevertheless , according to the DATE , the controversial Dr PERSON in B\u00e6rum had no reservations about performing liposuction on her \u2013 for a remuneration of ORG CARDINAL .", "\u2013 He also offered to lift my eyebrows , to give my nose a more classical finishing touch , to remove a wrinkle on my forehead and CARDINAL laughter dimples around my mouth .

I am aware of how desperate persons suffering from bulimia and anorexia might be and how far we might go in order to carry out alterations to our appearance . I thought that doctors had certain ethical norms to comply with , but it appears that some are prepared to do anything to earn money , says the young woman .", "Chief Doctor PERSON at FAC of ORG has a long and particularly extensive experience in treating young people suffering from eating disorders . He considers that the offers which his patient says she received from PERSON are sheer madness .", "\u2013 An experienced plastic surgeon ought to have been in contact with a sufficient number of people with behavioural problems to be able to see that this patient was ill . CARDINAL may wonder whether money is all they think about , says PERSON .", "Many people have regrets", "He also considers that it would have been very natural for this plastic surgeon to ask the patient whether she was ill or had previously been hospitalised . \u2013 After all , says PERSON GPE , it is the eating disorder , not the symptoms , that has to be treated .", "A number of his bulimia patients have sought treatment from plastic surgeons .", "\u2013 Many of them have regretted it later . Some have even sustained nerve damage ( paralysis ) as a result of undergoing liposuction . In Dr GPE \u2019s opinion , many tragedies could have been avoided if the surgeon had first tried to establish whether the patient was ill .", "The plastic surgeon Dr PERSON affirms that all patients arriving at PERSON must sign a declaration , almost before they are allowed to enter . This includes information inter alia about previous and present illnesses .", "\u2013 The security is in general better here than in public hospitals . But if the patient hides information about her illness , there is little that I can do , says PERSON But could you not see that this woman was ill ?", "\u2013 Because of my duty of confidentiality I am not able to comment on any individual patient . But , generally , if I suspect that a patient suffers from bulimia , she will never be operated on by me , assures the plastic surgeon and adds .", "\u2013 However , I know of several surgeons who would operate without taking into account the patient \u2019s condition in the way we do here . Anyhow , CARDINAL patient in CARDINAL who comes to us is refused because he or she is not fit for such an operation . For example , the person may be too overweight or too underweight to make it justifiable to carry out the desired intervention .", "Not a judge", "The DATE states that it was initially her wish to have her bust lifted that made her solicit the services of PERSON and PERSON .", "\u2013 I came to his office and was told to undress . While standing there wearing only my knickers I asked \u2018 What can you do for GPE . I obviously referred to my breasts and I was quite taken aback when he replied that he would propose alterations to my look from my forehead down to my knees , said the DATE .", "I would never have answered a question such as \u2018 What can you do for GPE . The patient must know herself what she wants ; it is not my job to be a judge of appearances , PERSON maintains , rejecting her allegation .", "According to the DATE bulimic , who now is QUANTITY tall and weighs QUANTITY it was PERSON who suggested that she undergo liposuction on her stomach , her thighs and hips . After the consultation , which lasted TIME , they agreed on the liposuction and to consider the other kinds of intervention later .", "Made savings", "\u2013 Since I am a student he asked me how I was going to pay , but I assured him that I had saved up enough money , says the young woman .", "She lost her deposit of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL as she cancelled the operation DATE before it was to take place .", "\u2013 It makes me a bit bitter to think , she says ironically , that it cost me ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to learn that I looked even worse than I thought .", "Another plastic surgeon in GPE surgically inserted a so - called slimming flask into her . At that time she weighed QUANTITY less than DATE .", "A poor self - image and dissatisfaction CARDINAL \u2019s body is a distinctive feature of persons suffering from eating disorders .", "\u2013 However slim a bulimic might be , she would always consider herself as overweight . As long as they are ill they will NEVER be satisfied with their own body or their appearance , says PERSON at ORG . \u201d", "The first of the CARDINAL short articles at the top of p. CARDINAL of the paper was an interview with Mr PERSON :", "\u201c Should not occur", "\u2013 I hope this is a rare error and that an apology has been made . It should obviously not occur , says Secretary General of ORG PERSON commenting on the bulimia patient who was offered liposuction . Without wishing to comment on this case in particular , he emphasises that the operating surgeon \u2019s responsibility in ascertaining who should not be operated on is just as great as that of establishing who should be operated on .", "\u2013 Probably the greatest art of medical science is to know what to do and what not to do , says PERSON .", "He does not believe that cosmetic surgery performed by plastic surgeons on patients suffering from , for instance , anorexia and bulimia constitutes a great problem .", "We should be cautious not to minimise this problem , but I do not believe it occurs to a great extent . Our margins of error have to be extremely small and I also believe that they are , says the Secretary General .", "PERSON adds that plastic surgeons would normally be particularly aware that patients who seek their services might have other reasons than purely physical ones behind their wishes to be operated on .", "\u2013 Since the adoption in DATE of the new rules on recognition of specialist competence for plastic surgery ORG has received very few complaints about plastic surgery , says PERSON . \u201d", "The other short article was entitled \u201c Controversial Doctor \u201d and read :", "\u201c PERSON has had to bear criticism also for his previous work within the practice . In DATE ORG warned its members against taking part in a world congress on liposuction which PERSON had organised in GPE . He has also attracted several law suits from patients who claim that they have been in part disabled and ruined after treatment by the PERSON doctor .", "For DATE PERSON ran his private clinic on the island GPE outside GPE , without having qualifications as a generalist surgeon or as a plastic surgeon . When new rules for plastic surgery were introduced in DATE , PERSON obtained a dispensation for DATE , in order to enable him to acquire the requisite qualifications .", "ORG was of the view that PERSON did not present sufficient documentation on his qualifications and refused to recognise him as a generalist surgeon .", "Not until DATE did PERSON obtain special recognition as a general surgeon . Only then was he able lawfully to run his practice at PERSON . \u201d", "The article was accompanied by a photograph of PERSON with the following caption :", "\u201c A ORG OF CRITICISM : PERSON has attracted several legal actions taken by his patients . \u201d", "On DATE PERSON and the ORG instituted defamation proceedings against the applicants , requesting compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage and annulment ( mortifikasjon ) with respect to the following CARDINAL statements :", "Item CARDINAL . The text on the front page :", "\u201c For DATE she has fought anorexia and bulimia . Nonetheless , according to the DATE , Dr PERSON in B\u00e6rum had no reservations about performing liposuction on her .

The DATE earnings of the ORG was reduced by some ORG CARDINAL immediately after the reportage and it took DATE to recover these losses . As regards non - pecuniary damage , the newspaper and the journalist were ordered jointly and severally to pay PERSON CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the newspaper alone was ordered to pay an additional ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 costs , the applicants jointly and severally were ordered to pay ORG MONEY and , the first applicant , ORG CARDINAL .", "ORG noted , inter alia , that bulimia was an illness which was hard to detect ; the patient would normally do anything that he or she could to conceal the illness . PERSON withholding of certain information confirmed this . ORG also observed that Verdens Gang had in a CARDINAL - sided fashion relied on statements made by a patient who , the paper was aware , suffered from psychological problems , bulimia being an illness of a primarily psychological nature . The paper had deliberately and negligently omitted to make the further inquiries required by the nature of the matter at hand . The journalist had not awaited PERSON comments after he was released from his duty of confidentiality . This omission had been the basis for a sensationalist coverage for which there was no factual support . The brief article entitled \u201c Controversial Doctor \u201d and the caption stating that Dr Dillerud had been the subject of several legal actions taken by former patients , were also found to be factually incorrect and biased . The advice to boycott the world conference had been related to a general dispute between plastic and cosmetic surgeons and entailed no professional criticism of Dr Dillerud . As regards CARDINAL actual lawsuits , CARDINAL had been dropped and CARDINAL settled out of court .", "The applicants appealed against ORG judgment to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , which held a hearing during the period from DATE . ORG heard evidence from the second applicant and Mr PERSON , Chief Editor of Verdens Gang , PERSON and CARDINAL witnesses , not including PERSON who died shortly before the hearing .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment , except that the award of compensation for pecuniary damage was amended so as to compensate both PERSON and the ORG , and ordered the applicants jointly to pay the plaintiffs ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL with respect to their costs before ORG . The judgment included the following reasons .", "ORG was only called upon to decide the question of defamation as such in relation to a claim for compensation and reached the same conclusions as ORG in this respect . ORG considered the newspaper report as a whole , while taking as its starting point the CARDINAL statements . The ORG considered the impression which the coverage would have on the ordinary reader .", "At the outset ORG found beyond doubt that the front page and the reportage as such left the impression that PERSON had acted in a manner which should be severely criticised , and that this criticism was endorsed not only by PERSON but also by the newspaper and PERSON .", "Items CARDINAL and CARDINAL would give the ordinary reader the impression that Dr Dillerud had knowledge of PERSON eating disorder . It was undisputed that , from a professional and ethical point of view , it would be unjustifiable to carry out liposuction on a patient with eating disorders unless there had been prior consultation with the doctor treating the patient for such disorders . It was considered unethical because of the loss in self - esteem and aggravation of psychological problems that this kind of medical intervention was likely to cause on a person suffering from bulimia . Items CARDINAL and QUANTITY constituted on their own allegations of serious culpability on the part of LOC .", "Item CARDINAL had been presented as PERSON own assessments , but the use of such expressions as \u201c I thought \u201d and \u201c it appears as if \u201d did not remove its accusatorial character involving unethical behaviour .", "Apart from containing the value - judgment \u201c Sickening Offer \u201d , item CARDINAL contained a statement which appeared as if it was the newspaper \u2019s own . Since it was followed by a quotation from PERSON that he was not aware that PERSON suffered from bulimia , item CARDINAL did not appear to accuse him of such knowledge .", "Unlike ORG , ORG did not find that items CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL in isolation could be interpreted as an allegation of greed on PERSON part . ORG did not find it necessary to consider whether the reportage as such gave the impression of greed .", "ORG did not find any elements in the report as a whole which removed the impression that PERSON was accused of being prepared to perform liposuction on PERSON despite his being aware that she suffered from bulimia . Although it was mentioned that PERSON himself had stated that he was unaware of this fact , PERSON had alleged the contrary and PERSON ORG comments and the paper \u2019s description were both based on her version .", "There was no doubt that the allegations were damaging to PERSON personal reputation , which was emphasised by the fact that PERSON , Mr GPE and PERSON had criticised on ethical grounds what they believed had happened . Moreover , the allegations were capable of damaging his professional reputation .", "ORG further considered that no evidence had been adduced which could prove the truth of the accusations . There was nothing to support the assumption that , when it was agreed that PERSON should perform liposuction on both of PERSON thighs , he was aware that she suffered from bulimia . ORG , moreover , did not find it substantiated that there were any circumstances suggesting that PERSON ought to have been aware that PERSON was ill or that he ought to have carried out further investigations . PERSON wished to be operated on by PERSON and she must have understood that it was important that her illness was not revealed as she concealed it when filling in the questionnaire . She had no external symptoms at this point in time and she had previously succeeded in concealing her illness from other doctors . The fact that she was slim and somewhat underweight ought not of its own to have aroused suspicion about eating disorders or made the removal of fat concentrations inadvisable . Ms J. was slightly shorter and heavier than stated in the newspaper .", "ORG found that the second applicant had behaved negligently in her report . Although she was not responsible for the front - page , the text of item CARDINAL essentially repeated item CARDINAL drafted by her . She had based her sensational report on information from PERSON whom the journalist knew had psychiatric problems . This information , moreover , lacked a factual basis . The journalist sought the comments from Mr GPE and the Secretary General of ORG . While this might have provided a possible corrective to PERSON assessments , it was of limited value as their comments were based on PERSON version of what had happened during her consultation with PERSON .", "Thus the impugned allegations were untrue . Even assuming that their purpose was justified in order to protect the interests of others ( Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) , it could not be said that the journalist had exercised due caution . There was no time - pressure . For the second applicant it must have been apparent that PERSON may have possessed information of importance for assessing the accuracy of the information provided by PERSON In this situation it was negligent of the paper and the journalist to publish the report in question without taking further steps to reach PERSON other than contacting his office .", "ORG considered that the impugned newspaper coverage concerned a matter of general interest calling for strong protection of the right to freedom of expression . However , in its view , it was not justified to make untrue defamatory statements about PERSON . The newspaper did not limit itself to reiterating PERSON allegations . The newspaper made its own accusations for which there was no basis , which was attributable to the journalist \u2019s negligence since , for instance , there were no time constraints or other circumstances which dispensed the paper from awaiting or seeking more information . The possible beneficial effects of the coverage could have been achieved without addressing any accusations against PERSON . The interest in protecting freedom of expression could not exclude the person who is unjustifiably injured by the accusations from claiming compensation for the damage caused .", "ORG considered that the case differed from that determined by ORG in the GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) , where the applicant journalist did not in any way identify himself with the impugned allegations . Nor did ORG case - law otherwise suggest that PERSON claim of protection against unjustified accusations must give way to freedom of expression . The applicants were thus liable under LAW , second subsection , to compensate PERSON and the ORG for the damage suffered .", "The applicants sought to appeal against the above judgment but , on DATE , ORG of ORG refused them leave to appeal .", "Under NORP defamation law , there are CARDINAL kinds of responses to unlawful defamation , namely the imposition of a penalty under the provisions of LAW , an order under LAW declaring the defamatory allegation null and void ( mortifikasjon ) and an order under LAW DATE ( Skadeserstatningsloven \u2013 Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) to pay compensation to the aggrieved party . Only the latter was at issue in the present case .", "Section CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the aforementioned LAW reads :", "\u201c A person who has injured the honour or infringed the privacy of another person shall , if he has displayed negligence or if the conditions for imposing a penalty are fulfilled , pay compensation for the damage sustained and such compensation for loss of future earnings as the court deems reasonable , having regard to the degree of negligence and other circumstances . He may also be ordered to pay such compensation for non - pecuniary damage as the court deems reasonable .", "If the infringement has occurred in the form of printed matter , and the person who has acted in the service of the owner or the publisher thereof is responsible under the first subsection , the owner and publisher are also liable to pay compensation . The same applies to any redress imposed under the first subsection unless the court finds that there are special grounds for dispensation ... \u201d", "Conditions for holding a defendant liable for defamation are further set out in LAW of LAW , ORG and CARDINAL of which provide :", "\u201c LAW . Any person who by word or deed unlawfully defames another person , or who is accessory thereto , shall be liable to fines or imprisonment for a term not exceeding DATE .", "Article CARDINAL . Any person who , by word or deed , behaves in a manner that is likely to harm another person \u2019s good name and reputation or to expose him to hatred , contempt , or loss of the confidence necessary for his position or business , or who is accessory thereto , shall be liable to fines or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year . If the defamation is committed in print or in broadcasting , or otherwise under especially aggravating circumstances , imprisonment for a term not exceeding DATE may be imposed . \u201d", "A limitation to the applicability of LAW follows from the requirement that the expression must be unlawful ( rettstridig ) . While this is expressly stated in LAW , LAW has been interpreted by ORG to include such a requirement .", "In a civil case concerning pre - trial reporting by a newspaper , ORG found for the newspaper , relying on the reservation of lawfulness ( rettsstridsreservasjonen ) , even though the impugned expressions had been deemed defamatory . It held that , in determining the scope of this limitation , particular weight should be attached to whether the case was of public interest , having regard to the nature of the issues and to the kind of parties involved . Regard should be had to the context in which , and the background against which , the statements had been made . Moreover , it was of great importance whether the news item had presented the case in a sober and balanced manner and had been aimed at highlighting the subject - matter and the object of the case ( PERSON PERSON [ The Norwegian Law Report ] DATE , p.
