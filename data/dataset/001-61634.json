THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 3", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and currently resides in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in the GPE , where , on DATE , he applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature ( klemmende PERSON aard ) . In support of his claim for asylum he submitted the following .", "CARDINAL . He belonged to the NORP population group and came from a farming family in the town of ORG in the north of GPE , bordering on the area controlled by ORG ( the \u201c NORP \u201d ) , a NORP terrorist organisation , engaged in an armed struggle for independence . ORG members would often visit NORP living in the area in order to obtain food . The GPE army was therefore quick to suspect local farmers of supporting the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant 's father was shot dead on his land by the NORP army because they suspected him of providing material assistance to the ORG . DATE after his father 's killing , the applicant 's mother sent him to the town of GPE , which was under NORP control at the time , where he stayed for DATE with his uncle . Following the death of his father , the applicant 's brother became a fighter with the ORG and neither the applicant nor his mother have heard from him since .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in his home by the Sri NORP army and detained in the PERSON military camp for DATE . Every other day he was questioned about the whereabouts of his brother . The soldiers told him that his father had been an NORP member and that the applicant must know other NORP members . During these interrogations soldiers beat him with their fists and sticks . He was also hung from the ceiling by his thumbs . Upon the arrival of new detainees , the applicant had to identify ORG members among them .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , he was released on condition that he report to the camp DATE . The ill - treatment to which he had been subjected had resulted in internal injuries requiring hospital treatment for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Every time he reported to the camp he was ill - treated , and often questioned . Sometimes he was made to accompany soldiers driving through PERSON so that he could point out NORP members . After DATE of reporting to the camp DATE , he was told to report on a DATE basis . However , a DATE reporting duty was once again imposed on him from DATE when a large number of ORG members was said to have arrived in PERSON ; the soldiers said that the applicant 's brother might be among them and the applicant was to point him out to them . According to the soldiers , his brother was an important NORP member who was responsible for many bomb attacks .", "CARDINAL . Because the applicant could no longer cope either physically or mentally with the DATE reporting duty , the interrogations , the ill - treatment and having to identify NORP members , he decided to leave the country . In addition , he knew of other persons who had a similar reporting duty who had disappeared . He feared the same thing could happen to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant travelled to GPE by train with his mother . During this trip , he was in possession of an identity card which his mother subsequently took back with her to PERSON . On DATE the applicant , using a passport bearing his name , flew to GPE and then , DATE , on to GPE . He travelled from GPE to the GPE in a van on DATE . His passport had been taken from him by an intermediary in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Whilst in GPE he received CARDINAL letters from his mother stating that she had been arrested and detained for DATE by the army , and that the army were searching for him because he had failed to report . The applicant did not keep these letters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) rejected the applicant 's requests , considering that it had not been established that the applicant had shown himself to be an opponent of the regime in GPE or that he was known as such by the authorities . Given that his arrest in DATE had obviously not constituted a reason for him to leave the country immediately , and that he had been able to leave GPE unhindered through the normal channels , it could not be said that at the time of departure he had been in such a dangerous situation that he could not have been expected to remain in his country of origin . The applicant was also notified that he would not be allowed to remain in the GPE when any objection ( bezwaar ) he might submit was being considered .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection on DATE and also requested an interim measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) from ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of The GPE sitting in GPE . The request for an interim measure was declared inadmissible by the President of ORG on DATE because no grounds had been submitted for the objection . The objection itself was rejected by the Deputy Minister for ORG on DATE for the same reason . The Deputy Minister held in addition that , even if grounds for the objection had been submitted , merely invoking the general situation in GPE was insufficient to justify the conclusion that the applicant would be subjected to either persecution or treatment contrary to LAW if returned to that country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE . Finding that the Deputy Minister had been correct in rejecting the applicant 's objection , ORG dismissed the appeal by a final decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not , however , leave the GPE and neither was he forcibly expelled . On DATE he lodged a new request for a residence permit for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature . This request was rejected by the Deputy Minister for Justice on DATE who considered that , even though recent developments in GPE continued to give cause for concern , the general situation there had not changed to such an extent that it required ORG to amend their policy relating to NORP asylum seekers . The applicant had failed to show that concrete reasons , related to facts and circumstances affecting him personally , existed which could justify the conclusion that he would be exposed to a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW if returned to GPE . The Deputy Minister further informed the applicant that he would not be allowed to remain in the GPE pending the examination of any objection he might wish to lodge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an objection to the decision of the Deputy Minister , and on DATE he requested an interim measure from ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE in order to prevent his expulsion . On DATE the President of ORG granted the interim measure , considering that the applicant belonged to CARDINAL or more of the so - called \u201c categories at risk \u201d : categories of people who ran the risk of being detained in GPE for TIME pursuant to ORG in force .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was given the opportunity to comment on his application for a residence permit before an official committee ( ambtelijke commissie ) on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's objection was rejected by the Deputy Minister for ORG on DATE . Given that the applicant 's claim for asylum had already been finally and conclusively rejected , and that he had failed to adduce any new facts or circumstances but had only made references to the general situation in GPE , the Deputy Minister considered that the request for a residence permit was no more than an attempt to frustrate his departure from the GPE . In any event , the fact that the applicant had not left GPE until DATE , even though the problems he had allegedly suffered stemmed from alleged events in DATE and DATE , militated against the assumption that he would currently run a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister further informed the applicant that any appeal lodged by him would be dealt with expeditiously , and the applicant 's departure from the GPE would be deferred pending such an appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE on DATE . He argued that the information from ORG , used by the Deputy Minister for the determination of asylum claims of NORP from GPE , was seriously lacking . Referring to information from ORG , the applicant submitted that the group of persons who ran the risk of being detained for DATE and tortured during that time was far greater than assumed by ORG . Moreover , the ORG 's official report ( ambtsbericht ) of DATE itself stated that , if a detainee was held for DATE , during which time he was questioned about NORP involvement , there was a great likelihood that the detainee would be ill - treated . In addition , according to the same official report , a GPE with a relative known to be an ORG member ran the risk of being detained for DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of his appeal before ORG on DATE , the applicant further submitted that he ran an extra risk of detention now that an amendment to the Immigrants and Emigrants Act had entered into force , given that he had left GPE on an unofficial passport .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the appeal by judgment of DATE . It considered that where GPE NORP belonging to CARDINAL of the categories at risk were concerned , it should in general be readily accepted that a real risk of treatment in breach of Article CARDINAL existed . Nevertheless , not every GPE belonging to CARDINAL of the categories ran a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW . The likelihood of such NORP being apprehended for checks on a more or less regular basis upon their return to GPE as a result of the security situation in GPE was in itself insufficient to conclude that unacceptable risks existed , even if the persons concerned encountered a certain heavy - handedness in the process . As regards the applicant , ORG saw no reason to come to a different assessment from that made on the applicant 's request for asylum . The applicant 's argument that the Sri NORP authorities held a file on him was only an assumption and had not been shown to be plausible . Even though ORG considered it likely that persons returning would be interviewed by ORG authorities at GPE airport in order to establish whether or not they had left the country through illegal channels , this did not lead to a considerably increased risk of treatment in breach of LAW . Neither was it contrary to LAW to prosecute and sentence persons who had contravened the Immigrants and LAW . In any event , the applicant had stated that his uncle had obtained a passport for him from ORG in GPE , and it was therefore unlikely that the applicant had left GPE on a passport which the authorities of that country knew to be forged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , i.e. following the introduction of the present application to the ORG , the applicant lodged a new request for asylum . This was refused on DATE . His objection against that decision , as well as his request for an interim measure , was rejected by the President of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE on DATE . In this decision the President based himself on information contained in official reports from ORG of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the accuracy of which , according to the President , had not been sufficiently disproved by the applicant . The President concluded that the security situation in GPE for rejected NORP asylum seekers was not such that they had to fear treatment contrary to LAW . The President further referred to a letter of the ORG ( ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ) of DATE in which the latter organisation stated its opinion that the expulsion of rejected NORP asylum seekers was acceptable as long as they were in possession of identity documents issued by the Sri Lankan authorities . The President noted that the applicant would be provided with an identity document by ORG in the GPE which he could use , even after its expiry , until such time as a new national identity card was issued to him .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW DATE ( vreemdelingenwet , hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , in force at the relevant time , aliens coming from a country where they have a well - founded reason to fear persecution on account of their religious or political conviction , or of belonging to a particular race or a particular social group , could be admitted by the Minister of ORG as refugees .", "CARDINAL . The expression \u201c refugee \u201d in this provision was construed to have the same meaning as in LAW relating to LAW DATE ( decision of ORG of the Raad van State of DATE , PERSON \u2013 Immigration Law Reports DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Aliens , other than refugees , wishing to reside in the GPE for any length of time had to hold a residence permit ( LAW ) . Such a permit was to be requested from , and granted by , the Minister of Justice ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Given the situation obtaining in the GPE with regard to population size and employment , Government policy was DATE and is \u2013 aimed at restricting the number of aliens admitted to the GPE . In general , aliens are only granted admission for residence purposes if :", "( a ) the GPE are obliged under international law to do so , as in the case of citizens of ORG or GPE member GPE and refugees covered by the above - mentioned LAW ; or", "( b ) this serves the \u201c essential interests of the GPE \u201d , e.g. economic or cultural interests ; or", "( c ) there are \u201c compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature \u201d .", "CARDINAL . An alien not , or no longer , qualifying for admission to the GPE could be expelled ( LAW ) . However , aliens claiming that their removal from the GPE would compel them to travel to a country where they have reason to fear persecution on CARDINAL of the grounds set out in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) could not be expelled except by a specific order of the Minister of Justice ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . An objection ( bezwaar ) against the refusal to grant refugee status or a residence permit lay to the Deputy Minister of ORG ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , LAW of LAW ) . An appeal against the rejection of an objection lay to LAW of ORG of GPE ( Article CARDINAL of the General Administrative Law Act ; Article PERSON of LAW ) . No further appeal was allowed ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the decision on the applicant 's objection ( DATE ) , as well as in the period leading up to the introduction of the present application , GPE policy was based on country reports issued by ORG on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . To assess whether a person ran a real risk of being treated in a manner contrary to the provisions of LAW , the following factors were taken into account :", "- All young NORP in GPE who speak little NORP and whose documents reveal that they were born in the north ran the risk of being taken to a police station for questioning following an identity check . Most were released within TIME once their identity had been established and they had explained their reasons for being in the city .", "- People who had recently come to GPE from a war zone and had no identity documents or \u201c valid \u201d reason for being in GPE , ran the risk of being held for longer than TIME so that further enquiries could be made . People who failed to register on arrival also lay themselves open to suspicion .", "- NORP suspected of NORP activities on the basis of police files or information from other sources ran the risk of being held for DATE . This also applied to people whom the authorities believed could provide information on the ORG , such as people known to have a relative who is an ORG member .", "- People could be detained for CARDINAL , DATE under LAW if there was firm evidence that they were involved in the NORP . Such evidence included arms caches or suspect documents .", "CARDINAL . Persons held for CARDINAL to CARDINAL hours for further questioning could be treated roughly ( beatings ) . Where the person concerned was held for DATE , and questioned about NORP involvement , the risk of illtreatment was considerable .", "CARDINAL . The mere fact that a NORP belonged to CARDINAL or more of the above categories of persons , who in theory ran the risk of longer detention , did not necessarily mean that there was a real risk of their being subjected to treatment prohibited by LAW . According to the country report of DATE , it could be assumed that , in any event , no such risk existed in the case of NORP falling into the first CARDINAL categories .", "CARDINAL . A country report of CARDINAL DATE stated that an amendment to the Immigrants and Emigrants Act had entered into force on DATE , pursuant to which the penalty for using forged travel documents was increased . According to the report , at the time of a person 's return to GPE there was generally insufficient evidence of use having been made of forged documents for the outward journey .", "This country report also contained information on the procedure followed by police in respect of persons apprehended at the airport or in the course of a round - up . The list of names of the arrested persons was passed to ORG to see if any of the names featured in the database held by the ORG . All persons suspected of violating LAW or LAW were included in the files of wanted persons . However , the police did not in all cases have information concerning that person . Information was only available if the person concerned had either been arrested previously or been denounced by another detainee .", "CARDINAL . The GPE policy in force at the time of the most recent decision of the Deputy Minister of Justice ( DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , was based on the country reports of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . These reports indicated that NORP fleeing the war could find an alternative place of residence in Government - controlled areas , including GPE . NORP were subject to frequent identity checks in Government - controlled areas , especially on or around public holidays , after attacks and if the military position of Government troops had deteriorated . NORP who could not identify themselves on the spot or who were believed to come from the north or east of GPE could be arrested . Most were released within TIME , after their identity and background had been checked . As to the factors which could occasion longer detention , the report of DATE referred to that of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The country report of CARDINAL DATE included information on the developments of the peace process that was started in DATE , stating that a formal cease - fire agreement ( ORG ) between the ORG and the ORG had been signed on DATE . It further stated that during the period under review CARDINAL suicide attack had taken place in GPE , which had not been followed by the usual round - ups , large - scale identity checks and arrests . After the installation of PERSON as prime minister in DATE , the security situation in GPE had improved considerably and the atmosphere in the city was relaxed and had normalised . Most roadblocks and checkpoints were removed . The number of identity checks had been drastically reduced and there were no reports of arrests of ORG suspects .", "CARDINAL . The most recent country report , of CARDINAL DATE , confirmed that the security situation in GPE had significantly improved as had freedom of movement . NORP were free to travel through the whole of the country without requiring prior permission to enter certain areas . As a result , it was now far simpler for NORP fleeing NORP - controlled areas to go to areas under Government control . In GPE , no restrictions on freedom of movement applied . During the period under review , the GPE authorities had in general respected human rights , in line with the provisions of the ORG . No arbitrary arrests had been made . Ill - treatment and torture to which persons who had been arrested on suspicion of membership of , or involvement in , the ORG had been subjected in the past , no longer occurred .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE , returning rejected asylum seekers were for the most part allowed to leave the airport after their identity documents had been checked . In a few cases , returnees had been handed over to ORG ( ORG ) , usually within CARDINAL but sometimes within TIME , and subsequently transferred to a ORG . ORG judge decided whether , on the basis of the information provided by the ORG , the person concerned should be remanded in prison , released on bail pending the conclusion of the investigation , or simply released . During the period under review , all returnees were released DATE , either on or without bail . Unless they tried to enter the country using forged travel documents , returning rejected asylum seekers generally did not have to fear prosecution under the terms of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act .", "CARDINAL . In its DATE Report DATE , covering events from DATE , ORG noted with respect to GPE :", "\u201c There was a major improvement in the human rights situation in the context of a cease - fire and peace talks between the ORG and the ORG . However , torture in police custody continued to be reported frequently ...", "Unilateral cease - fires declared by both the ORG and the NORP in DATE were followed by a formal cease - fire agreement ( ORG ) that came into force on DATE . Peace negotiations , facilitated by ORG , started in DATE in GPE . ORG ( SLMM ) consisting of representatives of NORP countries was set up to verify the implementation of the agreement through on - site monitoring . By DATE , CARDINAL of CARDINAL internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) had returned home ...", "As part of the ORG , the ORG made a commitment not to arrest anyone under the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG released ORG on ORG for DATE . It stated :", "\u201c In the past , arbitrary arrest and detention were problems ; however , there were no reports of arbitrary arrests or detentions during DATE ...", "Unlike in DATE , there were no large - scale arrests of NORP during DATE ...", "The ... reports of regular mistreatment by security forces largely ceased ...", "The reconciliation also has led to a sharp reduction in roadblocks and checkpoints around the country , the return of CARDINAL IDPs to their points of origin in the north and east , and to the opening of numerous investigations into actions by security force personnel ...", "The Government restricted the movement of displaced NORP due to possible security , economic , and social concerns . These restrictions have been lifted with the onset of the peace process . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Operational Guidance Note on GPE , issued on DATE by ORG ) of ORG reported :", "\u201c The authorities in GPE will no longer be concerned with those individuals with past low - level support for the LTTE ( e.g. digging trenches , providing food / shelter to NORP fighters ) , those with no police / criminal record or those who may have been arrested in the past and subsequently released .

On DATE , the Sri NORP President PERSON suspended parliament and sacked CARDINAL senior ministers . The President accused the Government of making too many concessions to the ORG . On DATE , NORP mediators said , after talks with the NORP , that the peace process was on hold until the country 's political crisis was resolved . The mediators had passed on to the NORP guarantees from both the President and the Prime Minister that they would abide by the ORG .
