CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Jon Fridrik Kj\u00f8lbro;Paul Lemmens;St\u00e9phanie Mourou-Vikstr\u00f6m;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turkovi\u0107", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the former NORP socialist regime all employees contributed to housing funds . The funds thus obtained were used , inter alia , to build blocks of flats . The flats were distributed to employees , who acquired protected tenancies in respect of them and other already existing socially owned flats . Each publicly owned company drew up a list of persons to be granted specially protected tenancies . When a person on such a list was granted a specially protected tenancy , his or her housing needs were considered to have been met and his or her name would be removed from the list .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was employed by a socially owned company , S. All employees of S. paid contributions to a housing fund in the amount of PERCENT of their DATE salaries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE company S. granted the applicant a specially protected tenancy of a flat measuring QUANTITY in the GPE suburbs , with the right to occupy it together with her husband and QUANTITY daughters . However , since that decision was not yet final , company S. entered into an agreement with the applicant on DATE giving her the right to move into the flat with her family and to care for that flat . The applicant moved into the flat and has been living there ever since .", "CARDINAL . The decision to grant the applicant a specially protected tenancy was challenged by CARDINAL other employees and quashed by ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the housing committee of company S. drew up a priority list for the distribution of flats . The applicant was the first on the list . On DATE the company \u2019s workers\u2019 council approved the priority list . On the basis of that list she was entitled to have a decision allocating a flat to her issued . On DATE the flats of the company S. were transferred for management to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , CARDINAL other employees of company S. brought an action before the competent court , seeking to have the priority list declared null and void . Competence in the matter was subsequently transferred to ORG , which on DATE dismissed the claims on the merits since there was no possibility under the relevant law to bring such an action at all . A civil action could be brought to challenge the decision on allocation of a flat but not to challenge a priority list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG amended the judgment of DATE so as to declare the actions inadmissible on the same grounds , namely that the priority list could not be challenged before a court of law .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE ORG had enacted ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo ) , which abolished the specially protected tenancies and regulated the sale of socially owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked GPE as the owner of the flat to conclude a contract for the sale of the flat with herself as the buyer . GPE did not take any decision within the prescribed time - limit of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant re - submitted to the GPE her request to purchase the flat she occupied . The request was refused on DATE because she had not been granted a specially protected tenancy in respect of that flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil action against GPE , which in the meantime had become the owner of the flat she occupied , seeking a judgment in lieu of the contract of sale of the flat in question .", "CARDINAL . The claim was dismissed by ORG on DATE on the grounds that the applicant had not acquired a protected tenancy of the flat in question , since the priority list did not constitute a decision on the granting of protected tenancies within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . The court held that the applicant did not have a final decision on allocation of the flat to her .", "CARDINAL . In a subsequent constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant , she complained that her right to equality before the law , her right to an appeal as well as her right to a fair trial had been violated . She argued that she had been the first on a priority list drawn up by company S. for the distribution of flats . The only reasons she had not been formally granted a specially protected tenancy of the flat she had been occupying were the challenge of the priority list by her co - workers and the delay in the civil proceedings before ORG . However , once those proceedings had ended , all of the conditions for recognition of her specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue had been met . The DATE validity of the priority list was to be counted from the date of its being confirmed , which in the applicant \u2019s case had occurred when the national courts had dismissed all the objections concerning that list . By not recognising her right to a specially protected tenancy , the national authorities had deprived her of the possibility to purchase the flat she occupied under favourable conditions . She also relied on some other decisions of the ORG whereby it had granted protection to persons in situations comparable to her own .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint on the grounds that the findings of the lower courts that she had not acquired a specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue had been correct . It further held that the decisions the applicant had relied on concerned persons who had had specially protected tenancies which they had subsequently lost ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
