On CARDINAL DATE ORG held a public hearing . After the hearing it upheld the applicant \u2019s claim in part . It noted that the parties had not significantly contributed to the length of the contentious proceedings , that the case was a rather simple one , and that the issue had certainly not been of minor importance to the applicant . The court referred to the compensation , which it considered to be typically awarded to the applicants by the ORG in cases concerning similar length and involving a similar number of levels of jurisdiction .

On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal , paying court fees amounting to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG partially upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal and increased damages to LAW . ORG found that the first - instance court had relied on case - law which was not analogous enough to the applicant \u2019s case to be used as a criterion for an appropriate compensation . Noting that the allowed compensation under LAW ranged from ORG CARDINAL to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , it considered that the applicant should have been awarded EUR CARDINAL . As regards the costs , it decided that the applicant was entitled to LAW for legal representation in the first - instance proceedings and nothing with respect to legal fees for the representation at the appeal stage as the law did not provide for it ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint and an application for constitutional review of the provisions of LAW ( Zakon o odvetni\u0161ki tarifi ) in parts concerning the fees for legal representation in the proceedings under LAW . She complained about the length of the contentious proceedings and the courts\u2019 handling of her claim for compensation for undue delays . She moreover argued that the extreme restrictions regarding the reimbursable legal fees in the proceedings under LAW , which did not apply to regular civil proceedings , were contrary to the equal protection of rights and the right to judicial protection enshrined in the LAW . The proceedings under LAW were complex enough to require legal representation as several steps , such as using of acceleratory remedies and settlement procedure , had to be conducted before a compensation claim could be lodged and there were strict procedural rules as regards the conduct of the compensation proceedings . She also pointed out that the contested provisions of LAW had essentially affected the plaintiffs , who had suffered damage due to a breach of the reasonable time requirement . For the representation in the LAW proceedings , the plaintiffs often paid legal fees based on an agreement , which meant that most of it might remain unreimbursed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected both the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint and the application for review of constitutionality . It rejected the constitutional complaint as inadmissible referring to section DATE ( a ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . As regards the application for review of constitutionality , ORG noted that the challenged law was no longer in force , and that in any event the outcome of the proceedings could not benefit the applicant , as her constitutional complaint had been rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant indicated to the ORG that she was due to pay her lawyer LAW with respect to court fees relating to the compensation proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

Further to an appeal , ORG issued a decision on DATE ( served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who had availed herself of the remedies provided for under LAW , reached an out - of - court settlement with ORG after being offered the maximum amount of compensation allowed under LAW , namely LAW , as just satisfaction for the violation of her right to a trial without undue delay in the inheritance proceedings , as well as LAW for the costs of legal representation .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL with relevant amendments ) provides that the losing party to the proceedings should bear the costs of the successful party . However , if the claim was upheld only in part , the court may order that the amount of the costs to be reimbursed by the defendant should correspond to the proportion of the upheld part of the claim . According to section CARDINAL of the same Act only necessary costs were reimbursable .", "CARDINAL . In the compensation proceedings under LAW the parties have to pay the court fees which apply in ordinary civil proceedings under LAW . The amount of the court fees depends on the monetary value of the claim .", "CARDINAL . The fees reimbursable to lawyers for representation of their clients were until DATE specified in the Lawyer Fees Schedule , based on LAW ( Official Gazette no . CARDINAL with relevant amendments ) , applicable from DATE . On DATE LAW ( Official Gazette no . CARDINAL ) entered into force . It specified , inter alia , the fees reimbursable to lawyers for representation of their clients in proceedings under LAW . LAW was the act applicable at the time of the applicant \u2019s compensation proceedings . The fees for representation in the proceedings under LAW was set at ORG CARDINAL for lodging a supervisory appeal , a motion for a deadline or a claim for settlement with the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG . In court proceedings the award for representation was set at PERCENT of the compensation awarded by the court , but could not exceed LAW . There was no additional fee for representation in the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . LAW was repealed on DATE by LAW to LAW ; however , the fees laid down in LAW were still applicable until the adoption of the new Lawyer Fees Schedule . According to the new Lawyer Fees Schedule , based on LAW and applicable from DATE , the fees for lodging an application for a supervisory appeal or a motion for a deadline was raised from ORG CARDINAL to EUR CARDINAL , while the distinction between court proceedings under LAW and ordinary civil proceedings was abolished and consequently the same fees applied to both .", "CARDINAL . As regards the admissibility of a constitutional complaint , section DATE of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A constitutional complaint is not admissible if the violation of human rights or fundamental freedoms did not have serious consequences for the complainant .", "( CARDINAL ) It is deemed that there has been no violation of human rights or fundamental freedoms which had serious consequences for the complainant with regard to individual acts : issued in small - claims disputes in accordance with the act which regulates civil procedure , or in other disputes if the value in dispute for the complainant does not exceed the amount which is determined by the definition of small claims disputes in the act which regulates civil procedure ; if only a decision on the costs of proceedings is challenged by the constitutional complaint ; issued in trespass to property disputes ; issued in minor offence cases .", "( CARDINAL ) Irrespective of the preceding paragraph , in especially well - founded cases ORG may exceptionally decide on a constitutional complaint against the individual acts referred to in the preceding paragraph . An instance of an especially well - founded case is a decision that concerns an important constitutional question which exceeds the importance of the specific case . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
