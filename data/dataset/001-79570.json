The applicant was suspected of having bodily assaulted and raped his wife , of having threatened her with a firearm , of having sexually assaulted his minor stepdaughter and of being in possession of child pornographic videos . The arrest warrant pointed out that there were reasons to assume that the applicant would react with \u201c massive resistance \u201d upon his arrest and would \u201c try to escape prosecution \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME six police officers of the special task force ( PERSON ) of the ORG gendarmerie entered the applicant 's house . The officers were equipped with bullet - proof vests and shields . Further , they wore masks .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that before the police entered his house , he had observed CARDINAL suspicious persons , namely CARDINAL of the officers , lingering around his parking .

The police officers forced the applicant to the ground and handcuffed him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that he had recognised the police officers on their emblems and had declared at once that he would not do anything and collaborate with the police . An officer allegedly replied to him that he would better do so otherwise he would be \u201c picked off \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was subsequently laid on a table where he was stripped naked , searched for arms and dressed again . According to the applicant he was blindfolded during this time . Upon the shock of his arrest the applicant had urinated in his clothes . The police officers , despite the applicant 's repeated requests , refused to let him change his clothes .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that he was then again forced to the ground where he remained for TIME while some of the police officers searched his house . According to the applicant he was lying face down while a police officer pressed his knee on the back of his neck .

During all of the time of his arrest and detention the applicant remained handcuffed . Upon his request , however , the handcuffs were covered with a garment when leaving the house and were later attached in his front instead behind his back .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was again heard by the gendarmerie . On DATE he prepared a note for the file in which he described the events at issue . He made , however , no reference to the fact that he had been blindfolded while stripped .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings against the applicant were discontinued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant complained to ORG ( Unabh\u00e4ngiger Verwaltungs - senat ) that the treatment he had suffered during his arrest and at the police station amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to LAW . He referred to his stripping by the police officers , the forcing to the ground while an officer pressed his knee against the back of his neck , the threats by the officers and the refusal to let him change his wet clothes . He finally complained that his handcuffing had not been necessary as he had been cooperative and had not shown any sign of resistance during all of the time .", "CARDINAL . ORG held CARDINAL hearings on CARDINAL and DATE . It questioned the applicant , the director of ORG ) , the police officer who had headed the mission , another police officer who had assisted the applicant 's arrest and the police officer who had questioned the applicant at the LOC police station . The police officers submitted that the applicant 's wife had informed them that the applicant was violent , regularly consumed alcohol , was in possession of a fire - arm and had attended training for hand - to - hand combat for DATE . He had allegedly received his wife several times with a weapon in his hand when she was entering the house . The applicant 's wife had warned the police that the applicant \u201c was up to do anything \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL officers who had participated in the applicant 's arrest confirmed that the applicant had been strip - searched . CARDINAL officer explained that this had been done for their and the applicant 's safety and in order to find the weapon . The applicant had been informed about the arrest and search warrant before being undressed . After the strip search the applicant had been seated on a sofa . The other officer stated that after the strip search the applicant had been laid and held on the floor . He denied , however , that somebody had approached the applicant 's neck with his knee . Both officers confirmed that the applicant had not shown any sign of resistance and denied that the applicant had been threatened to \u201c be picked off \u201d . The officer who had heard the applicant at the police station submitted that he had not lessened the applicant 's handcuffs because during some of the time he had been alone with the applicant at the police station .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's complaints . It found that the police officers had acted on the basis of an arrest warrant and had not exceeded the instructions of the investigating judge . The handcuffing of the applicant had been a necessary accompanying measure to the applicant 's arrest because of the applicant 's assumed resistance and escape . Against this background also the stripping of the applicant could not be regarded as excessive , especially as the applicant was suspected to be in the possession of weapons . The applicant 's further complaints about the threatening , the holding down by pressing a knee against the back of his neck and the refusal to let him change his wet clothes were , even assuming that the applicant 's allegations were true , of no relevance for the proceedings at issue as they concerned merely the way of proceeding during an authorised arrest and were attributable to the court . A review of lawfulness did not fall within ORG competence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to deal with the applicant 's complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a complaint with ORG in which he repeated his submissions made before ORG . He further complained about the fact that the intervening officers had been masked .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly granted the applicant 's complaint . It quashed ORG decision insofar as the refusal of the police officers to let the applicant change his clothes was concerned and remitted the case back to the Panel for further examination .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the remainder of the applicant 's complaint . It noted that the police officers had been confronted with a person suspected of severe crimes who was allegedly in possession of a firearm and was trained in hand - to - hand combat and who , furthermore , was holding a knife when meeting them . The handcuffing and complete stripping of the applicant and the alleged fixation and threatening by the police officers did not , therefore , exceed the instructions of the investigating judge . The court did not consider the applicant 's detention for TIME and his handcuffing during this period of time as excessive either . It noted in the latter regard that , despite the applicant 's calm and cooperative behaviour , there was reason to believe that the applicant once liberated from his handcuffs would try to escape or use force . ORG finally noted that the applicant had not raised the complaint that the officers had been masked before ORG . This complaint was , however , inadmissible in any way as it did not concern an act of direct administrative authority and coercion ( ORG unmittelbarer verwaltungsbeh\u00f6rdlicher Befehls- PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the police officers ' refusal to let the applicant change his wet clothes had not been covered by the instructions of the investigating judge who had ordered the applicant 's arrest and constituted inhuman or degrading treatment in breach of LAW . The applicant subsequently received compensation in the amount of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( Strafproze\u00df - ordnung ) concern the search of LOC and persons and the seizure of objects .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL stipulates that a search of a person and his clothes is inter alia admissible when this person is suspected of a crime .", "CARDINAL . According to section QUANTITY , a search should in general only be carried out after the person concerned has been heard , and only if the person or objects searched are not voluntarily rendered and if the reasons leading to the search have not been eliminated . It is not required to hear persons of bad reputation , or to have such a hearing where there is danger in delay .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL states , as a rule , that a search may only be carried out on the basis of a reasoned search warrant issued by a judge .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL stipulates that when searches of LOC and persons are carried out any disturbance and harassment of the person concerned which is not strictly necessary has to be avoided . Searches have to be carried out in respect of the rules of decency .", "By virtue of section DATE LAW verfahrensgesetz ) , ORG have jurisdiction , inter alia , to examine complaints from persons alleging a violation of their rights resulting from act of direct administrative compulsion ( ORG unmittelbarer verwaltungsbeh\u00f6rdlicher Befehls- PERSON ) . According to relevant jurisprudence and doctrine acts of administrative organs which are based on a court order are not attributable to the administrative authorities , but to the courts . Such an act is , however , attributable to the administrative authorities when the judicial order has been manifestly exceeded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
