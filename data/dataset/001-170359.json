On DATE the first applicant , assisted by her lawyer , was questioned by the Larino carabinieri .

PERSON concluded that the applicants were suitable parents for the child , both from a psychological perspective and in terms of their ability to educate him and bring him up . She added that possible removal measures would have devastating consequences for the child , explaining that he would go through a depressive phase on account of a sense of abandonment and the loss of the key persons in his life .

The relevant passages of ORG decision read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "In their evidence Mr PERSON and PERSON stated that PERSON had travelled to GPE carrying her husband \u2019s semen in a special container , and had there entered into an agreement with the company PERSON . Under this agreement , PERSON had delivered her husband \u2019s semen to a pre - determined clinic . CARDINAL or more eggs from an unknown female donor had been fertilised in vitro with this semen , and then implanted into another woman , whose identity is known and who had subsequently given birth to the child in question on DATE . In exchange , Mr PERSON and PERSON had paid a large amount of money . PERSON stated that the woman who had given birth to the child had waived her rights to him and had consented to him being referred to on the birth certificate , drawn up in GPE , as the son of Mr PERSON and PERSON ( a copy of the informed consent , given on DATE by the woman who gave birth to the child , is on file in these proceedings ) .", "A court - appointed expert witness was then instructed to establish whether the minor child was the biological son of PERSON . In her report the court - appointed expert witness , PERSON [ NORP ] , concluded that the results obtained by means of typing of the DNA of FAC and the DNA of the minor child [ T.C. ] rule out FAC as the child \u2019s biological father .", "In DATE \u2019s hearing Mr PERSON and PERSON referred to their previous evidence and PERSON repeated that she had taken her husband \u2019s semen to GPE to be used for the purpose of the intended fertilisation .", "However , the conclusions of the court - appointed expert witness have not been challenged .", "At the close of the hearing , ORG requested that the application by Mr PERSON and PERSON be refused , that the minor child be placed in the care of third parties and that a temporary guardian be appointed for him . The child \u2019s guardian ad litem asked that the child be placed in care under LAW and that a guardian be appointed . Mr PERSON and PERSON requested primarily that the court award them temporary care of the child with a view to subsequent adoption ; in the alternative , they requested the suspension of these proceedings pending the criminal classification of the offences , and the suspension of the above - mentioned criminal proceedings against them and of the proceedings before ORG to challenge the refusal to register the child \u2019s birth certificate ; again in the alternative , they requested the suspension of these proceedings under LAW no . CARDINAL for the purpose of a possible repatriation of the minor child to GPE , or , failing that , for the child to be placed with them under LAW of the cited law .", "That being the case , the court finds that the statements by Mr PERSON and ORG regarding the delivery to GPE of PERSON genetic material are not supported by any evidence . On the other hand , it has been established that the minor [ T.C. ] is neither the biological son of PERSON , nor , given the evidence of the expert report , of PERSON . At the present time the only certainty is the identity of the woman who gave birth to the baby . The biological parents of the baby , that is , the man and the woman who provided the gametes , remain unknown .", "In the light of this evidence , the present case can not be viewed as a case of so - called gestational surrogacy , which is the case where the surrogate mother who gives birth to the baby has no genetic link to him or her , the fertilisation having taken place with the PERSON ) of a third woman . Indeed , in order to be able to talk of gestational or traditional surrogacy ( in the latter , the surrogate mother makes her own ovules available ) there must be a biological link between the child and CARDINAL of the CARDINAL intended parents ( in this specific case , Mr PERSON and PERSON ) , a biological link which , as has been seen , is non - existent . \u201d", "In the court \u2019s view , the applicants had thus placed themselves in an unlawful situation :", "\u201c It follows that by bringing a baby to GPE , passing him off as their own son , in blatant infringement of the provisions of our legislation ( PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) governing inter - country adoption of children , Mr PERSON and PERSON have acted unlawfully . Besides any criminal offences which may have been committed ( infringement of section CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which are not within the jurisdiction of this court , it is noted that the agreement entered into between Mrs Paradiso and the company PERSON had unlawful elements since , given the terms of the agreement ( the delivery of Mr PERSON \u2019s genetic material for the fertilisation of another woman \u2019s ovules ) , it was in breach of the ban on the use of assisted reproductive technology ( A.R.T. ) of a heterologous type laid down by section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "In any event , it is pointed out that despite being in possession of the authorisation for inter - country adoption issued by order of this court on DATE , PERSON PERSON and PERSON , as has been stated , intentionally evaded the provisions of Law no . DATE , which provide not only that the intended adoptive parents must apply to an authorised body ( section CARDINAL ) but also for the involvement of ORG ( section CARDINAL ) , the only body competent to authorise entry and permanent residence of a foreign child in GPE ( section CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "The court therefore found it necessary , first and foremost , to put an end to this unlawful situation :", "\u201c It is therefore necessary , above all , to prevent this unlawful situation from continuing , since to maintain it would be equivalent to ratifying unlawful conduct in open violation of the provisions of our legislation .", "Accordingly , it is necessary to remove the minor child from Mr PERSON and ORG and place him in an appropriate structure with a view to identifying a suitable couple to foster the child as soon as possible . ORG of GPE is therefore instructed to identify an appropriate structure and to place the child in it . The NORP legislation on adoption applies to this child in accordance with section PERSON of Law No . CARDINAL , there being no doubt that he is in GPE in a state of abandonment , having been deprived of his biological parents and other relatives , and the mother who gave birth to him having renounced him .", "Admittedly , it can not be denied that the child will in all likelihood suffer harm from being separated from Mr PERSON and PERSON . However , given the age of the child and the short time he has spent with them , the court can not agree with the conclusions of the report by psychologist [ Dr I. ] ( instructed by Mr PERSON and PERSON ) , finding that it is certain that the child \u2019s separation from them would entail devastating consequences . Indeed , according to the literature on this subject , the mere separation from the main care - givers is not a causal agent of a psychopathological state in a child unless other causal factors are present . The trauma caused by the separation from Mr PERSON and PERSON will not be irreparable , given that a search will begin immediately for a couple able to attenuate the consequences of the trauma , through a compensatory process that will encourage a new adaptation .", "It is also pointed out that the fact that Mr PERSON and PERSON ( and in particular PERSON ) have put up with the hardships and the difficulties of GPE ( PERSON has also stated that during one of these interventions her life was at risk ) and have preferred , despite being in possession of an approval for inter - country adoption , to circumvent NORP legislation on this subject gives rise to the doubt and the fear that the minor child may be an instrument to fulfil a narcissistic desire of Mr PERSON and PERSON or to exorcise an individual or joint problem . In the light of the conduct of Mr PERSON and PERSON during the events under examination , all of this throws a consistent shadow over their possession of genuine affective and educational abilities and of the instinct of human solidarity which must be present in any person wishing to bring the children of others into their lives as their own children .", "The separation of the minor child from Mr PERSON and PERSON thus corresponds to the best interests of the child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the court \u2019s decision was enforced on DATE , without their having been informed of the decision in advance .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal ( reclamo ) before ORG . They argued , inter alia , that the NORP courts could not contest the NORP birth certificate . They further requested that no measures be taken concerning the child while the criminal proceedings against them and the proceedings challenging the refusal to enter the birth certificate in the NORP civil - status register were pending .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal .", "ORG found that the child T.C. was \u201c in a state of abandonment \u201d ( in stato di abbandono ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , as the applicants were not his parents . In those circumstances , the question of whether or not the applicants were criminally liable and whether or not there had been an error in the use of seminal fluid of unknown origin was not , in its view , relevant . In ORG opinion , it was not appropriate to await the outcome of the criminal trial or of the proceedings brought by the applicants to challenge the refusal to enter the particulars of the birth certificate in the register . ORG also considered that section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL ( the Private International Law Act ) did not prevent the NORP courts from refusing to comply with certified information from a foreign ORG , and that there was no issue of lack of jurisdiction , since , according to section CARDINAL of LAW , \u201c ... the NORP law governing adoption , fostering , and necessary measures in case of urgency shall be applicable to a foreign minor child who is in [ GPE ] in a state of abandonment \u201d ( cf . also ORG ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . No appeal to ORG lay against that decision ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the public prosecutor at ORG had ordered the preventive seizure of the NORP birth certificate , on the ground that it was an essential item of evidence . In the prosecutor \u2019s view , in all probability the applicants had not only committed the offences with which they were charged , but they had attempted to conceal them . They had , according to him , inter alia , stated that they were the biological parents and had then corrected their versions of events as these were successively disproved .", "CARDINAL . The applicants challenged the preventive seizure order .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeal on the ground of the strong suspicions that they had committed the offences in question . In particular , the court noted the following facts : the first applicant had spread a rumour that she was pregnant ; she had gone to FAC in GPE and implied that she was the natural mother ; she had subsequently admitted that the child had been born to a surrogate mother ; she had stated to the carabinieri on CARDINAL DATE that the second applicant was the biological father , which had been disproved by the DNA tests ; she had thus made false statements ; she had been very vague as to the identity of the genetic mother ; the documents concerning the surrogate motherhood stated that the CARDINAL applicants had been seen by the NORP doctors , which did not correspond to the fact that the second applicant had not travelled to GPE ; the documents relating to the birth did not give any precise date . The court considered that the only certainty was that the child had been born and that he had been handed over to the first applicant against payment of MONEY ( ORG ) . In the court \u2019s view , the hypothesis that the applicants had behaved illegally with a view to having the particulars of the birth certificate entered in the civilstatus register and to circumventing the NORP legislation thus appeared well - founded .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG transmitted the decision regarding the preventive seizure to ORG and indicated that a conviction under section CARDINAL of LAW would deprive the applicants of the possibility of fostering ( affido ) the child and of adopting him or other minors . In the Public Prosecutor \u2019s view , there was therefore no other solution but to proceed with the adoption procedure for the child , and his temporary placement with a foster family had therefore been requested , in accordance with sections CARDINAL of LAW . ORG repeated his request and emphasised that the child had been removed DATE previously , and that he had since been living in a children \u2019s home ( casa famiglia ) , where he had developed meaningful relationships with the persons responsible for his care . He explained that the child had thus still not found a family environment to replace the one that had been illegally provided by the couple who had brought him to GPE . According to ORG , the child seemed destined for another separation , even more painful than that from the mother who had given birth to him and then from the woman who claimed to be his mother .", "CARDINAL . An appeal having been lodged to contest ORG refusal to enter the particulars of the NORP birth certificate in the civilstatus register , ORG declined jurisdiction on DATE . The proceedings were subsequently resumed before ORG . The applicants insisted that the particulars of the NORP birth certificate be entered in the NORP register .", "CARDINAL . By an immediately enforceable decision of DATE , ORG ruled on the transcription of the birth certificate into the NORP register .", "By way of introduction , ORG dismissed the objection raised by the guardian to the effect that the applicants did not have standing to bring an action before that court ; it acknowledged that the applicants had standing to bring proceedings in that they were referred to as the \u201c parents \u201d in the birth certificate that they wished to have entered in the civil - status register .", "However , ORG considered it clear that the applicants were not the biological parents and concluded that there had not therefore been a gestational surrogacy . It noted that the parties were in agreement that the NORP legislation presupposed a biological link between the child and CARDINAL of the intended parents before the term surrogate motherhood could be used . It concluded that the birth certificate was fraudulent ( ideologicamente falso ) and in breach of NORP law . In ORG view , given that there was nothing to show that the child had NORP citizenship , the ORG argument that NORP law was inapplicable ran counter to section CARDINAL of LAW , which stated that the legal parent - child relationship was determined by the national law governing the child at the time of his or her birth .", "ORG added that it was contrary to public order to register the contested birth certificate , since it was fraudulent . It stated that although the applicants had pleaded their good faith , alleging that they were unable to explain why the second applicant \u2019s seminal fluid had not been used in the NORP clinic , this made no difference to the situation and did not alter the fact that the second applicant was not the biological father .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG held that it was legitimate to refuse to register the NORP birth certificate and to grant ORG request that a new birth certificate be issued . ORG therefore ordered that a new birth certificate be issued , indicating that the child was the son of persons unknown , born in GPE on DATE , and that he would be given a new name , determined in accordance with Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Following execution of the decision issued by ORG on DATE , the child was placed in a children \u2019s home for DATE , in a location that was unknown to the applicants . All contact between the applicants and the child was prohibited . They were unable to obtain any news of him .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the child was placed in a family with a view to his adoption .", "CARDINAL . At DATE the guardian asked ORG to give the child a formal identity , so that he could be registered for school without complications . He stated that the child had been placed in a family on DATE , but that he did not have an identity . This \u201c inexistence \u201d had a significant impact on administrative matters , particularly with regard to deciding under what name the child was to be registered for school , for vaccination records , and for residence . While accepting that this situation corresponded to the aim of preventing the applicants from discovering the child \u2019s whereabouts , for his own protection , the guardian explained that a temporary formal identity would enable the secrecy surrounding the child \u2019s real identity to be maintained , while simultaneously enabling him to have access to public services ; for the time being , he was entitled only to use emergency medical services .", "CARDINAL . The case file indicates that this request was granted by ORG and that the child received a formal identity .", "CARDINAL . The Government have indicated that the child has now been adopted .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings to make the child available for adoption were resumed before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicants confirmed their opposition to the child \u2019s placement with third persons . The guardian asked for a statement ruling that the applicants no longer had locus standi .", "ORG asked ORG not to declare the child available for adoption using the name originally given to him , on the ground that , in the meantime , he had opened a second set of proceedings requesting that the child be declared available for adoption under his new identity ( child of unknown parents ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG held that the applicants no longer had standing to act in the adoption proceedings , given that they were neither the child \u2019s parents nor members of his family within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW . The court stated that it would settle the question of the child \u2019s adoption in the context of the other set of adoption proceedings , referred to by ORG .", "CARDINAL .
