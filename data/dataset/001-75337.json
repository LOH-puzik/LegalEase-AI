The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his wife , PERSON , who was of NORP origin , had CARDINAL children , a boy T. born on DATE and a girl A. born on DATE . The family lived together in GPE until DATE when PERSON took the children to GPE where she took up residence with L. as her female partner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON applied for divorce and for custody of the children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parents reached an interim agreement whereby the children would stay in GPE with their mother for the moment and the applicant have the right to CARDINAL supervised visits .", "CARDINAL . The applicant states that on DATE he became aware that the children \u2019s maternal grandmother had made a complaint to the social services against B. \u2019s female partner , PERSON , alleging that she had sexually abused A. There is some indication in the documents that the applicant may also have lodged a complaint on this ground . The criminal charges lodged against PERSON were later dismissed by the courts .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , it appears that the applicant took proceedings with a view to having the children returned to GPE under LAW . However , by decisions of ORG dated DATE and by ORG dated DATE , the applicant \u2019s application for return was refused , principally on the ground that he had voluntarily entered into an interim agreement that the children remain in GPE with their mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG awarded sole custody of the children to the mother , finding that the children had lived with their mother in GPE since DATE and that it was in their best interests to remain with her . On DATE , ORG upheld this decision , as did ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was however granted visiting rights . It appears that the children visited him in GPE during GPE and DATE and met with him in GPE in DATE ( twice ) and DATE ( CARDINAL times ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , B. , the mother , died . The children were then aged DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . The applicant returned immediately to GPE . On DATE , he lodged a request that the children , still living with L. , be placed in a foster home and that he be accorded visiting rights .", "CARDINAL . Applications for custody of the children were lodged by both PERSON and by the applicant . During DATE , the children were interviewed twice by a team consisting of a child psychiatrist and CARDINAL psychologists . They expressed their wish to stay with L. because they felt safe and were used to living with her . A. was reported as stating that she would like to meet the applicant occasionally but only when she wished , while PERSON was reported as stating that the applicant was not part of his family and that he neither wanted to meet him or live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant saw the children CARDINAL times during DATE in supervised contact visits . There was another meeting outside the social workers\u2019 LOC .", "CARDINAL . In a ORG report dated DATE , it was stated that , following the mother \u2019s death , PERSON \u2019s influence on the children had increased and the children turned to her for support . It was noted that the children were not able to act against ORG will , because they were dependent on her at that time . Consequently , the children were in a state of conflict , as they were not allowed to like the applicant . The report considered that the lack of contact with their close relatives endangered the development of their identity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after oral hearings at which the applicant , PERSON and another CARDINAL witnesses , including a number of social workers involved in the case , were heard , ORG awarded custody to the applicant . It observed inter alia , that according to the evidence , PERSON had been involved in bringing up the children since their return to GPE . According to a number of social workers involved in the case , the applicant was considered fit to be a custodial parent as , for example , in dealing with conflicts he had always put the children \u2019s best interests first . The meetings between the children had also gone well . It concluded that in fact both PERSON and the applicant were fit as custodians .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the views of the children , ORG recalled that according to a statement of DATE given by a social worker during previous proceedings , ORG \u2019s wishes were not entirely his own ; he had been influenced by PERSON , his mother . His wishes were in contradiction with what he had told the social worker about the meetings with the applicant which had taken place . The social worker had noted that the fact that PERSON did not want PERSON to travel to see the applicant was significant and pointed out that it would be very important for the children \u2019s psychological development that they develop a more constructive view of the applicant . It recalled the evidence of a friend of PERSON and PERSON , who had given evidence before the court , had stated that the children \u2019s attitude towards the applicant had begun to be more positive from DATE , but that no meetings had taken place as from DATE , apparently due to the fact that the children \u2019s activities were given priority and the meetings with the applicant tended to be proposed at short notice . T. had told her that it would be alright to meet with the applicant if he could decide when . A. had told her that she would like to meet with the applicant DATE , but not at that time . T. \u2019s attitude towards meeting the applicant was therefore fairly positive . Following B. \u2019s death , everything had changed when the applicant came to see his children . As he allegedly had said that the law would make the children move to live in GPE , they did not want to meet with him anymore . According to this witness , the children feared moving to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that T. \u2019s attitude during the recent interviews was in contradiction with what had happened during the meetings with the applicant , which had all gone well . It found that none of the persons heard before the court had said that the children feared the applicant and concluded that , as the atmosphere in which the children had been living had obviously affected their wishes and hopes , it was not possible to analyse what their true views really were . Therefore , their expressed wishes could not be decisive when deciding the case . Noting that the case should be decided in accordance with the children \u2019s best interests , it decided that , given the strained relations between PERSON and the applicant , custody should be awarded to the latter . It was evident that PERSON would not be able to encourage the relationship between the children and the applicant enabling them to stay in contact . Therefore , ORG ordered that custody be awarded to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Pending L. \u2019s appeal against the decision , the enforcement of the order was suspended by ORG on DATE . According to the evidence of various social workers , the children had reacted to his expressed intention of taking them to GPE by refusing to meet with him unless PERSON was present . The applicant allegedly refused to meet with the children under these terms . The applicant \u2019s attempts to enforce contact visits also apparently failed due to the children \u2019s refusal to see him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG overturned the decision concerning the suspension and requested ORG and its NORP counterpart to report on the case . During the period DATE , pursuant to the court \u2019s request , the children were interviewed CARDINAL times by social workers , CARDINAL times in the presence of ORG and twice alone . The social workers\u2019 efforts to arrange a meeting between the children and the applicant were unsuccessful due to the children \u2019s opposition . It was reported by the social worker in later oral evidence that the children continued to express their wish to live with PERSON During the interviews , the children had turned to PERSON for support and been dependent on her . The children \u2019s memories of the applicant were , however , good . Nothing suggested that the children would have had any reason to feel unsafe in the applicant \u2019s company . According to CARDINAL of the social workers at the meetings , the wishes that the children expressed were more dependent on the wishes of PERSON than their own will . According to the evidence given by other witnesses in ORG , including other social workers , the children expressed their wish to be left alone and that they wanted to stay in GPE every time the applicant was brought up for discussion . They seemed to fear moving to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , it appears that the applicant applied to ORG for its original order to be enforced . This request was refused on DATE . His appeal to ORG was later rejected on DATE as meanwhile it had reached a fresh decision in the case . An application by the applicant to have the children placed in a foster home away from PERSON was also dismissed by ORG on DATE and his appeal rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after an oral hearing over DATE during DATE and at which the applicant and PERSON were heard as well as QUANTITY other witnesses from the ORG proceedings and CARDINAL new witnesses , ORG upheld ORG judgment . It ordered that the children move to live with the applicant on DATE , after a transitional period during which the children could meet with the applicant DATE and DATE during DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , ORG agreed that both PERSON and the applicant were fit to have custody : nothing suggested that they would not be fit . Given the ages of the children , it considered that their view had to be taken into account , but it was also evident that the strained relationship and litigation between the applicant and PERSON , and later on PERSON , had had influence on their view . It considered that the negative attitude towards meeting with the applicant was based on the fear of having to move to GPE . Nothing suggested that the children feared the applicant as such . Although the children were as mature as other children their age , they could not however be given the absolute right to decide on their future , particularly in light of their extremely difficult situation at that time . Notwithstanding the law on enforcement , the court did not consider that in deciding on custody it was bound to follow the opinion even of a child aged DATE or more . Concluding that the decision should be based on what was in their best interests , it found that the relationship between the children and the applicant was very important for a well - balanced development . It furthermore found that the fact that the applicant had said that he would allow the children to keep in touch with PERSON was in the best interests of the children . While it was true that the children appeared closer to PERSON and their environment ( including their home , school , hobbies and close personal relations ) would stay the same if custody was awarded to PERSON , ORG concluded , nonetheless , that the children \u2019s views did not correspond to their best interests . A situation which would lead the children and the applicant drift further apart was not in their best interests . Accordingly , it ordered that the applicant be awarded custody from DATE after a transitional period of increased contact with the children .", "CARDINAL . The applicant visited GPE in DATE , DATE and DATE , requesting visits with his children . On DATE , the applicant arrived in GPE and requested to see the children DATE . The social worker contacted PERSON to inform her of this and reported that the children refused . They allegedly wanted PERSON or another person to be present whereas the applicant refused any third party involvement . On CARDINAL occasion , in DATE , did a visit take place when it was agreed between the parties that the children see the applicant at their maternal grandmother \u2019s . However , only T. appeared , accompanied by a friend and CARDINAL of L. \u2019s lawyers . On this occasion , an incident occurred , the accounts of which vary but to which the police were called . T. subsequently informed his social worker that he was afraid of his father , who had tried , T. alleged , to keep him in the grandmother \u2019s apartment by force and stated that he did not wish to see him again . The children did not appear at the next meeting in DATE . They had already informed him that it would serve no purpose for him to come to GPE as they did not wish to see him . The social workers had several meetings with the children during this period and also made contact with their school seeking to persuade the children to attend therapy sessions . The children were recorded as stating that the applicant only made critical comments and demands and held strong views that they did not wish to live their friends and the environment they knew and that they did not trust their father . T. stated that he feared that his father would attempt to force them to leave GPE .", "CARDINAL . L. applied for leave to appeal . On DATE , ORG granted PERSON leave to appeal and suspended the enforcement of ORG order . PERSON applied for an oral hearing , requesting that the parties , and possibly also the children , be heard . In his submissions to ORG in reply , the applicant applied for interim visiting rights and for the current psychological state of the children to be examined . He also requested that if PERSON \u2019s request for an oral hearing was granted ORG should rehear the evidence presented before the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG gave judgment on the outstanding issues ( ORG Reports CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . It re - iterated that it had rejected the request for an interim order as being purposeless and the request for a psychological examination as being unnecessary . It also rejected the request for an oral hearing as unnecessary in the circumstances and for the reasons set out in its judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG recalled that , according to LAW , the issue of custody had to be decided with regard to the child \u2019s best interests and that if the custodial parent of the children died , custody could be given either to the other parent or to another person , depending on where the best interests of the child lay . It agreed with both the lower courts that the applicant and PERSON were both fit to act as custodians . Both children however had said that they wanted to stay in the environment which they knew and with L. Their views had been thoroughly examined before both ORG and ORG and although the conflict between the adults had apparently disturbed the relationship between the children and the applicant , there was nothing to suggest that their wish to remain with PERSON was not their own independent opinion , in particular given their age and maturity .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to section CARDINAL of the Act on the Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody and Access Rights and recalling that T. was DATE was DATE , found that a custody decision which required the children to move would not be possible to enforce . Having regard to the purpose of awarding custody , it would not be in the children \u2019s best interests to issue a custody order to a parent to whom they could not be transferred against their will . As the relations between the applicant and L. were bad , there was no reason to consider that it would be possible for the applicant to have custody while they continued to live with L. as that would render it impossible to take practical decisions concerning the children \u2019s lives . In the circumstances of this case , it was therefore not in the best interests of the children to transfer custody to the applicant against their will but custody should be awarded instead to the person with whom they were currently living .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to remark that future contact visits could be carried out under agreement or court order but that given the age of the children it would be dependent on their willingness to see the applicant . It underlined that according to LAW , the custodian of children was under an obligation to co - operate in order to promote and maintain relationships between children and a parent . It did not make any order on the point . The applicant had not made any application in that regard .", "CARDINAL . ORG therefore overturned the decisions of the lower courts and awarded custody to L.", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s renewed request for the children to be placed in a foster home .", "CARDINAL . Custody of children is governed by LAW and Right of Access with regard to Children ( laki CARDINAL lapsen huollosta ja tapaamisoikeudesta , lag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ang . v\u00e5rdnad om barn och umg\u00e4ngesr\u00e4tt \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) . LAW provides that the aim of such custody is to ensure the child \u2019s balanced development and well - being , regard being had to the latter \u2019s special needs and wishes , as well as to encourage a close relationship between the child and the parents .", "CARDINAL . The court may order that custody of a child be entrusted to CARDINAL or more persons together with , or instead of , the parents ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . It may transfer custody from the parents to other persons only if , from the child \u2019s point of view , there are particularly strong reasons for doing so ( section QUANTITY ) . It is also empowered to decide on access ( section CARDINAL ) . The aim of access is to secure a child \u2019s right to maintain contacts with a parent with whom he or she is not living ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In deciding on matters of custody and access the competent court must take into account the wishes and interests of the child in accordance with the following considerations : primary emphasis must be placed on the interests of the child and particular regard should be had to the most effective means of implementing custody and access rights in the future ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE and section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ; the child \u2019s views and wishes must , if possible and depending on its age and maturity , be obtained if the parents are unable to agree on the matter or if the child is being cared for by a person other than its custodian or if it is deemed necessary in the latter \u2019s interests ; the consultation must be carried out in a tactful manner , taking into account the child \u2019s maturity and without causing harm to its relations with the parents ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
