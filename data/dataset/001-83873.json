The applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE and lives in Hafnarfj\u00f6rdur .", "CARDINAL . The present case has its background in a real estate sale by the applicant to PERSON in DATE , relating to a property at FAC in GPE . The relevant sales agreement of DATE referred to a summary report describing the property , which included the following statement : \u201c The house has recently been renovated on the outside , except for windows and glass . New roof tiles . Garage renovated windows partly . Wooden parquet flooring in need of repair . Great location in the west part of GPE . Leakage in cellar has not been remedied . Seller will have that done . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON complained to the real estate agent that he had discovered a leak from the roof of the house and that the repair which had previously been done to the roof had covered only parts of it . Many new or newly discovered flaws on the property could be traced back to the leak in the roof . Moreover , PERSON claimed compensation from the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Following a report issued on DATE by a court appointed expert , PERSON brought compensation proceedings before ORG , claiming a discount on the purchase amount due to defects as well as compensation for the damage to the property .", "CARDINAL . After holding an oral hearing , at which the applicant was represented by a lawyer and both parties were heard and evidence was presented , including a report by a court appointed expert , ORG , sitting with CARDINAL professional judge and CARDINAL expert judges , by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , found in favour of PERSON and against the applicant . It ordered the applicant to pay PERSON CARDINAL NORP kr\u00f3nur ( ISK ) , plus default interest as from DATE , and ISK CARDINAL for legal costs ( value added tax included ) .", "ORG judgment included , inter alia , the following reasons :", "\u201c The plaintiff [ PERSON ] received the property in DATE . The plaintiff noticed a leak in the house in DATE , after a DATE with bad weather . The engineers report verified that there had been a leak on the roof . In accordance with the summary report for the sale of the house , where the property is described in writing , which also was available at the signing of the contract for sale , it is stated that there are new roof tiles on the roof . As has been verified throughout this process this was not the case . Furthermore it is not the understanding of the court that the plaintiff should have seen this fault during routine inspection of the house or should have seen whether the tiles were new . It has also been stated in the engineers report that the roof leaked and has caused damages to windows and window frames . It is therefore the understanding of the court that the defendant [ PERSON ] guaranteed that the roof tiles were new , and that the plaintiff should have been able to trust that the roof would not leak , even if the house is an old CARDINAL .", "By selling the property without the proper qualities , the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in accordance with the general rule of CARDINAL . paragraph , chapter CARDINAL of the laws then valid nr . CARDINAL regarding liquid assets . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against ORG judgment , challenging the latter \u2019s conclusions that she was liable to pay PERSON compensation or , in any event , claiming that the amount be reduced . PERSON was then given until DATE to notify ORG of whether he intended to submit any pleadings in the case , failing which it would be presumed that he would request confirmation of ORG judgment and that the case would be adjudicated in accordance with LAW , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Concurrently with her appeal , the applicant asked that a new expert be appointed by ORG in order to evaluate especially the supporting surface under each tile and to evaluate the necessity of changing the supporting surface ( roof cardboard ) if tiles were to be changed on the roof . ORG granted the request and appointed expert B.", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant submitted to ORG a writ of appeal dated DATE , which was deposited on DATE together with the case - documents pursuant to LAW . The writ reiterated the applicant \u2019s claims , enclosing copies of her request to ORG to appoint an expert and to take a statement from PERSON for use at a hearing before ORG . It moreover outlined the facts of the case and stated the applicant \u2019s grounds for appeal . It referred to her claims , arguments and evidence submitted in the ORG proceedings . The applicant protested against the assessment made by the expert before ORG . She maintained that PERSON had examined the house , including the roof , in detail before signing the acquisition offer . The offer of purchase had been issued on DATE and PERSON had taken possession of the property on DATE , whereas the sales agreement had been issued on DATE . Thus , the applicant argued , when the sales agreement had been issued , PERSON had been in possession of the property for DATE without ever mentioning that there had been a discrepancy between the retail accounts of the house and the state of the house with regard to roof tiles . It was unthinkable that PERSON had not known that the tiles were old at the time of the sales offer and certainly upon signature of the sales agreement . It was improbable that PERSON , who was an active person of keen interest , would not have taken a look at the roof . The slope of the roof had been quite steep and could be seen from the side - walk . It was preposterous to claim that the wording of the retail could be stretched to mean something other than what could be seen in plain sight . This was the essence of the case .", "The applicant further maintained that not until DATE had PERSON raised the matter in dispute and only then had he made an issue about the specific wording of the summary report describing the property with regard to new roof tiles . His indifference in this respect should lead to his forfeiting any right that he might have claimed . This indifference was further illustrated by the fact that he alleged to have discovered a leak shortly after taking possession of the property but had made no comments during the signing of the sales agreement or the deed . The applicant announced that she would make submissions about the confusing interpretation made by ORG regarding the wording of the summary report describing the property and the alleged flaw on the roof . She would submit new documents to ORG when they were ready , notably a new assessment by a court appointed expert .", "In addition , the applicant requested ORG to take witness evidence from persons who had provided repair and restoration services to PERSON in order to enlighten ORG on whether they had noticed that PERSON himself had inspected and examined the roof during DATE .", "Finally the applicant stated that the case would be further presented and commented on in the course of an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . As at DATE G had not indicated that he would plead his case before ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter of DATE from ORG to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , he was given until DATE to complete her further collection of evidence under Article CARDINAL ) . The lawyer then requested an extension with reference to the need to await the completion of the assessment by the court - appointed expert , which ORG granted until DATE . On the same ground ORG granted a further extension until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked , by way of e - mail , for a further extension of DATE . On DATE ORG registrar conveyed the following message to the lawyer by e - mail :", "\u201c The possibility is still open that the respondent [ G ] will be allowed to present defences in ORG , although he did not make a notification to that effect . An essential requirement is a letter from the respondent to the ORG , asking to be allowed to present his defences and explaining the reasons why no notification of defences was made . The letter must be accompanied by the appellant \u2019s [ the applicant \u2019s ] approval of this being allowed . This is assuming that judgment has not already been rendered on the basis of LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . \u201d", "By return e - mail in DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer declared that he would forward this information to the other side . He also asked whether an extension of DATE would be granted . There is no record of any formal reply to this request .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer reiterated his request to be granted respite , until DATE , in order to present the awaited new expert appraisal . He also informed that PERSON had omitted to show up at a hearing and affirmed that it was now clear that PERSON would not make submissions . He further objected that ORG interpretation of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG meant that the applicant was prevented from defending her case and stressed that a short summary of facts could not replace an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE G \u2019s lawyer sent the office of ORG the following e - mail message :", "\u201c Further to our conversation DATE , I can confirm that my client \u2019s [ G \u2019s ] desire is not to take any action on account of [ the applicant \u2019s lawyer \u2019s ] request for a reopening of the case and to have the case adjudicated in the present form , without further collection of evidence or presentation in court . His requests were , or were to be , only an affirmation of the judgment appealed from . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a letter to ORG of DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer protested against its interpretation of Article CARDINAL ) . It unduly restricted her possibilities of pleading her case in writing and orally . It meant that the case file from ORG and her appeal to ORG would constitute the only basis for ORG adjudication . Therefore , she asked ORG to grant her leave to at least plead her case in writing , her observations submitted so far having only been a \u201c skeleton \u201d version of the submissions she had intended to make to ORG . So far she had had no opportunity to elaborate on her appeal with references to case - law , scientific research or writings , explanation of the factual aspects of this case or the documentary evidence . The lawyer stressed that in so far as he was concerned the case was not ready for examination . In the circumstances it was the adversary party who had been allowed to decide the fate of the case while the applicant had practically lost standing in the case .", "CARDINAL . At an oral hearing held by ORG on DATE expert B presented his report and answered questions from the applicant \u2019s lawyer .", "CARDINAL . With a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer transmitted to ORG the expert PERSON \u2019s appraisal , ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE confirming the appraisal , CARDINAL photographs of the house and some other documents . According to the applicant , the new appraisal showed that ORG had overestimated the costs of repair , should ORG find that the applicant had promised that the roof had been completely renovated with new tiles at the time of sale . The applicant further commented on the photographs of the roof from DATE and on the front page of expert PERSON \u2019s report . She invited the members of ORG to carry out an on site visit to see that the state of the roof could be seen from the side walk . She also pointed out that her request to ORG to hear persons who had worked on the house for G during DATE had been denied by him , which the applicant had interpreted as an attempt to conceal information about the fact that G had thoroughly checked the roof and been aware of its state during DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , adjudicating the case on the basis of the written case - file , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld ORG judgment . ORG held inter alia :", "\u201c The plaintiff appeared before ORG and claimed that she knew there had been repairs on the roof in DATE or so . She also claims that the repairs were only that some of the oldest tiles or cracked tiles were exchanged for others and only in certain areas of the roof . When asked , the plaintiff did not remember if this had been especially discussed in detail with the defendant , when he examined the house the first time . She did however tell the defendant that the roof had been repaired and that it no longer leaked . It is the court \u2019s ruling that the plaintiff should have known that this description in the summary report for the sale of the house and the description of the current status of the roof , would give the defendant the wrong impression of the actual condition of the roof . The defendant should have reason to trust the description of the house in the summary report for the sale of the house and therefore have reason to believe the house had been renovated . Since the roof had not been fully renovated , the defendant has a right to compensation . In accordance with this and in other respects ORG refers to the ORG ruling and proceedings and verifies the ORG ruling hereby . \u201d", "In accordance with the above , the applicant paid ISK CARDINAL ( MONEY ( ORG ) to PERSON", "CARDINAL .
