This request was apparently granted .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE ORG refused to release the applicant . The decision stated that the district prosecutor had erred in relying on LAW as the offence of which the applicant had been accused was punishable , in the case of a minor , by DATE imprisonment , and therefore LAW , which concerned \u201c serious wilful offences \u201d ( those punishable by DATE imprisonment ) was not applicable . However , it was clear from the findings of the investigation that there existed a \u201c prima facie \u201d danger of absconding , committing further offences , or obstructing the investigation , such a danger being a ground for detention pending trial under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL .
