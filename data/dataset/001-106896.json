NORP The applicant , ORG , is a company registered in GPE as from DATE , which has its registered address in GPE . It was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company acquired CARDINAL pieces of land measuring CARDINAL , CARDINAL and QUANTITY , respectively , and QUANTITY in total , at a price of MONEY ( ORG ) DATE ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) , with the aim of developing the land for commercial purposes .", "CARDINAL . At the time of purchase , the land situated at the upper reaches of \u201c the valley \u201d was included within the \u201c limits to development \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( DATE ) issued by the relevant authority , namely ORG . The applicant alleged that the land within the development zone as delineated by LAW was at the time considered to have development potential , even though the exact layout and type of development had not yet been determined . The area in which the applicant company \u2019s property was situated was marked as a \u201c white area \u201d , which , according to the applicant , meant that no specific type of development had yet been determined for the site , as opposed to a \u201c green area \u201d , which meant that it was to be conserved and that no development would be allowed . Moreover , the land was situated within the boundaries of development . It followed , according to the applicant , that development of the zone was surely permissible .", "CARDINAL . DATE land development in GPE was generally governed by the guidelines set out in LAW . During this time , the applicant company alleged that various properties in the vicinity of its land , situated within the \u201c white area \u201d , had been developed ( mostly for residence purposes ) and the Government had built social housing complexes in the area . In DATE ( after the scheduling order referred to in the paragraph below came into effect ) permission was given to build a road , giving access to CARDINAL private hotels situated further in from the applicant company \u2019s land , at the lower reaches of \u201c the valley \u201d .", "CARDINAL . By a notice ( no . CARDINAL ) published in ORG of DATE , the site owned by the applicant was declared to be scheduled for conservation purposes in terms of section CARDINAL of LAW ( DATE ) ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the successor to ORG , considered the site to form part of the valley protection zone and its buffer zone , entailing level - CARDINAL protection , namely the lowest level of protection for scheduling purposes . In consequence , the use of the land was limited to agricultural purposes .", "CARDINAL . A number of different applications lodged by the applicant company on unspecified dates , asking for permission to develop the land , were dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company filed an appeal with ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) against the scheduling of its land . It argued that the area at issue should not have been scheduled in this way since there was no reason to conserve it , apart from the maquis vegetation found at its north eastern edge . Nor could the land be considered to be rural , bearing in mind that it was surrounded by a highly urbanised area . According to its experts\u2019 reports , the applicant company was of the view that the area should be considered suitable for commercial development and not a valley protection zone , a notion which was not mentioned in the Structure Plan . Nor could it be considered to be a rural conservation area , an area of ecological importance or a site of scientific importance .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the applicant company \u2019s appeal was dismissed and the contested scheduling confirmed . Referring to the findings of ORG , the ORG considered that the land at issue served as a buffer zone to the ecologically important \u201c valley \u201d and , therefore , qualified as a level - CARDINAL protection area of ecological importance , mainly acting as a buffer zone to the more important \u201c valley \u201d . The inclusion of buffer zones had been mentioned in the Structure Plan \u2019s Explanatory Memorandum as falling under the heading of areas of ecological importance and sites of scientific importance . Moreover , the applicant company had acknowledged the existence of the maquis vegetation , and this in itself allowed for the lowest level of protection according to LAW and therefore sufficed , according to the applicable law , in order to declare the land to be scheduled for conservation purposes . As to the use of the land for agricultural purposes , although this was not established by ORG , this was the actual use to which the land was being put at the relevant time . In conclusion , the land was indeed of ecological / scientific importance , and even though the term \u201c valley protection zone \u201d was not a legal term , it was understood as falling under the definition of areas which were to be protected according to Policies ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company appealed to ORG . During these proceedings , in DATE , it further complained that the ORG was infringing its property rights since : ( i ) ORG had acted outside the parameters of the law by de facto expropriating the property , as the LAW did not provide for the scheduling of property for valley protection or buffer zones ; ( ii ) the scheduling was not required for a public purpose ; and ( iii ) the LAW did not provide for payment of compensation upon the scheduling of property , notwithstanding that its property had diminished in value ( allegedly from ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The applicant company insisted that when it had acquired the land it was already situated in a developed area and , indeed , part of its land had been taken for the purpose of building a road to guarantee access to the built - up entertainment zone . However , as a consequence of the scheduling in question , the land had become worthless and the applicant company \u2019s investment futile . Moreover , since other permits had been issued for development of the area notwithstanding its environmental value , the applicant company had been discriminated against in the dismissal of its requests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG referred the matter to the constitutional jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) , in the exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction , upheld the applicant company \u2019s claims in part . It considered that , although there had not been a de facto expropriation , the ORG had been controlling the use of the applicant company \u2019s property , thereby limiting the latter \u2019s right of ownership . It was not necessary to go on to consider the legality of the measure , as this was deemed to be within the competence of the ordinary courts . It then considered it relevant that when the applicant company had purchased the land , it had been aware that the land was situated in a \u201c white area \u201d , which meant that only limited development could take place . In the meantime the land had become a \u201c green area \u201d , and development was no longer possible , in order to protect the valley on the periphery of which the applicant \u2019s land was situated . The court held that while it was true and unfortunate that the area surrounding the valley was fully developed , it was legitimate and in the general interest for ORG to protect what was left of it . However , it considered that there had been a violation of the applicant company \u2019s rights since no compensation had been granted to it following the permanent scheduling of its land . Lastly , it held that the applicant company had not been discriminated against , as the only land in a comparable position , namely land which had been scheduled but on which development had nevertheless been permitted , was the road built by the Government . This constituted a project in the general interest , as opposed to the applicant company \u2019s project , which was solely commercial and in the interest of private parties . Thus , the difference in treatment had been justified .", "CARDINAL . MEPA and the Attorney General appealed and the applicant company cross - appealed . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected a request by the applicant company for leave to submit new evidence .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld in part the first - instance judgment and quashed the rest , dismissing all the applicant company \u2019s original claims . It emphasised that the applicant had purchased the land when it had been designated as a \u201c white area \u201d . Thus , the potential for development of the land was limited and uncertain , since no guidelines or framework had yet been put in place to regulate it . In fact , as happened in the applicant company \u2019s case , its land was eventually scheduled as a level CARDINAL buffer zone to \u201c the valley \u201d , which was highly protected ( level CARDINAL ) , being an area of ecological and scientific importance . The scheduling of the applicant company \u2019s land had been in accordance with the relevant policies ( namely , ORG CARDINAL ) and the Structure Plan , which provided that \u201c small to medium scale physical developments can be considered , provided no suitable alternatives exist and features of ecological and scientific interest are protected , in so far as a suitable environmental impact assessment is made \u201d . Moreover , at the date of judgment the land had become a green area according to the CARDINAL Local Plan .", "CARDINAL . In answer to the applicant company \u2019s grounds of appeal , it confirmed that the validity ( legality ) of the scheduling was a matter for the ordinary courts to decide , and that the site was worth protecting in the general interest . The measure of control over use of the property had further restricted its use in that after the original designation of the land as a white area , which might have permitted full development in the future , the land had subsequently been scheduled so as to limit its use to \u201c small to medium scale physical development \u201d , according to certain conditions . However , bearing in mind the ORG \u2019s margin of appreciation in imposing planning restrictions , the aim of the measure had been legitimate and it could not be said that every scheduling of property required adequate compensation . In the present case the applicant company had not been certain that it would be granted permission to develop the land in the future , as the land had been designated as a \u201c white area \u201d ; thus , the applicant company had in fact engaged in a commercial speculation project . It followed that the applicant company did not have a legitimate expectation that it would be granted such permits and in consequence it could not be said that it had suffered a disproportionate burden . In the light of the foregoing , no right to compensation arose .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , as to the complaint regarding discrimination , it considered that the ORG could reasonably have dispelled environmental concerns when building a road in the public interest , a matter which was within its margin of appreciation . Similarly , the authority had not used its discretion manifestly without reasonable foundation when it had failed to schedule the housing estate built by the ORG in an area closer to the valley than the applicant company \u2019s land , and such a difference in treatment had not been illegitimate or oppressive .", "CARDINAL . Following the constitutional referral mentioned above , on DATE proceedings resumed before ORG , which by a judgment of DATE dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal . ORG considered that all the grounds raised by the applicant company had been dealt with in the ORG \u2019s decision and any argument relating to the fact that the ORG had based its decisions on reasons which had not been mentioned in the original scheduling order could not be entertained since this matter had never been brought to the attention of the ORG . Moreover , the applicant \u2019s appeal before the ORG only concerned matters of fact and not of law , and therefore no appeal to ORG could lie on this ground , such appeals being limited only to points of law in accordance with section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW . It further considered that the scheduling had not been done on the basis of the rural character of the land , but for the reasons enunciated by the ORG , which had been acting within the parameters of the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE MEPA adopted ORG , setting up a framework upon which the authority would base its decisions on land use and development for DATE . The applicant company submitted that , as transpired from this plan and the refusal of its applications , further development was to be carried out in the area surrounding \u201c the valley \u201d . Indeed , the DATE plan extended the development zone which had been earmarked in the DATE schedules and DATE plan . In DATE Notice was amended to remove an area of land from the scheduled property ( not owned by the applicant company ) and extended the scheduled boundary to cover the entire valley system , delineating the buffer and constraint zone . It further transpired that there was a plan to build a further arterial road which would pass right through the applicant company \u2019s land and , according to evidence given during the domestic proceedings , a further descheduling would take place to accommodate this project .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , LAW of LAW , reads as follows :", "\u201c The decisions of ORG shall be final . An appeal shall lie to ORG constituted in terms of article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG from such decisions only on points of law decided by ORG in its decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
