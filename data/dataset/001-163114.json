At the time of the events which are the subject of the present application he was an investment consultant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and ORG , a commercial company incorporated under NORP law , signed an acknowledgment of debt deed before a notary . Under the terms of the deed the applicant declared that he had borrowed MONEY ( ORG ) from ORG and undertook to repay that sum with interest by DATE . The deed also contained choice of law and jurisdiction clauses according to which it was governed \u201c in all respects \u201d by NORP law and the NORP courts had nonexclusive jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising out of it . The applicant \u2019s address was given as PERSON Street in GPE and was indicated as follows :", "\u201c [ FOR ] GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION , I , ORG , of [ no . ] , PERSON [ street ] , CARDINALrd floor , GPE , GPE , [ postcode ] GPE ... , ( \u2018 the PERSON ) ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG brought proceedings against the applicant in LOC ( PERSON , GPE ) , alleging that he had not repaid the above - mentioned debt and requesting that he be ordered to pay the principal debt together with interest . In the GPE proceedings the applicant submitted that he had in fact already repaid the debt before the proceedings were instituted in the NORP court , not by paying the sum of money in question to ORG but by other means linked to the capital of ORG parent company . However , he acknowledged that there was no documentary evidence of this . The respondent Government contested the applicant \u2019s submission .", "CARDINAL . In an order dated DATE ORG authorised the \u201c sealing and filing of the writ of summons \u201d . On DATE a \u201c specially endorsed writ \u201d was drawn up , describing the facts of the case in detail . It gave the applicant \u2019s address as G. Street in GPE , the address indicated on the acknowledgment of debt deed .", "CARDINAL . Since the applicant was not resident in GPE , ORG made an ex parte application to the same ORG on DATE seeking a fresh order enabling a summons to be served on the applicant outside the country and requiring him to appear within DATE from the date of issuing of the summons . The claimant company \u2019s lawyer produced an affidavit declaring that the defendant was habitually resident at an address in FAC in GPE and could actually receive judicial documents at that address . The applicant , for his part , contended that it would have been physically impossible for him to receive the summons at the address in question , which was simply the address at which he had signed the loan contract and the acknowledgment of debt deed in DATE and was not his home or business LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that notice of the proceedings be served on the applicant at the address provided by the claimant company . The applicant was summoned to appear or to come forward within DATE of receiving the summons . If he did not do so the court would make no further attempt to contact him and would instead post all future announcements concerning the case on the court noticeboard .", "CARDINAL . An affidavit produced by an employee of the firm of lawyers representing ORG showed that , in accordance with the court order , the summons had been sent by recorded delivery to the address in FAC in GPE on DATE . However , the copy of the summons furnished by ORG indicated that it had been drawn up on DATE . The slip produced by the NORP postal service stated that the summons had been sent on DATE to the address in PERSON Street , and had been delivered and signed for on DATE . However , the signature on the slip did not appear to correspond to the applicant \u2019s name . The applicant claimed never to have received the summons .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant did not appear , ORG ruled in his absence on DATE . It ordered him to pay the claimant MONEY or the equivalent in NORP pounds ( ORG ) , plus interest at an DATE rate of PERCENT of the aforementioned amount from DATE until payment of the debt . The applicant was also ordered to pay costs and expenses in a gross amount of ORG MONEY , plus interest at an DATE rate of PERCENT . According to the judgment , the final version of which was drawn up on DATE , the applicant had been duly informed of the hearing but had not attended . The judgment did not state whether the decision was final or indicate possible judicial remedies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG applied to ORG ( PERSON pils\u0113tas ORG priek\u0161pils\u0113tas tiesa , GPE ) seeking recognition and enforcement of the judgment of CARDINAL May CARDINAL . In its request the company also sought to have a temporary precautionary measure applied . It stated that the applicant was the owner of real property in GPE district ) which according to the land register was already mortgaged to a bank . Accordingly , fearing that the applicant might seek to evade enforcement of the judgment , it asked ORG to place a charge on the property in question and record the charge in the land register . Lastly , it requested that the applicant be ordered to pay the costs . In its request the company gave as the applicant \u2019s place of residence an address in \u010c. Street in GPE which differed from the address previously notified to the NORP court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned examination of ORG request , informing the company that the request contained a number of defects which it had DATE to correct . In particular , ORG had not explained why it had given an address in \u010c. Street when the applicant was supposedly resident in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted a corrigendum in which it explained , among other points , that according to the information contained in the register of residents ( ORG re\u0123istrs ) , the address in \u010c. Street was the applicant \u2019s officially declared home address . As to the address in PERSON Street , the company \u2019s representatives had assumed it to be the applicant \u2019s actual residence . In that connection the NORP Government provided the ORG with a copy of a letter from the authority responsible for the register of residents according to which , prior to DATE , the applicant \u2019s officially declared address had been in \u010c Street .", "CARDINAL . NORP In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled that the corrigendum submitted by ORG was insufficient to remedy all the defects in its request . The court therefore declined to examine the request and sent it back to the company . The latter lodged an appeal with ORG ( PERSON apgabaltiesa ) , which on DATE set aside the order of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case to ORG in order for the latter to examine the request for recognition and enforcement as rectified by the corrigendum of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE issued without the parties being present , ORG granted ORG request in full . It ordered the recognition and enforcement of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and the entry in the Garkalne municipal land register of a charge on the property owned by the applicant in that municipality . The applicant was also ordered to pay the costs .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , it was not until DATE that he learned , from the bailiff responsible for enforcement of the NORP judgment , of the existence of that judgment and of ORG order for its enforcement . On DATE ( DATE ) he went to ORG , where he acquainted himself with the judgment and the order . The respondent Government did not dispute these facts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not attempt to appeal against the NORP judgment in the NORP courts . However , he lodged an interlocutory appeal ( blakus s\u016bdz\u012bba ) against the order of CARDINAL DATE with ORG , while asking ORG to extend the time allowed for lodging the appeal . Arguing that there was nothing in the case file to confirm that he had been given notice of the hearing of DATE or of the order issued following the hearing , he submitted that the DATE period laid down by LAW should start running on DATE , the date on which he had taken cognisance of the order in question .", "CARDINAL . In an order of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request and extended the time - limit for lodging an appeal . It noted , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ... It is clear from the order of DATE that the issue of recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment was determined in the absence of the parties , on the basis of the documents furnished by the claimant , [ ORG ] . The order further states that the defendant may appeal against it within DATE from the date of receipt of the copy [ of that order ] , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "The court considers the arguments advanced by the applicant , P. ORG , to be wellfounded , to the effect that he did not receive the order ... of DATE until DATE , this being attested to by the reference in the list of consultations [ appended to the case file ] and by the fact that the order , served [ on the applicant ] by the court , was returned on DATE ... It is apparent from the documents appended to the appeal that the applicant has not lived at the declared address in [ \u010c. ] Street since DATE ; this confirms ... the statement made by his representative at the hearing , according to which the applicant no longer lives at the above - mentioned address .", "Accordingly , the DATE period should ... run from the date on which the applicant received the order in question ...", "Further , the court does not share the view of the representative of [ ORG ] that the applicant himself is responsible for his failure to receive the correspondence because he did not declare his change of address promptly , and that the time allowed [ for lodging an appeal ] should not therefore be extended . The fact that the applicant did not take the necessary legal steps concerning registration of residence is not sufficient to justify a refusal by the court to allow him to exercise the fundamental rights guaranteed by the ORG as regards access to the courts and judicial protection , including the right to appeal against a decision , with the consequences this is likely to entail . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his grounds of appeal before ORG the applicant contended that the recognition and enforcement of the NORP judgment in GPE breached ORG ( ORG ) No CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( \u201c ORG ) and several provisions of ORG . He submitted CARDINAL arguments in that regard .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , the applicant argued that in accordance with LAW corresponding in substance to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , third subparagraph , of ORG ) , a judgment given in default in another Member ORG could not be recognised if the defendant had not been served with the document instituting the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence . He maintained that he had not been duly informed of the proceedings in GPE , although both the NORP lawyers who had represented the claimant company in ORG and the NORP lawyers who had represented it in the NORP courts had been perfectly aware of his business address in GPE . In support of that allegation he submitted that he had had professional dealings with the NORP lawyers , who had telephoned him and sent faxes to his office , and had met the NORP lawyers in person . Hence , they must all have been aware of his business address . He added that he could also have been reached at his home address in PERSON , as he had a residence there that was officially declared in accordance with the law and the lawyers could have consulted the municipal land register , where the property he owned was registered under his name . However , instead of serving notice of the proceedings on him at one of those addresses , which had been known and accessible , the lawyers had given the courts an address which they should have realised could not be used .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the applicant argued that , under the terms of Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , second subparagraph , of LAW , a judgment had to be enforceable in the ORG of origin in order to be enforceable in the Member ORG addressed . In the instant case , there had been a threefold breach of those requirements . First , the claimant had only submitted the text of the NORP court judgment to the NORP court and not the certificate required by ORG to ORG . In that connection the applicant acknowledged that under LAW in which enforcement was sought could , in some circumstances , exempt the claimant from the obligation to produce a certificate . However , in the present case ORG had not made clear whether it considered that the claimant could be exempted from that obligation and , if so , for what reason . Second , the NORP judgment had contained no reference to the fact that it was enforceable or to possible judicial remedies . Third , although a judgment had to be enforceable in the country of origin in order to be enforced in accordance with ORG , the claimant company had not produced any documentary evidence demonstrating that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE was enforceable in GPE . In view of all these circumstances , the applicant contended that the judgment could on no account be recognised and enforced in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal on the merits , quashed the impugned order and rejected the request for recognition and enforcement of the NORP judgment .", "CARDINAL . F.H. Ltd. lodged an appeal against that judgment with the ORG of ORG , which examined it on DATE . At the start of the hearing ORG submitted copies of several documents to the ORG , including the certificate referred to in LAW and Annex V thereto . The certificate was dated DATE and had been signed by an acting judge of ORG . It stated that the document instituting the proceedings had been served on the applicant on DATE . The last part of the certificate , intended for the name of the person against whom the judgment was enforceable , had been left blank . When asked to comment on these documents the applicant \u2019s lawyer contended that they were clearly insufficient to render the judgment enforceable .", "CARDINAL . In a final judgment of DATE ORG quashed and annulled ORG judgment of DATE . It granted ORG request and ordered the recognition and enforcement of the NORP judgment and the entry in the land register of a charge on the applicant \u2019s property in Garkalne . The relevant extracts from the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ... It is clear from the evidence in the case file that the GPE ORG judgment became final . This is confirmed by the explanations provided by both parties at ORG hearing on DATE , according to which no appeal had been lodged against the judgment , and by the certificate issued on DATE ... As [ the applicant ] did not appeal against the judgment , his lawyer \u2019s submissions to the effect that he was not duly notified of the examination of the case by a foreign court lack relevance [ nav b\u016btiskas noz\u012bmes ] .", "Having regard to the foregoing , the ORG finds that the judgment of ORG ( GPE ) of CARDINAL May CARDINAL must be recognised and enforced in GPE .", "Article CARDINAL of the [ GPE I ] Regulation provides that a foreign judgment may under no circumstances be reviewed as to its substance ; in accordance with section CARDINAL ) of LAW , once such judgments have been recognised they are to be enforced in accordance with the conditions laid down by that PERSON . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , basing its decision on ORG judgment , issued a payment order ( izpildu raksts ) . The applicant complied immediately with the terms of the order and paid the bailiff employed by the claimant company a total of CARDINAL NORP lati ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) , comprising ORG CARDINAL for the principal debt and ORG in enforcement costs . He then requested that the charge on his property in Garkalne be lifted . In CARDINAL orders dated DATE the judge with responsibility for land registers ( PERSON noda\u013cas tiesnesis ) refused the request . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the ORG of ORG , which , in an order of DATE , lifted the charge on his property ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
