From DATE to DATE the applicant was detained at FAC . It transpires from the documents before the ORG that he was held in different remand prison cells where he had CARDINAL of living space .", "CARDINAL . After his conviction and transfer to ORG to serve his sentence , on DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings for damages . He argued that the conditions in which he had been held at FAC had been degrading : the cells were overcrowded , full of rats and worms , appropriate toilet facilities were lacking , the cells were hot in DATE and cold in DATE , the cell walls were damp , and the roof of the remand prison was covered with asbestos , which put the applicant \u2019s health in danger .", "CARDINAL . The FAC Prison administration responded that they attempted to maintain the statutory norm of QUANTITY per remand prisoner held in a cell ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but that had not always been possible . The administration acknowledged that the facility was \u201c constantly overcrowded ( nuolat perpildytas ) \u201d , because the institution could not refuse to admit persons brought there . The buildings of the remand prison were very old , they were repaired periodically and it was not possible to repair them entirely .", "CARDINAL . The case was first examined by ORG , which rejected the applicant \u2019s claim , inter alia , for having missed the statutory time - limit . ORG then remitted the case for fresh examination .", "On DATE ORG noted that the applicant had missed , by DATE , the statutory DATE time - limit to lodge a claim for damages . The court nevertheless restored the time - limit of its own motion , having observed that the applicant had lodged his claim belatedly partly because he had not obtained in time information necessary for his civil claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG established that the applicant had been held in overcrowded cells for DATE , given that for that duration he had been held in cells where he had QUANTITY of personal space . On the basis of LAW , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG and ORG judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , the first - instance court held that because of the overcrowding the applicant \u2019s dignity had suffered . Nonetheless , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s remaining complaints about the detention conditions in FAC as not actually proven . It also noted that he had not complained to any authority of the unsanitary conditions in GPE while he had been held there . The court also took into account that after having been transferred to FAC , the applicant had undergone a medical examination . The doctors had established that he was healthy , which provided evidence that the conditions of his detention in GPE had had no impact on his health .", "CARDINAL . Having taken into account the economic conditions in GPE , namely , a minimal DATE salary of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) and an average DATE salary of LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) , as well as the NORP administrative ORG practice in similar cases , the court awarded the applicant LAW ( EUR CARDINAL ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage on account of overcrowding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on appeal , ORG underlined that notwithstanding the general rule that a person claiming damage bore the burden of proving it , the lower court had actively used available means for obtaining evidence : on several occasions it had requested the prison in question to provide additional information as to the applicant \u2019s detention conditions and his state of health . That information had been provided to the court .", "CARDINAL . ORG also established that for DATE the applicant had been kept at FAC in inadequate conditions on account of overcrowding , understood by the domestic law requirement to guarantee prisoners QUANTITY of personal space in a remand prison cell . It can be deduced from ORG analysis of the details of the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE that for DATE he was held in cells where he had QUANTITY of personal space . ORG also noted that for most of his detention , namely for DATE , the applicant had been held in cells where his personal space had been even QUANTITY . The court noted that , despite the overcrowding , for DATE out of CARDINAL the applicant had been held in CARDINAL cells where heating , ventilation , sanitary and electric systems had been renovated in DATE , thus providing him with somewhat better material conditions ( geresn\u0117mis buitin\u0117mis s\u0105lygomis , nors ir neu\u017etikrinant minimalios gyvenamojo ploto normos ) . Nevertheless , he had been held in overcrowded cells for TIME a day , and FAC had provided no evidence that the lack of living space had been remedied in any other way . For the court , such conditions went beyond the inevitable element of discomfort connected with detention ( it referred to GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALXI ) , degraded the applicant and were in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that ORG would sometimes hold that finding a violation constituted sufficient just satisfaction . In the instant case , however , ORG considered that the degree of the applicant \u2019s suffering called for pecuniary compensation . Moreover , the sum of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL was not sufficient . Yet , ORG took into account that the applicant had not lodged a claim for damages until DATE after his detention in such conditions had ended , by which time the court considered that the impact on a person \u2019s emotional and physical suffering had decreased ( laiko veiksnys asmens patirtas dvasines ir fizines kan\u010dias menkina , jos bl\u0117sta ) . The fact that the applicant had not instituted court proceedings for damages until DATE after his release from FAC led the court to the conclusion that his mental suffering ( dvasin\u0117 skriauda ) was not so significant . Furthermore , when detained , the applicant was DATE . During the hearing before the first - instance court he had acknowledged that he was in a good state of health . Accordingly , the conditions of his detention in GPE had had no negative effect on his health . On the evidence , no other complaints , except for those concerning overcrowding , were found to be substantiated in his case . Lastly , the court held that the applicant had been partly favoured by the first - instance court \u2019s initiative to restore the time - limit for lodging a claim for damages . It was therefore reasonable and just to award LAW ( approximately ORG CARDINAL ) to compensate him for any non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was born in DATE . When he lodged his application with the ORG in DATE , he was serving a prison sentence at FAC .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant was held at ORG ( PERSON at\u0117mimo viet\u0173 ligonin\u0117 ) in GPE in the following conditions :", "- DATE in a room measuring QUANTITY , containing CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY per bed ) , and in a room measuring QUANTITY , containing CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY per bed ) ;", "- DATE in a room measuring QUANTITY , containing CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY per bed ) ;", "- DATE and DATE in a room measuring QUANTITY , containing CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY per bed ) ;", "- DATE in a room measuring QUANTITY , containing CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY per bed ) ;", "- DATE in a room measuring QUANTITY , containing CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY per bed ) ;", "- DATE in a room measuring QUANTITY , containing CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY per bed ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant later instituted court proceedings for damages , claiming that he had been held in inhuman and degrading conditions at ORG , because the rooms had been overcrowded , the hospital did not have a hygiene certificate , and the rooms had been dilapidated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly accepted the complaint . It established that as of DATE , the health - care authorities had CARDINAL times established breaches of hygiene requirements at ORG . In particular , the hospital showers , toilets and other LOC were not properly cleaned and disinfected , patients who were suffering from an open form of tuberculosis and psychiatric patients took showers together with other patients ( without being isolated , against the domestic law requirements ) , and many parts of the hospital needed renovation . The court also established that ORG was operating without a hygiene certificate , which was against the domestic law .", "CARDINAL . As to overcrowding , the hospital provided information about the applicant \u2019s stay therein , but could not specify how many persons had been held with him in the room . The first - instance court considered the lack of appropriate documentation as a flaw on the part of the hospital . The court then itself counted how many square metres the applicant could have had during each period of his stay at that hospital , dividing the size of each room by the number of beds therein . The court thus established that the applicant had been held in overcrowded rooms , and that the domestic norm had been \u201c seriously breached \u201d ( nustatyta minimali PERSON pa\u017eeista PERSON ) , given that the norm was that hospitals had to provide QUANTITY per bed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s right to be treated in appropriate conditions had been breached . It underlined that the flaws could not be justified by a lack of financing for the hospital . The court considered that compensation of LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) would be sufficient for the applicant , taking into account the principles of reasonableness and justice , and the economic situation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the above decision . The higher court recognised that the applicant had been held in overcrowded rooms and in improper sanitary conditions . However , patients at ORG had the opportunity of being in the open air from TIME to CARDINAL p.m. , which eased their situation as regards the overcrowding and also justified a lower award for non - pecuniary damage . Moreover , the conditions of the applicant \u2019s stay in the hospital , whilst unsatisfactory from a hygiene point of view , had not put his health or life at risk . Those conditions had had no lasting effect on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Mr Ivanenkov was born in DATE . When he lodged his application with the ORG , he was serving a sentence at ORG .", "CARDINAL . It transpires from the court decisions that from DATE to DATE the applicant spent time in dormitory no . CARDINAL at ORG in the following conditions :", "- DATE in a dormitory - type room measuring QUANTITY , which contained CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY of living space per inmate ) ; and", "- over DATE in a dormitory - type room measuring QUANTITY , containing CARDINAL beds ( that is , QUANTITY of living space per inmate ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant sued ORG for damages , claiming that the conditions of his detention had been degrading on account of overcrowding and the lack of suitable sanitary facilities . He relied , inter alia , on ORG recommendation No . R(CARDINAL ) and on LAW . To support his claim , he submitted a report of DATE drawn up by ORG ( ORG visuomen\u0117s sveikatos centras ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG took note of ORG report of DATE no . RCARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , issued in reply to a complaint by the inmates , to the effect that the ORG correctional facility had a shortage of furniture , dilapidated cells , insufficient lighting , a shortage of cleaning equipment and a shortage of toilets , and that renovation was necessary . The court also took note of another document DATE a report by ORG ( PERSON visuomen\u0117s sveikatos centro tarnyba prie PERSON apsaugos ministerijos ) \u2013 to the effect that complaints made by another inmate in the ORG facility were warranted and that there had been \u201c gross violations of hygiene norms ( \u0161iurk\u0161t\u016bs higienos norm\u0173 pa\u017eeidimai ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the parties in essence did not dispute that the applicant had been held in premises where he had had between QUANTITY of personal space , and that there had been a shortage of toilet facilities and furniture . Such breaches of the domestic norms on hygiene were far from being short term ( ne trumpalaikiai ) . Even so , the applicant \u2019s claim that his physical health had been damaged was dismissed as not proven . Given that he had had to stay within the dormitory only during TIME and had been able to move about during DATE in the prison yard , take exercise outside on basketball , football and volleyball pitches , and that the LOC had ventilation and the toilets were in a separate room , the court decided that it was reasonable and just to award the applicant LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG agreed with the assessment of the applicant \u2019s conditions in ORG . It noted that the applicant had never complained about the conditions to the ORG facility administration . Furthermore , there was no proof that the ORG administration had deliberately sought to degrade the applicant or to treat him inhumanely . Lastly , ORG observed that ORG quite often ( neretai ) held that the finding of a violation was sufficient just satisfaction . It considered that that would be an appropriate solution in the applicant \u2019s case , even though his right to be held in conditions as set out by the domestic law had been breached . Accordingly , no pecuniary award was made .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . When he lodged his application with the ORG , he was serving a sentence at the CARDINALnd Correctional Home - Open Colony of FAC .", "CARDINAL . It transpires from the documents before the ORG that from DATE to DATE the applicant spent time in the CARDINALnd Correctional Home - Open Colony in the following conditions :", "- DATE in a dormitory - type room , where he had QUANTITY of personal space ;", "- over DATE in a dormitory - type room , where he had QUANTITY of personal space ;", "- the remaining time , which appears to be a little bit less than DATE , in a dormitory - type room , where he had CARDINAL of personal space .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant instituted court proceedings for damages , claiming that during his entire stay in GPE the facility was overcrowded . Moreover , the number of inmates held was constantly rising , even though no new premises were built . The PERSON administration stated that there were plans to modernise that facility by DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG partly accepted the applicant \u2019s complaint , having noted that under the domestic law personal space in dormitory - type rooms had to be no less than QUANTITY ( see paragraphs DATE and DATE below ) . The court awarded the applicant LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG maintained the award of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) for non - pecuniary damage , caused by the ORG \u2019s failure to observe domestic law norms . That being so , the court underlined that overcrowding in the applicant \u2019s case was compensated for by free movement during DATE . Moreover , the dormitory \u2019s rooms in GPE had natural light and ventilation , and the sanitary facilities ( asmens higienos patalpos ) were separated from the sleeping premises . There was no evidence that overcrowding had had an impact on the applicant \u2019s health . The NORP court relied on the ORG \u2019s findings in GPE v. GPE ( no . PERSON , ORG CARDINALVIII ) , whereby it held that merely a lack of living space provided for the inmate did not necessarily amount to a violation of LAW . Last but not least , the applicant \u2019s personal living space was close to the required domestic norm . It was also noteworthy that the applicant had complained only about lack of space . Having taken into account the cumulative effect of the conditions the applicant was held in , ORG thus rejected his assertion that the conditions of his stay in GPE had been in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE was born in DATE . When introducing the application with the ORG in DATE , he was serving his sentence at ORG .", "CARDINAL . It transpires that after conviction , in DATE the applicant was placed in ORG pataisos namai ) , where he was held until DATE .", "Specifically , from DATE to QUANTITY DATE the applicant had to stay in dormitory - type room no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL measuring QUANTITY with CARDINAL other inmates ( that is , QUANTITY of living space per inmate ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , when he was already in ORG , the applicant complained to the administration of ORG that he had not had adequate living space in the latter facility and that the lighting in his room had been poor . When ORG denied responsibility , the applicant appealed to ORG , the body that oversees the NORP prisons . The latter replied that , because of the lack of available space , ORG administration could not always guarantee the minimum personal space of QUANTITY to each inmate required under domestic legislation . However , any lack of personal space during the night was compensated for by the inmates\u2019 ability to move about within the confines of FAC during DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then instituted court proceedings for damages . ORG asked the court to dismiss the claim , admitting that \u201c because of overcrowding in prisons throughout GPE at this time , ORG was not always able to provide the inmates with the minimum living space , as provided for by the domestic law ( \u0161iuo metu d\u0117l \u012fkalinimo \u012fstaig\u0173 visoje GPE perpildymo PERSON pataisos nam\u0173 administracija ne visada gali visiems nuteistiesiems suteikti \u012fstatymais nustatyt\u0105 minimal\u0173 gyvenam\u0105j\u012f plot\u0105 ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that there were no particular data with regard to the exact number of inmates held together with the applicant . That being so , having regard to the material provided , namely photographs of CARDINAL beds in room no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL , the court interpreted all the uncertainties in the applicant \u2019s favour , acknowledging a violation of his rights under the domestic legislation , on account of overcrowding . It established , however , that the applicant had not complained about the conditions of his detention during his stay in the facility at issue . The court held that the applicant \u2019s argument that he had not complained because he had feared retribution from the prison administration had no objective grounds ( niekuo nepagr\u012fstas ) . Furthermore , there was no proof that the overcrowding had had an effect on the applicant \u2019s health . Moreover , any lack of space during the night was compensated for by the applicant being able to move about within the facility during DATE . The court acknowledged that , according to the domestic case - law and the case - law of the ORG , in the event of inadequate detention conditions a person was considered to have sustained non - pecuniary damage . However , pecuniary compensation was not indispensable in order to protect infringed rights .", "CARDINAL . In parallel court proceedings , the applicant also complained of insufficient lighting in his dormitory . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the lighting was very near the requirements as set by the applicable domestic legislation ( CARDINAL lx , CARDINAL lx and CARDINAL lx , whereasCARDINAL lx was required under the legislation ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Traknys was born in DATE . When he lodged his application with the ORG in DATE , he was serving a prison sentence at FAC .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE and from CARDINAL to DATE PERSON was held in FAC .", "It can be deduced from the NORP court decisions that during the first period of his detention in GPE he spent DATE in cells where he had CARDINAL and QUANTITY of living space .", "During his second stay in GPE , the applicant spent DATE in cells where he had QUANTITY of personal space .", "CARDINAL . The applicant later instituted court proceedings for damages , complaining of overcrowding and deplorable conditions on account of the poor sanitary situation . He alleged that the cells were infested with mice and cockroaches , had insufficient lighting and were damp . He relied on a ORG report to the effect that CARDINAL of the cells had mould on the ceiling .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG acknowledged that there had been overcrowding during the first period of the applicant \u2019s detention in GPE , on account of the prison authorities\u2019 failure to keep up with the domestic law requirement to provide CARDINAL or , later , QUANTITY of personal space in the remand prison cells . The court had no doubts that staying in cells that did not meet hygiene standards had caused the applicant mental suffering . Furthermore , even though the applicant had objected to being placed with inmates who smoked , in breach of the domestic legislation , he had been held with smokers for ninety - nine days ( the domestic court referred to PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) , and with previously convicted inmates for DATE , even though it was his first time in prison . On account of those multiple breaches of the applicant \u2019s rights , without explicitly acknowledging a violation of LAW and taking into consideration the economic situation in GPE , the court considered it just to award compensation of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the second period of the applicant \u2019s detention , by a decision of DATE ORG also acknowledged overcrowding . Taking into account the short duration of the violation and the economic situation in GPE , an award of LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) was made .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was born in DATE . When he lodged his application with the ORG in DATE , he was serving a prison sentence at ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE , Mr ORG was held at FAC , where he spent DATE . During that time , he was held in a cell measuring QUANTITY , housing QUANTITY detainees ( that is , CARDINAL QUANTITY of personal space ) ; in a cell measuring QUANTITY , housing QUANTITY detainees ( that is , CARDINAL and QUANTITY of personal space ) ; and in a cell measuring QUANTITY , housing QUANTITY detainees ( that is , between CARDINAL and QUANTITY of personal space ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted court proceedings . His written complaint was sent from ORG , claiming that the conditions at the ORG facility had been deplorable : the remand prison was overcrowded , the cells were \u201c unsanitary \u201d , and he had been held together with smoking inmates , even though he was a non - smoker . During the hearings before ORG the applicant also complained that the cells lacked proper ventilation and that the toilets were not separated from the cells .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acknowledged a breach of the applicant \u2019s rights under the domestic law , as regards overcrowding . The court noted his statement during the hearing that he had complained to ORG about being kept with smokers . Although the applicant had not complained of a violation of LAW , the first - instance court nevertheless deemed it proper to examine his complaint in the light of the ORG \u2019s case - law criteria . Having done that , the court considered that the applicant \u2019s rights had been violated on account of overcrowding , as it was understood under the domestic law , and that while it was close to a breach of LAW , it did not pass that threshold . Lastly , the applicant had instituted court proceedings DATE on which he had left ORG , by which time his psychological and physical suffering had diminished . Accordingly , there was no need to award him any pecuniary compensation . The court did not address the applicant \u2019s complaint of unsanitary conditions .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG partly granted the applicant \u2019s appeal . It considered , however , that in his appeal the applicant had touched upon not only those issues which he had raised in his complaint to the first - instance court , but had also complained about other aspects of his detention . In particular , according to ORG , in his appeal the applicant had argued that the cells had lacked an artificial ventilation system , that the natural ventilation system had been insufficient , and that the toilet in the cell was of the type that should only be installed outside ( kameroje esantis tualetas ir pati kamera buvo vienoje patalpoje , o sanitariniam mazgui \u012frengti panaudotas lauko tualeto principas ) . The appellate court considered that the applicant should have raised those issues in his complaint ( skunde ) to the first - instance court . Accordingly , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegations of lack of ventilation and proper toilet facilities .", "CARDINAL . As to overcrowding , ORG noted that the number of inmates at FAC often changed during DATE . On the basis of the documents provided by ORG , ORG established that for DATE the applicant had been held in \u201c overcrowded \u201d cells and for DATE he had been held in cells where the minimum personal space was \u201c very close to , but did not meet the [ domestic ] norms \u201d . The ORG facility had thus breached the applicant \u2019s statutory right to be held in a cell where he would have CARDINAL or QUANTITY of space . Having reviewed the ORG \u2019s case - law on conditions of detention , ORG considered that the inconveniences suffered by the applicant during DATE went beyond those inherent in detention and were intense enough to amount to a violation of LAW . The court nevertheless noted that there was no evidence in the case that the remand facility had intentionally sought to debase the applicant . The applicant could go out for a stroll for TIME per day , thus spending some time outside his cell . Lastly , ORG observed that there was no evidence in the file that the applicant had ever asked the remand prison administration to be held in a non - smoking cell . Nor was there any evidence in the file that he had been held in unsanitary conditions . The appellate court considered that the applicant had lodged his complaint more than DATE after his release from FAC , and thus had had a possibility to gather evidence and to provide it to the court . Having taken into account the economic situation in the country , ORG awarded the applicant LTL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) for his suffering ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
