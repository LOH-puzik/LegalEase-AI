SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Per - Runo Hurtig , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in Hammerdal . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant retired on DATE . On DATE he applied for the first time for disability benefits under LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) . Claiming that he was in need of assistance and had extra expenses due to problems with the urine tract , the intestines and the back , he requested a disability allowance as from DATE . By a decision of DATE ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ; hereinafter \u201c the Office \u201d ) of GPE rejected the application , finding that the applicant 's needs or costs were not such as to make him eligible for disability benefits . The applicant appealed , and by judgments of DATE and DATE , respectively , ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE upheld the ORG 's decision . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) refused leave to appeal .", "The applicant applied anew in DATE . The ORG dismissed the application on DATE and ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE , both without an examination on the merits , finding that the matter had already been finally determined .", "A third application was lodged by the applicant , assisted by legal counsel , on DATE . He submitted a medical certificate issued on DATE by Dr PERSON , chief physician at FAC hospital , which purportedly indicated that his need of assistance existed already in DATE , i.e. before he retired . He also claimed that he had needs and costs which he had failed to state in the earlier proceedings . The third application should thus be examined on the merits , as the previous ones had been determined on insufficient evidence .", "By a decision of DATE the ORG again dismissed the case without an examination on the merits , finding that the matter was res judicata due to the earlier court examination .", "On DATE , upon appeal , ORG quashed the ORG 's decision , finding that , as the applicant had invoked new circumstances , his application should be examined on the merits under LAW .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the application , finding that the applicant 's needs or costs due to the impairment that had occurred before DATE were not such as to make him eligible for disability benefits .", "The applicant appealed on DATE and requested ORG to hold an oral hearing during which PERSON should be heard . He also wished to present his own submissions orally .", "The applicant has claimed that he was contacted by the court in DATE . Allegedly , the court suggested that a hearing could be held on DATE but later stated that it had been postponed . No evidence of these contacts has been submitted , however .", "By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided that an oral hearing was not necessary . It further rejected the appeal against the ORG 's decision on disability benefits , agreeing with the reasoning given by the ORG . In regard to the request for a hearing , the court noted that PERSON had been furnished with a copy of the ORG 's investigation and had stated that he had no objections to the ORG 's assessment .", "The applicant appealed to ORG and complained about the lack of an oral hearing before ORG . He maintained , inter alia , that , before examining the case , that court should have given him an opportunity to make further submissions in the case .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal . On DATE ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) also refused him leave to appeal .", "According to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW , a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits , provided that , before reaching DATE , he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time - consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses . The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation . It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses .", "A decision by ORG under LAW may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and ORG .", "The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of ORG , ORG ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Section CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The proceedings are in writing .", "An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case .", "In ORG and ORG an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings , unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing . \u201d", "The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "According to the preparatory documents to LAW , an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in CARDINAL situations in particular : firstly , when it is necessary to hear a witness , an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and , secondly , when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . It was stressed , however , that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it ( see Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It was further stated , in respect of the third paragraph of section CARDINAL , that a party 's request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter , as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case . Still , other circumstances may be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party 's understanding of a future decision in the case . Nevertheless , if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case , there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing ( p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
