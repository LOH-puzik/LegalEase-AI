ORG also pointed out that a person who has been charged with a criminal offence is at all times entitled to ask for a lawyer and to receive a form for giving authority to act . It concluded that the disputed measure was a disproportionate restriction on freedom of correspondence and on the rights of the defence . It consequently set aside ORG decision and awarded the applicants costs of QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to the general principles of criminal procedure , a suspect is under no obligation to make any statements .

CARDINAL ( DATE ) , part I a ) , p. CARDINAL , and vol . CARDINAL ( DATE ) , part I a ) , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

Letters jeopardising the purpose of detention or prison security shall not be forwarded ; letters relating to pending criminal proceedings shall be forwarded only if they form part of correspondence with a defence lawyer . A prisoner shall be informed if a letter is not forwarded . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , ORG considered the constitutionality of various provisions of GPE of DATE . As regards the restrictions on freedom of correspondence , it noted the following ( translation from NORP ) :", "\" Section CARDINAL lays down in particular that letters \u2018 whose content is improper\u2019 or which relate to pending criminal proceedings shall not be forwarded . Correspondence with co - prisoners or former co - prisoners is likewise prohibited . On the other hand , communications addressed to supervising authorities or to a defence lawyer are not subject to any restrictions .", "The applicant alleges that prohibiting communications \u2018 whose content is improper\u2019 goes much too far and leaves too great a discretion to the officials responsible for monitoring correspondence . In his submission , the prohibition should apply only to communications whose content is \u2018 illicit\u2019 . This change of wording would make no appreciable difference , since the second concept is likewise very imprecise in the present context . The applicant does not dispute the need to prohibit the dispatch of letters with a particular type of content , and that is the very purpose of the monitoring . It is clear , therefore , that any correspondence which might assist in the preparation of escape plans or the commission of fresh criminal offences , or which could have an impermissible influence on criminal proceedings ( danger of collusion ) must be prohibited . Even assuming that it is in principle desirable to maintain contacts with the outside world , these contacts must not compromise the purpose of detention . Moreover , the supervising authorities must also be given the right to hold back any communications which might jeopardise order in the prison . Conversely , the authorities can not refuse to forward communications which do not jeopardise either the purpose of detention or order in the prison and which are permissible in their quantity ( s. CARDINAL ) . It is accordingly of little consequence whether or not the supervising authority approves the content of such communications ( cf . , on the legal situation in GPE , ORG decision of DATE , vol . CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL ) . It is not possible to make an accurate general statement of where the line should be drawn , since it depends on the particular circumstances of each case . The general principle laid down in the disputed ordinance accordingly can not be criticised as being unconstitutional , at least not if regard is had to the fact that correspondence with the supervising authorities and defence lawyers is not subject to any marked degree of control . \" ( Judgments of ORG , vol .
