POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Administrative proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court)", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ledi Bianku;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was involved in administrative proceedings . He claimed reinstatement to work in the police after his dismissal from ORG ( PERSON ) and a refusal to hire him by the police , both given in DATE . The first - instance decision was issued by the Chief Officer of ORG ( ORG ) on DATE . That authority refused to hire the applicant and to count the period since DATE towards his service .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested that his case be re - examined . On DATE the Chief Officer upheld the contested decision . On DATE ORG quashed both the first- and secondinstance decision , finding that the authority had failed to establish the content of the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Officer discontinued the proceedings , finding that in so far as the applicant had requested to be hired by the police , that request could not be determined by way of an administrative decision . In so far as he claimed that the period from DATE should be counted towards the period of his service in the police , this claim had no basis in substantive law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant again requested that his case be reexamined . On DATE the Chief Officer upheld the contested decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision to ORG . That court gave a judgment in the case and dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE , finding that the contested decisions were lawful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant requested that legal - aid assistance be granted to him for the purposes of lodging a cassation appeal against this judgment with ORG . His request was granted and the local ORG assigned a lawyer to his case on DATE . The applicant gave a power of attorney for that lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer lodged a cassation appeal with ORG together with a request for retrospective leave to appeal out of time ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that court refused to grant leave to appeal out of time . The court found that the legal - aid lawyer had been informed that he had been assigned to represent the applicant on DATE . On DATE that he had been served with the power of attorney , authorising him to act on the applicant \u2019s behalf . It was only on DATE following the latter date that the lawyer had had a realistic opportunity of starting to act on the applicant \u2019s behalf in the preparation of the cassation appeal . Hence , the DATE time limit for lodging a request for a retrospective leave to appeal out of time and lodging a cassation appeal together with it had started to run on DATE . Consequently , such a request should have been submitted to the court within DATE , on DATE at the latest . The applicant \u2019s lawyer had failed to comply with that time - limit as he had submitted his request for leave together with the cassation appeal only on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed against this decision , arguing that the DATE time - limit to prepare a cassation appeal together with the request for retrospective leave to appeal , counted from DATE when the legal - aid lawyer had received the power to act on the party \u2019s behalf , was unrealistic and that it should be contrasted with the normal thirtyday timelimit for preparation and lodging of a cassation appeal in normal circumstances . A legallyaided party was unduly penalised by that difference in the relevant time - limits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court dismissed his appeal , sharing the conclusions of the firstinstance court .", "CARDINAL .

II FZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ORG held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the time - limit by a legally - aided applicant could be admitted for examination .", "CARDINAL . When legal aid has been granted and the time - limit for the submission of a cassation appeal has already expired , it is open to the legally - aided party to submit the appeal together with a request for leave to appeal out of time made under sections DATE and CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Procedure before Administrative Courts ( e.g. ORG FZ CARDINAL of DATE and ORG , I CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) . In certain cases the courts stated that such a request should be submitted within DATE from the date on which the lawyer obtained a power of attorney from the party , which date is considered as the date on which the impediment to lodging an appeal ceased to exist ( e.g. ORG , II ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) , or from the date when the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file ( e.g. the ORG , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a number of its recent decisions ORG acknowledged the difficulties which legallyaided parties experienced in connection with lodging their cassation appeals against judgments of the first - instance administrative courts . It expressed the view that they should not be penalised for the fact that their requests for legal aid were not processed speedily enough . It analysed relevant case - law of the administrative courts and noted that the manner in which DATE limit for lodging cassation appeals was determined had led to divergent results . It held that it was necessary to determine the relevant time in a manner compatible with effective access to the highest administrative court and which ensured equal treatment for parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legalaid scheme and by privately hired lawyers . The court held that the time - limit for a legally - aided party started to run only on DATE when a legal - aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal and not when he or she was informed of having been assigned to the case . The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigorous and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal - aid system illusory . In any event , the cassation appeal had to be lodged within DATE from DATE on which the party was informed of the appointment of the legal - aid lawyer ( I FZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ; PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; II OZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ; I CARDINAL CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ; ORG of DATE ; I FZ CARDINAL of DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
