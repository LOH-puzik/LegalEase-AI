On CARDINAL DATE officers of ORG , assisted by customs officers , seized CARDINAL kilograms of hashish imported from GPE in a van adapted for the purpose .

Contrary to what ORG judges said , there was indeed disproportionality in the instant case between the isolated offence Mr ORG was found guilty of and his interests as defined and protected in LAW Mr ORG was born in GPE , is married to a national of a ORG member ORG and is the father of CARDINAL NORP children ...

But I can not bring myself to accept his expulsion , and for good reason . Please understand me , PERSON President , or at least try to : since my husband went to prison my children have not been themselves ; they are suffering terribly and are constantly having to be examined by psychologists . But it is not just my children and I who are suffering : there is also the whole of my husband \u2019s family , particularly his mother , who is DATE and a diabetic .
