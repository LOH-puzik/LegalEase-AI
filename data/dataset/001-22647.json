THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are the PERSON family , all GPE nationals , resident in GPE :", "( CARDINAL ) NORP Dr PERSON , born in DATE ; husband", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON , born in DATE ; wife ; and their children", "( CARDINAL ) Mr PERSON , born in DATE ,", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON , born in DATE ,", "( CARDINAL ) Mr PERSON , born in DATE ,", "( CARDINAL ) Mr PERSON , born in DATE .", "They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , of FAC , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The first and second applicants decided to put themselves forward to adopt a child . In DATE , they were approved by ORG as prospective adopters and were matched with a child , PERSON , who was born on DATE and in the care of ORG ( \u201c the local authority \u201d ) . They stated that they made it clear that they could not envisage adopting a \u201c boisterous \u201d child or any child who presented challenging behavioural or physical disabilities .", "During the matching process , the applicants were not shown inter alia ORG DATE school report which noted that there were \u201c constant arguments when he was with others \u201d and that he \u201c can be aggressive \u201d , a report of a previous foster carer which depicted J. as a very troublesome presence in the family home and a report by ORG which stated that J. would find it harder to find adoptive parents given his history of difficult behaviour . The documents on PERSON \u2019s background gave a clear picture of a troublesome and difficult child with a disturbed background , far from the child whom the applicants envisaged they would be caring for .", "On DATE , ORG moved into the applicants\u2019 home . It was immediately apparent that he had serious behavioural problems , that he was prone to persistent foul moods and required constant one to CARDINAL attention .", "The applicants began to discover information that demonstrated that J. had not been a suitable child for them to adopt and felt very strongly that they had been severely misled by the local authority . Had full and candid disclosure been made they felt that they would never have accepted J. as suitable for their family . For example , they were not told of the possibility that J. might have had a genetic disposition to fragile X syndrome until shortly after he arrived in their home ; they were not told until DATE that he had been removed from his first foster placement after an alleged sexual incident between him and the foster mother \u2019s daughter ; and they were not told until DATE that it was the unsubstantiated belief of a previous social worker that J. had been abused at a pre - verbal stage . Nor had they been told of the correct number of previous placements ( there had been CARDINAL , not CARDINAL ) or of the extent of disruption that J. had caused in these placements .", "In DATE , the applicants reached the painful decision to discontinue their relationship with J. However social worker delays in responding to the situation left the applicants in the impossible situation of finding that they did not want to adopt him but having to keep him as the local authority could not place him anywhere else . In DATE , they decided that he could remain with them as a foster child while attending boarding school most of DATE .", "On DATE , the applicants initiated the local authority \u2019s internal complaints procedure complaining about their poor social work practices and also seeking access to the files to ensure the records accurately reflected the difficulties surrounding the placement . Their complaints were upheld in DATE and the applicants received reimbursement of their legal costs of MONEY .", "Following further disputes with the local authority about payment of ORG boarding school fees , the applicants applied for a residence order for J. in DATE . This order was made on DATE .", "J. has remained difficult throughout his teenage DATE and exhibits disturbed and disordered behaviour .", "The applicants took legal advice concerning their remedies in respect of the local authority \u2019s failings in their case .", "Notes of a consultation with ORG on DATE referred to the case - law which indicated that it was problematic to establish that a local authority owed a duty of care to foster parents in the area of child care . A pending case of PERSON v. ORG ( DATE WLR CARDINAL ) was expected to clarify if a cause of action could arise in a similar situation . It was also pointed out that difficulties arose concerning the ability of the applicants to demonstrate that they had suffered damage , as it would be necessary to show that there had been economic loss or a psychiatric condition caused to the parents or the other children .", "On DATE , ORG issued its judgment in the case of PERSON v. ORG , holding that the foster GPE claim against the local authority could not be struck out and should proceed on the merits .", "On DATE , advice from ORG noted that recent authorities indicated that the applicants might have an arguable claim that the local authority owed them a duty of care in respect of the information which they imparted about any child offered for fostering . However , the difficulty with their claim was that they had not suffered any damage recognised by law . They had not suffered any physical injury and had been able to protect their own children against J. Unlike the foster parents in PERSON v. ORG , they had not needed psychiatric treatment or been forced to abandon paid employment or otherwise incurred any overall financial loss . She therefore advised that there was no basis on which the courts would accept that they had suffered any damage of a kind that the local authority had a duty to prevent or of a kind that was recoverable ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
