Trafficking in human beings is CARDINAL of the most pressing and complex Human Rights issues faced by ORG member states , including GPE .

These women are officially recruited as cabaret dancers but are nevertheless often expected also to work as prostitutes . They are usually from countries with inferior income levels to those in GPE and may find themselves in a vulnerable position to refuse demands from their employers or clients .

The Commissioner urges the NORP authorities to be especially vigilant about monitoring the situation and ensuring that the system of artiste visas is not used for facilitating trafficking or forced prostitution . In this context , the Commissioner recalls the exemplary reaction of the GPE authorities to similar concerns expressed in his report on the country and their withdrawal of the cabaret artiste visa regime . Changes to the current practice might , at the very least , include women having to apply for the visa themselves , and the information leaflet being given to the women , if possible , before they enter the country .", "CARDINAL .
