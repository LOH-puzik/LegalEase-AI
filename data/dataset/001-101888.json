NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in GPE in DATE and is currently living in the GPE . At the time of the introduction of the application he stated that he was an NORP national . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Deputy Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and some of which are in dispute , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant reported to the GPE authorities for the purposes of seeking asylum . During his interviews with the GPE immigration authorities in the course of which he objected to assistance by an NORP - speaking interpreter and chose to be assisted by a GPE interpreter , he stated that he was an NORP national , that he was born in GPE \u2013 then a part of the former GPE \u2013 and that he was of NORP ethnic origin . The applicant \u2019s parents and CARDINAL adult siblings , who were all born in GPE , were living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed a formal asylum request and the immigration authorities conducted a first interview with him on DATE . On DATE the applicant filed a written account of his reasons for seeking asylum . He submitted an addition to this written account on DATE . The immigration authorities conducted a second interview with the applicant on DATE . By letter of DATE , the applicant availed himself of the possibility to submit corrections and additions to the report of this second interview .", "CARDINAL . The applicant gave the following account in support of his asylum application . He had lived in GPE until DATE and in GPE from DATE until DATE . He had received military training from DATE in GPE . In DATE , following the upheaval in GPE , the applicant went to live in GPE , where he served in ORG in an anti - terrorism unit , which also specialised in combating organised crime . The applicant participated in a number of operations .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant was involved in an incident in the context of a professional assignment which resulted in him being imprisoned . He was released after DATE following a changeover in power .", "CARDINAL . The applicant resumed his work for ORG , in which he was , amongst other things , involved in arresting people and handing these over to the ORG \u2019s investigation department , and in an undercover anti - corruption operation . He left the ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE , the applicant had become increasingly disillusioned and frustrated with the political system and the way the department where he worked was being used to suppress democracy . That department was supposed to battle terrorism and foreign interventions , but in practice it was used to arrest innocent civilians who stood in the way of a corrupt Government . He twice tried to resign but this was not accepted . In DATE his boss told him people could only leave the service if they retired or died . After this , his life became unbearable . His colleagues no longer trusted him . He had never held his own passport . ORG had held \u2013 but never given to him \u2013 a service passport for him which had been used by others on his behalf during a short stay in GPE in DATE . He was very scared as there was nothing more powerful than ORG so he could turn to no - one for protection . He feared the Ministry was looking for a reason to accuse him of something .", "CARDINAL . The applicant left GPE on DATE , because on DATE he was informed by a friend employed by ORG that he was wanted in connection with a failed attack on a rebel leader in DATE . The applicant claimed that he was being searched for by the authorities of GPE and also that he risked a lengthy term of imprisonment because he had left ORG and GPE without permission and was thus considered to be a deserter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request and , after an ex officio examination , further held that there were no reasons to grant the applicant a residence permit for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision . He filed additional grounds for his objection and further documents in substantiation of his account by letters CARDINAL and DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant requested ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE to order a stay of expulsion by way of a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) pending the proceedings on his objection . This request was granted on DATE by the provisional measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , who ordered that the applicant should not be expelled from the GPE until DATE after the determination of his objection .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE the applicant filed further additional grounds for his objection . On DATE , he was heard on his objection before an official board of inquiry ( ambtelijke commissie ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ) , the successor to the Deputy Minister of ORG since DATE , informed the applicant that his statements gave cause to suspect that LAW DATE LAW relating to ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) might be applicable to his case , and that for that reasons his case had been transferred to \u201c Unit CARDINAL \u201d . Unit CARDINAL is a team of specialists within ORG ( Immigratie- en ORG , \u201c IND \u201d ) who examine cases in which LAW may be applicable .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE , the applicant informed the ORG that he considered the decision of DATE as unlawful and unjust , and urged a speedy determination of his asylum claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted translations of a number of documents further to substantiate his account . On DATE the immigration authorities conducted an additional interview with the applicant which mainly concerned the nature of his work for ORG , and he was given the possibility to submit corrections and additions to the report of this interview . By letter of DATE the applicant stated he did not wish to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection and maintained the negative decision of the asylum request by holding LAW against the applicant on account of his work for ORG , which decision was based on the prescribed and so - called \u201c personal and knowing participation \u201d test . In this decision , the Minister further decided not to grant the applicant ex officio a residence title on account of the duration of the still pending proceedings on his asylum request ( tijdsverloop in de asielprocedure ) . The applicant \u2019s objection against the latter aspect of the decision of DATE was rejected by the Minister on DATE . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG of The Hague .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of DATE ( concerning his asylum request ) , as supplemented by him on CARDINAL and DATE DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL and DATE , was heard on DATE before ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG found that the Minister had correctly held LAW applicable to the applicant but quashed the impugned decision for lack of sufficient reasoning in that it did not appear from that decision whether the Minister had examined whether LAW would lastingly ( duurzaam ) stand in the way of expulsion and , if so , whether a continuous withholding of a residence permit would not be disproportionate . Accordingly it quashed the decision of DATE and ordered the Minister to take a fresh decision on the applicant \u2019s objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected in a separate judgment the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an additional hearing on his objection of DATE was conducted with the applicant before an official board of inquiry , including the question whether his expulsion to GPE would be contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was notified in person of the Minister \u2019s intention to declare him an undesirable alien entailing the imposition of an exclusion order , and he was given the opportunity to respond to this . He did so in person on DATE , as well as by letters of CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , the Minister declared the applicant an undesirable alien and imposed the pertaining exclusion order . The Minister noted that the applicant had been denied asylum in application of LAW and that , in its judgment of DATE , ORG of The Hague had accepted that decision as correct . The Minister held that the application of LAW against the applicant stood in the way of his being granted a residence permit since he was to be considered as a danger to public order and that his exclusion from the GPE was also in the interest of the Netherlands\u2019 international relations . The Minister lastly found that there were insufficient grounds for assuming that the applicant , if removed to his country of origin , would be exposed to a real and foreseeable risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a separate decision also taken on DATE , the Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s objection of DATE . She maintained her decision to hold LAW against the applicant . As regards LAW , the Minister did not find it established that the applicant , if returned to his country of origin , would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by the this provision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister noted that the applicant had not submitted any documents in support of his claim that he was searched for by the NORP authorities for having abandoned his work for the national security agency in DATE . The Minister further noted that the applicant had submitted CARDINAL documents , issued by the authorities of GPE , allegedly showing that he was being searched for in GPE . CARDINAL document was a protocol , drawn up by the police on DATE , relating to the opening of a criminal inquiry into the commission of the offence defined in section CARDINAL of the NORP LAW which concerns \u201c illegal extraction of fish and other water animals \u201d . The other document was a summons dated CARDINAL DATE , ordering the applicant to hand in on that DATE his passport at police station no . CARDINAL , failing which he would be held liable under LAW of LAW Criminal Code which concerns \u201c burglary \u201d defined as obtaining through violence property not belonging to the perpetrator . The Minister considered that , apart from the odd and unexplained fact that both documents had been drawn up in DATE whereas the applicant had already left GPE in DATE , these documents did not tally with the applicant \u2019s asylum account to the effect that he risked treatment in breach of LAW of having left his work without permission or for his involvement in the failed attack on the rebel leader in DATE . In so far as the applicant further claimed that he risked such treatment because the NORP authorities assumed that he was keeping contacts with CARDINAL of his former superiors who were residing abroad and who were planning to seize power in GPE , the Minister found that this had remained wholly unsubstantiated and was based on speculations by the applicant . The Minister further rejected as unsubstantiated and not plausible the applicant \u2019s claim that his relatives were encountering problems from the side of the authorities of GPE in order to exert pressure on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection with the Minister against the decision to impose an exclusion order on him . On DATE , he filed an appeal with ORG of The GPE against the rejection by the Minister of his objection of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE and after a hearing held on DATE , the provisional measures judge of ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , rejected as unfounded the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE and his pertaining request for an interim measure . The judge noted that , in its ruling of CARDINAL DATE , ORG had already accepted the Minister \u2019s decision to hold LAW against the applicant . The provisional measure judge further accepted the Minister \u2019s finding that the applicant had not demonstrated that LAW would lastingly stand in the way of his expulsion . Referring to constant case law of ORG of ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak PERSON ) , the provisional measures judge lastly held , in respect of the applicant \u2019s reliance on the right of respect for his private life within the meaning of LAW , that \u2013 given the strict separation under the provisions of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet CARDINAL ) between an asylum based and a regular residence permit DATE that arguments based on DATE could not be entertained in asylum proceedings but should be made in proceedings on a request for a regular residence permit .", "CARDINAL . In a separate ruling handed down on DATE , the provisional measures judge of ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s request for a provisional measure ( stay of expulsion ) for the duration of the proceedings on his objection against the decision to impose an exclusion order on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE in which his appeal of DATE had been rejected . On DATE , ORG declared itself not competent to examine this appeal , pursuant to LAW . It noted that the proceedings concerned a decision which had been taken before the entry into force on DATE of LAW , replacing LAW DATE . Under the latter Act no further appeal lay against a ruling of ORG in asylum proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was placed in GPE detention for removal purposes ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) . In a ruling given on DATE , in unsuccessful appeal proceedings taken by the applicant concerning his placement in GPE detention , ORG of The Hague noted that the NORP authorities had refused to issue a laissez - passer to the applicant and held that the GPE authorities should be given the opportunity to try to obtain the issuance of a laissez - passer from the authorities of GPE , given the fact that the applicant had been born there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s objection against the decision to impose an exclusion order on him . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision , including arguments based on LAW , was rejected on DATE by ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE . Although the applicant could have appealed this decision before ORG , he did not do so .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the DATE LAW , as amended by LAW of DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that :", "( a ) he has committed a crime against peace , a war crime , or a crime against humanity , as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes ;", "( b ) he has committed a serious non - political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee ;", "( c ) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The application was introduced on DATE and registered on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the applicant \u2019s request , the President of the Third Section decided under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to indicate to ORG not to expel the applicant pending the proceedings before the ORG . The President further decided , under LAW ( b ) of ORG , to give notice of the application to the respondent Government and to invite the parties to submit written observations on its admissibility and merits .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the applicant \u2019s stated nationality , the Government of GPE were invited , pursuant to LAW , to inform the ORG whether they wished to exercise their right to submit written comments . On DATE , ORG informed the ORG that they wished to avail themselves of that right . The applicant and the respondent Government were informed accordingly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the respondent Government informed ORG proceedings still pending on the applicant \u2019s challenge of the decision to impose an exclusion order on him , and requested leave to submit their observations after a final decision in these proceedings had been given . On DATE , the President accepted this request and fixed a new time - limit for the submission of the observations by ORG , namely within DATE after the final decision in the proceedings referred to by the Government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG requested a further extension until DATE of the time - limit to file observations . They explained that , as the applicant had not availed himself of the possibility to file an appeal with ORG against the ruling of CARDINAL DATE of ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , the latter judgment had become final on CARDINAL DATE implying that the ORG should file their observations within DATE from DATE . On DATE , the President acceded to this request .", "CARDINAL . The Government \u2019s observations were submitted DATE . The applicant \u2019s observations in reply were submitted on DATE . In those observations in reply , the applicant denied that he was a citizen of GPE and claimed that he was stateless .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the President invited the Government of GPE to inform the ORG whether or not the applicant was a national of GPE and , provided they would acknowledge that citizenship , to file any written comments they wished to make on the issues arising in the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , the Government of GPE informed the ORG that the applicant was not a national of GPE but nevertheless submitted written comments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG were informed that , as the applicant was not a citizen of GPE , they were not automatically entitled to intervene as a third party in the proceedings on the basis of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention but , given that their comments were mainly of a factual nature , that the President had interpreted their letter of DATE as a request for leave to intervene within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG and had granted this request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the respondent Government , the applicant and the Government of GPE were invited to submit further information of a factual nature , and the President further accepted the respondent Government \u2019s request for leave to submit additional observations .", "CARDINAL .
