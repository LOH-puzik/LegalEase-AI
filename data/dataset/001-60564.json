SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1 and 6-3-d", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Wilhelmina Thomassen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) of Borgholm was contacted by a schoolteacher on account of a suspicion that one of her pupils , PERSON , a boy born in DATE and thus at the time aged DATE , had been sexually abused by the applicant . On DATE , having carried out an investigation , the ORG reported the matter to the police authority in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , TIME and TIME , PERSON was interviewed by the police . The interview was recorded on videotape . PERSON 's parents and representatives of ORG were present in the adjoining room . At that time , the applicant had not been informed of the suspicions against him and no defence counsel had been appointed for him .", "The interview was conducted by a detective inspector with DATE of service in the police force . Since DATE he had been working exclusively on investigations concerning ill - treatment and sexual abuse of children .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was questioned by the police and the public prosecutor . Before the questioning the applicant was notified , in accordance with LAW , section DATE , of LAW ( PERSON ) , of the suspicions against him .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant received a copy of the report of the preliminary investigation and on DATE defence counsel was appointed for him . The applicant was given an opportunity to submit observations and request additional interviews and other investigative measures . Finding that further information was necessary with regard to , inter alia , the dates and the number of occasions when the alleged acts had been committed and the sites at which they were supposed to have occurred , the applicant 's counsel requested that PERSON be interviewed again .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with counsel 's request , a second interview with PERSON was conducted on DATE , TIME and TIME at the boy 's home , by the same detective inspector . During the interview , which was recorded on audiotape only , PERSON 's parents were present but not the applicant 's counsel . It appears that PERSON 's counsel , who had not been served notice of the interview , was opposed to counsel for CARDINAL of the parties being present at an interview . Finding that it would be unreasonable to cancel the interview , as the police officer was present and PERSON had taken time off from school , the applicant 's counsel agreed that it could be conducted without his being present . The police officer and the applicant 's counsel discussed what aspects of the case needed to be addressed during the interview . In general , counsel for the applicant wished to have a more detailed account of what was alleged to have happened . However , no written list of questions was drawn up . Counsel for the applicant later listened to the audiotape of the interview and was given a transcript of the tape . Finding that the issues raised in his request had been covered , he did not call for a further interview to be held .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted for sexual acts with a child ( sexuellt umg\u00e4nge med barn ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) heard the case on DATE . The applicant denied the charges . The videotaped police interview with PERSON was shown during the hearing . The record of the second interview was read out . The court also heard evidence from PERSON 's mother and his schoolteacher as witnesses . No request for PERSON to be heard in person was made .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The court , noting that the outcome of the case was entirely dependent on the credibility of PERSON 's statements , found no reason to call into question their veracity . Thus , basing itself on those statements , the court found that the applicant , on a large number of occasions in DATE , had touched PERSON 's penis or masturbated him and induced PERSON to touch the applicant 's penis or masturbate him .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) . Subsequently , at the applicant 's request , his defence counsel was replaced . The appellate court held a hearing on DATE , during which it heard the applicant and his new counsel . PERSON 's mother and his schoolteacher gave evidence . The videotape of the first police interview with PERSON and the audiotape of the second interview were played back . Again , the applicant did not request that PERSON give evidence during the hearing .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the applicant 's conviction but reduced the sentence to DATE imprisonment . It considered that , as there was no technical evidence in the case and nobody had witnessed the alleged acts , the credibility of PERSON 's statements was of decisive importance in determining the applicant 's guilt . It went on to state the following :", "\u201c For reasons of legal certainty , the questioning of children during pre - trial investigations must \u2013 as explained in detail by ORG [ ORG domstolen ] in ORG DATE p. CARDINAL \u2013 meet high standards with regard to both methods and content .", "The information given by [ M. ] is , in some parts , vague and uncertain . He has not been able to give details of any specific incident covered by the prosecution and he has been able to describe only in more general terms what kind of sexual contact has occurred . It should further be noted that some of the questions put to him have been of a leading nature . Even if these circumstances are taken into account , ORG finds that [ PERSON 's ] statements can not be disregarded .", "A fact which strongly indicates that [ M. ] has been subjected to homosexual abuse is his expressed concern that he would become ' gay ' . ORG has had further regard to the following circumstances . The general impression of the video - recording is that [ M. ] has talked about something he has indeed experienced and that it has been embarrassing and painful for him to give this information . This may explain his unwillingness to go into detail about specific incidents . [ M. ] has not shown any tendency to exaggerate his statements and has corrected the interrogator on several occasions . Furthermore , in some respects his statements can be said to contain more personal observations , for example , ' Of course , I did not want to touch his but sometimes I did it without gloves ' and ' First I asked if I would get any ( refers to pastilles ) . He did not have any and then I did it voluntarily but I do not know why ' . It should further be noted that no information has come to hand which could reasonably explain why [ M. ] would make untrue statements about events which he obviously considers to be shameful . Also of importance is the information given by [ PERSON 's ] mother and teacher which describes how [ M. 's ] personality has changed since the alleged injustice . The fact that it was a long time before [ M. ] spoke about what he experienced is easily explained by the feelings of guilt he has had and by the fact that thinking about the incidents is distasteful to him . [ PERSON 's ] accounts do not contain any improbable elements , neither is the information given by him contradicted by other statements . In view of what has now been said , ORG finds that [ M. ] is credible and that his statements should form the basis for ORG assessment of whether [ the applicant ] has behaved towards him in the manner indicated by the public prosecutor in his statement on the charges . \u201d", "ORG found that the information given by PERSON showed that the applicant had induced PERSON to touch the applicant 's penis or masturbate him . However , the statements that the applicant had touched PERSON 's penis or masturbated him were too uncertain and vague and thus did not constitute sufficient evidence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . Relying on LAW CARDINAL ( d ) of the ORG , he complained that his counsel had not been able to put questions to PERSON He noted that there was no technical or other evidence in the case to support PERSON 's statements . He further criticised the manner in which PERSON had been interviewed and stated that PERSON 's statements were vague and contradictory . In these circumstances , the applicant claimed that he had a right to cross - examine M. He maintained that ORG case - law , which allegedly permitted the procedure followed in his case , had to be changed in order either to give counsel for the defence a right to examine the minor or to require clear supporting evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Domestic provisions of relevance in the present case are found in LAW ( \u201c the Code \u201d ) and in the Ordinance on Preliminary Investigations ( ORG , DATE \u201c the Ordinance \u201d ) . There is also some national case - law of interest .", "CARDINAL . A preliminary investigation takes place whenever there is reason to believe that a crime has been committed . LAW , LAW , of the LAW includes provisions pertaining to the categories of persons allowed to attend an interview during a preliminary investigation . The suspect and his defence counsel are always entitled to attend an interview which takes place following a request made by the suspect himself . This right , however , does not manifest itself until a person has been informed of the suspicions against him in accordance with LAW , section DATE , of the Code . As far as other interviews are concerned , counsel for the defence may attend if his attendance will not harm the investigation . It is for the person who heads the preliminary investigation \u2013 a police officer or a public prosecutor \u2013 to decide who may attend a specific interview during the preliminary investigation . In cases where the suspect or his defence counsel are present during an interview , questions may only be asked in the order determined by the person in charge of the preliminary investigation ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Code ) .", "CARDINAL . When a preliminary investigation has reached the point at which a person can be reasonably suspected of having committed a crime , the person in question must be notified of the suspicions against him , pursuant to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Code . Under the second paragraph of that provision , an interview or other form of investigation may be undertaken at the request of the suspect or his defence counsel if the measure is deemed to be of importance to the preliminary investigation as such . If a request for such an investigative measure is not granted , the reasons for the decision must be given . If the suspect makes a complaint , the issue is settled by the court ( LAW , section DATE , of the Code ) .", "CARDINAL . Interviews with children conducted in the course of a preliminary investigation are subject to special regulations . Thus , according to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Code , a child 's custodian should be present whenever a child under DATE is questioned if this can be done without any harmful effects on the investigation .", "CARDINAL . Further and more detailed provisions concerning the questioning of children are found in the LAW , section CARDINAL of which provides that interviews with , inter alia , an injured party under the age of CARDINAL must be conducted in such a manner that there is no danger that the interviewed person might be harmed . It is also stipulated in that section that particular care is to be exercised when the questioning concerns sexual matters . Furthermore , particular care has to be taken in order to ensure that the interview does not create a stir and that it does not become more intimate than the circumstances require . Questioning should , moreover , according to section CARDINAL of the Ordinance , occur on only CARDINAL occasion unless it is more appropriate to conduct several interviews out of consideration for the child who is being questioned .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW provides that interviews with children must be conducted by persons who are particularly apt to perform the task . In addition , section DATE provides that a person with special expertise in the field of child psychology or interview psychology may assist at the questioning or comment on the value of the child 's testimony .", "CARDINAL . Whenever the evidence of a witness below DATE is used in a criminal case , the court must determine , taking account of all relevant circumstances , whether the child should testify ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Code ) . There is no corresponding provision applicable to children who are in the position of being the injured party . In practice , however , such evidence is normally presented to the court in the form of a video - recording of the police interview , which is played back during the court 's main hearing . In allowing this to take place , the court applies LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Code , by which a statement made to the police or to the prosecutor or otherwise out of court may be used in evidence in a trial only if this is specifically prescribed , if the person who has submitted the statement can not be heard before the court or if there are particular reasons for the statement to be relied on , regard being had to the costs or inconveniences that a hearing before the court may entail on the one hand and the advantages of a hearing before the court , the importance of the statement and all other relevant circumstances on the other hand .", "CARDINAL . As already mentioned , children below DATE do not normally give evidence in person before a court . There are , however , examples where children have been heard in court . Thus , in CARDINAL recent cases before ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) concerning sexual offences against children ( case no . B CARDINAL - CARDINAL , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , and case no . B DATE , judgment of DATE ) , the injured parties , CARDINAL girls aged DATE , gave evidence in person . Their statements were made before the members of the court , the public prosecutor , the defence counsel and their own counsel but in the absence of the accused , who were able to listen to the statements in an adjoining room . In both cases , the girls were heard at the request of the prosecutor following the acquittal of the accused at first instance . In another case before the same appellate court concerning a sexual offence ( case no . B DATE , judgment of DATE ) , the defence , upon appeal against the conviction of the accused at first instance , requested that the injured party , a CARDINAL-year - old girl , give evidence in person . The prosecutor and the girl 's counsel opposed the request which was subsequently rejected by ORG on account of her age . Instead , the court allowed recordings of her statements during the preliminary investigation to be played back . However , ORG reversed the judgment of ORG and acquitted the accused , finding that the evidence presented did not sufficiently show that he had committed the alleged offence .", "CARDINAL . The application of LAW , section DATE , of the Code in relation to LAW has been examined by ORG on CARDINAL occasion . In the case in question , published in LOC arkiv ( ( ORG ) DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , the court quashed a judgment by a court of appeal and referred the case back to the latter court for re - examination . The reason for this was that the appellate court , as well as the first - instance court , had allowed the prosecutor to use in evidence written records of a police interview with the injured party in a case concerning indictment for robbery . It had not been possible to serve a summons on the injured party to attend the main hearing . The court of appeal had been of the opinion that the information submitted by the injured party to the police had to be given credit and convicted the defendant of robbery . ORG , on the other hand , emphasised that LAW and its application and interpretation was of major importance in respect of the application of LAW , section DATE , of the Code . In the light of the fact that ORG had come to the conclusion that there was a breach of Article CARDINAL when a court relied on statements in support of a conviction by a person who had not been heard by the court and whom the defendant had not had the opportunity to question in some other context , ORG in its turn came to the conclusion that that provision of the LAW should be applied more restrictively than was called for by its wording and what appeared to be the original intentions behind the provision . According to ORG , the lower courts had applied the provision in such a way that the defendant had not been afforded a fair trial in accordance with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Issues concerning the quality and evaluation of evidence have been examined by ORG in CARDINAL published cases ( NJA DATE , pp . DATE et seq . , and DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) , which are of relevance in this context . The first - mentioned case concerned the alleged sexual abuse of a minor , aged DATE , who could not give evidence in court on account of mental problems . The evidence consisted mainly of information supplied by the injured party to the police . The police interview had been recorded on videotape . ORG came to the conclusion that it was inevitable that the value of such statements as evidence was not the same as the value of statements made during the main hearing . Even so , the evidence in that case , that is the injured party 's testimony together with other evidence , was deemed to be strong enough for a conviction .", "CARDINAL . In the second case , the injured parties were born in DATE and DATE , respectively . The essential evidence consisted of videotaped interviews with them . The interviews had taken place in the absence of the suspect and his defence counsel . They were given the opportunity to examine the information and to request that additional information be provided prior to indictment . However , defence counsel was of the opinion that further questioning would prove pointless since , in his view , the injured parties would only repeat from memory what they had submitted previously . ORG stated that , bearing in mind that the accused had chosen not to request a further examination , his right to a fair trial could not be seen as having been breached on account of the fact that the videotapes had been used as evidence against him . As far as the evaluation of the evidence was concerned , ORG stressed the fact that the injured parties had only been questioned out of court and that it could not therefore assess their credibility and the trustworthiness of their information by means of impressions conveyed through a direct examination in court . It followed , according to ORG , that the information submitted by the injured parties should be assessed with particular care . The fact that the accused had been prevented from putting questions to the injured parties through his defence counsel and that the court itself had also been prevented from doing so pointed in the same direction . According to ORG this did not mean , however , that the videotaped interviews could not be sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt . The injured parties ' submissions , combined with other evidence , led ORG to the conclusion that the judgment should be based on , inter alia , the submissions in question ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
