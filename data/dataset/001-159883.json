The applicant was born in DATE and has been residing in the GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered the GPE on DATE and applied for a residence permit for the purpose of asylum as well as for reasons not related to asylum . In support of this application , he gave the following account in his interviews with immigration officials .", "CARDINAL . He had been a member of ORG of GPE ( \u201c PDPA \u201d ) since CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and had worked for the NORP security service ORG ( \u201c ORG - e Dowlati / PERSON GPE ) DATE . Upon the PDPA \u2019s advice the applicant had joined the ORG as an alternative to mandatory military service . He had been stationed in LOC from DATE , where he had initially performed administrative tasks for DATE within ORG \u2019s local ORG department , followed by preparing / compiling course materials for ORG \u2019s internal training within the same department . He had done this until DATE . He had also been involved in the organisation of cultural events for ORG \u2019s youth department .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant had been sent to ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) for DATE for training ( ORG \u2019s organisation and the functioning of a secret service ) . Upon completion of this training he had been promoted to the rank of third lieutenant . In DATE the applicant had participated in DATE of political training , also in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant had worked for ORG \u2019s ORG department in GPE . DATE he had worked for ORG \u2019s \u201c FAC \u201d , located in GPE , where he had been given the task of internal control and research into the functioning of ORG staff . The applicant \u2019s highest attained military rank , through periodical promotions , was that of major .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had fled from GPE to GPE on CARDINAL DATE , DATE after DATE of the ORG regime . After the applicant \u2019s flight , his father was assaulted in GPE by mujahideen who had come to ask him about the applicant \u2019s whereabouts . The applicant \u2019s father had to have a kidney removed as a consequence of the battering he suffered at the hands of the mujahideen . The applicant \u2019s family had joined the applicant in GPE DATE after the applicant \u2019s departure from GPE , but they had lived separately for safety reasons . His family had lived with relatives in GPE , close to the NORP border . The applicant himself had stayed in GPE . On an unspecified date in DATE , unidentified mujahideen had come to the applicant \u2019s GPE home searching for the applicant . On that occasion , the applicant \u2019s youngest brother had been ill - treated and another brother had been taken away , tortured and killed by the mujahideen in their attempt to find the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request , holding that the applicant had failed to establish personal circumstances warranting a decision to grant him asylum . The applicant had never been approached personally by the mujahideen in GPE ; he had only made vague declarations about the post he had held in the KhAD , and he had lived for DATE in GPE without experiencing problems and/or having been found by the mujahideen ( who were said to be active in GPE too ) . Although they might have known where the applicant \u2019s family were , it was considered implausible that the mujahideen would have been aware of the applicant \u2019s whereabouts in GPE . The Deputy Minister also held that the applicant \u2019s submissions regarding the assault on his father and killing of his brother were brief and vague .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister of ORG did , however , grant the applicant a conditional residence permit ( voorwaardelijke vergunning tot verblijf ) , valid for DATE from DATE , on the basis of a temporary categorial protection policy ( \u201c categoriaal beschermingsbeleid \u201d ) in respect of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted an objection ( bezwaar ) to the Deputy Minister against the decision to reject his asylum request . On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE before an official board of enquiry ( ambtelijke commissie ) , the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s objection . The Deputy Minister found , inter alia , that the applicant had failed to establish that he had held a position within ORG of sufficient importance to warrant the conclusion that he would run a real risk of persecution upon his return to GPE . The Deputy Minister further noted that the applicant had not experienced any problems with the mujahideen either , stressing that the applicant had easily crossed a mujahideen - controlled border crossing with GPE in DATE . The Deputy Minister further found that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he ran a real risk of persecution by the ORG , who were in charge of most of GPE at the time the impugned decision was taken . The Deputy Minister underlined in this regard the unlikelihood of the ORG having been aware of the applicant \u2019s past activities for ORG , including the CARDINAL military training programmes he had allegedly attended in the GPE . The Deputy Minister also dismissed the applicant \u2019s argument that , in GPE , he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE . Pending these appeal proceedings , the applicant was informed that the Deputy Minister had decided , in view of the applicant \u2019s involvement with the ORG , to examine the possible applicability of LAW DATE LAW ( \u201c the DATE Refugee Convention ) to his case and that for this reason the impugned decision of CARDINAL DATE was withdrawn . Thereupon , the applicant withdrew his appeal .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile in DATE , the situation in GPE not having sufficiently improved , the applicant \u2019s conditional residence permit was converted ex lege into an indefinite residence permit after he had held it for a period of DATE . Subsequently , with the entry into force of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet CARDINAL ) on DATE , the permit held by the applicant came to be named an indefinite residence permit for the purpose of asylum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE , the applicant was interviewed by the immigration authorities about the nature of his activities for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ) notified the applicant of her intention ( voornemen ) to revoke his residence permit and to hold LAW against him . The applicant \u2019s asylum claim had been considered in the light of an official report ( ambtsbericht ) , drawn up on DATE by ORG on \u201c ORG in NORP GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG and ORG ( \u201c PERSON in communistisch GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG en WAD \u201d ) and concerning in particular the question whether , and if so which , former employees of those services should be regarded as implicated in human rights violations . On the basis of this report , the GPE immigration authorities had adopted the position that LAW could be held against virtually every NORP asylum seeker who , holding the rank of third lieutenant or higher , had worked during the communist regime for the ORG or its successor the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister found it established that the applicant had worked as a commissioned officer in the ORG \u2019s LAW DATE and considered that , in his account to the GPE authorities , he had sought to trivialise his activities for the ORG . She rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the applicability of LAW ought to have been examined at an earlier stage , holding that at the relevant time ( DATE ) considerably less information had been available to the GPE asylum authorities about the full extent of the human rights violations committed by the LAW , notwithstanding that to a certain extent there had been a general awareness of the nature of the former communist regime in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister then proceeded to an analysis of the applicant \u2019s individual responsibility under LAW , based on the prescribed and so - called \u201c knowing and personal participation \u201d test . Noting , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s steady career path in the ORG , the Minister excluded the possibility of the applicant not having known or not having been involved in human rights violations committed by the ORG . Relying on the official report of DATE , the Minister underlined the widely known cruel character of ORG , its lawless methods , the grave crimes it had committed such as torture and other human rights violations as well as the climate of terror which it had spread throughout the whole of NORP society . The Minister lastly emphasised that the applicant had done nothing to distance himself from ORG during DATE he had made a career there , referring to the applicant \u2019s own statement to the effect that he had consciously chosen to stay with ORG in order to avoid being sent to the war front . The Minister considered that the consequences of that choice were for the applicant to bear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant submitted written comments ( zienswijze ) on the Minister \u2019s intended decision and , on DATE , he was once more heard before an official board of enquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with an additional notice of intent in which the Minister examined whether the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE would be compatible with his rights under LAW , as required in expulsion cases according to the case - law of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG . The Minister noted that , according to an official report on GPE issued by ORG in DATE , the position of ex - communists and persons associated with the former communist regime was not yet entirely clear . Members of the ORG possibly ran a risk of becoming a victim of human rights violations from the side of the authorities ( except for the government ) but more so from the side of the population ( GPE relatives ) as they were identified with human rights violations during the communist regime . However , there were no indications that persons in GPE should fear persecution merely because of their ties with the former communist regime . The Minister , therefore , held that the applicant had to demonstrate personal facts or circumstances warranting the conclusion that his return to GPE would be in breach of LAW , and found that the applicant had not done so . In reaching this finding , the Minister noted that the applicant \u2019s fear of being subjected to treatment proscribed by LAW had remained unsubstantiated in any concrete manner and was only based on assumptions . The applicant had not specified which particular faction of the mujahideen had been looking for him shortly after he left GPE , nor whether that faction was currently holding any position of power in GPE . The Minister further took into account the applicant \u2019s statement made at the hearing of DATE that in the meantime his parents and brother had returned to GPE . Although the applicant \u2019s father had allegedly been approached in DATE by individuals asking for the applicant , the Minister held that it had not been demonstrated that the applicant \u2019s parents and brother had experienced serious difficulties from the authorities or any groups . The Minister further considered that the mere fact that LAW was being held against the applicant did not in itself warrant the conclusion that , if expelled to GPE , he would have to fear treatment contrary to LAW . The Minister also rejected as still unsubstantiated the applicant \u2019s claims that he risked treatment contrary to LAW because he would be considered an infidel as his family was not professing ORG , as he drank alcohol and had studied , and also because of his ethnicity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted additional written comments on DATE and , on DATE , was heard once more before an official board of enquiry .", "CARDINAL . NORP In her decision of DATE , the Minister revoked the applicant \u2019s residence permit . The notices of intent of CARDINAL DATE and DATE were added to the decisions and formed part of them . The Minister did not deviate , in the relevant part , from her earlier conclusions in the notices of intent and went on to confirm them on all points . The applicant \u2019s rebuttals were dismissed as not raising any new grounds . Moreover , in a letter of the same date the Minister informed ORG ( Openbaar Ministerie ) that LAW had been held against the applicant and asked ORG to consider prosecuting the applicant under criminal law . No further information on any follow - up to this letter has been submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister notified the applicant of her intention also to impose an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) on him . The applicant submitted written comments on this intended decision on DATE and on DATE was heard before an official board of enquiry .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant against the Minister \u2019s decision of DATE was rejected on DATE by ORG of The Hague , sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch . It accepted the Minister \u2019s impugned decision to hold LAW against the applicant as well as the underlying reasoning . It further upheld the Minister \u2019s decision and underlying reasoning that the applicant \u2019s removal would not be contrary to his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected a further appeal by the applicant on summary grounds , holding :", "\u201c What has been raised in the grievances ... does not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling . Having regard to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , no further reasoning is called for , since the arguments submitted do not raise questions which require determination in the interest of legal uniformity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of ORG imposed an exclusion order on the applicant . An objection by the applicant to this decision was rejected by the Minister on DATE . On DATE , the applicant appealed to ORG of GPE . No further information about these appeal proceedings has been submitted ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
