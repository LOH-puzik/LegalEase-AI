J left the first applicant \u2019s household in DATE .", "From DATE onwards the first applicant experienced difficulties in educating the second applicant , who showed signs of aggressiveness and refused to follow orders . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the second applicant was placed in a psychiatric institution for children and adolescents .", "Upon medical advice , the second applicant started ambulant therapy which was discontinued because the first applicant did not agree with the educational methods applied .", "In DATE further major difficulties arose when the second applicant had been caught smoking , lying and stealing from the first applicant . The first applicant considered placing the second applicant into an after - school care centre , but refrained , when ORG ( ORG ) refused to cover the costs as the first applicant was unwilling to disclose her financial situation . The tensions between the applicants persisted .", "On DATE a serious dispute broke out between the applicants when the second applicant refused to help his mother in gardening . The second applicant absconded and only returned in TIME . On his return , he fell and incurred a laceration on his head which had to be sewn with CARDINAL stitch .", "On DATE the conflicts resumed . The second applicant absconded and cycled to his CARDINAL - sister J. That same afternoon , the first applicant and PERSON called upon the police in order to achieve a settlement on where the boy should stay for TIME . Following an exchange of views , the second applicant agreed to return to the first applicant .", "The conflict between the applicants continued as the second applicant insisted on his wish to stay with ORG DATE the first applicant drove the second applicant to J. \u2019s place . Subsequently , she informed ORG about the second applicant \u2019s whereabouts .", "On DATE J. , who felt unable to cope with the situation , requested ORG assistance .", "On DATE ORG requested ORG ( ORG ) to withdraw parental authority from the first applicant . Relying on the statements made by J. and her partner , ORG submitted that the second applicant had been repeatedly beaten by the first applicant . In the course of the arguments which took place on CARDINAL DATE , the first applicant hit the second applicant on the fresh wound . On DATE the first applicant had stated that the second applicant should stay for DATE with J. , while she was leaving on vacation .", "By interim order of DATE ORG , without hearing either of the applicants , temporarily withdrew the first applicant \u2019s parental authority over the second applicant pursuant to section DATE of LAW ( B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch , see relevant domestic law below ) and transferred it to ORG . ORG found that the second applicant \u2019s physical well - being was jeopardised by an abuse of parental authority and that ORG had to take the necessary steps to avert this danger , in particular by ensuring medical treatment and accommodation . Due to the urgency of the matter it had not been possible to hear the first applicant before taking this decision .", "ORG placed the second applicant in a foster family for short - time accommodation . On DATE the second applicant was placed with the foster family PERSON On that same date ORG issued a certificate to the foster family according to which the second applicant \u2019s placement was planned as a permanent measure ( \u201c PERSON ist auf Dauer angelegt \u201d ) .", "On DATE the first applicant , who was represented by counsel , lodged a complaint against the interim order .", "On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG heard both applicants as well as J. and her partner .", "On DATE ORG transferred the case - file to ORG ( ORG ) to rule on the first applicant \u2019s appeal against the interim order .", "On DATE the presiding judge of ORG heard the second applicant in the foster family \u2019s household . According to the TIME drafted by the presiding judge , the second applicant declared that he felt at ease with the foster family and that he enjoyed a good relationship to the other foster child and , in particular , to the foster GPE grown - up son . With regard to the incident which led to the withdrawal of parental authority , the second applicant declared that he did not wish to talk about this and did not quite remember the details . He had left his mother \u2019s household because of the many arguments and beatings he had received . On his return , he had incurred the wound on his head . Some time later he had been beaten again . He further confirmed having given a faithful account of the incident to ORG judge .", "When questioned if he had had sufficient time to settle down during DATE , and if he wished to see his mother , the second applicant replied that he did not wish any personal contact to his mother . Even if his mother should promise that everything would change from now on , he was afraid that she would continue beating him and threatening him with sending him away or placing him in a psychiatric hospital .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing in the presence of the first applicant , the first applicant \u2019s counsel and a representative of ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal . That court found , firstly , that the withdrawal of parental authority had been in accordance with the pertinent provisions of sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . The events of DATE , which had been confirmed by both the second applicant himself , his sister J. and her sister \u2019s partner , justified the taking of measures relating to guardianship . There were substantial indications for an abuse of parental authority , which justified the assumption that there was a serious danger for the child \u2019s welfare .", "With regard to the present situation , ORG found that there was no reason to revoke or to modify the impugned decision . There remained serious indications that the child \u2019s well - being would be jeopardised if he returned to the first applicant \u2019s household . The second applicant had repeatedly stated that he had frequently been slapped by his mother . Even if this was not regarded as a decisive factor , the child \u2019s well - being would be jeopardised by the first applicant \u2019s deficiencies in parenting . The first applicant had conceded that she experienced serious educational difficulties . She had failed to resolve these problems by use of adequate educational measures or by availing herself of public assistance . The basis of confidence between mother and child was seriously disturbed . This had become obvious when the second applicant , during the hearing before ORG , had expressly declared that he presently did not wish any contact to his mother . There was no indication that the applicant had been influenced by third persons when expressing this wish .", "It was currently not possible to avert the danger by alternative means , such as external assistance , as the second applicant refused any cooperation with ORG .", "On DATE the first applicant lodged a further complaint ( PERSON ) against ORG decision , which she withdrew on DATE .", "On DATE the counsel PERSON , who acted on behalf of the first applicant , was granted access to the case files of the custody and access proceedings .", "On DATE the first applicant lodged a motion for bias against ORG judge , which was rejected by ORG on DATE .

On the contrary , the judge attempted intensively to promote the proceedings and accurately to examine the facts in order to gain a stable basis for reaching her decision . Conversely , the mother and her counsels have delayed the proceedings by lodging various procedural requests , both admissible and inadmissible appeals and other motions , including rejections on grounds of bias , administrative complaints , criminal informations for perversion of justice and petitions ... \u201d", "On DATE the second applicant absconded from the foster family in order to avoid a meeting with a ORG official .

She considered that the second applicant had experienced several times that his mother had threatened to give him away or had indeed given him away , for example by placing him in a psychiatric hospital or with his sister . As the second applicant emotionally and socially depended on his mother , this situation appeared to threaten his existence . This was aggravated by the fact that he did not have any positive memories of his biological father and that the contacts to his sister , as an important confidant , had been restricted by his mother . The second applicant tried to overcome this emotional and existential insecurity by accepting the foster family as the new centre of his life in order to become independent from his mother . When exposed to strong psychological pressure , the second applicant tried to avoid the situation or showed auto - destructive reactions , such as a suicide attempt in DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s wish not to see his mother had to be regarded as an attempt to distance himself .

While the first applicant expected to see her son under the expert \u2019s supervision , the foster family expected that the meetings took place between the first applicant and the foster parents , without the child \u2019s direct involvement . The first applicant did not wish to meet the foster parents .

ORG concluded that the second applicant , who had matured according to his age , seriously and understandably opposed to visits . Under these circumstances , it was impossible to impose visits against his will . Before the background of the family conflicts and the circumstances which led to the withdrawal of parental authority , this would be contrary to the child \u2019s best interests . ORG further noted that the psychological expert F had found that the second applicant \u2019s wish to distance himself from his mother had to be taken seriously .", "This finding was confirmed by ORG own impression during the oral hearing of CARDINAL DATE .

According to the court minutes , the rapporteur explained the second applicant that he had to abide by certain social rules and that he would not suspend the first applicant \u2019s access rights . The second applicant firmly objected to any further meetings with his mother . Upon suggestion of the second applicant \u2019s curator ad litem , a further meeting between the applicants and the judge rapporteur was scheduled for DATE .", "The second applicant did not appear at the meeting .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the curator ad litem informed ORG that the second applicant was presently opposed to any personal contacts with his mother .", "On DATE the foster parents informed ORG that the second applicant continued to oppose any contact to his mother , in spite of the joint efforts made by themselves , ORG and the psychotherapist to convince him otherwise .

If it was not possible to find an agreement on visiting contacts , the courts were called upon to reach a decision which respected both the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the parent DATE in the present case the mother \u2013 and the child \u2019s welfare . The remainder of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c In the course of the instant proceedings , a curator ad litem was appointed pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Law on Non - Contentious Proceedings , and both PERSON and the applicant were repeatedly heard by the rapporteur ( see TIME of the hearings held on DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) . It became clear during all the personal hearings that PERSON presently does not wish any contacts to his mother and that he only took part in the meetings because these had been ordered by the court . This is not disproved by the fact that PERSON \u2019s second meeting with his mother , which took place on DATE , was less tense than the previous meeting on DATE . The child expressed during all the hearings that he felt at ease in the foster family , where he felt understood . Conversely , his attitude demonstrated that he did not have any confidence in his mother , but was sceptical towards her . He frequently declared that his mother was only lying to him . The present rejection of his mother culminated when PERSON absconded on the date of the third scheduled meeting on DATE . The senate acknowledges that this meeting was scheduled by the rapporteur against PERSON \u2019s will during the hearing on DATE . The rapporteur , the foster parents and the curator hoped that PERSON would attend that meeting because of the court order . PERSON \u2019s resistance , which was expressed by his running away , induces the senate to fear that it would lead to uncontrollable actions , including auto - aggressiveness , if he was forced to further personal contacts .", "The mother \u2019s right to personal access has to cede in view of this irrational behaviour . The senate acknowledges that the right to personal access forms part of the natural parental rights and of the parental responsibility . However , this right meets its limit at a point where there exists the danger of the child \u2019s causing damage to himself ( see section DATE of LAW ) .", "The rapporteur has tried to re - establish personal contacts between mother and child and arranged several meetings . [ The rapporteur ] tried to convince the mother to refrain from raising reproaches against third persons ( curators , foster parents , experts , therapists , judge , PERSON \u2019s CARDINAL - sister ) , and to try instead to keep these questions away from PERSON and to accept during the conversation with her child that the latter presently lived with the foster family , where he felt at ease . During the hearings held on DATE and DATE this strategy succeeded as long as the rapporteur was present and controlled the course of conversation . The mother \u2019s behaviour during TIME she spent alone with PERSON led to defence reactions , he closed himself up and did not see any other resort than running away .", "Having regard to the above , the mother \u2019s complaint had to be rejected as being unfounded . It is presently only possible to stabilise the child if PERSON is not forced to any personal contact with his mother and if he is given the opportunity to stabilise himself in an environment which he considers as safe .", "The senate considers that access rights have to be suspended for a longer period of time , as the pressure the child is exposed to in the course of the proceedings on parental authority requires protecting him for DATE . Taking into account that PERSON \u2019s individual rights are limited by the parental rights and that he is obliged to respect his mother \u2019s right of access to him , it appears appropriate to limit the suspension of access rights until the end of custody proceedings , or at the latest until DATE . \u201d", "This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "By telefax of DATE the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint .", "On DATE an administrative officer of ORG informed the applicant that her constitutional complaint appeared to have been lodged out of the statutory time - limit of DATE , as the original version and annexes reached the constitutional court only on DATE .", "On DATE ORG refused to admit this constitutional complaint for adjudication without giving any reasons .", "Since DATE the second applicant stayed with his natural father .
