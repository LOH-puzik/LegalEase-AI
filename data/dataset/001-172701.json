The applicants , NORP migrants living in GPE without a work permit , were recruited on different dates DATE and DATE in GPE and other places , to work on the region \u2019s biggest strawberry farm , at GPE , a village of CARDINAL inhabitants in the regional district of GPE , in the western part of the NORP peninsula . In that area there are a number of production units , of various sizes , specialising in the intensive cultivation of strawberries . Exports account for PERCENT of the local production , which covers PERCENT of the NORP market . Most of the workers are irregular migrants from GPE and GPE . Some are employed on the farms permanently and others only on a seasonal basis .", "CARDINAL . The production unit in question was run by ORG , the applicants\u2019 employers .", "The applicants were among a total of CARDINAL workers divided into CARDINAL teams , each CARDINAL headed by a NORP national who reported to ORG", "CARDINAL . The workers had been promised a wage of CARDINAL ( ORG ) for CARDINAL hours\u2019 work and CARDINAL for TIME of overtime , with QUANTITY per day deducted for food . They worked in greenhouses DATE from TIME picking strawberries under the supervision of armed guards employed by ORG They lived in makeshift shacks made of cardboard , nylon and bamboo , without toilets or running water . According to them , their employers had warned them that they would only receive their wages if they continued to work for them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in DATE , DATE and on DATE the workers went on strike demanding payment of their unpaid wages , but without success .", "On DATE the employers recruited other NORP migrants to work in the fields . Fearing that they would not be paid , CARDINAL workers from DATE who worked in the fields started moving towards the CARDINAL employers , who were on the spot , in order to demand their wages . CARDINAL of the armed guards then opened fire against the workers , seriously injuring CARDINAL of them , including CARDINAL of the applicants ( listed under numbers CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ) . The wounded were taken to hospital and were subsequently questioned by police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the police arrested GPE and ORG , together with the guard who had fired the shots and another armed overseer . During the preliminary investigation by the local police , a number of other NORP , including some who had worked with the suspects , were used as interpreters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor charged the CARDINAL suspects with attempted murder and other offences , and also , in response to a request from the prosecutor at ORG , with human trafficking under LAW . The charge of attempted murder was subsequently reclassified as grievous bodily harm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor acknowledged that CARDINAL workers \u2013 including CARDINAL team - leaders \u2013 , who had all been injured during the incident , were victims of human trafficking , thus making them lawful residents under LAW of PERSON no . PERSON ( on the repression of human trafficking , crimes against sexual freedom , child pornography , and more generally sexual exploitation ) .", "CARDINAL .

They stated that they had been employed on the farm run by ORG in conditions of human trafficking and forced labour and that they were part of the group which had come under fire . Relying on LAW to LAW , known as the \u201c LAW \u201d , of DATE ( \u201c to Prevent , Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons \u201d ) , they asked the public prosecutor to bring charges under LAW of LAW against their employers , accusing them of exploiting them in a work - related context . They further alleged that , on DATE , they had also been present at the scene of the incident and that they had gone there to demand their unpaid wages , with the result that they were also victims of the offences committed against the other CARDINAL complainants .", "CARDINAL . The police questioned each of the above - mentioned CARDINAL applicants , who signed a record containing their statements , which had been given under oath and were accompanied by their photos , and they forwarded the statements to the public prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . NORP In decision CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG public prosecutor rejected the application of DATE workers . He emphasised that those workers had been sought in order to give testimony during the preliminary investigation and that CARDINAL of them had been traced and interviewed ( including the CARDINAL applicants mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He noted that it transpired from their statements and other material in the file that their allegations did not correspond to the reality . He explained that if they had really been the victims of the offences complained of , they would have gone to the police immediately on DATE , like the CARDINAL other workers had done , and would not have waited until DATE . In his view , the claim that the complainants had been afraid and had left their huts was not credible because they had been close to the scene of the incident and , when the police arrived , they could have returned to make their complaints known . He further noted that CARDINAL out of CARDINAL complainants interviewed had stated they had been injured and that , unlike the CARDINAL workers mentioned above , none of those CARDINAL workers had gone to hospital . Lastly , he observed that all the complainants had stated that they had made statements to the police after learning that they would receive residence permits as victims of human trafficking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor at ORG dismissed the appeals of DATE workers against decision no . CARDINAL on the grounds that the material in the case file did not substantiate their allegations and that they had sought to present themselves as victims of human trafficking in order to obtain residence permits ( decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The accused were committed to stand trial in ORG . Only GPE was charged with committing the offence of human trafficking . The CARDINAL other defendants , namely ORG and the CARDINAL armed overseers , were charged with aiding and abetting that offence . The hearings began on DATE and ended on DATE . The CARDINAL workers mentioned above joined the proceedings as civil parties and were represented by their lawyers PERSON and PERSON , whose fees were paid by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In his oral submissions the public prosecutor pointed out that the applicants who had been injured in the incident had been living and working in GPE without any permit , at the mercy of networks which exploited human beings and in conditions which enabled them to be characterised as victims of human trafficking . In his view both the material element and the mental element of this offence were made out in the present case .", "CARDINAL . The public prosecutor further emphasised that exploitation in a labour context was part of the notion of exploitation provided for in NORP and other international law instruments as a means of committing the offence of human trafficking . He indicated that LAW of LAW prohibited forced or compulsory labour . He explained that the notion of exploitation through work included all acts which constituted a breach of employment law , such as the provisions concerning TIME , working conditions and workers\u2019 insurance . In his view , that form of exploitation also obtained through the performance of work for the benefit of the offender himself .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the facts of the case , the public prosecutor explained that the employer , ORG , had not paid the workers for DATE , that he had only paid them a very small sum for food , deducted from their wages , and had promised to pay the rest later . He observed as follows : that the defendants were unscrupulous and imposed themselves by making threats and carrying weapons ; the workers laboured in extreme physical conditions , had to work TIME and were constantly humiliated ; on DATE , ORG had informed the workers that he would not pay them and would kill them , with the help of his co - accused , if they did not carry on working for him ; as the workers had not given in to the threats , he had told them to leave and said that he would take on another team in their place and that he would burn down their huts if they refused to leave . He lastly noted that , when he recruited them , ORG had promised the complainants makeshift shelters and a DATE wage of ORG DATE which in his view was the only solution for the victims to be sure of a means of subsistence DATE and that GPE had thus succeeded , at that point , in obtaining their consent in order to be able to exploit them subsequently .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor asserted that the incident of DATE was illustrative of a situation of over - exploitation and barbaric treatment to which the major landowners in the region had subjected the migrant workers . He took the view that the incident had been a barbaric and armed aggression by NORP employers against the migrants , conjuring up images of a \u201c southern slave - trade \u201d which had no place in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing , one of the witnesses , an officer from the police station of ORG , stated that DATE before the incident of CARDINAL DATE some workers had gone to the police station to complain that their employers had refused to pay them their wages and that CARDINAL of his colleagues had subsequently had a telephone conversation with GPE on this subject .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG acquitted the CARDINAL defendants on the charge of trafficking in human beings , on the ground that the material element of the offence was not made out in the present case . It convicted CARDINAL of the armed guards and ORG of grievous bodily harm and unlawful use of firearms , sentencing them to prison for terms of DATE , respectively . As regards the overseer who had been responsible for the shots , it took the view that he had not intended to kill those who were attacked in the incident and that he had been trying to make them move away so that the newly recruited workers would not be approached by them . As to GPE , it acquitted him on the ground that it had not been established that he was one of the workers\u2019 employers ( and therefore that he was obliged to pay them their wages ) or that he had been involved as an instigator of the armed attack against them . ORG commuted their prison sentences to a financial penalty of CARDINAL per day of detention . It also ordered the CARDINAL convicted men to pay the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the CARDINAL workers who were recognised as victims ( about EUR CARDINAL per person ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the workers\u2019 conditions of employment had provided that they would receive : PERSON CARDINAL for TIME of work and LAW for TIME ; food , of which the cost would be deducted from their wages ; and materials for the construction of electrified huts next to their plantations , at their ORG expense , to satisfy their basic accommodation needs DATE while allowing them the option of living elsewhere in the region . It noted that these conditions had been brought to the knowledge of the workers by their fellow countrymen who were team - leaders .", "CARDINAL . ORG thus observed that the workers had been informed of their conditions of employment and that they had accepted them after finding them satisfactory . As to the amount of the wages , it found that this was the usual amount paid by the other producers in the region and the workers had not been obliged to accept it . In the court \u2019s view , the information provided to the workers by their team - leaders and their compatriots working for other employers about the reliable payment of wages constituted a major factor in the choice of ORG as employer . ORG further noted that , until DATE , the workers had not made any complaint about their employer , whether concerning his conduct or the payment of wages , and they had only started to complain at DATE or DATE about a delay in payment .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ORG rejected the ORG allegations that they had not received any wages and had been subjected to a threatening and intimidating attitude , on the part of the defendants , throughout the duration of their work , on the following grounds : those allegations had been expressed for the first time at the hearing , and not at the stage of the preliminary enquiries or investigation ; certain intimidating acts had led the complainants to leave their place of work ; and the description of these acts was particularly imprecise and vague . ORG also noted that it transpired from the testimony of the workers that , during their free time , they were able to move freely around the region , do their shopping in shops which operated by agreement with the defendants , play cricket and take part in an association set up by their compatriots . It added that it had not been shown that ORG had , under false pretences and by means of promises , coerced the workers into agreeing to work for him by taking advantage of their situation of vulnerability , especially as it found that they were not in such a situation .", "CARDINAL . ORG took the view that it had also been shown that the relations between the workers and their employers had been governed by a binding employment relationship and its conditions were not intended to trap the workers or to lead to their domination by the employers . On that point , it explained that the conditions had not led the complainants to live in a state of exclusion from the outside world , without any possibility for them to abandon this relationship and look for another job . It further noted that the workers had been in a position to negotiate their conditions of employment at the time of their recruitment and that their unlawful presence in GPE had not been used by their employers as a means of coercion to force them to continue working .", "CARDINAL . ORG indicated that , for the notion of vulnerability to be constituted , the victim had to be in a state of impoverishment such that his refusal to submit to the offender would appear absurd ; in other words the victim had to be in a state of absolute weakness preventing him from protecting himself . It added that the victim would be exploited , as a result of his vulnerability , if he unconditionally submitted himself to the offender and was cut off from the outside world , which in the court \u2019s view was not the case here since : ( a ) the relations between the workers and their employers had been governed by a binding employment relationship , and ( b ) its conditions were not intended to trap the workers or to lead to their domination by the employers , such that the workers might be cut off from the outside world and find it impossible to withdraw from the employment relationship and find another job . ORG further observed that most of the workers had stated that they would have continued to work for their employers had they been paid their wages .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , as to the ORG allegation that they had received death threats from the defendants DATE an allegation that it did not accept DATE , ORG took the view that , if that statement had been true the workers would have left their place of work without hesitation . The fact of fearing for their lives would have prevailed over any other consideration ( such as : their unpaid wage demands ; their need to earn a living , which allegedly could not have been satisfied in view of the objective inability to find another job ; and all the other arguments that the workers had put forward to justify the fact that they had continued to work ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the convicted defendants appealed against the judgment of ORG . The appeal , which is still pending before that same court , has suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the workers\u2019 lawyers lodged an application with the public prosecutor at ORG asking him to appeal against ORG judgment . In their application they submitted that ORG had not adequately examined the charge of human trafficking . They took the view that , in order to determine whether that court had properly applied Article CARDINAL of LAW , it was necessary to examine whether the accused had taken advantage of any vulnerability of the foreign nationals in order to exploit them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor refused to lodge an appeal . He gave reasons for his decision , indicating only that the statutory conditions for an appeal on points of law were not met . As a result of this decision , the part of the DATE judgment concerning human trafficking became \u201c irrevocable \u201d ( \u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7 ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["4"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["4-1", "4-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
