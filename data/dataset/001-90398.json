On DATE the case was listed for the confiscation hearing with a time - estimate of DATE . The applicants objected that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the confiscation proceedings on the grounds that DATE had elapsed since their convictions and that the judge had not considered whether there were \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d warranting the imposition of the confiscation orders outside the statutory time - limit , as required by section CARDINALA ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG DATE , as amended ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the confiscation proceedings were listed again for mention . Renewal of argument in relation to ORG jurisdiction to hear the confiscation proceedings , in light of ORG judgment in NORP v. PERSON and ORG , was listed for DATE . Following the hearing on DATE , the judge held that the court retained a common law power to adjourn beyond the statutory DATE time - limit in compelling circumstances such as where there was an illness or the judge was unavailable . In his opinion a statutory postponement citing exceptional circumstances was required only where the purpose of the postponement was to gather further information , and not in the instant case where the issue had been the unavailability of the judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Court of Appeal heard and dismissed PERSON appeal against conviction . On DATE the confiscation proceedings were listed again for mention before the trial judge , to notify him of the result of PERSON appeal .

On DATE the second applicant \u2019s case was listed before ORG and the confiscation order was reduced to ORG CARDINAL , taking into account ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the ORG appeals and quashed the confiscation orders and default sentences of imprisonment . They noted that on DATE , defence counsel for the second applicant and the co - accused Mr. PERSON had requested an early hearing at ORG . However , the earliest date that the trial judge would be available was DATE beginning DATE . That date was pencilled in by the trial judge , even though it was \u201c DATE away \u201d . ORG considered that , given the importance attached by ORG and the courts to the link between confiscation orders and sentencing , a high degree of judicial scrutiny was required before finding exceptional circumstances to justify the imposition of a confiscation order outside the DATE time - limit . In the present case , there was no evidence of any enquiry from DATE ( when the second applicant was the first to plead guilty ) DATE into whether a space could be found for the confiscation hearing during DATE .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , on DATE , the trial judge had acknowledged with \u201c admirable candour \u201d when finding that he had jurisdiction to hear the confiscation proceedings outside the DATE time - limit that \u201c no enquiry was made of the ( applicants ) as to the postponement \u201d when the decision to hold the confiscation hearing in DATE beginning DATE was finally confirmed on DATE . Neither had there been any analysis of any factors which might amount to exceptional circumstances . The trial judge had also \u201c candidly acknowledged more than once \u201d that there were no exceptional circumstances . ORG ultimately found that the failure to address the question as to whether the circumstances could properly be described as exceptional and to make a finding to that effect was fatal to the upholding of the confiscation orders . Though in principle confiscation orders should not be quashed for mere defects in procedure , if the statutory requirement of exceptional circumstances was to be more than a \u201c mere incantation \u201d , enquiry into the circumstances and the possibility and feasibility of a timely hearing were required .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in the decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the prosecution leave to appeal against the decisions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reversed the decisions of ORG and ordered the latter to re - impose the confiscation orders in respect of both applicants .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the core problem before it was whether , as a matter of statutory construction , failure to comply with a statutory time - limit would have the effect of invalidating an act . The fact that ORG cast statutory requirements in imperative form without expressly specifying the consequences of a failure to comply had caused difficulty and had been the source of a great deal of litigation over DATE . A distinction had first evolved between mandatory and directory requirements ; where a requirement was mandatory , a failure to comply had the effect of invalidating the act in question but where a requirement was merely directory , a failure to comply did not invalidate the act . Over DATE , a further distinction had been made CARDINAL types of directory requirements : requirements of a purely regulatory character , where a failure to comply would never invalidate an act , and requirements where a failure to comply would not invalidate an act provided that there was substantial compliance . In ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , ORG , however , Lord PERSON had emphasised that it was within the ORG inherently discretionary jurisdiction to determine the nature of a particular statutory requirement and to examine the consequences of non - compliance before determining whether ORG had intended total invalidity . In the later case of ORG v. Commissioner of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , ORG followed and applied the dictum of Lord PERSON in GPE and GPE ( cited above ) . ORG also took into consideration a number of cases in which ORG had adopted the same approach , and parallel developments in the courts of GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , ORG considered that the prime purpose behind the statutory provision for confiscation orders was the recovery of any financial benefit that an offender might have obtained from his criminal conduct . ORG rejected the ORG argument that , given the criminal law context , a strict approach to the construction of section CARDINALA of the ORG DATE should be adopted and instead applied a teleological approach . They noted that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the CJA DATE imposed a positive duty to proceed with confiscation proceedings and that the time limits under section CARDINALA were linked to the date of conviction rather than sentence . This was considered to be evidence that ORG \u2019s intention was the early disgorgement of an offender \u2019s criminal gains . Though ORG had envisaged that courts would make confiscation orders before sentencing , unless they exercised their postponement power under LAW ) , it was of some significance that ORG considered it more important that a confiscation order should be made than that it should be made before the defendant was sentenced . Though no common law power to adjourn existed , ORG could not have intended to disable a court from making a confiscation order after sentence merely because the time - limits were not strictly adhered to .", "CARDINAL . In the present case , ORG had postponed its final decision on confiscation orders in good faith . The prejudice to the applicants was not significant and was outweighed by the countervailing public interest in not allowing convicted offenders to escape confiscation for what were no more than bona fide errors in the judicial process . In any event , there would always be the safeguard of judicial review should there be an apparent abuse of process .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG re - imposed the confiscation orders and sentences of imprisonment in default on the applicants ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
