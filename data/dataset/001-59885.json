The applicant made the following allegations concerning the events underlying the dispute he submitted to the NORP courts . The Government stated that they were not in a position to comment on the accuracy of these claims .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who is a trained pilot , went to GPE in DATE to assist in its defence against GPE . During the Gulf War he served as a member of ORG and , after the NORP invasion , he remained behind as a member of the resistance movement . During that period he came into possession of sex videotapes involving Sheikh PERSON ( \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) , who is related to the PERSON of GPE and is said to have an influential position in GPE . By some means these tapes entered general circulation , for which the applicant was held responsible by the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . After the NORP armed forces were expelled from GPE , on or about CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON and CARDINAL others gained entry to the applicant \u2019s house , beat him and took him at gunpoint in a government jeep to ORG . The applicant was falsely imprisoned there for DATE during which he was repeatedly beaten by security guards . He was released on CARDINAL DATE , having been forced to sign a false confession .", "CARDINAL . NORP On or about CARDINAL May CARDINAL the PERSON took the applicant at gunpoint in a government car to the palace of the PERSON of GPE \u2019s brother . At first the applicant \u2019s head was repeatedly held underwater in a swimming - pool containing corpses , and he was then dragged into a small room where the PERSON set fire to mattresses soaked in petrol , as a result of which the applicant was seriously burnt .", "CARDINAL . Initially the applicant was treated in a NORP hospital , and on CARDINAL DATE he returned to GPE where he spent DATE in hospital being treated for burns covering PERCENT of his total body surface area . He also suffered psychological damage and has been diagnosed as suffering from a severe form of post - traumatic stress disorder , aggravated by the fact that , once in GPE , he received threats warning him not to take action or give publicity to his plight .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted civil proceedings in GPE for compensation against the PERSON and ORG in respect of injury to his physical and mental health caused by torture in GPE in DATE and threats against his life and well - being made after his return to GPE on DATE . On DATE he obtained a default judgment against the PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings were re - issued after an amendment to include CARDINAL named individuals as defendants . On DATE a deputy ORG judge ex parte gave the applicant leave to serve the proceedings on the individual defendants . This decision was confirmed in chambers on DATE . He was not , however , granted leave to serve the writ on ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a renewed application to ORG , which was heard ex parte on DATE . Judgment was delivered the same day .", "The court held , on the basis of the applicant \u2019s allegations , that there were CARDINAL elements pointing towards ORG responsibility for the events in GPE : firstly , the applicant had been taken to a State prison ; secondly , government transport had been used on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE ; and , thirdly , in the prison he had been mistreated by public officials . It found that the applicant had established a good arguable case , based on principles of international law , that GPE should not be afforded immunity under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW : see paragraph MONEY below ) in respect of acts of torture . In addition , there was medical evidence indicating that the applicant had suffered damage ( post - traumatic stress ) while in GPE . It followed that the conditions in LAW rule ORG ) of the Rules of ORG had been satisfied ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that leave should be granted to serve the writ on ORG .", "CARDINAL . The NORP government , after receiving the writ , sought an order striking out the proceedings . The application was examined inter partes by ORG on DATE . In a judgment delivered the same day the court held that it was for the applicant to show on the balance of probabilities that ORG was not entitled to immunity under LAW . It was prepared provisionally to accept that the Government were vicariously responsible for conduct that would qualify as torture under international law . However , international law could be used only to assist in interpreting lacunae or ambiguities in a statute , and when the terms of a statute were clear , the statute had to prevail over international law . The clear language of LAW bestowed immunity upon sovereign GPE for acts committed outside the jurisdiction and , by making express provision for exceptions , it excluded as a matter of construction implied exceptions . As a result , there was no room for an implied exception for acts of torture in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . Moreover , the court was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that GPE was responsible for the threats made to the applicant after CARDINAL DATE . As a result , the exception provided for by LAW could not apply . It followed that the action against the ORG should be struck out .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed and ORG examined the case on DATE . The court held that the applicant had not established on the balance of probabilities that ORG was responsible for the threats made in GPE . The important question was , therefore , whether ORG immunity applied in respect of the alleged events in GPE . Lord Justice PERSON finding against the applicant , observed :", "\u201c Jurisdiction of the NORP court in respect of foreign GPE is governed by LAW DATE . LAW ) provides :", "\u2018 A ORG is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the GPE except as provided in the following provisions of this Part of this LAW . ... \u2019", "... The only relevant exception is section CARDINAL , which provides :", "\u2018 A ORG is not immune as respects proceedings in respect of", "( a ) death or personal injury ... caused by an act or omission in GPE", "It is plain that the events in GPE do not fall within the exception in section CARDINAL , and the express words of CARDINAL provide immunity to LAW . Despite this , in what [ counsel ] for the Plaintiff acknowledges is a bold submission , he contends that that section must be read subject to the implication that the ORG is only granted immunity if it is acting within ORG . So that the section reads : \u2018 A ORG acting within ORG is immune from jurisdiction except as provided ... \u2019", "... The argument is ... that international law against torture is so fundamental that it is a jus cogens , or compelling law , which overrides all other principles of international law , including the well - established principles of sovereign immunity . No authority is cited for this proposition . ... At common law , a sovereign ORG could not be sued at all against its will in the courts of this country . LAW , by the exceptions therein set out , marks substantial inroads into this principle . It is inconceivable , it seems to me , that the draughtsman , who must have been well aware of the various international agreements about torture , intended section CARDINAL to be subject to an overriding qualification .", "Moreover , authority in GPE at the highest level is completely contrary to [ counsel for the applicant \u2019s ] submission . [ Lord ORG referred to the judgments of GPE courts , GPE v. ORG and PERSON v. ORG , cited in paragraph CARDINAL below , in both of which the court rejected the argument that there was an implied exception to the rule of ORG immunity where the ORG acted contrary to ORG . ] ... [ Counsel ] submits that we should not follow the highly persuasive judgments of the NORP courts . I can not agree .", "... A moment \u2019s reflection is enough to show that the practical consequences of the Plaintiff \u2019s submission would be dire . The courts in GPE are open to all who seek their help , whether they are NORP citizens or not . A vast number of people come to this country DATE seeking refuge and asylum , and many of these allege that they have been tortured in the country whence they came . Some of these claims are no doubt justified , others are more doubtful . Those who are presently charged with the responsibility for deciding whether applicants are genuine refugees have a difficult enough task , but at least they know much of the background and surrounding circumstances against which the claim is made . The court would be in no such position . GPE would be unlikely to submit to the jurisdiction of the GPE court , and in its absence the court would have no means of testing the claim or making a just determination . ... \u201d", "The other CARDINAL members of ORG , Lord Justice Ward and Mr Justice PERSON , also rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . Lord Justice PERSON commented that \u201c there may be no international forum ( other than the forum of the locus delicti to whom a victim of torture will be understandably reluctant to turn ) where this terrible , if established , wrong can receive civil redress \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was refused leave to appeal by ORG . His attempts to obtain compensation from the NORP authorities via diplomatic channels have proved unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . There is no rule under LANGUAGE law requiring a plaintiff to be resident in GPE or to be a NORP national before the NORP courts can assert jurisdiction over civil wrongs committed abroad . Under the rules in force at the time the applicant issued proceedings , the writ could be served outside the territorial jurisdiction with the leave of the court when the claim fell within CARDINAL or more of the categories set out in order CARDINAL , Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG . For present purposes only Rule CARDINAL(f ) is relevant :", "\u201c ... service of a writ out of the jurisdiction is permissible with the leave of the court if , in the action begun by the writ ,", "...", "( f ) the claim is founded on a tort and the damage was sustained , or resulted from an act committed , within the jurisdiction ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant parts of LAW DATE provide :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

The above provision ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) was enacted to implement the DATE LAW ( \u201c the Basle Convention \u201d ) , a ORG instrument , which entered into force on DATE after its ratification by CARDINAL States . It has now been ratified by MONEY ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) and signed by CARDINAL other ORG ( GPE ) . LAW provides :", "\u201c A ORG can not claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of ORG in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to tangible property , if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory of the ORG of forum , and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those facts occurred . \u201d", "LAW provides that a Contracting State shall be entitled to immunity if the proceedings do not fall within the stated exceptions .", "CARDINAL . In its Report on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property ( DATE ) , the working group of ORG ( ILC ) found that over DATE a number of civil claims had been brought in municipal courts , particularly in GPE and GPE , against foreign governments , arising out of acts of torture committed not in the territory of the forum ORG but in the territory of the defendant and other GPE . The working group of the ORG found that national courts had in some cases shown sympathy for the argument that GPE are not entitled to plead immunity where there has been a violation of human rights norms with the character of jus cogens , although in most cases the plea of sovereign immunity had succeeded . The working group cited the following cases in this connection : ( GPE ) PERSON v. State of GPE CARDINAL International Law Reports CARDINAL at CARDINAL ; ( GPE ) ORG and Auditor General v. Sir PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL , particularly at CARDINAL ( per PERSON ) ; Dissenting Opinion of Justice Wald in GPE ) Princz v. GPE CARDINAL F DATE ( DC Cir . DATE ) at CARDINAL ; PERSON v. ORG ( CARDINALth Cir . DATE ) ; GPE v. PERSON Shipping Corporation CARDINAL US CARDINAL ( DATE ) ; GPE v. PERSON CARDINAL International Law Reports CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The working group of the ORG did , however , note CARDINAL recent developments which it considered gave support to the argument that a ORG could not plead immunity in respect of gross human rights violations . CARDINAL of these was the ORG of Lords\u2019 judgment in ex parte PERSON ( No . CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The other was the amendment by GPE of its LAW ( FSIA ) to include a new exception to immunity . This exception , introduced by section CARDINAL of the Anti - Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of DATE , applies in respect of a claim for damages for personal injury or death caused by an act of torture , extra - judicial killing , aircraft sabotage or hostage - taking , against a ORG designated by the Secretary of ORG as a sponsor of terrorism , where the claimant or victim was a national of GPE at the time the act occurred .", "In its judgment in PERSON v. ORG ( CARDINAL PERSON . DATE ( D.D.C. CARDINAL ) ) , ORG for GPE confirmed that the property of a foreign ORG was immune from attachment or execution , unless the case fell within CARDINAL of the statutory exceptions , for example that the property was used for commercial activity .", "CARDINAL .

The United Nations CARDINAL Declaration on ORG from Being Subjected to Torture and other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment provides in Article CARDINAL that :", "\u201c No State may permit or tolerate torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment , adopted on DATE ( \u201c the ORG Convention \u201d ) , torture is defined as :", "\u201c For the purposes of this Convention , the term \u2018 torture\u2019 means any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession , punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or coercing him or a third person , or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind , when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity . It does not include pain or suffering arising only from , inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions . \u201d", "The UN Convention requires by LAW that ORG is to take effective legislative , administrative , judicial or other measures to prevent torture in any territory under its jurisdiction , and by DATE that all acts of torture be made offences under each ORG \u2019s criminal law .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment in Prosecutor v. PERSON ( DATE , case no . IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL/I - T , ( DATE ) CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ) , ORG for the Former GPE observed as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It should be noted that the prohibition of torture laid down in human rights treaties enshrines an absolute right , which can never be derogated from , not even in time of emergency ... This is linked to the fact , discussed below , that the prohibition on torture is a peremptory norm or jus cogens . ... This prohibition is so extensive that GPE are even barred by international law from expelling , returning or extraditing a person to another ORG where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture .", "CARDINAL . These treaty provisions impose upon GPE the obligation to prohibit and punish torture , as well as to refrain from engaging in torture through their officials . In international human rights law , which deals with ORG responsibility rather than individual criminal responsibility , torture is prohibited as a criminal offence to be punished under national law ; in addition , all GPE parties to the relevant treaties have been granted , and are obliged to exercise , jurisdiction to investigate , prosecute and punish offenders . ...", "CARDINAL . The existence of this corpus of general and treaty rules proscribing torture shows that the international community , aware of the importance of outlawing this heinous phenomenon , has decided to suppress any manifestation of torture by operating both at the interstate level and at the level of individuals . No legal loopholes have been left .", "CARDINAL . There exists DATE universal revulsion against torture ... . This revulsion , as well as the importance GPE attach to the eradication of torture , has led to a cluster of treaty and customary rules on torture acquiring a particularly high status in the international , normative system .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... the prohibition of torture imposes on GPE obligations erga omnes , that is , obligations owed towards all the other members of the international community .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... the other major feature of the principle proscribing torture relates to the hierarchy of rules in the international normative order . Because of the importance of the values it protects , this principle has evolved into a peremptory norm or jus cogens , that is , a norm that enjoys a higher rank in the international hierarchy than treaty law and even \u2018 ORG customary rules . The most conspicuous consequence of this higher rank is that the principle at issue can not be derogated from by GPE through international treaties or local or special or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force .", "CARDINAL . Clearly the jus cogens nature of the prohibition against torture articulates the notion that the prohibition has now become CARDINAL of the most fundamental standards of the international community . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
