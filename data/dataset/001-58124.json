Built in DATE , it adjoins a former ORG convent and it has been used as a place of worship continuously since DATE . The building was acquired by the church by adverse possession ( ektakti khrissiktissia ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE CARDINAL people living next to the church , PERSON and Mr PERSON , demolished one of its surrounding walls , which was QUANTITY high , and made a window looking onto the church in the wall of their own building .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the church , represented by the abbot , the Right Reverend PERSON , applied to ORG seeking a declaration that it was the owner of the wall in question and orders that the defendants must cease the nuisance and restore the previously existing situation , that the judgment should be provisionally enforceable and that the defendants should be liable to a fine of MONEY and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment if they did not comply with the judgment .", "The defendants raised an objection to admissibility on the ground that NORP churches in GPE had no legal personality and were thus prevented from bringing legal proceedings .", "The plaintiff church answered the objection by stating that it was a cloister church , founded and authorised before DATE and recognised under LAW DATE . More particularly , it stated that it was a ORG cloister that had been authorised before DATE and belonged to the diocese of GPE and PERSON , which did have legal personality ( aftotelia ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the wall was owned by the church and ordered the defendants to rebuild it to its original height . As to the objection to admissibility , the court held that it was unfounded , accepting the plaintiff church \u2019s submissions , which \u2013 it found \u2013 were substantiated by the papal seal of DATE that was in the file ; the court also noted that the abbot was the manager of its wealth and was therefore entitled to represent it in legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The defendants appealed against that judgment to ORG of First Instance on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , allowing the appeal , quashed the judgment of the court below for the following reasons :", "\u201c \u2026", "The provisions of LAW of DATE , which remains in force by virtue of LAW No . CARDINAL annexed to LAW DATE , require GPE to ensure LOC freedom of religion , freedom of worship and equality before the law irrespective of their religious denomination \u2013 freedoms which are , moreover , guaranteed in DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the current LAW but do not provide that religious or other establishments founded by a religious minority may acquire legal personality without complying with the ORG \u2019s laws on the acquisition of legal personality . Furthermore , LAW adopted by the protecting powers on DATE , and ratified in GPE by ORG Memorandum of DATE , \u2026 did not confer on the bishops of ORG any jurisdiction other than spiritual and administrative , that is to say relating to that ORG \u2019s domestic order , and the provisions of the canon law that governs ORG which attribute legal personality to convents and other ORG establishments founded by decisions of the bishops of that ORG were not adopted .", "In the instant case ORG of the Capuchins , whose date of foundation is not apparent from the evidence , did not acquire legal personality from the sole fact of being founded by the competent bishop in GPE without the formalities laid down in NORP laws on the acquisition of legal personality having been complied with . Consequently , they have no legal standing and their action must be dismissed for that reason in accordance with LAW . The failure to comply with the ORG \u2019s laws on the acquisition of legal personality is admitted by the plaintiffs themselves . It must be noted that even if this church was founded before DATE , it accordingly did not acquire legal personality , having failed to comply with the laws of the ORG .", "\u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the church appealed on points of law , alleging a breach of LAW of CARDINAL DATE taken together with ORG DATE , LAW , LAW , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW .", "In his opinion of DATE the reporting judge of ORG indicated that he thought the judgment of CARDINAL DATE should be quashed ; he pointed out that under LAW NORP nationals belonging to religious minorities enjoyed the same protection in law and in fact and the same safeguards as other NORP nationals and , in particular , had an equal right to establish religious foundations and practise their religion freely ; furthermore , under the canon law of ORG , churches , convents and monasteries established with the approval of ORG had legal personality without it being necessary to comply with the formalities laid down in NORP laws . Such a restriction would be contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal in the following terms :", "\u201c \u2026", "[ LAW ] , having been ratified in a statute , was kept in force as domestic law , but inasmuch as its content is covered by ORG , which is much wider in scope , the treaty must be regarded as having been abrogated by this subsequent Convention , which pursues the same objective . However , the special provisions of the treaty which are not reproduced in LAW and do not conflict with it must be regarded as still being in force . By means of the Convention Greece protects , inter alia , the religious freedom not only of minorities but of any person within its jurisdiction , irrespective of religion , national origin , membership of an ethnic minority , etc . LAW , which provides for freedom to practise any \u2018 NORP religion and for freedom to perform religious obligations without hindrance , likewise corresponds to the content [ of the Convention ] .", "Regard being had to the foregoing , it is clear that the above - mentioned provisions guarantee to religious minorities freedom of religion , freedom of worship and religious equality and , by extension , the right to found religious associations and establishments , which acquire legal personality as of right but only after complying with the ORG \u2019s laws on such acquisition \u2026 It is even provided ( in LAW ) that the religious convictions of minorities can not constitute a legal ground exempting them from complying with the above - mentioned laws on the acquisition of legal personality , which , by the first sentence of LAW of LAW , is a condition of being able to bring or defend legal proceedings \u2026 Consequently , if LAW , whereby everyone is entitled to seek legal protection from the courts , is to apply , the above - mentioned statutory conditions must be satisfied . Furthermore , since section CARDINAL of the Introductory Law to LAW \u2026 provides that only legal persons \u2018 lawfully DATE at the date of adoption of the Civil Code continue to exist , the court below rightly held that LAW did not apply in the instant case as the formalities required by GPE \u2019s laws for the acquisition of legal personality had not been complied with by the appellants . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

By DATE , \u201c A person who has the capacity to possess rights and be bound by obligations shall also be entitled to bring or defend legal proceedings . Unions of persons which pursue a specified aim without being associations and also partnerships that do not have legal personality may bring or defend legal proceedings . \u201d", "This concept of a union of persons seems to approximate to the concept of a common - interest group in NORP law , since the courts have applied the concept to co - ownership of a seagoing vessel , to a political party and to an association of co - owners of a building .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The applicant church annexed to the memorial it filed with the ORG a series of judgments given by the highest courts in the land which , it submitted , substantiated its assertion that neither the legal personality of ORG in GPE nor its capacity to bring or defend legal proceedings had ever been called in question . The decisions were the following :", "( a ) judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG , in which the court held that the appropriate NORP bishop represented the legal person of ORG and its parish churches in legal proceedings for the protection of their property , and did so by virtue of the NORP canon law , which was wholly applicable in GPE in so far as it did not conflict with any provisions of national law ;", "( b ) judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG , in which the court ruled similarly , holding that the canon law of ORG had been recognised in LAW DATE \u201c as having the force of law \u201d in GPE ;", "( c ) judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG , in which the court held that it was for the PERSON to appoint local administrators of ORG property and , moreover , that there was no need for NORP parish churches \u201c once established and lawfully in existence , to obtain permission from the ORG authorities to acquire [ their ] legal personality \u201d ;", "( d ) judgment no . CARDINAL of ORG of LOC , in which it was held that NORP parish churches were represented by persons appointed by the PERSON , according to canon law ;", "( e ) judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG ( the first to be given on the subject after LAW of DATE had come into force ) , in which the court held that legal persons constituted before DATE were accorded full recognition under section CARDINAL of the Introductory Law to LAW ; as regards , more specifically , ORG foundations in GPE , it was held in the same judgment that NORP bishops had \u201c special \u201d power to constitute them by means of a unilateral decision , without any need for that decision to take any particular form or to be subject to any prior authorisation ;", "( f ) judgment no .

DATE of a full court of ORG , whereby the court recognised the legal personality of the parish church of PERSON the GPE on the island of ORG in a case of expropriation in the public interest ;", "( h ) judgment no .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL delivered by ORG in the present case , ORG dismissed an action brought jointly by ORG and the applicant church for recovery of possession of a rented property , holding that the plaintiffs had no standing as they did not have legal personality ( judgment no . ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government cited a judgment of ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in which it was held that a monastery founded in DATE by a decision of the NORP bishop of GPE had not by virtue of that fact alone acquired legal personality .
