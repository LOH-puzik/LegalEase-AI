A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants , who are all NORP citizens , were indicted on charges of having committed , inter alia , aggravated drug offences and aggravated violation of GPE in Medicinal Products ( lagen ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) om handel med l\u00e4kemedel m.m . , hereafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) . According to the prosecutor , during the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , in GPE and the county of GPE , the applicants and CARDINAL other defendants had , together and in consultation , created a business on CARDINAL different websites on the internet through which they had sold medicinal products illegally for a total amount of CARDINAL MONEY ( SEK ) , MONEY ( ORG ) of which products for an amount of MONEY , approximately ORG CARDINAL , constituted narcotic drugs .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants were accused of having been responsible for the business . The first applicant had operated from GPE while the second applicant had operated mainly from GPE . They had allegedly controlled the other GPE actions , received orders from customers all over the world and forwarded these to the persons responsible for the distribution of the medicinal products , including the narcotic drugs . According to the prosecutor , they had also been involved in company acquisitions to facilitate the web trade of medicinal products and credit card payments . The first and second applicants had also participated in the creation of the websites where the medicinal products , including the narcotic drugs , had been sold and opened bank accounts for payments received for the products . The third applicant , who had operated from GPE , was accused of having created , administered and dealt with customer contacts for CARDINAL of the websites through which the medicinal products and narcotic drugs had been sold . In relation to the charges for aggravated drug offences , he was also accused of having promoted narcotic drug trafficking by illegally holding and forwarding payments for narcotic drugs . The fourth applicant was accused of having created CARDINAL of the internet sites used for the trading of the medicinal products and the narcotic drugs and of having administered and dealt with customer contacts on all CARDINAL internet sites .", "CARDINAL . Legal representatives were appointed to the applicants , who denied the charges . The applicants and their co - defendants argued , among other things , that NORP courts did not have jurisdiction in the case as no medicinal products had ever been physically present in GPE and nothing had been sold to persons in GPE . The medicinal products had been acquired outside of GPE and sold to people in various countries but never in GPE . In their view , their business had been lawful and they had not committed any criminal offence under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a main hearing which lasted DATE , ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicants of aggravated drug offences and sentenced them to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In so far as concerned its jurisdiction , ORG first noted that GPE ( Narkotikastrafflagen ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) was applicable also to crimes committed outside of GPE for which reason the alleged drug offences were covered by that Act . It then noted that several of the alleged activities had taken place in GPE , such as offering the medicinal products , including the narcotic drugs , for sale from GPE and establishing the contacts between sellers and buyers from GPE . These activities were , in the court \u2019s view , sufficient to find that the alleged crimes had been completed in GPE . Therefore , it had jurisdiction to try this charge . The court proceeded to find that the applicants had been involved in the activities as specified by the prosecutor and that they had known that it was illegal and in breach of NORP law .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG acquitted the applicants of the second charge as it found that LAW was not applicable in the present case as no medicinal products had passed through GPE and the business had not been aimed at consumers in GPE . According to the court , the ORG \u2019s monopoly to trade with medicinal products in GPE had therefore not been breached .", "CARDINAL . The applicants as well as the prosecutor appealed against the judgment to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) . The prosecutor argued , inter alia , that the applicants should also be convicted of aggravated violation of LAW . The applicants submitted inter alia that the appellate court should dismiss the charges against them or , alternatively , that the charges for aggravated drugs offences should be rejected . They maintained that NORP courts lacked jurisdiction and that they had not committed any criminal offence under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following a main hearing , ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s conviction of aggravated drug offences for the first and second applicants . It aquitted the third applicant of that charge as it did not find that he had been aware that medicinal products classified as narcotic drugs had been sold on the internet sites . Lastly , it altered the fourth applicant \u2019s conviction to complicity to aggravated drug offences . However , the appellate court also convicted the first and second applicants of aggravated violation of LAW and the third and fourth applicants of complicity to aggravated violation of LAW . The first and second applicants were sentenced to DATE imprisonment , the third applicant was given a probationary sentence and a fine of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the fourth applicant was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court found that since the first applicant , who had had the leading role in the business , had operated from GPE and the other defendants had taken part in the same business , all their actions should be deemed as having been committed in GPE . Consequently , the court had jurisdiction to consider the acts and NORP law was applicable . As regards the charge of aggravated violation of LAW , the appellate court noted that the business had been large scale , comprising sales of MONEY CARDINAL . Since the DATE Act prohibited sales of medicinal products by others that GPE , or a legal entity in which the ORG had decisive influence , the court found that the applicants had violated the LAW as specified by the prosecutor in the indictment . ORG further noted that it did not consider that convicting the defendants would be in breach of either the principle of legality when applying LAW in its wording before it was amended on DATE , or any ORG laws or regulations .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and CARDINAL of their co - defendants appealed against the judgment to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) , maintaining their claims .", "CARDINAL . ORG granted leave to appeal concerning the question whether what ORG had found proven in relation to each of the defendants under the charges of aggravated violation of the DATE Act meant that the prerequisites to convict them under LAW were fulfilled . The question of leave to appeal for the remainder of the case was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG gave judgment , answering the question in the affirmative , namely , that the prerequisites to convict the applicants under LAW were fulfilled in the present case . In view of its finding , it refused leave to appeal for the remainder of the case . ORG first noted that the prosecuted activities of the defendants , that is the running of the retail business during the specified time , were to be seen collectively and hence be considered as CARDINAL crime , even though they comprised several acts carried out at various times where each act was sufficient to be considered a crime of itself . The main question was then whether the activities could be considered to have been performed in GPE . Agreeing with ORG , ORG found that this was the case since some of the acts had been carried out in GPE and GPE therefore had jurisdiction to try the charge in its entirety in accordance with the principle of ubiquity and LAW , ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) . As regards the acts of complicity , such acts should be considered to be committed not only where they were performed , but also where the main act had been committed . ORG hence concluded that the NORP courts had jurisdiction to try the charges against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . ORG then turned to consider whether the applicants and their co - defendants had violated NORP law , namely LAW . Here , the court noted that LAW was primarily directed at regulating the trade of medicinal products in GPE and that it had to establish whether it was applicable when neither the products nor the buyers were physically present in GPE , that is when the trade was based in GPE but directed against foreign markets . In deciding this , the court had regard to the rapid development of the technical means of trading over national borders and the interest to protect the health and safety of consumers , also outside of GPE . It further took into account LAW and Other Information Society Services ( lagen ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) om elektronisk handel och andra informationssamh\u00e4llets tj\u00e4nster , hereafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) which was based upon the ORG directive CARDINAL of DATE on certain legal aspects of information society services , in particular electronic commerce , in FAC ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The directive established the subjective territoriality principle in that Member States should ensure that services emanating from within their territories complied with national provisions applicable in that ORG . ORG noted that the subjective territoriality principle was an established principle applicable to various areas . It further concluded that retail trading of medicinal products was not , as such , covered by the scope of LAW . Even though marketing and ordering of medicinal products via internet did , in fact , fall under the LAW , actual deliveries of medicinal products were not covered by the scope of the LAW . Having regard to the above as well as to the interest to protect the health and safety of consumers , avoid that GPE be considered as a suitable base for irresponsible large - scale medicinal trade and that there did not appear to exist any formal or other circumstances directly contradicting that the subjective territoriality principle was applicable , ORG concluded that LAW was applicable and that the defendants had breached it as found by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The third applicant requested ORG to re - open the case on DATE . He claimed inter alia that LAW in its wording before it was amended on DATE , referred to a repealed ordinance ( LAW ORG ( CARDINAL ) ) and that therefore , he could not have foreseen that the acts he was convicted of were illegal . The request was rejected by ORG on DATE since it found that the applicant had not shown any such new circumstance that would justify a re - opening of the case .", "CARDINAL . The provisions applied in the present case were laid down in LAW . It may be noted that LAW was replaced , on DATE , by a new ORG in Medicinal Products ( lagen ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) om handel med l\u00e4kemedel \u2013 hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provided , inter alia , that retail trade of medicinal products should be conducted by the ORG or by a legal entity , appointed by the ORG , in which the ORG had a decisive influence . DATE and DATE the state owned company ORG had exclusive rights to sell medicinal products in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In its wording until DATE , section CARDINAL of LAW referred to retail trade in \u201c items that are covered by the now repealed Medicinal Products Ordinance ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) \u201d and QUANTITY . However , through a legislative amendment this was changed and , as from DATE , section CARDINAL instead referred to LAW ( L\u00e4kemedelslagen ( CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) and Regulation ( ORG ) No . CARDINAL of ORG and of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a person who intentionally or negligently violated section CARDINAL should be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment not exceeding one year , unless the act was punishable under LAW . It further provided that minor offences should not be punishable and that an intentional violation that had been conducted as a professional activity , concerned a considerable quantity or value , or otherwise was of a particularly dangerous nature , should be subject to imprisonment not exceeding DATE .", "CARDINAL . With the entry into force of the DATE Act , on DATE , the pharmacy market was deregulated to allow actors other than ORG the right to sell medicinal products to the general public . However , an authorisation and special permit from ORG is required to sell medicinal products to the general public .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW provides inter alia that any person who unlawfully either transfers narcotics , acquires narcotics for the purpose of transfer , or procures , processes , packages , transports , keeps or in some other similar way handles narcotics that are not for personal use , or offers narcotics for sale , keeps or conveys payment for narcotics , mediates contacts between seller and buyer or takes any other such measure , if the procedure is designed to promote narcotics traffic , shall , if he or she has acted with intent , be sentenced for drug offences to imprisonment for not DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the LAW , in case of an aggravated offence , the sentence shall be imprisonment of DATE and at DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG has applied LAW to criminal acts committed abroad without this having constituted an issue per se ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL and NJA DATE p. CARDINAL ) . This approach has also been confirmed in legal doctrine ( see for instance , GPE , LOC kriminalr\u00e4tt [ General criminal law ] , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The regulations regarding the jurisdiction of NORP courts in criminal cases and the applicability of NORP penal laws are laid down in LAW of LAW . LAW , LAW provides that crimes committed in GPE shall be adjudicated in accordance with NORP law and by a NORP court . The same applies when it is uncertain where the crime was committed but grounds exist for assuming that it was committed in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW a crime is deemed to have been committed where the criminal act was perpetrated and also where the crime was completed or , in the case of an attempt , where the intended crime would have been completed . According to the preparatory works to LAW ( see NJA II CARDINAL p. CARDINAL ) and NORP case - law ( ORG case ORG DATE p. CARDINAL , as well as the ORG case ORG CARDINAL ) , as soon as a part of a crime has taken place within the realm , the criminal act in its entirety is to be considered to have been perpetrated in GPE ( the principle of ubiquity ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of complicity to a crime , it is considered that the location of the criminal act is determined by both the act of complicity and the main act . An accomplice acting from abroad will be deemed to have committed a crime within the country , if he is aiding a main perpetrator to carry out or complete a crime in GPE ( see , for example , PERSON . , PERSON , En kommentar [ Commentary to LAW ] , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Application of penal provisions by analogy is prohibited according to LAW , LAW . GPE provisions should be prescribed by law . In a judgment of DATE ( ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) ORG stated that there were no impediments to interpret penal provisions in accordance with the recognised principles for interpretation of the law . However , such an interpretation had to be made cautiously .", "CARDINAL . NORP The penal law principle of legality also embodies a general requirement that a penal provision should be sufficiently clear and precise . It should be possible to foresee the application of a penal provision to a reasonable extent and it should be compatible with the grounds and purpose of the penal provision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
