However , the project had failed , which showed the GPE incapacity for exercising their parental role and belied the temporary nature of the situation . With reference to the social services\u2019 findings , ORG emphasised that the failure of the project had had negative consequences for the children and that the declaration was geared to protecting their interest in being fostered in a family capable of properly caring for them , which their family of origin was incapable of doing owing to the mother \u2019s state of health and the father \u2019s difficulties . ORG noted that there had been some positive developments in the situation , such as the mother \u2019s realisation of her health problems and her determination to undergo treatment , as well as the father \u2019s efforts to find resources in order to look after his children and the availability of the grandfather to help out . However , ORG held that those factors were insufficient to assess the CARDINAL GPE capacities for exercising their parental responsibilities . Having regard to those factors , and with an eye to safeguarding the children \u2019s interests , ORG also confirmed their availability for adoption .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the children \u2019s father lodged an appeal on points of law .
