ORG The applicant submitted a copy of a decision of DATE by ORG of ORG , quashing a decision by a city court to prolong an authorisation to use security measures under LAW . Such prolongation should , after a main hearing ( hovedforhandling ) , be decided by way of judgment by the city court which had initially given the authorisation , sitting , not with a single judge ( forh\u00f8rsrett ) , but with lay assessors ( domsmenn ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG delivered a judgment ( PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) which included the following statements about the interpretation of the second paragraph of Article CARDINAL :", "\" The connection between the criminal acts that provided the grounds for security measures , and the new - extended - authorisation of such supervision is quite crucial to the question whether the second paragraph , cf . the first paragraph , of LAW requires that there must be a justified suspicion of a new criminal act punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding DATE . ORG can not see that any such requirement can be read into the provision . Since the original criminal act can be the offence that provides grounds for continued security measures , it must also be possible for it to be the offence that forms the basic condition for a remand in custody pursuant to the said provision , which moreover will also in this instance require tha the general conditions for a remand in custody , e.g. a risk of repetition of an offence , are fulfilled ( see PERSON DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . This interpretation is supported by the legislative background of this provision . Before the DATE LAW the provision concerning a remand in custody in connection with proceedings relating to security measures was contained in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( b ) , item CARDINAL , of LAW . There was nothing in that provision which indicated a new criminal act as a condition for a remand in custody in connection with proceedings for an extension of security measures . There is nothing in the legislative history in connection with the inclusion of this provision among the provisions of LAW concerning remanding in custody which indicates that any change on this point was intended . Nor is it indicated by any considerations of policy . It is conceivable that the need for an extension of security measures will first become clear close to the expiry of the period of the security measures without there being any reason to criticise the prosecuting authority for not raising the question earlier , and without the need that has become apparent having any basis in the commission of a new criminal act punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding DATE . In such cases it may appear to be unconditionally necessary in order to prevent the commission of new serious criminal acts that the offender should be remanded in custody until a new legally enforceable authorisation for security measures subsists . ORG can not see that this interpretation of the second paragraph of Article CARDINAL , cf . the first paragraph , of LAW to the effect that a new criminal act punishable by imprisonment for DATE is not required - is contrary to the provision in ORG . The provision in the LAW which might conceivably be applicable must be LAW CARDINAL ( c ) ( article QUANTITY ) . ORG has interpreted this provision ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-c ) to the effect that it \u2018 permits deprivation of liberty only in connection with criminal GPE ( see , inter alia , the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the PERSON case ) . The rule must be that a person who is convicted of a criminal act can not , after having served his sentence , be subjected to a new remand in custody on the basis of the matters that have been adjudicated because there is reason to fear the commission of new criminal acts . In cases of security measures , however , the situation is - as the ORG has stated - that an authorisation of limited duration is given to apply specific security measures , which can be extended if the conditions for such extension subsist . The extension will be a part of the reaction system - see LAW para . CARDINAL ( a ) of the LAW ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-a ) . When a decision is made to remand an offender in custody as a step in proceedings for the extension of security measures , because he is dangerous and it is necessary to protect vulnerable persons - in this case children against sexual assaults - ORG can take no other view than that the remand in custody , in the same way as when a remand in custody is otherwise used pending a sentence becoming legally enforceable , has the necessary connection with the criminal acts committed and the lawful prosecution thereof . ORG also finds it necessary to consider the restriction which ORG has read into Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) of the LAW ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-c ) as regards the condition \u2018 necessary to prevent him from committing a criminal act\u2019 , i.e. that a remand in custody must be to \u2018 prevent a concrete and specific offence\u2019 ( see , inter alia , the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the PERSON case ) . This need for concretisation is significant . A more general risk of punishable offences would not be sufficient ... In the opinion of ORG , the risk of a criminal act [ in this case ] was concrete and specific for the purposes of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) ( article QUANTITY ) ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that the detention should not be a disproportionate measure .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of LAW , a person who , because of his or her mental state , does not seek the medical supervision and psychiatric health care which he or she needs and whose nearest relatives fail to ensure that he or she does so , may be subjected to compulsory medical examination and may , if necessary , be placed without his or her own consent , for DATE , for treatment in a hospital or other appropriate place .", "However , under section CARDINAL , a person suffering from serious mental illness may be admitted to hospital without his or her consent if his or her nearest relatives or a public authority so desire , and if the senior physician at the hospital considers , on the basis of the patient \u2019s state of health , that such admission is necessary in order to prevent him from suffering harm or that the prospect for recovery or substantial improvement is jeopardised or that the patient presents a serious danger to himself or others ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
