On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for registration of the title of a periodical , ORG A NORP Moral Tribunal ( PERSON spo\u0142eczno - polityczny , europejski s\u0105d moralny ) to be published in PERSON . The court considered that in accordance with LAW and the Ordinance of the Minister of Justice on the registration of periodicals , the name of a periodical should be relevant to its contents . The name as proposed by the applicant would suggest that a NORP institution had been established in GPE , which was untrue and would be misleading to prospective buyers . Moreover , the proposed title would be disproportionate to the periodical 's actual importance and readership as it was hardly conceivable that a periodical of a NORP dimension could be published in GPE . The court went on to state :", "\u201c ... the applicant stubbornly applies for registration of periodicals the titles of which would suggest the existence in GPE an institution of international character ( such as ORG or ORG ) , and when requested by the court to change the titles he declares that he will not do so . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The court considered that registration of the periodical with the proposed title would be harmful to NORP reconciliation and detrimental to good cross - border relations .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision , submitting that it was incomprehensible and amounted to censorship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the contested decision . The court observed that the title , as proposed by the applicant , suggested that the proposed periodical would concentrate unduly on negative aspects of NORP relations . The court considered that such a title would be in conflict with reality in that it would give an unbalanced picture of the relevant facts . The court further considered that the lower court had been justified in refusing registration on the ground that the title would be detrimental to NORP reconciliation and to good relations between GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL .
