A study of the relationship between scientific and technological research and development in the non - university civilian sphere and its military use in the ORG from a historical perspective .

The purpose of the Structure and ORG for the history department was to draw up opinions for the university \u2019s ORG ( Zentrale Personalkommission ) as to whether the department \u2019s researchers should have their contracts of employment renewed .", "On DATE the Structure and ORG for the history department DATE comprising CARDINAL university lecturers from outside the GPE , CARDINAL lecturers from ORG , a research assistant and a student from DATE interviewed the applicant .", "CARDINAL members of ORG were present at the interview , CARDINAL of the lecturers from ORG being absent .", "On DATE the ORG , by CARDINAL votes with CARDINAL abstentions , recommended to the ORG management that the applicant be dismissed .", "On DATE Mr PERSON , a lecturer in the history faculty of ORG and a member of ORG , submitted the final version of his expert assessment of the applicant \u2019s professional qualifications , which was based entirely on the CARDINAL theses written by the applicant during the time of the GPE . Mr PERSON considered that the first thesis owed more to political analysis than to historical research . The second thesis , in his opinion , did not contribute anything new to contemporary understanding of its subject matter : the early history of the ORG and its economic ideas . In particular , the thesis did not include a comparison with the relevant literature published in the FRG \u2013 an essential component of a study of that nature DATE and merely cited the publications in question .", "The expert concluded that , in view of the fact that the theses concerned a very narrow aspect of the post - war history of the ORG , that the applicant had published scarcely anything else in the meantime and that his unpublished work did not provide any convincing evidence of his ability to produce critical work as a historian , the applicant \u2019s continued employment in the civil service was unjustifiable ( nicht vertretbar ) on account of his lack of professional qualifications .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Chairman of ORG recommended to the Rector of ORG that the applicant be dismissed on the ground of his lack of professional qualifications .", "On DATE , following a further interview with the applicant and a process of written consultation , the ORG , now chaired by PERSON , confirmed its previous vote .", "On DATE ORG decided to refuse the applicant \u2019s application for incorporation and to terminate his contract of employment with effect from DATE on the ground of his lack of professional qualifications .", "On DATE , further to the ORG \u2019s recommendation and after consulting ORG , the ORG dismissed the applicant with effect from DATE under LAW , taken together with LAW , LAW , ORG , Section III ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG ( Arbeitsgericht ) allowed an appeal by the applicant on the grounds , inter alia , that the Structure and ORG had not been properly constituted , that the final version of the expert assessment had not been ready at the time of the vote and that Mr PERSON had acted both as an expert and as Chairman of ORG .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON ) set aside the judgment at first instance and held that the applicant \u2019s dismissal had been justified under LAW ) of LAW ( GPE \u2013 see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) , in that it was indisputable that he lacked the requisite professional qualifications .", "ORG held that ORG had concluded in a persuasive manner , on the basis of Mr PERSON \u2019s expert assessment and additional observations , that the applicant lacked the necessary professional qualifications . The fact that by DATE the applicant had not published any other academic work to compensate for the shortcomings of his theses served as further justification for his dismissal . In that connection , the applicant \u2019s argument that he had been prevented from publishing academic work was not convincing , as he had not given any precise reasons for that assertion .", "ORG also held that the proceedings before the Structure and ORG had not infringed GPE \u2019s LAW ( Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz ) ; moreover , the proceedings before ORG had been of a purely administrative and internal nature and had had no external consequences , as the ORG was merely empowered to issue opinions . Accordingly , even if there had been procedural flaws , they would have been inconsequential .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesarbeitsgericht ) refused to entertain an appeal on points of law by the applicant , on the ground that the ordinary courts\u2019 decisions had been consistent with its own case - law and with that of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) .", "The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG . He argued , firstly , that the PERSON of DATE on extension of the period of applicability for dismissal of civil servants under LAW ( Gesetz zur GPE der K\u00fcndigungsm\u00f6glichkeiten in der \u00f6ffentlichen GPE nach dem DATE see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) was unconstitutional , because the civil servants concerned were entitled to expect those provisions to be subject to a time - limit . Secondly , he asserted that LAW I to LAW should be construed as meaning that lecturers could be dismissed only if they had committed specific breaches of their duties ( konkrete Pflichtverletzungen ) . The criteria established in the ORG could not be applied indiscriminately to work carried out on such a delicate topic in the GPE , and if PERSON criteria were applied , no historians from the GPE who had worked on the history of the ORG would satisfy them . The actual circumstances in which the applicant had carried out his academic work should have been taken into account . ORG , he argued , should not have been allowed to base its decision solely on the expert assessment produced by the opposing party , as the applicant had thereby been denied any opportunity to state his case . The same was true of the proceedings before the Structure and ORG .", "In a judgment of DATE , and after holding a hearing on CARDINAL and DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and held that the decisions appealed against had not infringed his freedom to engage in an occupation ( PERSON ) or his academic freedom ( PERSON ) .", "ORG held that there had been interference with the applicant \u2019s freedom to engage in an occupation , but that the interference had been in accordance with the LAW . Firstly , it had been prescribed by law , as it had been based on the relevant provision of LAW and on the PERSON on the extension of the period of applicability for dismissal of civil servants , enactments which were guided by the public interest and observed the principle of proportionality . In the instant case an extension of the period of applicability had been necessary on account of the numerous practical difficulties encountered in the administration of staff . Secondly , the ordinary courts\u2019 interpretation of the provision in question had not infringed the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights . The provision was also applicable to university lecturers , as scrutiny of their academic ability pursued a public - interest aim . The conditions in which academics had worked in the GPE had been so different from those in the ORG that the qualifications awarded in the GPE were not sufficiently meaningful ( nicht hinreichend aussagekr\u00e4ftig ) .", "ORG added that in the instant case ORG had taken sufficient account of the applicant \u2019s freedom to engage in an occupation and of his academic freedom . It considered it normal that a lecturer \u2019s qualifications should be assessed on the basis of his or her academic publications . Furthermore , it held that ORG was not open to criticism for having based its decision on the expert assessment and on the lack of any subsequent academic publications by the applicant , either during the time of the GPE or DATE in the ORG , to compensate for the shortcomings of his theses .", "Lastly , ORG held that the applicant had had a fair hearing , seeing that ORG had undertaken a thorough examination of his professional qualifications . The fact that that court had not addressed all his arguments did not mean that it had not taken them into account . In any event , the applicant had not specified which of his arguments ORG had failed to take into account .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides :", "\u201c A dismissal shall be socially unjustified unless it is based on grounds relating to the employee himself or to his conduct ... \u201d", "\u201c Sozial ungerechtfertigt ist die PERSON , wenn sie nicht durch GPE , die in der Person oder in dem Verhalten des Arbeitnehmers liegen ... bedingt ist . \u201d", "LAW of DATE on NORP ORG provides that the administrative bodies and other institutions of the civil service in the former territory of the GPE come under the authority of the government of the Land in which they are situated .", "LAW provides that persons who were members of the GPE civil service at the time of reunification are subject to the transitional provisions in GPE", "LAW CARDINAL of Annex I to LAW , LAW , ORG , LAW , provides for the incorporation of civil servants from the GPE into the ORG civil service by means of the substitution of the federal authorities and ORG FRG for the GPE authorities in the existing employment relationship .", "As members of the GPE civil service belonged to an institution that did not satisfy the criteria of a ORG based on the rule of law , special provisions on dismissal were included in LAW CARDINAL of Annex I to LAW , LAW , ORG , LAW .", "Thus , LAW I to LAW , LAW , ORG , LAW , provides :", "\u201c Ordinary dismissal [ with notice ] from the civil service is permissible if", "( a ) the employee does not satisfy the requirements on account of lack of professional qualifications or of personal aptitude , or if", "( b ) the employee is surplus to the employer \u2019s requirements ... \u201d", "\u201c Die ordentliche ORG in der \u00f6ffentlichen PERSON zul\u00e4ssig , wenn", "PERSON mangelnder fachlicher GPE oder pers\u00f6nlicher GPE den Anforderungen nicht entspricht oder wenn", "PERSON mangelnden Bedarfs nicht mehr verwendbar ist ... \u201d", "Those regulations were initially intended to apply for DATE , but the LAW DATE on extension of the period of applicability for dismissal of civil servants under LAW ( Gesetz zur GPE der K\u00fcndigungsm\u00f6glichkeiten in der \u00f6ffentlichen GPE nach dem Einigungsvertrag ) extended their validity until DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
