The helicopter took off at TIME reached a height of QUANTITY . Immediately before the start of the parachute jumps Chief PERSON , in charge of the jumps , instructed the helicopter 's pilots to speed up . The pilots responded \u201c You have it \u201d . It is unclear what the exact speed thus reached was , because , as it was established later , the helicopter 's device recording the parameters of the flight had not been loaded with a tape .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Ministers of the Interior and Defence appointed a CARDINAL - member commission to investigate the reasons that had led to the fatal accident . The commission , which included paratroopers , doctors and other experts , conducted inspections , interviewed witnesses and examined documents . On DATE it presented an interim report proposing , with a view to establishing properly the circumstances of the accident , that an experiment with a dummy being thrown from a helicopter at different speeds be carried out and that the helicopter 's manufacturer be asked for additional technical information . However , it appears that none of these actions was taken .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the commission submitted its final report . It established that after Chief PERSON had instructed the crew to speed up ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the helicopter had increased its speed from CARDINAL to QUANTITY / h .

The commission recommended various measures for the prevention of similar accidents in the future , mostly concerning the training of paratroopers and flight preparation . It is unclear whether any of them were put into practice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the commission 's report was affirmed by the Minister of Defence , but not by the Minister of the ORG .

During DATE after CARDINAL DATE the investigator in charge of the case examined other witnesses , conducted inspections and collected documentary evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he appointed the members of the internal inquiry commission of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) as experts in the criminal proceedings , with the task of determining the cause of the CARDINAL paratroopers ' deaths .

On DATE the experts submitted their conclusions , specifying that the information they had been given was insufficient , there being no data on the exact parameters of the flight , and also that they were not experts in parachuting ; therefore , they were not able to draw up a formal expert report .", "CARDINAL . The experts considered that the helicopter 's speed at the time of Mr PERSON and PERSON jumps had been CARDINAL km / h . However , in their view , the speed was not related to the fatal accident , which had instead been caused by the QUANTITY paratroopers ' jumping technique ; this had not been in compliance with the respective instructions for performing parachute jumps .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the GPE military regional prosecutor 's office sent new letters to ORG requesting again that the experts appointed on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) draw up a formal report .", "CARDINAL .

On the basis of ground control data , ORG experts established that the helicopter 's speed at the time of Mr PERSON and PERSON jumps had been QUANTITY / h . The experts were of the opinion that Mr PERSON and PERSON had not committed any errors when jumping from the helicopter , but pointed out that they did not possess the expertise to assess whether the helicopter 's crew had committed any errors that might have led to the tragic accident .

On an appeal by the applicants , on DATE the ORG quashed the prosecutor 's decision . On DATE ORG affirmed the lower court 's findings . It held that the prosecutor had breached the procedural rules and that the conclusions of ORG experts , on which his decision had been based , could not serve as valid evidence in the case .", "CARDINAL . After the case was remitted to the prosecution , some of the witnesses were re - examined . On an unspecified date Chief PERSON , who had been in charge of the parachute jumps , explained that when he had instructed the helicopter crew to speed up he had meant a speed of QUANTITY / h , as was usual . He had become aware later , apparently from the conclusions of the internal inquiry , that the speed had been above QUANTITY / h . He considered that this , coupled with a possible minor side inclination of the helicopter , which would have shifted the position of the left rear tyre vis - \u00e0 - vis the paratroopers ' bodies , had been the reason for the accident with the applicants ' son and PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from the GPE military regional prosecutor 's office requested the Ministers of the Interior and Defence to nominate CARDINAL experts in aerodynamics , aviation , meteorology and parachuting to be appointed experts in the criminal proceedings and draw up a new expert report .

The experts submitted their report on DATE . They considered it scientifically impossible for Mr PERSON and PERSON to have hit the helicopter 's left rear tyre ; in their view those blows had been \u201c made up \u201d . The experts considered that the QUANTITY paratroopers had wrongly estimated the distance to the ground and had failed to open their parachutes in time ; this had led to their deaths . Furthermore , the paratroopers had failed to comply with the relevant instructions on the position of their bodies at the time of jumping . The speed and course of the helicopter had not been related to their death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from the GPE military regional prosecutor 's office once again discontinued the criminal proceedings . In his decision , he referred to the expert report of DATE and its conclusion that the applicants ' son and PERSON had not in fact hit the left rear tyre of the helicopter ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , he also mentioned the witness testimony indicating that these impacts had happened ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . He failed to examine the apparent controversy between those CARDINAL groups of evidence and to indicate which version he found plausible . He merely concluded , after describing the evidence collected in the case , that there was no appearance of a crime .", "CARDINAL . Upon appeal by the first applicant , on DATE the prosecutor 's decision was upheld by ORG . Examining the evidence collected in the case , that court dismissed the conclusion of the expert report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that Mr PERSON and PERSON had not hit the helicopter 's left rear tyre ; it considered that in this regard the testimony of the other participants in the flight was reliable . Nevertheless , the domestic court accepted the experts ' conclusion to the effect that PERSON PERSON and PERSON had not positioned themselves correctly when they jumped . It concluded that this had been the reason for their hitting the tyre and falling to the ground . Accordingly , it upheld the prosecution 's conclusion that no offence had been committed in the case .", "CARDINAL . Soon after their son 's death , the applicants sought the compensation provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW CARDINAL ( see paragraph DATE below ) . As they had not received that sum by DATE , they brought a claim . They sought the compensation provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , plus interest , as provided for in section CARDINAL ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . While the proceedings were pending , ORG paid up the compensation due , which was in the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) , the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) . Therefore , in a judgment of DATE the GPE ORG only awarded the applicants the interest accrued , in accordance with CARDINAL of LAW , which amounted to ORG , the equivalent of LAW . That judgment was not appealed against and entered into force .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants also sought indemnification from the company with which their son had been insured by ORG . They claimed a sum of MONEY , the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL . However , that indemnification was refused as they had failed to claim it within the statutory DATE time - limit from the date of their son 's death .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that Act , in force at the relevant time , provided that ORG would be liable to pay compensation in the amount of DATE salary , to each of the heirs ( spouse , children or parents ) of an army serviceman who had died during military service . By CARDINAL of the same LAW , the ORG was also liable to pay any interest accrued in the event of a delay of payment .", "CARDINAL . Where the heirs of an army serviceman who had died during military service sought a larger amount in damages , they could , by virtue of the provision of section ORG ) of LAW , bring an action before the civil courts .", "CARDINAL .
