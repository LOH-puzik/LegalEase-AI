In DATE , in his telephone conversations with the applicant , Mr ORG had repeatedly expressed his interest in the military exercises that were being conducted by ORG at that time , especially their particular features and any differences from previous exercises . The judgment further stated :", "\u201c On DATE , on an official invitation , [ the applicant ] , as a representative of the ORG newspaper , attended a meeting of ORG , where he learned that an appraisal of the results of the military exercises of ORG was scheduled for DATE .", "On DATE [ the applicant ] , with the intention of obtaining classified information on the said exercises and subsequently transferring it to [ Mr ORG ] , arrived at the headquarters of ORG . Although he was not included in the list of persons authorised to participate in the appraisal of the tactical training exercises , the applicant attended the meeting and collected information disclosing the actual names of highly critical and secured military formations and units , including military - intelligence units , that had taken part in the exercises and information disclosing the means and methods of protection of classified data by radio electronic warfare units that had participated in the exercises . Under section CARDINAL paragraphs CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) of DATE , as amended by ORG no .

The court based its findings on statements by a number of witnesses , CARDINAL recordings of the applicant 's telephone conversations with Mr ORG made by the ORG in DATE , and the expert report of DATE , insofar as it stated that the applicant 's handwritten notes contained information classified as secret . In particular , the court noted with regard to the expert report of DATE :", "\u201c ... The experts concluded that [ the applicant 's ] notes contained , in summary fashion , information on the composition of the groups of the naval forces which had taken part in the exercises , [ such information ] disclosing the actual names of highly critical and secured military formations and units , including military intelligence units , which constituted a ORG secret under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of GPE ( no .

DATE of the President of GPE of DATE .", "Also , the experts concluded that [ the applicant 's handwritten notes ] in summary fashion ... disclosed information on the activities of radio electronic warfare units , and notably on means and methods of protection of classified data , which constituted a ORG secret under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of GPE , no .

The applicant confirmed that he had attended the meeting of DATE and made summary notes of speeches and reports of its participants , but pleaded not guilty and argued that he had lawfully attended the said meeting , since he had the right to receive and impart information as a journalist . The applicant insisted that he had had no intention of transferring this information to Mr ORG and had kept it in order to enrich his own knowledge on the latest developments in the ORG and to inform his subordinates thereof , and to report on the results of the military exercises in the ORG newspaper . The applicant stated that all his activities had fully complied with NORP legislation .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's argument that he had the right to freedom of expression , and was therefore entitled to attend the meeting of DATE , the court noted that the right to information was not absolute and could be limited by law for the protection of national security . Under national law , military personnel 's right to information was limited in the interests of military service and , in particular , such personnel had an obligation not to disclose state or military secrets . As a serving officer , the applicant was bound by the legal provisions regulating the way in which servicemen accessed , collected , kept , imparted and published information classified as secret , and the way they communicated with foreign nationals .", "CARDINAL . The court also rejected the applicant 's argument that he had made the impugned notes with a view to their publication in PERSON . In this respect the court noted that the applicant had been fully aware of the relevant regulations which prohibited publication of information disclosing the actual names of military formations and units , and there had therefore been no practical use for such information in the applicant 's publications .", "CARDINAL . The court further examined the conclusions of the expert report of DATE in respect of the other items of information imputed to the applicant , compared them with the other materials of the case and rejected them as unreliable . In particular , the court stated that some of the pieces of information imputed to the applicant , including the list of accidents on NORP nuclear submarines and the map of the territory of military unit no . DATE , could be found in public sources , such as a military reference book on submarines , or a ORG report . In this respect the court noted that receiving , keeping and disseminating publicly accessible information was not punishable under the NORP legislation in force and that there was no practical need to classify information which could be found in public sources .", "CARDINAL . The court thus acquitted the applicant of all the other charges listed in the indictment , some of them having been waived by the prosecuting party .", "CARDINAL . In view of the fact that the applicant had a minor child , no criminal record and positive professional references and decorations , and given that his offence had caused no damage , since he had not transferred the impugned information , the court referred to the \u201c special - circumstances \u201d clause of LAW of LAW and sentenced the applicant to a term below the statutory minimum , namely , DATE imprisonment in a strict - security correctional colony , and deprivation of a military rank .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal submissions the defence complained , inter alia , that the experts who had drafted the report of DATE had relied on unpublished Decree no . CARDINAL of ORG in asserting the classified nature of the impugned information . The defence argued that the use of Decree no . CARDINAL by the experts had resulted in the incorrect application of LAW by the first - instance court . They further argued that LAW had been applied retrospectively , since there had been no list of information constituting ORG secrets at the time of the commission of the offence in question . The defence also contended that , in any event , the information contained in the applicant 's notes had been accessible from public sources .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant 's conviction on appeal , having excluded a reference to the unlawfulness of his presence at the meeting of DATE and to the general unlawfulness of his off - duty contacts with foreign nationals .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the question whether the applicant 's handwritten notes had contained ORG secrets had been thoroughly and objectively examined in the first - instance judgment . It confirmed that the trial court had based its judgment on the expert report of DATE , which had stated that \u201c information disclosing the actual names of highly critical and secured military formations and units and information on the presence among the participants in the military exercises of the military intelligence units and information on the means and methods of protection of classified data [ constituted ] ORG secrets under LAW , paragraphs CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of GPE ( no . DATE ) of DATE , as amended by ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG classified as ORG , approved by Decree of the President of ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , and paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of ... Decree of ORG no . CARDINAL \u201d . The appellate court further noted that , when assessing the expert report of DATE , the trial court had rejected a number of its conclusions in which the experts had groundlessly stated that some of the impugned items of information had contained ORG secrets . ORG thus concluded that the first - instance court had critically assessed the expert report of DATE and had only relied on those conclusions which had been objectively confirmed during the trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG also upheld the first - instance finding that the applicant 's intent to transfer the impugned information to Mr ORG had been proved by the recordings of his telephone conversations with the latter . The court further rejected the applicant 's argument that the information in his handwritten notes could have been found in public sources . In that connection it stated DATE with reference to the trial court 's finding \u2013 that \u201c no data concerning the actual names of highly critical and secured military units , ships and formations , and , in particular , military intelligence units , the means and methods of radio electronic warfare , as contained in [ the applicant 's ] handwritten notes , [ was ] openly published \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court also rejected the applicant 's argument that Decree no . CARDINAL had been unlawfully applied in his case , holding that this decree had been operative on the date that the applicant had committed his offence and was still in force .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as regards the applicant 's argument that the law had been applied retrospectively in his case , ORG noted :", "\u201c According to the decision of ORG DATE , ... the requirements of LAW of GPE are implemented in LAW of GPE of DATE , which defines the notion of ORG secrets and lists the information classifiable as ORG secrets . Later , on DATE , the List of Information classified as ORG secrets was enacted by Decree no . DATE of the President of GPE .", "Since collecting and keeping secret information for its transfer to a foreign citizen , committed by [ the applicant ] , [ was ] a continuing criminal offence which was brought to an end on DATE , the [ first - instance ] court rightly applied the aforementioned legal instrument as well as LAW , as amended on DATE , in the examination of his case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant unsuccessfully applied for supervisory review of his conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released on parole .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ( High Treason ) of LAW , in force as of DATE , provides that high treason , that is , espionage , disclosure of ORG secrets , or assistance otherwise provided to a foreign state , a foreign organisation , or their representatives , by way of hostile activities undermining the external security of GPE , committed by a NORP citizen , shall be punishable by DATE imprisonment and confiscation of property .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that everyone has the right to freely search , obtain , impart , generate and disseminate information by all lawful means and that a list of information constituting ORG secrets is to be defined by a federal statute .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , CARDINAL and DATE ORG , noting that the absence of the list of classified information \u201c deprived the law - enforcement agencies of a legal basis for the performance of their duty to protect the security of the ORG , community and individuals \u201d , repeatedly petitioned the ORG to prepare for the President 's approval a draft decree containing the list of classified information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President approved Decree no . CARDINAL on the List of Information classified as ORG .
