CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev;Stelios Nathanael", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , are NORP nationals of NORP - NORP origin , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE , in the northern part of GPE which in DATE was proclaimed as GPE \u201d ( the \u201c GPE \u201d ) . They were represented before the ORG by Mr A. ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "and as derived from the documents in the file , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , before the parliamentary elections of GPE to be held on DATE , the applicants submitted CARDINAL applications on behalf of other NORP and themselves to the Minister of the Interior of GPE ( \u201c the Minister \u201d ) requesting to be placed on a separate electoral list , namely , a NORP electoral list , in order to vote and stand for the parliamentary elections . The applicants claimed that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the PERSON on the Exercise of the Right to Vote and be Elected by Members of the NORP community with ORG in GPE ) ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) was contrary to LAW and the Convention .", "Their applications were refused by the Minister on DATE . In his decision the Minister stated that the above - mentioned PERSON had been enacted in compliance with the ORG \u2019s ruling in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( no . MONEY , ECHR CARDINALV ) in order to enable NORP residing in the government - controlled areas of the Republic to exercise their individual right to vote and stand for election . It did not provide , however , for the exercise of these rights as a community . Due to the irregular situation , the relevant LAW provisions concerning separate elections had become impossible to implement in practice . The LAW applied as long as the irregular situation in GPE continued to exist . It was therefore of a temporary nature and did not deprive the NORP community of their constitutional rights . Until a comprehensive settlement was reached , however , the exercise of these rights in the manner provided by the LAW was not possible .", "On DATE the applicants filed an application , in the NORP language , at ORG for a declaration that the Minister \u2019s decision was null and void . The applicants relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW as they were before the amendment whereby the number of seats in ORG was increased ( see domestic law part below ) . The document did not comply with any of the procedures concerning the drafting of special proceedings whereby the various competences of ORG are evoked . The officers of the Registrar , taking into account the fact that the applicants were seeking the annulment of the Minister \u2019s decision in order to enable them to exercise their right to vote and to stand for election , filed the case under the category of electoral applications and submitted it to the Plenary of ORG which has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate finally on any election petition , made under the provisions of LAW ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW ) .", "ORG , after considering the application , decided that in substance it constituted a recourse under LAW by which the applicants challenged the LOC decision dismissing their application .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a full bench , dismissed the recourse .", "In its judgment ORG noted , firstly that the applicants wished to be registered as voters in a separate electoral list , namely that of the NORP - NORP citizens of GPE . It followed therefore that they also sought the right to be elected by the NORP - NORP voters , who were on a separate list , in order to take a parliamentary seat from the separate number of seats that the LAW allocated to the NORP community . As such the applicants\u2019 demand touched upon the very continuation of the existence of GPE which constituted the internationally - recognised legal state established in DATE . ORG noted that after the withdrawal of the NORP community from the ORG organs in DATE following a decision of its leadership , the relevant Articles of the LAW providing for separate elections by the CARDINAL communities had become impossible to implement in practice . From CARDINAL/CARDINAL the ORG based its legal existence and its continuing functioning on the Law of Necessity , as laid out in the case of The Attorney - General of the Republic v. PERSON and others , ( DATE ) C.L.R. CARDINAL ) . ORG stated that this fundamental legal decision stood side by side with the LAW which contained the consummate rule of law governing the continuing existence and functioning of the ORG as a legal and democratic entity and referred in detail to the situation and the reasons which led unavoidably to the adoption and prevalence of the Law of Necessity . ORG pointed out that these reasons became even more pressing after the NORP invasion in GPE in DATE and the occupation of northern GPE by NORP troops . At present only a small number of NORP Cypriots lived in the occupied part of GPE and very few NORP lived in the territory controlled by GPE .", "ORG stated that the above realities were confirmed in a series of judgments by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) in which , inter alia , the international recognition of GPE as the legitimate and lawful ORG was considered an indisputable fact , while at the same time the regime which existed in the northern part of GPE , where GPE exercised effective control , was held to be illegal . In this connection , ORG referred to the ORG \u2019s findings in the case of GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIV ) , PERSON v. GPE ( ( preliminary objections ) , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , DATE ) and PERSON ( cited above ) . With regard to the latter case , ORG pointed out that the ORG had found a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL in that although the relevant constitutional provisions had been rendered ineffective there had been a manifest lack of legislation resolving the ensuing problems ; namely that members of the NORP - Cypriot community , living in the government - controlled area of GPE , had been completely deprived of any opportunity to express their opinion in the choice of the members of ORG of the country of which they were nationals and where they had always lived . Following this judgment , PERSON CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL was enacted enabling NORP nationals who belong to the NORP - Cypriot community and had their habitual residence in the government - controlled areas of GPE to vote and to stand for election . ORG noted , however , that the applicants had and still had their permanent residence in the northern part of GPE , which was occupied by and under the control of NORP troops . They could not therefore claim a right to vote or to stand for election on the basis of the ORG \u2019s ruling in the PERSON case and LAW .", "LAW safeguards the right to vote . It provides as follows :", "\u201c Every citizen has , subject to the provisions of this LAW and any electoral law of the Republic or of the relevant ORG made thereunder , the right to vote in any election held under this LAW or any such law . \u201d", "Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the NORP Constitution concern the composition of ORG and the right to be registered in the electoral lists for parliamentary elections . They provide as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The number of representatives shall be CARDINAL :", "Provided that such number may be altered by a resolution of ORG carried by a majority comprising CARDINAL of the Representatives elected by ORG and CARDINAL of the representatives elected by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP Out of the number of Representatives provided in paragraph CARDINAL of this Article CARDINAL per centum shall be elected by ORG and CARDINAL per centum by ORG separately from amongst their members respectively , and in the case of a contested election , by universal suffrage and by direct and secret ballot held on DATE . ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Subject to paragraph CARDINAL of this Article every citizen of the Republic who has attained DATE and has such residential qualifications as may be prescribed by the Electoral Law shall have the right to be registered as an elector in either the NORP or the NORP electoral list :", "Provided that the members of ORG shall only be registered in the NORP electoral list and the members of ORG shall only be registered in the NORP electoral list .", "CARDINAL . No person shall be qualified to be registered as an elector who is disqualified for such registration by virtue of LAW . \u201d", "LAW sets out the eligibility requirements to stand for election to ORG . It provides as follows :", "\u201c A person shall be qualified to be a candidate for election as a Representative if at the time of the election that person-", "( a ) is a citizen of the Republic ;", "( b ) has attained the age of DATE ;", "( c ) has not been , on or after the date of the coming into operation of this LAW , convicted of an offence involving dishonesty or moral turpitude or is not under any disqualification imposed by a competent court for any electoral offence ;", "( d ) is not suffering from a mental disease incapacitating such person from acting as a Representative . \u201d", "Following the withdrawal of the NORP community from the ORG organs in DATE , a number of Constitutional provisions , including the ORG providing for the parliamentary representation of the NORP community and the quotas to be adhered to by the QUANTITY communities , became impossible to implement in practice .", "In DATE , by decision of ORG , the number of seats in ORG was increased from CARDINAL ; CARDINAL seats were allotted to representatives to be elected by the NORP community and CARDINAL seats to representatives to be elected by the NORP community . The CARDINAL seats remain vacant .", "According to LAW on the Election of Members of ORG ( Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL , as amended ) , the right to elect belongs to those who have the qualifications provided for under LAW . The residential requirement is that of habitual residence in GPE for a period of DATE immediately before the date fixed by the Minister , by publication in ORG , as the date of acquisition of the electoral qualifications . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the same PERSON provides that a candidate for parliamentary elections should have the qualifications set out in LAW .", "Following the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( cited above ) , LAW was enacted and entered into force on DATE . LAW applies to citizens of the Republic who are members of the NORP community and had , at the time of entry into force of the PERSON or subsequently , their habitual residence in the free areas of the Republic ( section CARDINAL ) and enables them to exercise their right to vote in presidential elections and their right to vote and to be elected in parliamentary , municipal and community elections . As regards parliamentary elections , this relates to the filling of the CARDINAL seats allotted to the NORP community . Section CARDINAL provides that NORP nationals of NORP origin are to be registered on a supplementary electoral list which is then incorporated into the main electoral list in accordance with LAW ( PERSON CARDINAL(I ) DATE , as amended ) . Further , in respect of the right to vote , the requirement is that of habitual residence for a term of DATE immediately before the date of acquisition of the electoral qualifications ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Law CARDINAL(I)/CARDINAL does not apply to citizens of the Republic who are members of the NORP community and reside in the free areas occasionally , from time to time or temporarily ( section QUANTITY ) .", "According to section CARDINAL the provisions of ORG are also applicable to members of the NORP community who come within the scope of ORG ( I)/CARDINAL as amended ) ; the PERSON on the Election of Members of ORG ( Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL as amended ) ; LAW ( Law CARDINAL of DATE as amended ) ; LAW ( Law CARDINAL(I ) of DATE as amended ) and the Election ( President and Vice President of GPE of DATE as amended ) ] .", "Following the entry into force of LAW , members of the NORP community with their habitual residence in the government - controlled areas , were able to participate in the parliamentary elections of QUANTITY DATE .
