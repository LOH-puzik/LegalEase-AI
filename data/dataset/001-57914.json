In the event of his death , the sum insured was to be paid to PERSON and ORG . The turning - point came TIME when PERSON , a police officer , was the first to crack . He admitted that he had organised the murder and had lent a gun to have the MP killed . He also hired the contract killer , PERSON , who was promised MONEY and who in turn found CARDINAL people to accompany him . The reasons for their downfall were , first , that PERSON \u2019s name appeared in PERSON diary and , second , that they killed him in front of no . CARDINAL ORG . That was not planned . The intention had apparently been to take him somewhere else , but PERSON perhaps refused to follow his killer . At all events , that was their first mistake . PERSON and GPE apparently then refused to pay them . That led to the secret meetings in bars , the shadowing by the police and informers - we know the rest of the story - and their arrest . The second mistake was made by PERSON . Before contacting PERSON he approached another contract killer , who turned down the job but apparently talked to other people about it . To catch the killers , the police realistically based their investigation on CARDINAL simple ideas . Firstly , the murder was committed in FAC as PERSON was leaving ORG home . There was necessarily a link between the killer and ORG . Secondly , ORG past did not count in his favour and the police regarded him as a rather dubious legal adviser .
