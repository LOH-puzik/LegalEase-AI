SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , presently resides in GPE , GPE . In his application form , he states that he has NORP nationality .", "a.", "", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE . He requested asylum DATE . He had a NORP passport but stated that he considered himself to be a citizen of GPE and not of GPE . He claimed further that he had been a soldier in the NORP army from which he had deserted .", "On DATE ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request and ordered his deportation to GPE . ORG found that the applicant held both NORP and NORP citizenship . Noting that the prevailing situation in GPE rendered a deportation to that country impossible , the ORG examined the applicant \u2019s situation with respect to GPE . ORG found that he did not risk to be sent from GPE to GPE or to be punished for desertion in GPE .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . On DATE ORG granted the applicant a temporary residence permit until DATE and quashed the deportation order . In so doing , the ORG referred to a Government decision of CARDINAL DATE according to which the worsened situation in GPE constituted an impediment to the deportation of asylum seekers to that country .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a new application for a residence permit . He referred to his previous statements and added that he is an ethnic NORP from GPE in GPE . Further , he had been informed by his parents in GPE that he had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for desertion . He was convinced that , if returned to that country , he would have to serve the sentence and also risk harassment as the majority of the population in his home district were now NORP . The applicant referred also to the time he had spent in GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s new application and ordered his deportation to GPE . ORG had regard to a guiding decision taken by ORG on DATE . In that decision the ORG stated , inter alia , the following :", "( Translation )", "\u201c As regards the situation in GPE and the region , the ongoing peace process , based on a general agreement on peace in GPE , has lead to stabilisation . The relations between GPE and GPE have improved . GPE has been admitted into ORG . Acts of warfare have not occurred on NORP territory since DATE . The risk of further conflicts appears unlikely . The general situation in GPE has improved in such a way since the Government \u2019s previous assessment in DATE that nowadays NORP citizens can generally be afforded protection in GPE . \u201d", "As in its previous decision concerning the applicant , the ORG found that he could not be sent back to GPE . ORG considered , however , that the applicant \u2019s submissions did not show that he was unable to go to GPE .", "Following the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG , on DATE , quashed ORG decision and referred the case back for re - examination . ORG found that no oral hearing had been held by ORG , as required by law .", "ORG later held an oral hearing at which the applicant stated that , being a NORP , he would be persecuted by NORP in GPE . He maintained further that he had obtained his NORP passport illegally and that he could not be considered as a citizen of that country . He had no relatives or friends in GPE and could not see any reasons why GPE should admit him . Allegedly , during his stay in GPE he had adjusted to NORP society .", "In a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s new application and ordered that he be deported to either GPE or GPE . ORG referred to ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE in which the following conclusions were drawn as regards the situation in GPE :", "( Translation )", "\u201c Recently , the situation in GPE has improved . After the parties signed a general agreement on peace in GPE there is an ongoing peace process in the country . It has been strengthened by the establishment of Government institutions and the general elections held in DATE . There are still actual restrictions on the movement of people within the territory of the ORG . The possibility to return to the home district without risking harassment and outrage is , in the present circumstances , dependent on the prevailing ethnic composition of the population in the district . In the ORG \u2019s view , it is now possible to return to the home district where one \u2019s own ethnic group is in the majority . This view corresponds to the position taken by the ORG in regard to the return of people to GPE . The relative stability enjoyed by \u201c the majority population \u201d in the respective regions leads to the conclusion that asylum seekers from such places in GPE can no longer be considered as generally being in need of protection . \u201d", "ORG noted that , according to information from the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) , the majority of the population in GPE were NORP . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s fear of persecution was considered to be exaggerated . ORG considered also that the amnesty laws enacted in GPE would be applicable to the applicant .", "As regards the possible deportation of the applicant to GPE , ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s NORP passport was genuine and noted that the applicant had previously stated that this was the case . According to ORG , there was thus no reason to assume that GPE would not afford him protection . In this respect , the ORG again referred to information available from ORG and the ORG . This view had been confirmed also by ORG . Finally , the ORG found that there were no reasons of a humanitarian nature to grant the applicant a residence permit .", "On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision .", "On DATE the applicant submitted yet another application for a residence permit to ORG . He referred to his long stay in GPE and to the fact that he had already had a temporary residence permit . Furthermore , he claimed that , while serving in the NORP army , he had seen how his neighbour and a work - mate had been killed . His experiences during the war , a difficult childhood and his fears of persecution and punishment for desertion in GPE had impaired his mental health and rendered the deportation to that country impossible . He could not be deported to GPE either , as he had no connections to GPE and as the situation for NORP in GPE had worsened as of late . He invoked a medical certificate issued on DATE by chief physician E.A. and psychologist PERSON at the psychiatric clinic at the hospital in GPE , according to which the applicant suffered from insomnia , anxiety and flashbacks from the war .", "By a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s latest application .", "In a further medical certificate issued at the above - mentioned psychiatric clinic on DATE physician ORG stated that the applicant , as from DATE , received treatment at the clinic for a post - traumatic stress syndrome . ORG found that there was a considerable risk that the applicant would attempt to commit suicide . The applicant states that he has since left the clinic but that he continues to visit his psychiatrist on a regular basis .", "Relevant domestic law", "Under LAW of LAW ( Lagen om psykiatrisk tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd , DATE ) , such care shall be terminated at the request of the competent police authority whenever the person placed in care is ordered to be deported . This presupposes , however , that the chief physician finds that the alien \u2019s condition allows that the deportation takes place . According to LAW , no appeal lies against the chief physician \u2019s decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
