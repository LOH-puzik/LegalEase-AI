AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 10;Not necessary to examine Art. 14+10;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , a limited liability company with its seat in GPE , is the owner and publisher of the magazine News .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a series of letter bombs was sent to politicians and other persons in the public eye in GPE . Some of the addressees were severely injured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE B. , a right - wing extremist , was arrested on suspicion of having been involved in the so - called letter - bomb campaign . He was taken into detention on remand . Preliminary investigations were instituted against him on suspicion of attempted murder and of having committed offences under LAW ( GPE \u2013 \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . He was later charged with offences under LAW and with having aided and abetted assault .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant company published a special issue and later an article in CARDINAL of the regular issues of its magazine News , dealing with the letter - bomb campaign , the activities of the extreme right and , in particular , the suspect PERSON The respective reports were illustrated with several pictures of B. The cover page of the special issue for instance showed a small picture of PERSON , subtitled in big letters \u201c The Mad World of Perpetrators \u201d . Under the headline \u201c Terror for the NORP \u201d a full - page picture showed PERSON together with CARDINAL other persons . According to the comments , this picture was taken in a courtroom , where PERSON stood up in protest when the verdict was pronounced against his \u201c ORG , the neo - NORP leader GPE Furthermore , it was stated that , when GPE was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , his companions , including PERSON , swore vengeance . According to another comment on the same page , these companions who had been supposed to be harmless lunatics were now arrested as bomb terrorists . The cover page of the second issue carried the headline \u201c Victims and NORP \u201d and showed a large picture of CARDINAL of the victims and a smaller picture of PERSON and CARDINAL others . The victim was quoted as saying : \u201c I want to meet the perpetrators . \u201d At the bottom of the page the words \u201c NORP scene uncovered \u201d appeared . In the article , a further picture of PERSON and another suspect , NORP , was shown . According to the comment , it had been taken on the occasion of the trial of the neo - NORP leader PERSON The comment went on to state that NORP and PERSON , who had both wished to succeed GPE , were now suspected of having dispatched the bombs . Moreover , a wedding picture of PERSON was published . The comment accompanying it stated that , according to the investigations of the police , PERSON and NORP had probably collaborated in order to organise the letter - bomb campaign . In the article itself , PERSON was described as pathologically ambitious , one of the most brutal members of the neo - NORP scene and the possible successor to the neo - NORP leader PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE B. brought proceedings under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Urheberrechtsgesetz ) against the applicant company , requesting that the latter be prohibited from publishing his picture in connection with reports on any criminal proceedings against him . He also requested a preliminary injunction ( einstweilige GPE ) to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) dismissed PERSON 's application for a preliminary injunction .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that section CARDINAL of LAW prohibited publishing a person 's picture if the publication violated that person 's legitimate interests . However , where criminal proceedings were conducted against the person concerned , that interest had to be weighed against the public interest in receiving information . As the present case related to very serious offences based on anti - democratic , subversive ideology , the publication of a suspect 's picture was justified in principle . Further , the court found that it did not have to examine whether the accompanying comment violated PERSON 's right to respect for his private life as he had failed to indicate which passages of the articles at issue might go beyond the limits of acceptable reporting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , upon PERSON 's appeal , issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the applicant company from publishing PERSON 's picture in connection with reports on the criminal proceedings against him on suspicion of having committed offences under LAW and of having aided and abetted assault through letter - bomb attacks .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that section CARDINAL of LAW was directed against the abuse of pictures in public . Section CARDINAL sought above all to prevent a person from being disparaged by the publication of a picture , or his private life being made public or his picture being used in a way giving rise to misinterpretation , or in a disparaging and degrading manner . Further , the court observed that section CARDINAL of LAW did not define the term \u201c legitimate interests \u201d , thus conferring discretion on the courts in order to enable them to take the particular circumstances of each case into account . It also required the courts to weigh the interest of the person concerned in the protection of his or her picture against the publisher 's interest in conveying information .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to say that , in assessing whether a person 's legitimate interests within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW had been violated , not only the picture itself , but also the accompanying text had to be taken into account . Also , a person suspected of having committed an offence had a legitimate interest in not being denounced in public by the publication of a picture in connection with a disparaging text . In the present case , the contested publication constituted not only a gross insult , but also a serious violation of the presumption of innocence . Quoting some headlines and comments from the articles at issue , ORG noted that the applicant company had called B. a \u201c perpetrator \u201d of the letter - bomb attacks , a \u201c NORP \u201d , a \u201c terrorist for the ' PERSON ' \u201d and a companion of the neo - NORP GPE who had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment . These gross violations of PERSON 's legitimate interests justified a prohibition on the publication of his picture in the context of the criminal proceedings which were at the time conducted against him .", "CARDINAL . Despite this line of reasoning , the judgment had the effect of prohibiting the publication of PERSON 's picture not only in connection with a text that was prejudicial but DATE even more restrictively \u2013 in connection with reports on the criminal proceedings against him irrespective of the accompanying text .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Oberster Gerichtshof ) rejected both parties ' extraordinary appeals on points of law ( au\u00dferordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) , finding that they did not raise any important legal issues . As to the applicant company 's appeal , it found that section ORG of LAW ( Mediengesetz ) , to which the applicant company had referred in its submissions , did not lead to the result that a suspect 's legitimate interests could not be violated by the publication of his picture . There was thus no contradiction with section CARDINAL of LAW . Further , there were no clear indications in the present case that the public interest justified the publishing of B. 's picture . Thus , the appellate court 's decision was not based on a gross misinterpretation of the law .", "CARDINAL . Supplementing his application of DATE , PERSON had in the meantime filed an alternative claim ( PERSON ) , requesting that the applicant company be ordered to refrain from publishing his picture in connection with such statements as had been made in the articles at issue and which he listed in detail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the main proceedings , granted PERSON 's alternative claim , ordering the applicant company to refrain from publishing PERSON 's picture where the publication was likely to violate PERSON 's legitimate interests , namely in connection with statements in which PERSON was referred to as the perpetrator of the letter - bomb attacks or as being involved in terror or letter - bomb attacks , or in connection with such statements \u2013 listed in detail \u2013 as had been made in the articles at issue .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the publication of PERSON 's picture together with the accompanying text constituted not only a gross insult , but also a serious violation of the presumption of innocence . These gross violations of PERSON 's legitimate interests justified a prohibition on publishing his picture in the context of the criminal proceedings against him , but only if he was referred to as the perpetrator of the offences or if otherwise the rules of objective reporting were violated . Having regard to the seriousness of the charges brought against PERSON and the notoriety of the victims , the public interest in PERSON 's appearance outweighed his interest in not having his picture published as long as such reports did not overstep the boundaries of objective journalism . Further , the court emphasised that it did not intend to sanction reporting ( PERSON ) as such . It repeated that , when assessing a person 's claim under section CARDINAL of LAW , the text accompanying the pictures was of importance . It made a difference whether a person , along with the publication of his picture , was stigmatised as the perpetrator of a crime or whether an objective report on the criminal proceedings against him was given .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company 's appeal but granted PERSON 's appeal . It ordered the applicant company to refrain from publishing PERSON 's picture in connection with reports on the criminal proceedings against him on suspicion of having committed offences under LAW and of having aided and abetted assault through letter - bomb attacks .", "CARDINAL . The court recalled the reasons given in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs DATE above ) concluding once again that the publication of B. 's picture in the context of the accompanying comments had constituted a gross violation of his legitimate interests , which justified a prohibition on publishing his picture in the context of the criminal proceedings against him . It added that the onus was not upon B. to specify the statements which the applicant company had to refrain from publishing in connection with the pictures since , in general , new accusations were published in the course of the proceedings , and there was no interest in repeating the previous ones . Thus , ORG judgment was worded too narrowly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company 's extraordinary appeal on points of law . It found that the applicant company undoubtedly had a right to impart information about the proceedings conducted against B. However , the right to impart information had to be distinguished from the right to publish pictures of B. , which had to be balanced against PERSON 's interest in the protection of his picture . Even the publication of a picture accompanied by a correct statement of facts , which violated neither section ORG nor section CARDINALb of LAW , could infringe the legitimate interests of the person concerned . Finally , ORG , referring to LAW , found that the applicant company 's right to freedom of expression had not been violated , since it had not been prohibited from reporting on the proceedings , but only from publishing PERSON 's picture in that context .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a first - instance court acquitted PERSON of the charges of assault but convicted him of offences under LAW . The criminal proceedings against B. received extensive news coverage . Contrary to the applicant company , other newspapers remained free to publish PERSON 's picture .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in proceedings brought by LAW under section CARDINALb of LAW , found that the applicant company had violated the presumption of innocence and ordered it to pay MONEY by way of compensation to B. The court found that in its articles of DATE the applicant company had referred to B. as the perpetrator of the \u201c letter - bomb terror \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provision of LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly , nor disseminated in any other way in which they are made accessible to the public , where the legitimate interests of the person in question or , in the event that they have died without having authorised or ordered publication , of a close relative would be injured .", "... \u201d", "This provision has been interpreted in ORG case - law . In particular ORG found that in determining whether the publication of a person 's picture violated his or her \u201c legitimate interests \u201d regard was to be had to the accompanying text . Where the publisher of the picture claimed that there was a public interest in its publication , the courts had to carry out a weighing of the respective interests involved . As regards reporting on criminal cases , ORG constantly held that there was no predominating public interest in the publication of the suspect 's picture if it had no additional independent information value . The only effect was that the intensity of such reporting was increased by joining the suspect 's picture and , thus , made his or her appearance known to the public at large ( see for instance , PERSON , p. CARDINAL ; ORG , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , p. CARDINAL ; ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
