HIV is transmitted through specific behaviours which are almost always private . Prevention thus requires voluntary acts and can not be imposed . Restrictive measures can in fact run counter to public health interests , since exclusion of HIV - infected non - nationals adds to the climate of stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV and Aids , and may thus deter nationals and non - nationals alike from coming forward to utilise HIV prevention and care services .
