In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG unanimously upheld the judgment of DATE , finding", "( i ) that the applicant \u2019s request for a public hearing should be refused on the ground that it was not the task of ORG to review the establishment of the facts .

In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG found as follows :", "\u201c Whether or not a public hearing should be held at an individual \u2019s request in connection with a special administrative action to set aside an administrative act depends on the extent of ORG powers of review as regards the establishment of the facts . It is clear that a hearing devoted to the production of evidence and discussion of the facts would be useful and meaningful only if ORG had unlimited jurisdiction to review all the facts established by the impugned decision . If that were the case ORG would form its own opinion regarding the evidence and would examine new evidence , going well beyond a review of lawfulness .", "However , as is clear from the uniform case - law of ORG , this option is not available in the light of ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the Judiciary , sitting in plenary , after grouping together the penalties imposed on the applicant ( c\u00famulo jur\u00eddico das penas disciplinares aplicadas ) in the CARDINAL sets of disciplinary proceedings referred to above , unanimously imposed a single penalty of CARDINAL days\u2019 suspension from duty .", "CARDINAL .
