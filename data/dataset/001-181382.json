On DATE the applicant submitted a written notice to the mayor of GPE informing him that the LOC civic youth association ( \u201c the Association \u201d ) registered in GPE , of which he was chairman , intended to hold a picket ( \u043f\u0456\u043a\u0435\u0442 ) outside ORG ( \u201c the regional authority \u201d ) building . The notice read as follows :", "\u201c We inform you that , starting from DATE our organisation will hold a picket [ in front ] of the [ regional authority ] for an indefinite term in view of the unhealthy , in our view , social and economic state of affairs in the region .", "Beginning of the picket : DATE at TIME .", "Place : square in front of the [ regional authority ] building ;", "Responsible person according to the decision of the ORG \u2019s management : ORG [ the applicant ] .", "Chairman of the [ Association ] Chumak , PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the ORG \u2019s officially registered chairman at the material time was a certain PERSON . The applicant was neither the chairman , nor could he even be a member of the Association because according to the ORG \u2019s charter , membership was open to persons DATE . At the time of the relevant events the applicant was older .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mayor \u2019s office forwarded the applicant \u2019s notice to the police , requesting that they maintain public order during the demonstration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG started the picket as intended . According to the applicant , several other local groups joined the action and CARDINAL small camping tents ( measuring CARDINAL by QUANTITY ) were erected by the walls of the regional authority building on a QUANTITY wide street for storing handout materials and displaying the NORP slogans .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the executive committee of ORG instituted administrative proceedings seeking \u201c to enjoin the [ Association ] not to organise and carry out pickets on the streets and squares of GPE and to oblige it to uninstall the unlawfully erected \u2018 small architectural structures\u2019 ( \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0456 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0456\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0456 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438 ) . \u201d The plaintiff alleged that the protesters had been breaching the peace and public order by offending passers - by , acting arrogantly towards them , obstructing the traffic and pedestrians and endangering the lives and health of local residents . Referring to LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which provided for the lodging of an action before the start of a picket , the plaintiff asked the court to admit its action for consideration out - of - time on the grounds that only after the picket had started had it become apparent that the protesters intended to engage in inappropriate conduct . The statement of claim was supplemented with applications by GPE . and GPE , CARDINAL passers - by , addressed to the police , in which they complained that the protesters had \u201c acted arrogantly \u201d , had offended their feelings and had erected tents obstructing pedestrians and spoiling the street aesthetics .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) held a hearing at which the applicant , representing the ORG , denied the allegations that the picketers had engaged in any inappropriate conduct . According to him , during the hearing he had unsuccessfully made several requests for the production of evidence . Notably , he had requested that GPE . , GPE and the police officers present at the site of the picket be summoned for questioning ; that the police authorities be asked whether any incidents of unlawful conduct by the picketers had been documented ; and that the site be inspected in order to determine whether , in fact , the camping tents mounted by the picketers had obstructed the traffic or the passage of pedestrians .", "CARDINAL . Later on the same date , ORG allowed the claim , having decided that the case file contained sufficient evidence that the protesters had behaved inappropriately . The relevant part of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ... [ the ] executive committee ... did not and could not have known about a possible breach of public order by the participants of the event , which fact resulted in missing the time - limit for lodging a court action as required by paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL of the Code of Administrative Justice of GPE ; the court therefore resets the procedural time - limit ...", "The court , when deciding the case , takes into account that the participants in the event installed small architectural edifices on the pavement . In addition , during the event , they acted arrogantly , thus offending other citizens , obstructed the passage of pedestrians along PERSON street , and endangered road users , a fact confirmed by the complaints from GPE and GPE .", "In addition , the court has regard to the fact that in the notice of the event it is stated that it will be held indefinitely . Also the number of protesters is not defined ... and it may gradually increase . Accordingly , at any time during the picket of indeterminate length , it can not be excluded that those taking part might repeatedly breach public order . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also noted that the picket \u201c may potentially encroach upon the rights and freedoms of other local residents \u201d and held as follows :", "\u201c [ the court holds ] to prohibit [ the ORG ] and other persons taking part in the action from organising and carrying out peaceful assemblies in the streets and squares of GPE , [ and ] from installing small architectural edifices in GPE ; ... oblige them to dismantle the small architectural edifices installed in the square in front of the [ Administration \u2019s ] building ...", "To allow immediate enforcement of the court ruling ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the protesters were dispersed by the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local registry office informed the applicant that GPE . and GPE were not registered as residents at the addresses indicated by them in their complaints lodged with the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the court judgment of DATE , which he signed as the ORG \u2019s chairman . He submitted that under LAW of the ORG , a plaintiff \u2019s action could not be examined when it had been lodged out of time . He further submitted that the court \u2019s factual conclusions had been devoid of an evidentiary basis . In particular , there was no evidence whatsoever that the protesters had breached the law , apart from the complaints by CARDINAL . and GPE , who had given false home addresses and thus could not be identified . The applicant further complained that the court had rejected his request that those individuals be located and summoned , and that the police officers present at the site of the picket also be summoned for questioning concerning the alleged breaches of the law by the protesters . He also regretted that the court had refused his requests that the relevant police reports documenting the purported breaches of the law ( if any ) be produced and an inspection of the picket site be carried out with a view to determining whether the tents erected by the activists could count as \u201c architectural structures \u201d and whether there had been any obstruction of traffic or pedestrians . Lastly , the applicant complained that the sanction imposed by ORG ( a total and permanent ban on the ORG organising peaceful assemblies in GPE ) had been arbitrary and disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s appeal and decided that , in view of namely , the short notice of the intention to hold a picket and the indefinite period during which the participants planned to continue their demonstration ) the administrative action lodged by the executive committee could be accepted for examination . It agreed with ORG findings of fact and noted , in particular , that by installing the tents , the protesters had breached section CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW . At the same time , ORG found that the sanction imposed on the protesters had been disproportionate . In particular , LAW generally allowed peaceful assemblies , which could therefore not be prohibited in a blanket manner . Nevertheless , it did not envisage a form of assembly such as the \u201c picketing \u201d of administrative buildings \u201c with the installation on the streets of small architectural structures \u201d . Accordingly , the court found that the term \u201c peaceful assemblies \u201d in the operative part of ORG judgment had to be substituted with the term \u201c pickets \u201d . The court then rejected the applicant \u2019s remaining arguments as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG GPE dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
