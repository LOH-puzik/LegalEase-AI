In her reply , addressed to PERSON , the applicant pointed out that Ms ORG had not taken part in the show as an interlocutor , but as one of the authors , together with CARDINAL other journalists . She went on to specify that Ms ORG \u2019s participation had altogether lasted CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . DATE the ORG management board met to consider \u201c technical discipline \u201d during the show on DATE . It found that by allowing PERSON to in effect host the show the applicant had breached the editorial board \u2019s resolution and the programme \u2019s DATE schedule . It further found that PERSON had taken part in the show in disregard of the board \u2019s resolution , that Mr E.I. , the show \u2019s editor , had also breached the board \u2019s resolution and the DATE schedule , and that the editorsinchief , Mr TIME , Mr PERSON and PERSON , had failed to exercise sufficient control over the preparation and the running of the show . The board resolved to impose disciplinary punishments on all them , to be determined in line with their varying degrees of fault . It entrusted the execution of its resolution to the ORG director general .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG director general , relying on Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , Article CARDINAL ) , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) , dismissed the applicant on disciplinary grounds . The reasons given were that she had allowed PERSON to host the show in her stead , thus breaching the technical rules on the operation of radio programmes , that she had breached the programme coordination rules , that she had disregarded the editorial board \u2019s resolution rejecting the proposal for PERSON to take part in the show , and that she had breached Rule QUANTITY of the \u201c PERSON \u201d programme and point CARDINAL of order no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE of the programme \u2019s director ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG director general also dismissed PERSON and Mr E.I. , giving similar reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the regular DATE meeting of the \u201c PERSON \u201d programme \u2019s editorial board , Mr TIME ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) tendered his resignation , citing , among other things , the lack of clear rules on who could and who could not host radio shows .", "CARDINAL . Those events sparked a vigorous reaction in the media community and prompted the publication of several articles deploring what the journalists saw as an unjustified interference with their colleagues\u2019 freedom of expression . In a declaration of CARDINAL DATE ORG protested against the dismissals of the applicant , PERSON and Mr E.I. , saying that they were an example of \u201c the appetite of forces alien to the journalist profession to gag it \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , the chief media regulatory body in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , discussed the above events at a meeting on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It observed that the dismissal orders did not cite any provisions of ORG DATE , and that there was therefore no scope for the ORG to assess whether the radio show had complied with those provisions . On the face of it , there existed a purely employment dispute , which could be examined only by a court . However , the ORG was competent to verify whether the dismissals were consistent with the DATE LAW and the freedom of expression which it guaranteed .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the main safeguard against encroachments on freedom of expression in the national electronic media was the existence of internal regulations and their proper implementation . The ORG noted that at CARDINAL of its previous meetings it had discussed draft regulations drawn up by the ORG management board , and had noted that they did not envisage any mechanism governing the workings of the ORG collective bodies and the LOC rights and obligations . The ORG \u2019s recommendation for those matters to be addressed had not been heeded . The lack of precise regulations was somewhat offset by the existence of rules governing the workings of individual BNR programmes . However , the rules of the \u201c PERSON \u201d programme did not say on which legal provision they were based and predated the BNR regulations on which they were supposed to be based . Those rules did not define clearly the competencies of the journalists in their various professional capacities as authors , hosts , editors , reporters and so on . Neither the BNR regulations nor the individual ORG rules dealt with the powers of collective bodies such as management and editorial boards . The applicant \u2019s and the CARDINAL other ORG dismissals showed that there existed confusion between administrative and professional bodies , which made it possible to have administrative interference in the content of radio shows . Rule CARDINAL of the \u201c PERSON \u201d programme ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , mentioned in the dismissal orders , was an example of that , because it said that changes in a show \u2019s content could be made solely by written order of the respective manager . The editorial board \u2019s resolution of CARDINAL DATE as to who could and who could not be an interlocutor in the show was also an example of that .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the ORG said that it did not accept the supplanting of the preordained rules for the operation of the ORG by administrative actions and sanctions . However , that did not mean that the ORG accepted the attempts of some journalists to place themselves above the established principles of work in the national media .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil claim against the ORG , seeking annulment of the order for her disciplinary dismissal , reinstatement and lost wages . She argued , among other things , that her dismissal in connection with the show on DATE and the statements which ORG had made during the show had been in breach of LAW , section CARDINAL of ORG CARDINAL ( see DATE and DATE below ) and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia District Court ( GPE \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) held hearings in the case on DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . It heard a number of witnesses , admitted in evidence various documents , and obtained several expert reports .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG set the applicant \u2019s dismissal aside and partly allowed her claim for lost wages , awarding her MONEY , plus interest , but refused her claim for reinstatement . It found that the rules of disciplinary procedure had been breached in that the applicant had not been properly invited to explain her actions before a competent disciplinary authority . It went on to say that the order for the applicant \u2019s dismissal did not point to the specific disciplinary offences committed by her , save for the breach of the editorial board \u2019s resolution of CARDINAL DATE . However , TIME of the board \u2019s meeting showed that it was far from clear whether any resolution had been adopted with regard to the participation of PERSON in the show . Lastly , the court found that , despite having the duty to do so under LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) , the ORG had failed to consider whether the severity of the punishment corresponded to the gravity of the applicant \u2019s offence . The order for the applicant \u2019s dismissal was therefore unlawful and had to be set aside . She was accordingly entitled to lost wages , plus interest . However , she could not be reinstated because the term of her employment contract had come to an end on DATE , while the judicial proceedings were pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the refusal of her claim for reinstatement and the partial refusal of her claim for lost wages . On DATE the ORG also appealed , and on DATE it rectified its appeal pursuant to instructions by the court . ORG ( GPE \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) held QUANTITY hearings . The first took place on DATE . The second , initially listed for DATE , was adjourned because on that date the court \u2019s building was sealed off by the police due to a bomb threat , and took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and refused the applicant \u2019s claims . It found that the applicant had been duly asked for an explanation by a competent disciplinary authority \u2013 her line manager \u2013 prior to the imposition of her punishment . The court went on to say that the order for the applicant \u2019s dismissal had been issued in line with the applicable requirements , had indicated the offender , the offence , the punishment , and the legal provisions on which it had been based . Moreover , the applicant had in fact committed the disciplinary offence alleged against her . By allowing PERSON to in fact host her show for CARDINAL the applicant had not only breached employment discipline but had also grossly violated basic rules of her work , such as compliance with the resolutions of the editorial board . By trying to present PERSON as a \u201c coauthor \u201d instead of an \u201c interlocutor \u201d , she had tried to circumvent the editorial board \u2019s resolution . Under Rule CARDINAL of the \u201c PERSON \u201d programme ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , any changes in the content or in the organisation of shows that had already been approved could be made only by written decision of the appropriate manager . Therefore , after the editorial board had approved the show on DATE , the applicant should have informed it about the intended participation of PERSON as a coauthor . By failing to do so , she had grossly breached the rules of the \u201c PERSON \u201d programme and had accordingly correctly been given the harshest disciplinary punishment DATE dismissal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law . She raised several points , the bulk of which concerned alleged breaches of the rules of disciplinary procedure . She also asserted , based on a number of arguments concerning the lawfulness of the editorial board \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE and the lawfulness of the order for her dismissal , that she had not committed a disciplinary offence . CARDINAL of those arguments was framed as follows :", "\u201c Disregarding ... [ my ] arguments concerning the lack of duly adopted rules governing the workings of the \u2018 Hristo Botev\u2019 programme at the time of [ my ] dismissal , as well as the arguments concerning the unlawfulness of point CARDINAL of those Rules [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] on account of its being contrary to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG [ DATE ] , LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] and LAW ] , the [ lower ] court came to the erroneous conclusion that [ I ] had broken point CARDINAL of the Rules and that [ my ] punishment had therefore been lawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After hearing the appeal on DATE , in a judgment of DATE ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 DATE \u0433. , ORG , ORG \u0433. \u043e. ) ORG ( NORP \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u044a\u0434 ) upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . In its view , that court \u2019s ruling that the order for the applicant \u2019s dismissal had been lawful corresponded to the evidence , which showed that the order had been issued by a competent disciplinary authority in line with the applicable rules of procedure and had been duly reasoned . The court further found that the decision to dismiss the applicant had been correct . By knowingly failing to comply with the decision that PERSON should not take part in her show , the applicant had breached employment discipline within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was true that the ORG \u2019s internal rules had not envisaged an editorial board , but it could not be overlooked that the meeting on DATE had been attended by PERSON and PERSON , both of whom had been entrusted by the directors general of the BNR and the \u201c PERSON \u201d programme with managerial functions . Mr PERSON and PERSON had indicated that they did not agree with PERSON intended participation in the applicant \u2019s show . Although the applicant had been aware of that , she had allowed PERSON to take part in her show , thus breaching employment discipline within the meaning of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court went on to say that the applicant should have also been aware of the orders of the directors general of the BNR and of the \u201c PERSON \u201d programme , which had been public and available upon request . Lastly , the court held that the applicant \u2019s dismissal had not been contrary to LAW , because that Article allowed the licensing of broadcasting enterprises . Therefore , neither its letter nor its spirit proscribed the existence of disagreements between those entrusted with the task of framing a radio \u2019s programme and those in charge of current and operative issues . The same went for LAW and section CARDINAL of ORG CARDINAL ( see DATE and DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . Ms GPE and Mr ORG , who were disciplinarily dismissed together with the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , also challenged their dismissals in court . It appears that ORG dismissal was eventually set aside in a judgment which became final on DATE , and that Mr ORG \u2019s dismissal was also eventually set aside .", "CARDINAL .
