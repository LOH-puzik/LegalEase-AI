A conviction is deemed unfair if the sentence imposed is inconsistent with the seriousness of the offence , the personality of the convicted person , or if that sentence , although within the limits of the relevant LAW , is unfair in its chosen type or extent , being either disproportionately lenient or disproportionately severe A conviction may be reversed when it is necessary to impose a more severe penalty where the penalty imposed by the trial court is deemed unfair as being disproportionately lenient - only when it is requested by the pubic prosecutor , the victim or the private prosecution ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
