The determination of the beginning of that situation carries with it a certain element of arbitrariness since [ LAW ] does not lay down any term within which the ordinance referred to in section [ CARDINAL ] ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) should be issued . Assuming that in general the absence of a term is tantamount to a duty to enact a law without undue delay , it can be considered that the discharge of the statutory authorisation , assuming the existence of willingness of the authorised body ( the ORG ) should have taken place in DATE or in DATE at the latest .
