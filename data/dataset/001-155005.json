The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . She is a journalist , working for the newspaper DV .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Director of Public Prosecutions issued an indictment against CARDINAL individuals for importing cocaine into GPE . The cocaine had been hidden in a ORG vehicle , where it had been discovered by customs officers . The police had removed the cocaine and put another substance in its place . CARDINAL of the accused , Mr A , had collected the car from customs and had paid customs duties for it . He and the other accused had driven the vehicle to a garage , where the substance had been removed .", "CARDINAL . The newspaper ORG published an article on DATE on the ongoing criminal proceedings against Mr A and his co - accused before ORG . A picture of PERSON A was published on the front page of the newspaper showing him walking into the courtroom . There was a large headline under the photograph which read \u201c Scared cocaine smugglers \u201d and underneath that it was written that both the accused were afraid of retaliation by their accomplices and had therefore refused to identify them . Mr PERSON name also appeared on the front page , with a report that he and his co - accused could expect prison sentences of DATE and CARDINAL to DATE respectively for removing the substance .", "CARDINAL . The article itself was reproduced on page CARDINAL of the newspaper and the applicant was identified as its author . Next to the article appeared another photograph of ORG , again using his name . The article stated that Mr A had been afraid to reveal the identity of the man he claimed had actually been behind the importation , and that he feared for his family \u2019s and his own safety . The article contained the following passage :", "\u201c The Director of Public Prosecutions is requesting a punishment of DATE ORG imprisonment in respect of [ Mr A ] , who has been indicted for importing QUANTITY of cocaine , intended for sale , together with an unknown accomplice . A punishment of DATE is requested in respect of [ Mr B ] , who is also charged in the case with removing the alleged drug from the vehicle , in cooperation with [ Mr A ] , \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the next paragraph it was stated :", "\u201c The cocaine was hidden in a vehicle which [ Mr A ] imported into the country and took possession of in DATE , believing that the cocaine was still in the vehicle , but the police had already confiscated the cocaine and replaced it with a decoy drug . \u201d", "This sentence was a verbatim rendering of a part of the description of the facts contained in the indictment , without explicit reference being made to that document .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG acquitted both PERSON A and his co - accused of all charges , and on DATE ORG upheld the acquittal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr A lodged defamation proceedings before ORG against the applicant and Mr S.M.E. , who was the editor of DV at the time . In his writ he requested that the headline ( \u201c Scared cocaine smugglers \u201d ) which had appeared on the front page of the newspaper published by DV on DATE and the passage quoted in paragraph CARDINAL above be declared null and void . In addition , Mr A requested that the respondents jointly and severally be ordered to pay him CARDINAL NORP kr\u00f3nur ( ORG ) in respect of non - pecuniary damage and LAW to cover the costs of publishing the judgment in the case in CARDINAL newspapers .", "CARDINAL . Mr A argued that the responsibility for the statements lay with the applicant as the author of the article , in accordance with section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW no . GPE . No one had been identified as the author of the front - page headline , and therefore the publisher or editor was responsible for it ( see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the same LAW , at paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found for the applicant and the editor . In its reasoning it referred to the right to freedom of expression and protection of private life , as guaranteed by LAW . It further stated :", "\u201c When there is an overlap of the defendant \u2019s aforementioned interest in the enjoyment of freedom of expression and the plaintiff \u2019s interest in the enjoyment of respect for his private life , it must be examined whether the publication of the material , for which the defendants are responsible , can be considered to have taken place in the context of a general public debate and therefore to be of interest to the public . The disputed comments appeared in newspaper coverage of public criminal proceedings in which the plaintiff had been accused of a serious crime . The proceedings were open to the public and to those who wanted to observe , in accordance with the usual practice , and the defendants\u2019 account is in accordance with what was revealed at the proceedings . News reporting of criminal cases being tried before the domestic courts must be considered normal and part of a journalist \u2019s work . It can not be a requirement that news reporting must await the outcome of a trial before publication . It makes no difference that the plaintiff was later acquitted of the charges . It must therefore be held that the published material , at the time it was published , was relevant to the public and was newsworthy . Although the headline on the front page is sensationalist , it has to be kept in mind that it refers to what was revealed during the testimony of the plaintiff in the criminal case , namely that he did not want to reveal the name of the person on whose behalf he was acting in respect of the charge of importing the drugs , as he feared for his own and his family \u2019s safety . In view of all this , the statements are not considered to have been insulting or hurtful to the plaintiff , as defined in LAW , or to contain an insinuation , as in LAW . Moreover , they will not be deemed to entail an illegal injury to his character and honour ... \u201d", "Mr A appealed against ORG judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG overturned the ORG judgment . It declared null and void the words \u201c cocaine smugglers \u201d on the front page and the statement \u201c ... believing that the cocaine was still in the vehicle \u201d and ordered the applicant and the editor jointly and severally to pay the appellant ORG CARDINAL ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , plus interest , and ISK CARDINAL for the costs of publishing the judgment . Its judgment contained the following reasons :", "\u201c When the statements at issue in the present case appeared in DV on DATE , the criminal proceedings against the appellant and another man were pending before ORG . This was clearly stated in the article , in which the substance of the charges against them was reproduced , along with a few essential points from the prosecution \u2019s evidence and the statements which they had given at the hearing . It is not argued that the narrative was in any way incorrect , with the exception of those statements which are at issue in this case . The material published concerned a serious criminal case , which was being tried at a public hearing . It was therefore not subject to any limitations under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , in force at the time , which would have prevented the media from utilising its freedom [ of expression ] under LAW , to report on the case , including freedom to identify the accused . However , in that discussion special weight ought to be attached to the fact that it is the role of the courts , not the media , to determine whether an accused person is guilty of an offence .", "... The appellant was acquitted of the ... criminal charges by a judgment of ORG exactly DATE after the publication of the statements in DV , and that conclusion was unaltered after the adoption of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . By virtue of that conclusion the courts had rejected the accusation that the appellant and the co - accused in this case had been guilty of being \u2018 cocaine smugglers\u2019 , and also that the appellant in DATE had taken possession of the aforementioned vehicle \u2018 believing that the cocaine was still in the PERSON . However , these CARDINAL assertions were made in the statements which the appellant seeks to have declared null and void , without any reservation being made with reference to the fact that the assertions were based on an indictment which was contested in court . Bearing in mind the outcome of the criminal proceedings that had been instituted by that indictment , the statements in question contained an insinuation against the appellant , and there is no ground for rejecting his request for them to be declared null and void . As regards the other statements which the appellant claims should be declared null and void , it must be held that the word \u2018 PERSON in the headline on the front page contained a value judgment , and was also supported by comments made by the appellant and the co - accused during the criminal proceedings . The narrative in the article inside the newspaper , stating that the cocaine had been hidden in the vehicle which the appellant had imported into the country and had taken possession of in DATE , after the police had confiscated the drugs and replaced them with another substance , was merely a description of facts that were later substantiated during the criminal proceedings . There are therefore no grounds for declaring the statements relating to this matter null and void .", "The statements which are declared null and void were published in an article , of which [ the applicant ] was named as the author , except for one word [ k\u00f3ka\u00ednsmyglarar ] in the headline on the front page . She is liable to pay compensation for them , as provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . On the other hand , since the author of the front - page headline was not identified , liability to pay compensation for that statement falls on the defendant [ Mr S.M.E. ] as the editor of the newspaper , under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the same LAW . The statement in the front - page headline and those in the article on page CARDINAL were linked to such a degree [ voru \u00feau tengsl ] that the defendants must be ordered jointly to pay compensation for them . It is considered that since , in the present case , declaring the statements null and void alone rectifies the appellant \u2019s position to a great extent , compensation in the amount of ISK CARDINAL is appropriate , with default interest , as further specified in the operative part of the present judgment . With reference to LAW , the defendants must also be ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL to the appellant to cover the costs of publication of the outcome of this case ; he has not claimed interest on that amount . \u201d", "CARDINAL . After his acquittal , Mr A initiated proceedings before the domestic courts , seeking compensation from the NORP State for unlawful detention during the above - mentioned criminal investigation , but to no avail . ORG , in its judgment of DATE , found the detention to have been justified even though he was later acquitted .", "CARDINAL .
