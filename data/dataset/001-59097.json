IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 6-2;No separate issue under Art. 8;No separate issue under Art. 10;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE a large explosion occurred at a ORG checkpoint in GPE . CARDINAL NORP soldiers and CARDINAL civilian were killed and a number of other NORP army personnel were seriously injured .", "CARDINAL . TIME , NORP police officers on surveillance duty noted a light in a house QUANTITY from the scene of the explosion . At TIME on DATE a warrant was obtained to search the house . At or TIME the police entered the house and found an assortment of gloves ( rubber and knitted ) , balaclavas , caps and other clothing . The CARDINAL men in the house , including the owner and the applicants , were arrested and detained by the police under section CARDINAL of the Offences against LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . As later noted by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it was suspected that the bombing had been carried out by ORG ( an unlawful paramilitary organisation known as the IRA ) and the applicants were , in turn , suspected by the police of membership of that organisation and of involvement in the bombing .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants were cautioned by police officers in the usual terms , namely that they were not required to say anything unless they wished to do so and they were also informed that anything they did say would be taken down in writing and might be given in evidence against them .", "PERSON was then questioned about the bombing and about his presence in the house where he was arrested . He refused to answer the questions put to him . Police officers then read LAW to him and he was requested pursuant to that section to give a full account of his movements and actions TIME on DATE and TIME on DATE . He refused to answer any questions .", "PERSON was also questioned about the explosion and about his presence in the house where he was arrested . He refused to answer those questions . He was then requested to account for his movements between CARDINAL a.m. and TIME on DATE . He refused to answer . Police officers then read LAW to him and he was handed a copy of the section and asked to read it . He continued not to answer questions put to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE both applicants were brought to ORG in GPE and charged with the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation ( contrary to section DATE the CARDINAL Act ) and of failing to account for their movements ( contrary to section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' trial in ORG took place . On DATE the applicants were acquitted of the charge of membership of an unlawful organisation but each was convicted of failing to provide an account of their movements during a specified period contrary to section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . The court rejected their arguments that section CARDINAL must be read as including a right to refuse to provide such information on reasonable grounds and about the confusion caused by police officers giving the usual caution about the right to remain silent and then making a request for information under LAW . Both applicants were sentenced to DATE imprisonment . Their sentences commenced on DATE . They were released on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants then appealed against their conviction and sentence under LAW to ORG . As regards their conviction , they submitted that ORG had erred in finding that the applicants were not confused as a result of the caution about their right to remain silent and the conflicting request for information under LAW by the same officers . They argued that section CARDINAL should have been read as including the possibility of a refusal to give information based on reasonable excuse . As to their sentence , they argued that the confusion caused by the caution and request for information should have been a mitigating factor ; that there was no evidence that they warranted the maximum sentence ; and that the court failed to take into account the time the applicants had spent in custody prior to their trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants took proceedings in the High Court challenging the constitutionality of section CARDINAL of LAW . The proceedings pending before ORG were consequently adjourned .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment dated DATE , ORG rejected their application . It based the applicants ' right not to answer questions as regards their movements on LAW rather than on DATE , noting that their case related to suspects in custody and not to accused persons on trial . However , it was considered that section CARDINAL constituted a proportionate interference with the applicants ' right to silence , the objective being to assist police investigations into serious crimes of a subversive nature involving the security of the ORG . In addition , the restrictions were not considered arbitrary or irrational .", "ORG also considered that the restriction did not excessively impair the right to silence given the objective pursued by section CARDINAL and the other legal protections applicable to persons in custody under LAW , which protections were afforded to minimise the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and to safeguard against the possible abuse of the powers provided by LAW . Those protections were listed by ORG : the requirement that a police officer must have a bona fide suspicion prior to arrest ; the obligation to inform the suspect of the offences under LAW and/or of the scheduled offences of which he is suspected ; the right to legal assistance when reasonably requested ; the right to medical assistance ; the right of access to a court ; the right to remain silent and to be told of that right ; the obligations to provide appropriate cautions to detainees and to abstain from cross - examining a person in detention DATE Act and from unfair and oppressive questioning of such detainees ; and the conditions attaching to any extension of the length of detention under LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment dated DATE ORG rejected the applicants ' appeal , finding that section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was not inconsistent with LAW . It was noted that LAW was silent on the use which could be made of statements provided pursuant to requests made under LAW . While ORG had suggested in a previous case ( The People ( Director of Public Prosecutions ) v. PERSON [ DATE ] Irish Reports CARDINAL ) that information lawfully obtained under section CARDINAL might be later used in evidence , ORG expressly reserved its position as to whether that view was correct or not .", "ORG considered that the right to silence was a corollary to freedom of expression guaranteed by LAW and that the relevant assessment was to consider the proportionality of the restriction on the right to silence in view of the public order exception to LAW . It noted that LAW was aimed at actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the ORG and that the proclamation made pursuant to section DATE CARDINAL Act remained in force .", "As to whether section CARDINAL restricted the right to silence more than was necessary in light of the disorder against which the ORG was attempting to protect the public , the court noted that an innocent person had nothing to fear from giving an account of his or her movements even though such a person may wish , nevertheless , to take a stand on grounds of principle and to assert his or her constitutional rights . However , it considered that the entitlement of citizens to take such a stand must yield to the right of the ORG to protect itself . The entitlement of those with something relevant to disclose concerning the commission of a crime to remain silent must be regarded as of an even lesser order . ORG concluded that the restriction in section CARDINAL was proportionate to the ORG 's entitlement to protect itself .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' appeal to ORG in relation to their conviction under LAW has been adjourned generally pending the outcome of the present application .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law . By DATE , the ORG guarantees liberty for the exercise , subject to public order and morality , of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions .", "CARDINAL . The Offences against LAW is described in its long ( explanatory ) title as an LAW to make provision for actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the ORG and , for that purpose , to provide for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the ORG , and to establish ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act makes it an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation as defined in the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL deals with the arrest and detention of suspected persons and provides that a member of the police can arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed an offence under LAW or an offence scheduled under Part V of LAW ( the scheduled offences are mainly offences under the firearms and explosive substances ' legislation ) . This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section CARDINAL proclamation ( see the following paragraph ) .", "CARDINAL . Section DATE CARDINAL LAW provides that Part V of that LAW ( which establishes ORG and contains section CARDINAL ) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the government made when the government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order , and when the government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect . The proclamation was made in DATE and is still in force . Accordingly , section CARDINAL of LAW has been in force since DATE to date .", "CARDINAL . By section QUANTITY the government may declare that a particular class or kind of offence is a scheduled offence for the purpose of LAW and such offences are to be tried by ORG established under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this LAW , any member of the [ police ] may demand of such person , at any time while he is so detained , a full account of such person 's movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub - section of this LAW or any scheduled offence .", "CARDINAL . NORP If any person , of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub - section of this section is demanded under that sub - section by a member of the [ police ] , fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading , he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under the terms of the Good Friday Peace Agreement of DATE , the government committed to initiating a wide ranging review of , inter alia , LAW with a view to reform and dispensing with those elements of LAW which would no longer be required . The Minister for ORG , ORG has , with government approval , established a committee to examine all aspects of the LAW against ORG and to report to the Minister with recommendations for reform . The committee has already commenced its work .", "CARDINAL . In the PERSON case cited above , the accused had been arrested under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act and had made certain statements to the police . The defence argued that because of the basis of his arrest PERSON ( section CARDINAL ) , the existence of LAW and even though no section CARDINAL requests had actually been made , the accused was bound under penalty to give an account of his movements . Accordingly , the statements which had been made by him were involuntary and not therefore admissible . The court did not find this argument persuasive since no section CARDINAL requests had in fact been made . It went on to point out that , even if section CARDINAL had been relied on by the police , the defence submission was not well - founded because of previous NORP case - law which had held that statements obtained in accordance with NORP law , even a law which made it a criminal offence to refuse to answer , were not inadmissible in any legal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Garda Siochana ( police ) Handbook contains relevant legislation and commentaries and is published by ORG of Ireland in association with ORG . The commentary on section CARDINAL of LAW in the sixth edition ( DATE ) provides as follows :", "\u201c The fact that the accused is bound under threat of penalty to answer questions lawfully put under section CARDINAL does not render the resultant answers or statements inadmissible in evidence . \u201d", "The judicial authority for that proposition was noted in the handbook as being found in the PERSON case cited above and the earlier NORP case - law approved in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . In the case of ORG ( In the matter of ORG and LAW DATE , [ DATE ] CARDINAL NORP Law Reports DATE CARDINAL ) ORG found that a confession of a bank official obtained by inspectors as a result of the exercise by them of their powers under LAW of LAW DATE would not , in general , be admissible at a subsequent criminal trial of that official unless , in any particular case , the trial judge was satisfied that the confession was voluntary . ORG considered that compelling a person to confess and then convicting that person on the basis of the compelled confession would be contrary to LAW . That court also found that any other evidence obtained as a result of information provided under LAW of LAW would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial if the trial judge considered , in all the circumstances , that it would be just and fair to admit it ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
