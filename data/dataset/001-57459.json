Mr PERSON , who was born in DATE , lives at GPE , GPE .", "In DATE and until DATE , he operated - through ORG , a company which he controlled - a club for the exchange of video cassettes , under the name of ORG . The company recorded cassettes which were subsequently made available to subscribers to the club , of whom there were CARDINAL . A substantial number of the recordings distributed through the club had been made in breach of copyright , although the applicant contended that he had received counsel \u2019s advice to the effect that the club \u2019s exchange activities were within the law .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant \u2019s business came to the notice of CARDINAL film companies and CARDINAL organisations formed to protect film producers and film distributors , respectively , from activities carried out in breach of copyright ( \" the Plaintiffs \" ) . The investigator employed by the Plaintiffs , a former policeman , discovered and reported to them that their copyright was , in his view , being breached by the applicant and his company ( \" the Defendants \" ) .", "Accordingly , on DATE , the Plaintiffs , as a preliminary step in an action against the Defendants , applied to ORG for interim relief in the form of an order known as an \" PERSON order \" ( see paragraphs TIME below ) . Their application was supported by CARDINAL affidavits , CARDINAL sworn by the investigator and the other by PERSON , a solicitor . The order was made on DATE by Mr Justice PERSON . The Defendants were not present in court : in accordance with the practice in such cases ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , no notice was given to them of either the application or its outcome .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of ORG ( Consolidation ) Act DATE - now section CARDINAL of ORG DATE - , ORG had and has a general power to grant an injunction by interlocutory order in all cases in which it appears to be just or convenient so to do . LAW , rule CARDINAL , of the Rules of ORG specifically empowers it to make orders \" for the detention , custody or preservation of any property which is the subject - matter of the cause or matter \" .", "In this context , ORG developed - in particular from DATE TIME - the practice of granting in appropriate cases to the plaintiff or intending plaintiff in civil proceedings \" PERSON orders \" , so called after the name of a case in which their use was approved by ORG ( PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . They are of a procedural and essentially provisional nature only , being granted pending the trial of the action on the merits .", "CARDINAL . One of the basic purposes of this interlocutory measure being to preserve for that trial evidence in the possession of the defendant or prospective defendant , its essence is surprise . For this reason , the court - by virtue , so it was held in the PERSON case , of a power deriving from its inherent jurisdiction - grants the order on an ex parte application , that is without the defendant \u2019s being given notice and without his being heard . For the same reason , the application is invariably heard in private and the defendant will become aware of the order \u2019s existence only when it is served on him with a view to immediate execution .", "Over DATE , the principles governing the grant and the terms of these orders have been restated and refined in numerous judgments .", "CARDINAL . ORG An PERSON order will normally contain restrictive or mandatory injunctions :", "( a ) prohibiting the defendant from dealing with materials that are the subject of the action ( for example , \" pirate \" - that is , unlicensed or unauthorised - video tapes ) ;", "( b ) requiring the defendant to disclose to the person serving the order the whereabouts of all such materials and details of suppliers and customers , and to deliver up the materials to the plaintiff ;", "( c ) requiring the defendant to make within a specified time - limit an affidavit containing all the information to be disclosed by him under the order ;", "( d ) requiring the defendant to permit the plaintiff to enter specified premises for the purpose of searching for and removing specified items .", "As regards this last injunction , the court will confine the items specified to documents and materials directly relating to the action . It will also restrict the time of entry ( commonly from TIME on DATE ) and the number of persons who are to be permitted to enter ( very rarely CARDINAL ) . The latter will include the plaintiff \u2019s solicitor , who is an officer of the court ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Whilst PERSON orders have been made in a wide variety of cases , the great majority are granted in proceedings involving allegations of infringement of patents , trade marks or copyright or of passing off . Of these , by far the most frequent have been cases involving pirate records , tapes and video cassettes , where the risks of suppression of evidence are especially strong . It appears that CARDINAL such orders were made DATE , but the current figure has dropped to CARDINAL . This reduction reflects the decrease in the incidence of video piracy , which in DATE and DATE had attained epidemic proportions .", "CARDINAL . ORG An PERSON order is usually applied for at the very outset of proceedings , at the same time as the writ commencing them is proposed to be issued .", "The plaintiff or intending plaintiff will submit to the court a draft of the order sought , accompanied by supporting evidence in the form of affidavits ( or drafts to be sworn subsequently ) . The evidence , which is often provided by a professional investigator , will outline the plaintiff \u2019s business and how it is alleged to be prejudiced by the defendant \u2019s activities . There will be a description of those activities , very often including a record of a visit to the defendant \u2019s premises and the purchase and presence there of , for example , pirate video cassettes .", "CARDINAL . ORG The plaintiff must , however , state at the beginning what his charges are and what facts they are based on ; he must not use an PERSON order as a means of finding out what sort of charges he can make ( per Lord Justice PERSON in ORG Conveyors International Ltd [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) .", "Furthermore , he is under a duty to disclose all material facts when applying for the order . Failure to comply , even innocently , with this obligation will , unless the court in its discretion otherwise decides , lead to a refusal or discharge of the order , even though there may be facts justifying its grant .", "CARDINAL . ORG Before making an PERSON order , the court must be satisfied that :", "( a ) the plaintiff has made out an extremely strong prima facie case that his claim will succeed on the merits ;", "( b ) the actual or potential damage is very serious for him ; and", "( c ) there is clear evidence that the defendant has in his possession incriminating documents or things , and that there is a real possibility that , if he is forewarned , he may destroy such material .", "CARDINAL . ORG If so satisfied , the court will nevertheless accede to the application only on terms which will be incorporated in its written order , in the form of undertakings given to the court . These are designed to protect the position of the absent defendant , counsel for the plaintiff being under a duty to ensure that the order contains all proper safeguards for this purpose . The court determines in its discretion what undertakings are to be given , there being no invariable rules or practice in this respect . Examples are the following , item ( a ) being found in all , and items ( b ) , ( c ) ( i ) and ( c ) ( ii ) in most cases :", "( a ) an undertaking by the plaintiff to pay to the defendant any damages sustained by him as a result of the making of the order ;", "( b ) an undertaking by the plaintiff that the order and other relevant documents , such as the affidavit evidence underlying it , the writ instituting the proceedings and the notice of the next hearing , will be served on the defendant by the plaintiff \u2019s solicitors ;", "( c ) undertakings by those solicitors :", "( i ) to offer to explain to the person served , fairly and in DATE language , the meaning and effect of the order , and to inform him that he has the right to obtain legal advice before complying with the order or parts thereof , provided such advice is obtained forthwith ;", "( ii ) to retain in their custody any items taken by or delivered to them pursuant to the order ;", "( iii ) to answer any question from the defendant as to whether an item is within the scope of the order ;", "( iv ) to prepare , before their removal from the LOC , a list of the items taken ;", "( v ) to use any information or document obtained under the order only in connection with the civil proceedings in question ;", "( vi ) to ensure that the exercise of rights under the order remains at all times under the control of a solicitor .", "The significance of the intervention of a solicitor in this procedure and in the undertakings given is that solicitors are officers of ORG and , as such , subject to its inherent jurisdiction in disciplinary matters . A failure by a solicitor to comply fully with an undertaking given by him personally to the court in his professional capacity will render him liable to summary proceedings for contempt of court with a potential sanction of imprisonment , a fine or an order to pay compensation or costs . It will also constitute professional misconduct , punishable in professional disciplinary proceedings by striking off the roll , suspension from practice or a financial penalty .", "CARDINAL . ORG In addition to the fact that it is issued to a private party in civil proceedings , and not to the police in criminal proceedings , an PERSON order is to be distinguished from a search warrant in that it confers no right of forcible entry onto LOC . Its terms require the defendant to permit the plaintiff to enter , but it remains open to the defendant to refuse and , if he so wishes , to apply by urgent motion for variation or discharge of the order ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He is , however , under pressure to give permission , especially since refusal to comply will expose him to the risk of proceedings for contempt of court on the motion of the plaintiff , with a possible penalty of imprisonment . Moreover , even if the defendant later succeeds in having the order discharged , his disobedience whilst it was in force will - unless it was made in circumstances in which it was a nullity in law - still constitute a contempt , albeit one which will probably be treated as technical and will usually attract no penalty ( per Lord Justice PERSON in ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG It is common practice - and this has received judicial approval - to arrange for a policeman to be present , outside the LOC , when an PERSON order is being executed , with a view to forestalling any breach of the peace .", "CARDINAL . ORG An PERSON order will expressly reserve to the defendant liberty to apply by urgent motion for its variation or discharge on giving specified notice to the plaintiff ( usually TIME but sometimes less ) . Being an essentially provisional measure , it will in any event limit the duration of the relief which it affords to a specified period , generally DATE . On the expiry of that period , there will in principle be a hearing inter partes at which the court will review the order and consider whether the relief should be continued . On that occasion , or at any time subsequently , the defendant may apply for the order to be varied or discharged . Whilst the court may set aside the order even after its execution , it will not do so unless discharge was applied for reasonably soon thereafter and will serve some practical purpose ( PERSON plc v. PERSON [ DATE ] Reports of Patent Cases CARDINAL ) .", "An PERSON order can be set aside if there existed no , or no sufficient , grounds for its making , if the plaintiff failed to disclose material facts when applying for it or , it seems , if it was improperly or oppressively executed .", "If the order is set aside , the defendant will be relieved from complying with the injunctions contained therein and any materials seized thereunder will be returned to him . Partial relief of a similar nature may also be granted by the court even if the application for discharge is unsuccessful ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In addition or as an alternative to applying for the order \u2019s discharge , the defendant may seek damages under the plaintiff \u2019s cross - undertaking ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( a ) above ) on the ground that the order was improperly obtained or executed . Damages may be awarded even if the order is not set aside and even if the plaintiff \u2019s action succeeds on the merits ( ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . Whilst they may be determined earlier , claims for damages are usually stood over until the trial on the merits ( ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG ) . Damages are primarily intended to compensate the defendant for loss occasioned by the order but they may be aggravated if it was executed in an excessive or improper manner ( see ORG case ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG If the defendant considers that the plaintiff or his solicitors are in breach of their undertakings contained in the PERSON order or that the latter have acted improperly in executing it , he can proceed against them for contempt of court ( see paragraph CARDINAL in fine above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The defendant can also claim damages for trespass if , for example , entry to his LOC was obtained by a trick or without real consent , or materials were removed without justification under the order .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the ORG case , Mr Justice PERSON reviewed extensively the law and practice relating to PERSON orders . He considered that the availability of damages did not meet the main objection to the procedure , namely that it produced for the defendant , without his being heard , damaging and irreversible consequences , often in the form of the closure of his business .", "Furthermore , whilst it was proper to make PERSON orders in suitable cases , they had , in his opinion , been too readily granted and with insufficient safeguards for defendants , the balance that had to be struck between the rights at issue having swung much too far in favour of plaintiffs . He was of the view that the draconian and essentially unfair nature of an PERSON order from the defendant \u2019s point of view required that it be restricted to the minimum extent necessary to achieve its purpose and he gave several examples of steps to be taken to meet this standard .", "CARDINAL . ORG The interlocutory relief obtained by the Plaintiffs on DATE in the shape of the PERSON order was granted until DATE or until further order . The Defendants were given liberty to apply to the court for variation or discharge of the order on giving CARDINAL hours\u2019 notice to the Plaintiffs .", "CARDINAL .

The LOC identified in the order were those under the control of PERSON and his company ; they were in fact where he carried on business but - apparently unbeknownst to the Plaintiffs - they were also occupied by him in part as his home ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and constituted at the time his only residence .", "( c ) An injunction requiring the Defendants to reveal to the GPE solicitors the whereabouts of , and to deliver to them , all the aforesaid copies and documents in the GPE possession .", "( d ) Injunctions requiring the Defendants to disclose to the GPE solicitors the names and addresses of the GPE suppliers of and customers for unlicensed copies of the said films ; and to swear , within DATE after service of the order , an affidavit setting forth this information ( \" the affidavit of disclosure \" ) .", "CARDINAL .

The undertaking to inform the Defendants of their right to obtain legal advice related , however , solely to the requirement to disclose particulars of their suppliers and customers ( see paragraph CARDINAL ( d ) above but cf . paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The PERSON order was executed on DATE , simultaneously with a police search warrant . The circumstances that led to this special feature of the present case are set out below .", "CARDINAL .

He arranged with A that , if the order was obtained , there would be a meeting between those who were to execute it and the police at Bath police station at TIME on DATE . The reason for this arrangement was that the police planned to execute , in connection with possible proceedings under LAW DATE and at the same or about the same time as the order , a warrant to search the GPE LOC for and seize any pornographic video films .", "CARDINAL .

Well , that is a different matter altogether .", "( Counsel ) : My Lord , it is a different matter , but I felt I ought to draw your Lordship \u2019s attention to the fact that they propose a visitation upon [ the applicant ] and his company at about the same time as we propose to serve this order upon them .", "( The judge ) : Yes , but they are not interested in ...", "( Counsel ) : No .", "( The judge ) : ... these films .", "( Counsel ) : They are just interested in the obscenity .", "( The judge ) : It \u2019s only the self - incrimination .", "( Counsel ) : My Lord , that \u2019s right .", "( The judge ) : So far as that is concerned there is no indication that the police are ...", "( Counsel ) : None whatever .", "( The judge ) : As to that you gave the undertaking . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG A letter of CARDINAL DATE from the GPE solicitors to PERSON - which was put in evidence by the Plaintiffs in another connection - contained the following passage concerning the arrangements with the police :", "\" We would like to deal ... with the point about the simultaneous execution of the police search warrant with the [ PERSON order ] ... [ We ] would like to make our position plain ... On DATE [ we ] first received instructions to obtain an [ order ] . It is quite clear from our attendance note of the conversation that [ the investigator ] also told [ H. ] that the police were interested in you and [ the applicant \u2019s company ] in relation to pornographic material . It was also clearly assumed that should the police wish to take action then a joint execution of the search warrant and the [ order ] would be the ideal arrangement . Obviously anything other than a simultaneous execution might well prove to be to little or no effect . Of course no one could be certain at that time that such simultaneous execution would take place since it depended , inter alia , on a judge granting a full PERSON order and the police obtaining a search warrant quite apart from any other practical difficulties . That was the position when the application before the application judge was made on [ CARDINAL ] DATE ] . Let us be quite clear , we do not in any way deny that it was the intention that the [ order ] , if granted , would be served and executed at the same time as the search warrant , assuming that [ that ] was granted to the police and that the other arrangements could be made . We repeat that such is obvious . We also think reference to the transcript [ of the hearing concerning the application for the order ] makes it quite clear that the application judge was informed of the police interest and the likelihood or possibility of a search warrant being executed . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG As soon as the PERSON order was made on DATE , the GPE solicitors informed the NORP police , who had obtained a search warrant on DATE . The previous arrangements were confirmed .", "CARDINAL .

It infringed what is normally the fundamental principle of audi alteram partem , as a result of proceedings in which the defendant had not been heard and of which he had not even previously been informed . Hence the importance of full disclosure to the court from which the order was sought and of observing not only in the letter but in the spirit the stipulations it incorporated for the defendant \u2019s protection .", "( b ) Whilst PERSON Justice PERSON had not been adequately informed of the plan to execute the order and the search warrant simultaneously , there had been no deliberate intention to deceive him .", "( c ) There had not been a plot by the Plaintiffs to enter the premises without permission , but it was \" disturbing \" that the Defendants were not given a proper opportunity to refuse entry at the door .

However , Lord Justice PERSON added that , if this was intended , the court from which the order was sought had to be told in advance so that it could consider safeguards for the defendant as regards , for example , the order of the searches or the conduct of the plaintiff on obtaining entry . In Lord Justice PERSON \u2019s view , steps should be taken to ensure that the CARDINAL searches were not conducted \" simultaneously \" and that the solicitors executing the order did not seem to be \" the hangers on of a squad of police officers \" .", "( e ) PERSON had admitted dealing in \" a substantial volume \" of pirate material , he had not applied to Mr Justice PERSON in DATE for discharge of the order but had instead given wide undertakings , and the order was necessary for the Plaintiffs\u2019 protection .", "Whilst describing what had happened as \" unfortunate and regrettable \" , ORG concluded that it was not necessary to set the PERSON order aside for the purpose of doing justice to Mr PERSON .
