When invited to the meeting on DATE , he had not been informed of its real purpose , namely the plan to take the child into public care .

On CARDINAL DATE the mother informed the authorities that ORG could not stay with her as the situation had drained her strength . She suggested that ORG should stay with her paternal grandfather . The same day social welfare officials visited PERSON 's paternal grandfather and his partner , a family day care nurse by profession , who informed the officials that they could not take care of H. in the long term . It was agreed , however , that H. would stay with them until ORG had reached its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the social welfare authorities that he did not approve of the public care . In an opinion of DATE a senior physician , PERSON , found PERSON to be normally developed both physically and mentally .", "CARDINAL . In a hearing on DATE ORG examined CARDINAL witnesses . The psychologist PERSON testified to having met once with PERSON , following which the examination had been continued by the psychologist PERSON , who had met her on a few occasions .

The applicant requested that the court refer H. to a child psychiatrist for examination . ORG did not object to such an examination as long as it was conducted by a public institution . The applicant contended that in the DATE he had , of his own motion , discussed his daughter 's behaviour with a social welfare official in another local office , following which he had requested the day carer to observe H. particularly in this respect . The day carer denied that such a conversation had taken place .", "CARDINAL . ORG granted the applicant cost - free counsel retroactively from DATE .

From DATE the day carer had seen H. frequently masturbating during naps and when playing . According to her notes , such masturbation had lasted from TIME to TIME at a time . H. had also repeatedly been saying that the applicant had been tickling her in her buttocks and kissing her with his tongue .", "CARDINAL . ORG reasons for upholding the care order read in extenso as follows :", "\u201c According to the evidence available , the conditions in the home of [ H. ] have seriously jeopardised her health and development . Open - care support measures have not been possible . The public care of [ H. ] and her placement outside her original home must be considered to be in her interests . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was notified to the ORG on DATE . The following day social welfare officials presented themselves without giving any advance notice in the paternal grandfather 's and his partner 's home , removed PERSON and temporarily placed her in a substitute family .", "CARDINAL .

The mother consented to the placement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant removed PERSON from the venue of a supervised meeting and hid her during the following DATE . On DATE he and ORG underwent an examination by a psychologist , ORG , who in a written opinion of CARDINAL DATE found PERSON to be more developed than an average child of her age . She was balanced , very attached to her father and there was no indication of her having been sexually abused .", "CARDINAL . DATE after the abduction the ORG decided that the public care should be implemented in the substitute family . ORG did not accept the paternal grandfather 's and his partner 's offer to care for H. It noted that the applicant had been heard in person on DATE . He had been invited to attend the ORG 's meeting , but he sent instead a letter that was read out at the meeting .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG filed observations in reply to the applicant 's appeal to ORG . On DATE he submitted a rejoinder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court invited ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the GPE \u201d ; terveydenhuollon oikeusturvakeskus , r\u00e4ttsskyddscentralen f\u00f6r h\u00e4lsov\u00e5rden ) to submit a written opinion on the conduct of the examinations by ORG , which was subsequently communicated to the applicant for comments .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , and following the applicant 's complaint as to the examinations by ORG , ORG had obtained expert opinions from its standing experts , a professor in child psychiatry , PERSON , and a psychologist PERSON , as well as a written opinion from PERSON and PERSON In an opinion dated DATE Dr GPE noted inter alia the following :", "\u201c The examinations carried out on H. were initiated on account of ' the sexual games ' with the father , of which the child had spoken to DATE care nurse , and on account of ORG 's frequent masturbation in day care , especially before taking a nap . Although masturbation is relatively usual at that age , it can no longer be considered to merely relate to the age of the child when it is so extensive and intense as described by DATE care nurse , especially not where the masturbation is placed in the context of the child 's description of ' sexual games ' at home . In this light I find the initiation of the examinations concerning sexual abuse a justified measure . .... [ Dr A - K.R 's ] questions [ that were put to H. ] were not leading although they tended to have an element of pressure given that they were repeated several times as the girl was unable to answer them . ... Whether the girl has undergone psychological tests , either projective tests or tests measuring the child 's abilities , remains unclear . Also the contents of [ H. 's ] playing remain unclear . Thus , I can not assess the quality of psychologist [ PERSON 's ] examinations . Pyschologist [ GPE ] has met both parents , but the documents I have received do not disclose any detailed description of the contents of the discussions , thus preventing me from assessing also the quality of these discussions . With the exception of the interview carried out by child psychiatrist [ A - K.R. ] , which I find appropriate , I can not take a position on the nature of the examinations . ... The decision to take the child into public care was made in an appropriate manner by the social welfare authorities , considering that the father had proved to be the likely abuser of the child ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave the applicant permission to consult , during TIME , CARDINAL tape recordings from the examination of PERSON at ORG . He was not allowed to copy the tapes but had them transcribed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited the applicant 's further observations . In his observations of DATE he submitted a written opinion by the psychologist PERSON , issued following the abduction . He also requested a hearing including the taking of witness evidence from the former girlfriend PERSON , PERSON , the psychologist PERSON and PERSON , a child psychiatrist and consultant to ORG . Moreover , he objected to not having been provided with the full documentation underlying ORG opinion such as PERSON and the psychologist PERSON 's observations . Lastly , he relied on a written opinion , dated DATE , by PERSON , who considered that the examination by ORG had not shown that PERSON had been sexually abused by the applicant . On the contrary , it transpired from the transcripts of the interviews that she had been led and pressurised by PERSON , the clear goal being to detect sexual abuse . Not all interviews had been recorded . Clinical annotations were missing from the records , which rendered it impossible for PERSON to assess the credibility of ORG examinations .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG request for an additional opinion , PERSON and the psychologist PERSON , in their joint opinion of DATE , expressed the view that the decision to take ORG into care and place her first with her mother and later in a substitute family , had been justified and appropriate , considering both PERSON 's own words and her behaviour . They also took the view that ORG should have considered more thoroughly the conditions for an additional examination of PERSON given the fact that the psychological examination and the interviews with the parents had been insufficient . Further , they took a stand regarding the examinations carried out on the applicant 's request during PERSON 's abduction by the psychologist PERSON As noted above , the applicant relied on a written opinion of H.H in ORG .", "\u201c ... Psychologist PERSON has carried out psychological examinations on both PERSON and her father . A written opinion has been given on account of these examinations . It indicates that ORG had examined the father on CARDINAL occasions and the child on CARDINAL occasion . It is questionable especially in the context of suspected sexual abuse that the same psychologist tests both the suspect and the abused child . .... The examinations were carried out without consultation with those involved in the earlier examination , which in our opinion shows professionally unethical and inconsiderate conduct on the part of the examining psychologist . .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its further opinion of DATE to ORG the Medicolegal Authority deemed ORG examinations in DATE to have been necessary and based on a reasonable suspicion of sexual abuse . ORG had obtained the audio tapes and documents produced by ORG and had heard the psychologist PERSON , PERSON and the psychologist PERSON in writing . It had also obtained the above joint opinion of its standing experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG invited the applicant 's further observations . In his observations of DATE he noted that he had not been provided with copies of the above supplementary opinion by PERSON and the psychologist PERSON", "CARDINAL . H. was missing from the authorities until DATE when the police fetched her from the applicant 's work place . She was placed in a family support centre ( perhetukikeskus , familjest\u00f6dscenter ) . The applicant was informed of her whereabouts on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE underwent an examination in a university hospital . A paediatrician , PERSON , stated in her written opinion of CARDINAL DATE that she had not found any signs of sexual abuse in her examinations and found PERSON 's behaviour to be normal for her age . PERSON did not , however , take any stand regarding the earlier medical opinions .", "CARDINAL . In a meeting on DATE between social welfare officials and staff of the university hospital hesitation was expressed about undertaking new examinations concerning the alleged sexual abuse .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to DATE H. underwent child psychiatric examinations at the GPE university hospital on the basis of a referral dating back to DATE . During that period the applicant was heard at the surgery on DATE and DATE and he was consulted over the telephone on DATE and DATE . In her written opinion of DATE a child psychiatrist , PERSON , described PERSON as a very lonely DATE girl , whose basic human relationships with her parents and her brother and other persons close to her were coloured by argument and conflict . The examinations did not concern the sexual abuse suspicion as such an examination would have damaged the child 's mental health . PERSON was considered to suffer from a severe stress reaction and to have adjustment difficulties and she was in need of possibly long - lasting child psychiatric treatment . The opinion recommended child welfare measures with a view to protecting the child .", "CARDINAL .

In a meeting with social welfare officials on CARDINAL DATE the applicant was informed that PERSON , who was diagnosed as suffering from post - traumatic stress , would be moved out of the family support centre within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in a meeting with social welfare officials , the applicant was informed that a substitute family home had been found and he was invited to comment in writing on the intention to transfer H. there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he requested ORG to terminate the public care as being no longer justified . He submitted that PERSON 's initial examination in ORG had been conducted on the basis of the preconceived idea that sexual abuse had taken place . This suspicion had been categorically refuted in the written opinions of PERSON and the psychologist PERSON behavioural disturbance had not been shown to result from the conditions in the applicant 's home . Before the taking into care she had not displayed any signs of being disturbed . Moreover , her wish to continue living with him had been recorded repeatedly .", "DATE . On DATE the senior social welfare official refused the applicant 's request that the public care be terminated , being of the view that no alternative care solution existed . Open - care assistance would be insufficient for ensuring the child 's healthy physical and mental development . By placing H. in substitute care , the authorities were seeking to provide her with a secure and home - like growing environment and to ensure her mental rehabilitation as well as a healthy development corresponding to her age . Having received the decision , the applicant pursued his request before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In his submission of CARDINAL DATE he objected to the intended transfer of ORG to a substitute family home and proposed that she be placed in the family of her former day care nurse , who had consented to receiving her . PERSON 's mother again consented to the transfer to a substitute family home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Board decided to transfer H. to the substitute family home . Her removal took place on the following day . The ORG 's decision stated , inter alia , that :", "\u201c According to ORG , the examining doctor of the GPE university hospital , H. suffered from post - traumatic stress , inter alia , because of the abduction , and for the purpose of rehabilitation H. should be provided with a safe home - like growing environment . No suitable substitute family was found that could have taken the child , inter alia , because of the abduction threat by the father . A family home was found which has a home - like atmosphere and has long experience of the care of different children taken into public care . In the family both parents are at home , looking after the children . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG also confirmed the official 's refusal to terminate the public care , relying on the reasons given in the official 's decision . It further noted that the care order had been triggered by the disturbed behaviour which ORG had been repeatedly displaying during DATE . From the sexual point of view her symptoms had differed from those of other children of her age . She had been placed in public care on the basis of ORG examinations . Her growing environment had been jeopardising her healthy development and open - care assistance had been considered insufficient .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the ORG 's decisions of CARDINAL May and DATE , arguing that it had failed to hear PERSON and the other interested parties . In considering that there was no alternative to the public care and in finding open - care assistance insufficient the ORG had based itself on events which had occurred DATE , without obtaining any fresh evidence as to the justification for its decisions . He furthermore recalled that , when PERSON had been removed from him in DATE , the social welfare officials had requested her fresh examination in the clinic in view of the expert opinions submitted by him . However , after ORG had rejected his final appeal against the care order , social welfare officials had allegedly amended their request to the clinic , asking instead that PERSON receive treatment according to their instructions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in a meeting involving social welfare officials , the substitute parents and medical staff , it was observed that according to the patient records of the clinic PERSON 's symptoms , which had already abated in the family support centre , had continued to diminish in the substitute family home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard CARDINAL witnesses . It had at its disposal , inter alia , a written opinion of a psychologist , ORG , whom the personnel of the family home had consulted . On DATE it rejected the applicant 's appeal against the decision to transfer ORG to the substitute family home . It gave the following reasons :", "\u201c ... Having been taken into public care , [ H. ] was officially placed in a substitute family from DATE to DATE . In reality she was a fugitive with her father from DATE to DATE , when she was placed in a family support centre .", "A doctor of the university hospital who examined [ H. ] after her escape journey considered that she should be provided with secure conditions resembling a home .

ORG also rejected the appeal against the decision not to terminate the public care . It reasoned as follows :", "\u201c On DATE [ the applicant ] abducted [ H. ] , who had been placed in the care of the ORG , and was hiding her at different locations until DATE . After the escape journey [ H. ] was diagnosed as suffering from various behavioural disturbances , a serious post - traumatic stress syndrome and adjustment difficulties .

In DATE social welfare officials inspected the home of the applicant and his then common - law spouse . It appears that no report was made .", "CARDINAL . In a meeting on DATE , which the applicant had not been invited to attend , social welfare officials and staff of the hospital and ORG agreed that the symptoms displayed by PERSON \u201c more than likely \u201d resulted from her having been subjected to sexual abuse . By now the substitute care had provided ORG with sufficient security and in the prevailing circumstances she would be able to develop into a balanced young person and adult . A termination of her public care could have unforeseeable consequences . Her meetings with the applicant would be supported also in the future .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without having held an oral hearing , rejected the applicant 's appeal against ORG decision of DATE .
