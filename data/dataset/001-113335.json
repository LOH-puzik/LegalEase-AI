GPE of the Police in GPE ( the first applicant ) is registered as a trade union of members of ORG . It is a legal person with its registered office in GPE . The application on its behalf was lodged by Mr PERSON , the trade union \u2019s president . Mr PERSON ( the second applicant ) is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in Malacky . At the relevant time he was vice - president of the first applicant association . Mr PERSON ( the third applicant ) is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in LOC . He is the first applicant \u2019s vice - president . Mr PERSON ( the fourth applicant ) is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a member of the first applicant association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , of which CARDINAL policemen were members at that time , organised a public meeting in CARDINAL of the main squares in GPE . Its aim was to protest against envisaged legislative amendments concerning the social security of policemen and their low remuneration . In its course the participants spontaneously shouted , inter alia , that the Government should step down . CARDINAL of the banners displayed by the participants read \u201c If the ORG does n\u2019t pay a policeman , the mafia will do so with pleasure \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the Minister of the ORG criticised the meeting and its organisers . He considered it to be an attempt to involve policemen in politics , in particular because of the slogan calling for the ORG \u2019s resignation , which he considered incompatible with the ethical code of the police .", "CARDINAL . Apart from the public statements described below , the Minister of the ORG , on DATE , removed PERSON , the president of the first applicant , from the post of director in the police force and assigned him to a different post as an ordinary policeman . At an extra - ordinary general meeting of the police joint health insurance company held on DATE , the third applicant was removed , upon a proposal by the Minister of the ORG , from the company \u2019s supervisory board . The policeman who had carried the above - mentioned banner was summoned by the inspection service of ORG and was asked to explain its content .", "CARDINAL . The applicants refer to the following public statements by the Minister of the ORG in particular .", "CARDINAL . In an article published on DATE in the DATE newspaper GPE the Minister of the Interior was quoted as saying that if anyone acted contrary to the ethical code of the police again they \u201c would be dismissed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In an interview published in the same newspaper on DATE the Minister stated that he did not challenge the policemen \u2019s right to elect their trade union representatives . He expressed the view that , nevertheless , he was not obliged to negotiate with those representatives as they had lost credibility .", "CARDINAL . In a TV debate broadcast on DATE the Minister of the ORG stated , among other things :", "\u201c PERSON was demoted because he misled ... the public , those policemen whom he had lured out to the square ... PERSON was not demoted because of his opinion , but for having lied . He lied in that he called into question [ the fact ] that the Government had money at their disposal for increasing policemen \u2019s salaries ...", "ORG is an armed security force . As such it must remain strictly apolitical . This means in practice , CARDINAL of the ethical code of the police indicates , that when expressing his or her views in public a policeman must act in an impartial and reserved manner , so that there can be no doubt about his or her impartiality . Thus slogans calling for the ORG \u2019s resignation are in complete contradiction to that code ... I am telling you , it will not be possible for excesses like the ones at that meeting to reoccur in the future . This is what I guarantee to you . If a policeman behaves in such a way in the future , he or she will no longer be a policeman . I still proceeded in a particularly moderate manner in this case , where the sanction applied concerned PERSON exclusively . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint with ORG . They alleged a breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW and their constitutional equivalents . The applicants specifically referred to the above - mentioned statements of the Minister of the ORG which had been published in GPE on DATE and DATE and to the statements he had made in context of the TV broadcast of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the applicants maintained that the Minister \u2019s statements , when considered in the light of his powers in respect of the police , gave rise to a fear that members of the police force would be sanctioned for availing themselves of their freedoms of expression , assembly and association . There had been no breach of LAW of the police in the context of the public meeting organised by the first applicant . The Minister \u2019s statements had been repressive , as he had indicated that he was not obliged to negotiate with the representatives of the first applicant . Those statements , accompanied by the transfer of the president of the first applicant to a different position , deterred the police from defending their rights through their trade union .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the statements in question had not breached the applicants\u2019 rights .", "CARDINAL . The judgment stated that the freedom of assembly and association under LAW and LAW CARDINAL extended exclusively to natural persons . The Minister \u2019s statements complained of could not , therefore , amount to a breach of that freedom in respect of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered that , in the context of the meeting held on DATE , the applicants had exercised their right to freedom of expression . At the same time the second , third and fourth applicants had exercised their right to freedom of association with others . They had done so freely and independently of the will of the Minister of the ORG . The Minister \u2019s statements published in the media were to be understood as part of a dialogue between both parties , who had thus been given the opportunity to express their opinions and standpoints .", "CARDINAL . Admittedly , the Minister \u2019s statements could be characterised as \u201c bold and , from a certain point of view , capable of creating an atmosphere of fear \u201d . However , their nature and intensity were not such as to amount to a breach of the freedoms in issue .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further held that the Minister of the ORG had been entitled to express his opinion on the situation within the ministry for which he was politically responsible . His statements represented an immediate reaction to ideas and views expressed at the meeting . Those statements had not interfered with the applicants\u2019 rights in issue . They merely described a situation which might occur under specific circumstances . However , ORG was exclusively entitled to examine complaints of breaches of rights which were based on facts that had actually occurred .", "CARDINAL . In a separate opinion to the decision on admissibility one of the constitutional judges expressed the view that the ORG complaint should have been rejected for their failure to use the other remedies available , namely , to seek redress by means of an action under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL .
