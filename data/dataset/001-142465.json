FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Administrative proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time)", "JUDGES": "Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s husband was injured in a car accident and he received insurance benefits from an insurance company . However , on DATE the insurance company refused his applications for compensation for rehabilitation . On DATE and DATE the husband appealed against these decisions to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) . The husband died on DATE but the applicant and the estate decided to continue the appeals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeals . No appeal lies against these decisions . The judgment of ORG was sent to the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) complaining , inter alia , about the excessive length of the proceedings in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave a reply , after having requested a statement from ORG which included reports from the referendary and the judges responsible for examining the applicant \u2019s case . The ORG considered that the proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case had taken , in total , a long time . However , the ORG accepted the reasons given by ORG , namely that the case had been exceptionally extensive , complex and time - consuming . ORG examined the case as a first instance , which required more preparation than when it examined appeals as a second instance . Also the case file had been incomplete and several requests for information had been made . The applicant , on her part , had sent a considerable number of documents during the course of the proceedings , which had also contributed to the length . The ORG considered that there had been no particular inactivity in ORG . Hence it considered that , despite the lengthy proceedings , there had not been unjustified delays in the course of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant initiated extraordinary proceedings before ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , requesting that the decisions of ORG be quashed because the referendary in ORG had been biased .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application for being outside its competence . As the proceedings before ORG were administrative , it was ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) that was competent to examine an extraordinary appeal concerning an alleged procedural flaw .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal with ORG , claiming that the proceedings before ORG had been flawed due to the partiality of the referendary and the wrong application of law .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint concerning the wrong application of law without examining the merits and rejected the partiality complaint after having examined it . ORG considered that the applicant had reasoned her complaint about the referendary \u2019s partiality only with the fact that she had complained about the referendary to ORG . The court was of the opinion that the mere fact that the applicant had complained about the referendary to the ORG did not put the impartiality of the referendary into question ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
