ORG on DATE accordingly prolonged the applicant 's detention , relying in particular on evidence obtained from CARDINAL of the co - accused .", "CARDINAL .

In addition to the existence of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences , the court relied on the complexity of the case , the severity of the penalty that might be imposed and the need to secure the proper conduct of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG prolonged the applicant 's detention . It reiterated the grounds previously given for keeping him in custody .

NORP ORG , on DATE and DATE respectively , dismissed the applicant 's requests . The reasoning of both decisions was identical .
