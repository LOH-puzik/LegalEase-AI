The applicant instituted proceedings in the GPE City Third ORG , suing the newspaper for non - pecuniary damages in the amount of CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , or MONEY ( ORG ) ) for a breach of her right to privacy . She referred , inter alia , to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ruled in favour of the applicant . The court found that the information about the applicant \u2019s private life had been collected and published without her consent . The data about her private life did not correspond to any legitimate public interest . The article had been published on the front page of the newspaper as the sensation of DATE , with the aim of increasing sales . ORG noted that publication had humiliated her and caused her significant non - pecuniary damage . The court concluded that , by printing the article and doing so in a humiliating manner , the newspaper had deliberately sought the negative consequences or had intentionally allowed for such consequences . Taking into account the above considerations , the court applied LAW on LAW to the Public , multiplied the statutory sum of LTL CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL ) by CARDINAL , and awarded the applicant LTL CARDINAL ( about ORG CARDINAL ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , requesting the maximum award under LAW of the said PERSON , namely ORG . On DATE the appellate court reduced the award to LTL CARDINAL ( about EUR CARDINAL ) . It reasoned that the applicant had not proved that the newspaper had published the information about her intentionally and that the first - instance court had had no grounds to triple the statutory sum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the appellate court \u2019s decision . It stated that an award in excess of LTL CARDINAL,CARDINAL under LAW on ORG to the Public could only be granted if it had been established that the information had been published intentionally . The court agreed with the reasoning of the appellate court that , for a breach of privacy , intent was to be regarded as proven if the facts about someone \u2019s private life were disseminated with the purpose of degrading that person ( siekant j\u012f sumenkinti ) . ORG held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c It is to be stressed that the problem of the interaction between persons who are sick with AIDS and the others is relevant and should be discussed . The relations of the sick with the persons who live nearby are based on the knowledge about the disease we have DATE and on the understanding of the related dangers . The nature of the disease and the known data about it reasonably raise concern on the part of the people who live in close proximity , to many of whom this question becomes pertinent not from curiosity , but from concern for their personal safety . These are significant arguments , which demonstrate great concern in society , and which attest to the relevance of the question . It should be taken into account that persons who live in proximity [ to the applicant ] have expressed concern for their safety , which is endangered by the [ applicant \u2019s ] behaviour , which does not always meet moral standards . In such circumstances the publication of data which breaches a [ person \u2019s ] privacy , even though such publication violates the [ legal ] norms which protect privacy , can not be regarded as an end in itself or intentional , which would be a basis for the application of much stricter liability . [ Therefore ] the amount of LTL CARDINAL as compensation for non - pecuniary damage is considered sufficient \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
