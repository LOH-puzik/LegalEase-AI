It is obvious that Mr PERSON is not fit to conduct his own defence as is his right .. And , indeed , it may well be the case that he is not fit to be tried even if counsel were able to represent him . I must say that , having seen Mr PERSON in court and having heard Mr GPE , he is able to put his case forcibly and eloquently , although that may be on the medical evidence before me only over very short periods of time . I have therefore come to the conclusion that I should apply a stay in this case but it will not be a permanent stay . I intend to apply to this indictment a conditional stay . The indictment will be stayed upon the following conditions which I have had the opportunity of canvassing both with [ counsel ] on behalf of the Crown and PERSON PERSON and it is right to say Mr PERSON does not agree with them , but they are the conditions which I impose . Firstly , that the stay will continue to apply providing that , one , the defendant 's health does not improve by way of treatment or otherwise to a condition where he is no longer medically unfit to be tried ; and , secondly , providing that the defendant does not engage in any activity , either political , social or personal , which demonstrates to the satisfaction of a court that he is in fact able to stand his trial , irrespective of his medical condition . \u201d", "The formal order incorporating that ruling reads as follows :", "\u201c The indictment be conditionally stayed against PERSON and the stay will continue to apply :", "CARDINAL .

The prosecution stated that they had offered to return seized material which was not relevant to the prosecution of the co - defendant , but that the applicant had stated that he wanted all of the material or none of it . The applicant did not accept the prosecution 's claim , and maintained that \u201c special procedure material \u201d should never have been seized under the warrant .
