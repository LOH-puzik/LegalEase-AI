THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE . He is currently being detained in an Immigration Deportation Centre awaiting removal to GPE .", "The facts of the case as set out by the applicant and as deduced from the case file can be summarised as follows :", "The applicant arrived in GPE on DATE and was given leave to enter GPE for DATE as a visitor . He was subsequently granted leave to extend his stay until DATE to pursue a course of studies . Further leave to remain beyond that date was refused on DATE and he was warned on CARDINAL DATE that he was liable to be deported . A deportation order was signed on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant alleges that he never received notice of that order and that it only came to his attention in DATE when his solicitor contacted ORG about his status in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant came to the notice of ORG when he was arrested on suspicion of having submitted a fraudulent social security claim . A deportation order was served on the applicant on DATE . The applicant 's appeal against the order was rejected as being out of time .", "On DATE the applicant was detained at a GPE police station . He requested political asylum DATE . He was interviewed by ORG on DATE and on CARDINAL and DATE about the grounds for his asylum request . At the interview conducted on DATE the applicant alleged for the first time that in DATE he had become caught up in a plot to overthrow the military regime in GPE when serving as an officer in ORG . The plot was uncovered and he had to flee GPE since he feared for his life . The Secretary of ORG refused his request on DATE , finding that the applicant had given contradictory accounts of his reasons for leaving GPE which called into question the credibility of his claim . For the Secretary of ORG it was significant that the applicant had not made a request for political asylum until DATE although he had arrived in GPE in DATE .", "On DATE a Special Adjudicator rejected the applicant 's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of ORG , being of the view that the applicant was not a truthful and reliable witness and had not substantiated his account of the events relied on in his asylum request .", "In a letter dated DATE the applicant made fresh representations to the Secretary of ORG claiming that he feared persecution on religious grounds if he were deported to GPE . The Secretary of ORG informed the applicant by letter dated DATE that he had not adduced any new elements which would lead him to reconsider his earlier decision . On DATE the applicant was removed to GPE but was returned to GPE DATE . It would appear that the NORP immigration authorities refused the applicant entry since he claimed to be a NORP national on arrival . On being returned to GPE the applicant made a further request for political asylum on the grounds that he had a well - founded fear of religious persecution if deported to GPE . His request was refused and he appealed to the Special Adjudicator who rejected his appeal following a hearing held on DATE . The Special Adjudicator found that the applicant had not substantiated his fear of religious persecution and questioned the truthfulness of the factual basis of his claim . The Special Adjudicator concluded that the claim was frivolous and lay outside the scope of LAW .", "The applicant sought judicial review of the decision to remove him to GPE on the grounds that GPE authorities had procured a travel document for him from ORG without his consent . On CARDINAL DATE his application was refused .", "Since arriving in GPE the applicant has formed a relationship with a NORP woman , who , according to ORG records , is an overstayer with no claim to remain in GPE . CARDINAL children have been born in GPE from that relationship , one in DATE and the other in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
