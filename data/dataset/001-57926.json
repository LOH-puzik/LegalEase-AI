He maintained that their independence served only to inflate inordinately their self - importance and enabled them to apply the law in all its cruelty and irrationality , without any scruples and without anyone being able to oppose them .", "Mr PERSON continued by recounting his personal experiences from meeting judges and visiting courtrooms , referring in this connection to the \" arrogant bullying \" ( menschenverachtende PERSON ) of Judge PERSON", "CARDINAL .

After considering the matter , it decided that none of the evidence offered could sufficiently substantiate the allegations in issue .", "Thus statement no . CARDINAL , according to which Judge PERSON treated every accused at the outset as if he had already been convicted , was not proved merely by the fact that the judge in question had , in a given case , asked defence counsel to be brief , as he had already made up his mind . Similarly , the CARDINAL decisions of Judge PERSON reported by PERSON in support of statement no . CARDINAL were not sufficient to bear out the allegation that the judge had adopted bullying tactics . None of these decisions disclosed the slightest intention to cause unnecessary suffering . Lastly , the accusations made in passage no . CARDINAL had been definitively refuted by a disciplinary decision of ORG of DATE .

Not content with having denied Judge PERSON an opportunity to answer the accusations levelled against him , his research had been conducted in a very superficial manner ; moreover , he had himself admitted that he had not attended any trials presided over by Judge PERSON , that he had reproduced the content of old newspaper articles without checking their accuracy and had represented as true allegations based on hearsay .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG upheld this judgment , but reduced the damages to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It held in particular that ORG had in no way infringed the rights of the defence by dismissing as immaterial the evidence that Mr PERSON had sought to adduce . This situation had arisen because of the way in which he had formulated his criticism . It had been so comprehensive and general that it had been impossible to specify evidence capable of establishing its accuracy . The case could , moreover , be distinguished from the case of PERSON v.
