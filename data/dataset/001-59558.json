THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-2;No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE , at ORG , the applicant was convicted of being concerned in the importation in DATE of a large quantity of cannabis resin , contrary to section PERSON ) of the ORG and Excise Management Act DATE . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in respect of this offence . The applicant had previous convictions , but none in respect of a drug - related offence .", "CARDINAL . An inquiry was conducted into the applicant \u2019s means , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW see below ) .", "On CARDINAL DATE a ORG and Excise appointed drug financial investigation officer advised the applicant \u2019s solicitors that he was carrying out an investigation into their client \u2019s financial affairs and that he wished to interview him in order to assist the court in determining whether he had benefited from drug trafficking . The applicant declined to take part in the interview .", "CARDINAL . The investigation officer prepared a written statement pursuant to LAW which was served on the applicant and filed with the court .", "In the statement the investigation officer observed that the applicant had no declared taxable source of income , although he was the registered owner of a house converted into CARDINAL flats from which he had started a bed - and - breakfast business in DATE . Examination of the applicant \u2019s building society account showed cash and cheque deposits in the period from DATE to DATE totalling over MONEY ( GBP ) , which the investigation officer suggested might represent rental income from the CARDINAL flats . The applicant was found to have become a director of a newsagents business in DATE of which his parents were the sole shareholders and to have bought a shop in DATE for GBP CARDINAL , of which GBP CARDINAL was paid in cash . He was the registered owner of CARDINAL cars , of an estimated total value of MONEY , and was found to have spent GBP CARDINAL on a ORG CARDINALi in DATE , and MONEY CARDINAL on expenses related to the DATE importation of cannabis ( in respect of which he had been convicted ) . The investigation officer concluded that the applicant had benefited from drug trafficking and that the total benefit was GBP CARDINAL .", "In respect of the applicant \u2019s realisable assets , the investigation officer observed :", "\u201c The size of Phillips\u2019 realisable assets is likely to be peculiarly within the defendant \u2019s own knowledge and I feel it reasonable to suppose that any successful drug trafficker ( in as much as the defendant is ) may take care to ensure , so far as he can , that the proceeds of his trade will be hidden away so as to be untraceable . Examples include the fact that his business dealings are always conducted in cash , that no records are ever maintained , and that some assets , for example the ORG CARDINALi , are registered in false names . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a written statement in response , in which he denied having benefited from drug trafficking . He explained that in DATE - CARDINAL he had been convicted of car theft and required to pay GBP CARDINAL to the insurance company which had indemnified the victims . He claimed that he had sold the house for GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL to X in order to clear this debt and had used the GBP CARDINAL residue from the sale to purchase the newsagents LOC for his parents because he owed them money too . He denied owning any part in the newsagents business . When he was released from prison in DATE he began trading in telephones ; this was the source of the GBP CARDINAL in his building society account . He denied owning any of the cars registered in his name , claiming variously that each had been purchased and sold on behalf of a friend or stolen without insurance . In conclusion , he alleged that his only realisable assets were some GBP CARDINAL in a building society account and the fittings of a garage rented from the local authority . The applicant filed documentary evidence and affidavits in support , primarily , of his claim no longer to own the house .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigation officer filed a second statement in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act . He stated , inter alia , that the applicant was still the owner of the house and that the conveyance to X had never been registered .", "CARDINAL . At the confiscation hearing in the ORG the applicant gave evidence and called witnesses . Giving judgment on DATE the judge observed :", "\u201c It is for the prosecution to establish , of course , on a balance of probabilities that he has benefited from drug trafficking , that is received any payment or reward in connection with drug trafficking . Here there is no direct evidence of that so the ORG invite me to make the assumptions required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , namely ( a ) that property held by him since his conviction , and property transferred to him since DATE , the appropriate date , was received as such a benefit ; ( b ) that any expenditure of his since that date in DATE was met out of payments received by him in connection with any drug trafficking carried on by him . I must do so unless either he shows on a balance of probabilities that the assumption is incorrect , or I am satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice to him if the assumption was made . \u201d", "The judge commented generally that , in seeking to displace the assumption and to counter the prosecutor \u2019s allegations , the applicant had failed to take obvious , ordinary and simple steps which would clearly have been taken if his account of the facts had been true . For example , instead of calling as witnesses the alleged purchaser of the house , X , and other individuals for whom he claimed to have bought and sold cars , the applicant had called only himself , his father and a solicitor .", "CARDINAL . The judge found the prosecution \u2019s allegation that the applicant still owned the house to be correct and held that ORG \u2019s purported purchase payment of ORG had in fact been a benefit of drug trafficking . The judge stated :", "\u201c The assumption to be made is plain , and the accused has neither shown that it is incorrect nor demonstrated a risk of injustice .", "There are real indications on the civil basis of proof that [ X ] was complicit in the crime of which the accused was convicted . They travelled to GPE together at about the time when arrangements for shipment of the load of compressed herbal cannabis would be likely to be made . A mobile phone at the heart of the arrangements for the haulage of the drugs was registered in the name of [ X ] . Just as the jury did not believe PERSON , neither do I. What has happened here , in my judgment , is a device of just the sort providing a cover to explain the transfer of money which one would expect to find in concealing benefit from drug trafficking . There is an apparently ordinary , formal , commercial transfer of property , appropriately done through solicitors in the ordinary way , which has never ultimately been formally finalised , and my judgment is that it was indeed a sham , that the property ... is still owned by the accused ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The prosecution alleged that the applicant had received a further GBP CARDINAL in cash from X. The applicant accepted that he had received this money , but claimed that X had merely been cashing a cheque drawn by the applicant \u2019s father to buy out the applicant \u2019s share in the family business for a total of GBP CARDINAL . In connection with this transaction , the judge observed :", "\u201c No sensible explanation for the involvement of [ X ] in that cashing of that cheque was given to me at all , and it is impossible , in my judgment , to see any sensible reason other than that he did not cash a cheque ; that it was a simple payment . It involves my disbelieving not only the accused but also his father , but I do . I think family loyalty has overcome his honesty .", "Although the accused now has no formal interest in the remaining shop LOC from which the family business is conducted , I do not accept the account of himself and his father that he has no interest in the business . Even within a family I find the purchase of a share of a business for GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL entirely without documentation simply unbelievable . Again , on the balance of probabilities it is a device to conceal the true reason for the payment by [ X ] to the accused of GBP CARDINAL which was that it was a payment for drug trafficking . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s dealings with cars , the judge remarked :", "\u201c Accepting his lowest estimates of those sums which he has paid out , a total of GBP CARDINAL in cash is reached . He told the jury that he always dealt in cash in all his transactions , not only dealing with these but other transactions , he presenting himself to the jury as a general wheeler - dealer , having specialised at CARDINAL stage in cars , more recently in mobile telephones , but willing to deal in anything which would offer a profit . He says he never kept records at all . He accepts and asserts that he dealt dishonestly in cars , as well as legitimately , and that is certainly so . He has been convicted during the relevant period of offences of dishonesty in relation to ringing cars and was sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment in respect of that . There are also in the papers before me indications of earning legitimate commissions in ordinary sales of cars .", "But the fact that he may have had other sources of cash , both legitimate and illegitimate , does not , in my judgment , displace the second assumption in a case such as this where no sort of account , complete or partial , is available or possible . I have seen what must have been a fraction of his dealings , and I am satisfied that the GBP CARDINAL must be treated as a benefit . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge assessed the applicant to have benefited from drug trafficking to the extent of GBP CARDINAL .", "He next calculated the value of the realisable property held by the applicant as follows :", "\u201c For the reasons that I have given above I am satisfied that [ the applicant ] is in fact the beneficial owner of [ the house ] . In the absence of a current valuation , but taking judicial notice of a recent modest recovery in the housing market after a long , flat period , I am satisfied that the GBP CARDINAL which he said in evidence was what such a property was worth in DATE , that is to say during the long , flat period , I am satisfied that GBP CARDINAL is a fair estimate of the likely net proceeds of a sale of that property now or in the relatively near future .", "Again for the reasons that I have given above , I am satisfied that the accused still has a CARDINAL interest with his parents in the [ newsagents business ] . He and his father said that the business was worth GBP CARDINAL in DATE . That is what was purported to be the basis of the GBP CARDINAL he was to be given for it . There is no evidence that it is worth any less now , and I therefore find his realisable share in the equity in that business to be worth GBP CARDINAL . Since I am satisfied as to GBP CARDINAL realisable sums , that figure exceeds the GBP CARDINAL and under section CARDINAL I find the amount to be recovered to be that figure . \u201d", "In view of the difficulties inherent in realising the applicant \u2019s share of the family business , the judge allowed him DATE in which to pay the confiscation order , with a period of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment to be served in default of payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was refused leave to appeal against conviction and sentence ( including the imposition of the confiscation order ) . His application to renew leave to appeal against conviction and sentence was refused on DATE after a full hearing before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW provides that a ORG should make a confiscation order in respect of a defendant appearing before it for sentencing in respect of CARDINAL or more drug - trafficking offences , whom the court finds to have received at any time any payment or other reward in connection with drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW , the confiscation order should be set at a sum corresponding to the proceeds of drug trafficking assessed by the court to have been gained by the defendant , unless the court is satisfied that , at the time the confiscation order is made , only a lesser sum could be realised .", "CARDINAL . In determining whether and to what extent the defendant has benefited from drug trafficking , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act require the court to assume that any property appearing to have been held by the defendant at any time since his conviction or during DATE on which the criminal proceedings were commenced was received as a payment or reward in connection with drug trafficking , and that any expenditure incurred by him during the same period was paid for out of the proceeds of drug trafficking . This statutory assumption may be set aside by the defendant in relation to any particular property or expenditure if it is shown to be incorrect or if there would be a serious risk of injustice if it were applied ( section CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The required standard of proof applicable throughout the DATE Act is that applied in civil proceedings , namely on the balance of probabilities ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Provisions broadly similar to the above were previously included in LAW DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d , considered by the ORG in PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , by a majority of CARDINAL , held that a confiscation procedure similar to that applied in the present case was incompatible with LAW . Lord PERSON , with whom Lord PERSON agreed , observed , inter alia :", "\u201c ... By asking the court to make a confiscation order , the prosecutor is asking it to assess the value of the proceeds of the petitioner \u2019s drug trafficking . It is therefore asking the court to reach the stage of saying that he has trafficked in drugs . If that is criminal , that seems to me to be closely analogous to an actual charge of an actual crime , in NORP terms . There is of course no indictment or complaint , and no conviction . And the advocate depute pointed out a further difference , that a NORP complaint or indictment would have to be specific , and would require evidence , whereas this particular allegation was unspecific and based on no evidence . But the suggestion that there is less need for a presumption of innocence in the latter situation appears to me to be somewhat PERSON , and to portray vice as a virtue . With no notice of what he is supposed to have done , or of any basis which there might be for treating him as having done it , the accused \u2019s need for the presumption of innocence is in my opinion all the greater ... I can see no basis upon which it could be said that [ such ] assumptions ... would not offend against the presumption of innocence , leaving it to the accused to show that these assumptions were incorrect . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held unanimously that the imposition of a drug confiscation order did not give rise to a violation of LAW . Giving judgment , the Lord Chief Justice examined the confiscation process on the basis that LAW as a whole , including LAW , applied . He concluded that , considered as a whole , the confiscation scheme struck a fair balance between justice for the defendant and the public interest in controlling the proceeds of drug trafficking .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution appealed from ORG decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and on DATE ORG of ORG held , unanimously , that LAW did not apply , since during the confiscation proceedings the accused was not \u201c charged with a criminal offence \u201d but was , instead , faced with a sentencing procedure in respect of the offence of which he had been convicted . Moreover , ORG held that even if LAW could be said to apply , the assumption involved in the making of the confiscation order was not unreasonable or oppressive ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
