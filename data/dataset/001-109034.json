X may get an unsuspended prison sentence DATE up to six months \u201d . Why prison ? \u201c X has apparently not been sufficiently daunted by the suspended prison sentence \u201d .

NORP Immediately after the articles appeared , X. instituted proceedings against the applicant company in ORG . The applicant company attached to its initial reply the statement by its journalist ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and numerous press articles about X , including a number of interviews given by him , to ORG magazine among others , together with photos of him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG imposed an injunction on publication of the article , following a request lodged by X on DATE . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE it confirmed the injunction . That judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE ORG also imposed an injunction on publication of the photos illustrating the article . It confirmed that decision in a judgment of DATE . The applicant company did not challenge that judgment , which became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG prohibited any further publication of almost the entire first article , on pain of an agreed penalty , under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( by analogy ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , read in the light of the right to protection of personality rights ( Allgemeines Pers\u00f6nlichkeitsrecht ) . It ordered the applicant company to pay ORG CARDINAL as a penalty under the agreement and to reimburse the procedural expenses ( EUR CARDINAL , plus statutory interest accrued from DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the article in question , which mentioned ORG name and was accompanied by photos of him , amounted to a serious interference with his right to the protection of his personality rights ; the disclosure of his criminal conduct had , so to speak , resulted in his being pilloried and discredited in the eyes of the public . The court found that , despite those negative effects , reporting of that kind would nonetheless have been lawful in the event of serious crimes that were part of contemporary society and on which the press was entitled to report . Any interference with a criminal \u2019s private sphere was limited , however , by the proportionality principle , which involved a balancing exercise between the competing interests . The court held that in the present case the right to protection of X \u2019s personality rights prevailed over the public \u2019s interest in being informed , even if the truth of the facts related by the daily had not been disputed . Neither the nature of the crime committed , nor the person of X , nor any other circumstances justified publication of the article at issue .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that whilst a drugs - related offence was not a petty crime , particularly as in the present case it had been cocaine , which was a hard drug , X had been in possession of only a small quantity of that drug and had not been accused of drug trafficking . The type of offence involved was of medium , or even minor , seriousness , was a very common one and there was no particular public interest in knowing about it . The court added that , unlike serious crimes ( such as spectacular robberies , or murders ) , there were no particular circumstances distinguishing the offence in question from ordinary crimes , even if there was an assumption that drug abuse was more widespread amongst key figures from the arts world and the media than in other circles . Furthermore , the way in which the report had been made by the applicant company confirmed that the offence itself was not an important one . The report had focussed more on X \u2019s person than on the offence , which would probably never have been reported in the press if it had been committed by a person unknown to the public . Similarly , the court pointed out , whilst ORG \u2019s previous conviction for a similar offence was such as to increase the public \u2019s interest , it was his only previous conviction and , moreover , dated back DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court also found that publication of the articles in question was not justified by the person of X. The public did admittedly show an interest in Police Superintendent Y , a character in a relatively popular television series , but not in the actual person of the actor playing the part . There was nothing to suggest that X attracted the attention of the public on account of his performance as an actor or other activities bringing him within a circle of persons about whom the public had a need for regular information . The interest in X did not , in any event , go beyond the interest habitually manifested by the public in leading actors in NORP television series .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the applicant company had published many articles about X over a period of DATE and particularly over DATE . The vast majority of these publications had , however , merely mentioned X \u2019s name \u2013 often without a photo \u2013 among the names of celebrities invited to various events . Whilst it was undisputed that X had taken part in over CARDINAL national and international cinematographic and televised productions , that did not convey much of an idea of his public importance . Indeed , actors could have starred in CARDINAL of television series and still remain little known to the public . There was no evidence that X had made a name for himself on account of any particular performance or that he had occupied a prominent position in society which had brought him into the public eye .", "CARDINAL . X had , to an extent , sought to attract the public \u2019s attention by giving interviews to certain magazines CARDINAL . He therefore had to be more tolerant towards reports published about him than other wellknown figures who avoided the limelight . According to the court , X had not , however , courted the public to a degree that he could be considered to have implicitly waived his right to the protection of his personality rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG conceded that the fact that the actor had broken the law whereas on television he played the role of a superintendent entrusted with crime prevention was more entertaining for the public than if the actor had played any other kind of role . However , that contrast between the television role and the personal lifestyle of the actor did not mean that the public confused the latter with the fictional character . The actor merely donned the persona of a superintendent , just as he could don that of any other character , without thereby adopting the conduct of the character in question in his daily life . The fact that an actor did not adopt the lifestyle of the character he played could not in any way be regarded as an extraordinary event worthy of being reported . In the court \u2019s view , viewers could distinguish between the actor and his role , even where the actor was well known essentially for playing CARDINAL particular character .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , further , that X had not sought to portray himself as an emblem of moral virtue ; neither had he adopted a stand on matters relating to drug abuse . The interviews reported by the applicant company contained no comment by X on the subject . In issue no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of the magazine PERSON , X had stated , in passing , that he did not have any alcohol in the house and that he had become a big tea connaisseur . In the court \u2019s view , the fact that X had briefly remarked on his previous conviction in CARDINAL interviews with magazines in DATE did not mean that he had portrayed himself as an advocate or critic of the fight against drugs or as an expert in the field . That subject had been only marginally covered in the interview , which had mainly concerned the actor \u2019s professional prospects and his difficulties in his relationships .", "CARDINAL . Observing that when balancing the competing interests , the decisive criteria were how well known X was and the seriousness of the offence with which he was charged , ORG found that the case concerned an actor who was not exceptionally well known and was accused of an offence which , while not insignificant , was not particularly spectacular and could be regarded as fairly common in the entertainment world . The public did not therefore have a great interest in being informed of an event that was actually fairly anodyne , whereas the information published amounted to a serious ( gravierend ) interference with PERSON \u2019s right to the protection of his personality rights .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , lastly , that the applicant company was not justified in arguing that the publication of the article was lawful because it pursued legitimate interests . Admittedly , the press officer from the public prosecutor \u2019s office at ORG I had informed a large number of media reporters of the offence with which X had been charged and had disclosed his identity to them ; nor was there any doubt that the public prosecutor \u2019s office could be regarded as a \u201c privileged source \u201d ( privilegierte ORG ) of information that did not , as a general rule , require verification as to the truth of its content . Moreover , CARDINAL press agencies had disclosed similar details . However , even assuming that it had received all the information before publishing the article in question , the applicant company could only conclude that the published information was true and was not thereby absolved from the requirement to check whether its publication was justified in terms of X \u2019s right to protection of his personality rights . In the court \u2019s opinion , the question of the veracity of information issued by a public authority had to be distinguished from that of the lawfulness of the subsequent publication of that information by the press .", "CARDINAL . The court found that it could be presumed that institutions providing a public service , and in particular the public prosecutor \u2019s office and the police , made every effort , in accordance with the principle of neutrality , not to issue information unless the public interest in doing so had been carefully weighed against that of the persons concerned . However , such institutions were not necessarily in a better position than a publisher to weigh the conflicting interests at stake regarding the dissemination of the information through the media .", "CARDINAL . In the instant case the applicant company was actually better placed than a member of the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office to judge the degree to which X was known and the question regarding whether the public had an interest in learning of his arrest . On that point the court considered that account also had to be taken of the context in which the information was published : the public services were not in a position to anticipate every possible form of dissemination of factual information in any foreseeable context or to foresee whether a report mentioning the person \u2019s name was justified or not . Accordingly , publishers could not generally consider that the disclosure of a person \u2019s identity by a privileged source would make any kind of report on the person concerned legal , without having first balanced the interests at stake .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that there were situations in which there may be doubts regarding the assessment by the public authorities . Accordingly , in the case of X , the question arose as to whether it was appropriate for the public prosecutor \u2019s office to have expressed an opinion on the sentence that X could expect to receive when the criminal investigation had only just started . The court concluded that the applicant company could not argue that it had relied on the disclosure of ORG name by the public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant company , but reduced the amount of the agreed penalty to ORG CARDINAL . It upheld the conclusions of ORG , pointing out that the disclosure of a suspect \u2019s name when reporting on an offence constituted , as a general rule , a serious infringement of the right to the protection of personality rights , even if it was a drug offence of medium or minor seriousness . In X \u2019s case the fact of informing the public that he had taken cocaine could adversely affect his future prospects of securing acting roles and , in particular , of obtaining a role in an advertisement or in television series aimed at a young audience .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterated the relevant criteria when balancing the rights of the press against the right to protection of personality rights , as established by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It confirmed that the nature of the offence and the exact circumstances in which it had been committed made it an everyday offence and would not have aroused any interest if the perpetrator had been little known . In the court \u2019s opinion , the possession and consumption of low quantities of drugs did not have adverse effects on third parties or on the general public . As PERSON had not taken cocaine in the tent in front of everyone , his conduct did not imperil a young audience that might be likely to imitate him on account of his being a well - known television star .", "CARDINAL . ORG acknowledged that the public had a particular interest in being informed and entertained because X was a well - known figure and had played the part of a police superintendent over a long period of time ( l\u00e4ngerer PERSON ) . However , even if X played that role , this did not mean that he had himself necessarily become an idol or role model as a law - enforcement officer , which could have increased the public \u2019s interest in the question whether in his private life he actually behaved like his character . It was clear that the actor X could not be identified with the fictitious character of GPE Y that he played . The fact that X had his fan clubs and had made public appearances as the actor who played the part of GPE did not alter that finding . It could well be that X \u2019s appearance , his manner of presenting himself , and the relaxed attitude portrayed in his films appealed to others , particularly a young audience . That did not mean , though , that others saw in him a moral role model whose image should be corrected by the newspaper report in question .", "CARDINAL . The publications submitted by the applicant company were indeed evidence that X was hugely popular , but did not support the contention that he had used confessions about his private life to attract the public \u2019s attention . Nor was the newspaper report justifiable on the ground that X had been arrested in public , in a tent , because the drug had actually been consumed in the men \u2019s toilets , that is , in a place that fell within the protected private sphere , and out of public view . Lastly , even if it were to be established that ORG \u2019s arrest was a matter of substantial public interest , the same could not be said of the description and characterisation of the offence committed out of public view .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , while upholding the conclusions of ORG regarding the role of the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office , ORG stated that the applicant company \u2019s liability did not extend beyond minor negligence given that the information disclosed by the public prosecutor \u2019s office had led it to believe that the report was lawful . The illegal disclosure by the public prosecutor \u2019s office did not , however , make publication by the applicant company legal . ORG accordingly reduced the agreed penalty to ORG CARDINAL . It refused leave to appeal on points of law because its judgment did not conflict with the case - law of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company claiming that it had not had a sufficient opportunity to make submissions ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) . It stated that when balancing the public \u2019s interest in being informed about public criminal proceedings against an interference with the defendant \u2019s private sphere , ORG in accordance with the criteria established in its case - law . There was no evidence that the relevant criteria for the balancing exercise had been disregarded . ORG stated that the fact that the civil courts had found against the applicant company did not permit the latter to lodge an appeal on points of law and did not amount to a violation of the right to be heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted an application by X for an injunction against any further publication of the second article .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG granted X \u2019s application in the main proceedings , ordered the applicant company to refrain from any further publication of the second article on pain of penalty and ordered it to pay ORG in costs , plus statutory interest accrued from DATE . It based its decision on essentially the same grounds as those set out in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs DATE above ) . It stated that the case in question had to be distinguished from the one that had been the subject of the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in that the person concerned in that case , Prince PERSON DATE PERSON , was much more widely known than X , so the press had been entitled to report on the substantial penalty imposed in that case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant company on essentially the same grounds as those given in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . On the subject of the relevant criteria for weighing the conflicting interests , it stated that , according to the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the fact that a person was a prominent figure or CARDINAL known to the public was not a sufficient factor in itself to justify the existence of an interest on the part of the public in being informed of his or her conduct . In the present case , the public \u2019s interest in being informed and entertained , which derived from the fact that X was a well - known figure and starred as a superintendent in a television series , was insufficient to justify the interference with his right to decide for himself which information he was willing to disclose ( informationelle PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company \u2019s reliance on the high audience rating of the television series Y. did not , in ORG opinion , prove that X. had served as a role model or a counter model . If a role model existed for CARDINAL of viewers , the role model in question was the character of the superintendent . ORG reiterated that the fact that X. had been arrested in a public place did not make the newspaper article lawful because the offence itself had been committed out of public view , in the men \u2019s toilets . The suspicious movement that X had made with his hand had admittedly attracted the attention of the police at the scene , but it had not been established that other persons present in the tent had noticed that X had taken cocaine .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that whilst the fact that the \u201c quality press \u201d had reported the case might indicate that there was a not insignificant ( nicht geringes ) interest in reporting it , that was not a basis on which to conclude that the interference with X \u2019s right to the protection of his personality rights had been lawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that its judgment did not conflict with the case - law of ORG , in particular the latter \u2019s judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case - law . On DATE it dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company claiming that it had not had a sufficient opportunity to make submissions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - judge panel of ORG declined to entertain constitutional appeals lodged by the applicant company against the court decisions delivered in the first and second sets of proceedings . It stated that it was not giving reasons for its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG ordered the applicant company to pay X CARDINAL penalty payments of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , each one for having breached the order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court criticised the applicant company for , inter alia , publishing in DATE of the DATE newspaper PERSON and on the newspaper \u2019s internet page ( welt.de ) on CARDINAL DATE the following statement by CARDINAL of its editors :", "\u201c Accordingly , we had no right whatsoever to report on the trial of the popular actor X for possession of cocaine , even though he was a very well - known recidivist and the offence was committed at the beer festival in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

If there are reasonable fears that further damage will be inflicted , the owner may seek an injunction .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( no . Vi ZR CARDINAL ) ORG reiterated its established case - law according to which the decisive criteria for evaluating the lawfulness of a news report mentioning the name of the person concerned were the nature of the offence and the person of the suspect . The facts of the case were a fine and a prohibition on driving imposed by the NORP courts for speeding on a motorway ( CARDINAL instead of QUANTITY ) on a person known to the public . ORG found , firstly , that the speed limit had been exceeded to such an extent that it could be regarded as an expression of extreme contempt for the highway regulations , and , secondly , that the offence had put other motorists at considerable risk . Moreover , both the manner in which the person concerned had behaved in public in the past and his origins and the fact that he was the husband of a very well - known individual meant that the interest of the press in publishing a news report prevailed over the right to protection of the personality rights of the person concerned . ORG pointed out that the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE of DATE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ) allowed of no other conclusion . The articles ( and photos ) in that case had concerned only scenes from PERSON daily life , and had aimed merely to satisfy the curiosity of a particular readership regarding her private life .", "CARDINAL .
