SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicants , a family of CARDINAL , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE , CARDINAL and DATE , respectively , and are currently in GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant arrived in GPE and applied for asylum and a residence permit on DATE . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) , he claimed that he had been a major in the NORP army and had witnessed how other officers were involved in illicit smuggling of weapons . He had reported it to his superiors with the result that he had been assaulted and threatened but no investigation had been instituted . A colonel , who had been involved in the smuggling , had threatened to kill the first applicant or have him committed to a psychiatric clinic . To protect his family , he had divorced his wife and moved out of their common home . In DATE he had resigned from the military and had commenced a civil employment . DATE the colonel had contacted him and had wanted him to take part in some form of illegal activity failing which he would be killed . Out of fear , the first applicant had left the country . He submitted a copy of a referral to a psychiatric clinic for forced hospitalisation , dated DATE , and a medical certificate stating that he had been hospitalised because of concussion and was exempt from work for DATE , dated DATE .", "On DATE the other applicants came to GPE and joined the first applicant \u2019s request for asylum and residence permits . The second applicant stated that she had chosen to remain in GPE with the children when the first applicant left the country as she had considered that his problems did not concern them . However , in DATE , the colonel had come to their home and had threatened her and had searched their home and , DATE , CARDINAL men had come to their home and had assaulted her . The men had said that they had been sent by the colonel . The second applicant claimed that she and the children had received more threats , by telephone calls and anonymous letters , and had therefore also decided to leave the country . Because of the assault , she was suffering from anxiety and depression .", "The children were also heard by ORG and they stated that they felt fine , that they had not had any problems in their home country and that they did not know why they had come to GPE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the ORG request . It found that the family \u2019s problems emanated from individual persons and not from the NORP authorities and that the family therefore should have exhausted all means to seek protection from the authorities against the aggressors . As they had failed to do so , they had not shown that they were in need of protection in GPE . ORG found no other grounds on which to grant the family leave to remain in GPE , even having regard to the fact that the case involved CARDINAL children .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining their claims and adding that the first applicant had reported the smuggling to several authorities within the military in his section and region . A review of the weapons in the unit , carried out on the basis of his report , had not shown any irregularities but he had been threatened with court martial for slander . Consequently , since his reports had led to nothing except threats against himself and his family , it was clear that the authorities protected each other and that the applicants could not count on help or protection from the NORP authorities . Moreover , the first applicant alleged that he had also received several summonses to appear before the police . These had been sent to his address in GPE , proving that some persons were still looking for him and that the family would not be safe in GPE . He submitted CARDINAL summonses in which he was called to appear before the police on DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively . He stated that these had been sent to him by the second applicant \u2019s sister in GPE .", "The second applicant also submitted a medical certificate , dated DATE , by PERSON , psychologist , and PERSON , psychiatrist and chief physician , at ORG in GPE . The certificate stated that the second applicant was suffering from ORG ( PTSD ) following an assault in DATE . She was taking antidepressants and consulted a psychologist on a regular basis which had improved her condition . It further noted that she was doing an internship at a hospital as a paediatrician ( her profession in GPE ) which was going well .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It first seriously questioned the authenticity of the summonses invoked as they were only copies and lacked a case number . Moreover , CARDINAL stated that the first applicant was called as a witness and the others did not state why he was called . None of the summonses mentioned that he was suspected of having committed any crime . Furthermore , the court observed that the family had not reported the threats to the authorities and that the second applicant had not reported the assault . Thus , they had not made probable that the NORP authorities neither could nor would help or protect them against those individuals threatening them . Consequently , the court concluded that the applicants were not in need of protection in GPE . Moreover , it considered that the second applicant\u2019Sweden .", "Upon further appeal , ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) , on DATE , refused leave to appeal .", "The applicants were then called to a meeting with ORG on DATE to prepare for their return to GPE .", "The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . Both the old Aliens Act and the DATE Act define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "LAW , of the DATE Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) as to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section DATE CARDINAL Act ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien \u2019s state of health . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit .", "As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "According to LAW DATE everyone lawfully within the territory of GPE has the right to move freely and choose his or her place of stay or residence . Moreover , the PERSON on the right of NORP citizens to liberty of movement and freedom to choose the place of temporary and permanent residence within GPE ( no . CARDINAL-I , adopted on DATE , hereafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) guarantees the right for NORP citizens to liberty of movement and freedom to choose their place of residence but requires a person to apply for residence registration at a new address within DATE of moving ( Sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ) . This is done by submitting an identity document , an application form and a document showing the legal basis for residence at the indicated address , such as a rent contract or the consent of the flat - owner ( LAW for registration of temporary and permanent residence of NORP citizens , no . CARDINAL , of CARDINAL DATE ) . For more details , please , see PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ORG DATE ... ) .", "Furthermore , LAW stipulates that cancellation of a registration at a previous place of residence is carried out by the relevant bodies , either upon a citizen \u2019s application for a registration at a new place of residence or upon his application for cancellation of registration at the previous place of residence . If by the time of registration at a new place of residence , he or she has not cancelled the registration at the previous place of residence , the registration authority ( at the new place of residence ) is under an obligation to notify , within DATE , the registration authority at the person \u2019s previous place of residence so that it can be cancelled ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
