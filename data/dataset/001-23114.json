LATVIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are \u201c permanently resident non - citizens \u201d of GPE , born in DATE and DATE respectively and living in GPE ( GPE ) . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE the NORP ORG sold to a certain O.A.R. a plot of land CARDINAL sq . m in area with a semi - detached DATE house , located in PERSON ( in the suburbs of GPE ) . After O.A.R. \u2019s death in DATE , the property passed to his daughter , GPE", "In DATE fear of NORP persecution forced GPE to go into exile in the LOC and abandon her property . The house was also considerably damaged during DATE .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the executive committee of ORG granted the right to use the above - mentioned land to Colonel PERSON ( the applicants\u2019 father ) and Lieutenant Colonel PERSON , and calculated the actual value of the building on it . On DATE Mr S. and PERSON purchased the house by paying the tax authorities the sum of MONEY . In DATE and B. rebuilt the house .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the municipal authorities granted PERSON definitive right to use the land . However , on DATE those authorities divided the land into CARDINAL parts , CARDINAL of which were allocated to PERSON the third of which was placed in public ownership .", "On DATE the municipality \u2019s executive council divided the house into CARDINAL parts and registered them as CARDINAL separate properties with different numbers . The title to CARDINAL of the parts was granted to the heirs of PERSON , who had died DATE ; title to the other CARDINAL was granted to PERSON \u2019s former wife .", "In DATE the applicants were recognised as the heirs to equal portions of their ORG estate .", "On DATE after GPE had regained its independence , ORG padome ) enacted the PERSON on the Return of Real Estate to ORG ( NORP \u201c ORG nam\u012bpa\u0161umu atdo\u0161anu likum\u012bgajiem \u012bpa\u0161niekiem \u201d ) .", "On DATE , in response to an application by O.A.R. \u2019s grandson , ORG restored ownership of the land in issue to ORG That decision did not , however , cover the buildings erected on the land .", "In DATE A.R. asked ORG to set aside all the decisions taken in relation to the semi - detached house during the NORP period and recognise him as the legitimate owner .", "In a judgment of DATE delivered after adversarial proceedings ORG allowed PERSON \u2019s application . The ORG noted first of all that although the house in issue had never been formally expropriated , it was covered by section CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Return of Real Estate to ORG , which excluded property abandoned for fear of persecution from the category of res nullius ( the property of nobody ) . The taking of possession of the property by the NORP local authorities in DATE had therefore been arbitrary and illegal , especially as it had not been based on any judicial decision . Furthermore , ORG pointed out that section CARDINAL of the aforementioned law precluded the return of items of property sold to private individuals acting in good faith by means of contracts certified by a notary . However , it noted that there had been no such contract in the instant case . Lastly , ORG rejected the ORG argument that the disputed house had been completely rebuilt by their father and was in fact a new item of property . In that connection , the ORG considered on the basis of the evidence produced that the repairs carried out ( the replacement of doors , windows and roofing and repairs to some of the walls ) were not sufficient to warrant the assertion that the initial building no longer existed and that PERSON had built a new house . Consequently , ORG declared the decision of CARDINAL DATE and all subsequent measures relating to the building null and void and ordered that it be returned to A.R.", "The applicants appealed against that judgment to ORG of ORG , which , in a judgment delivered on DATE following adversarial proceedings , dismissed PERSON \u2019s application on the ground that the documents he had submitted were not sufficient to prove O.A.R. \u2019s title to the disputed house .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL March CARDINAL ORG , ruling on an appeal on points of law lodged by PERSON , quashed the aforementioned judgment and remitted the case to ORG . According to ORG , as a building was in principle an adjunct to the land on which it was built , the house in question should , in the absence of any evidence to the contrary , have been considered to have belonged to the owner of the land , namely O.A.R.", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of ORG allowed PERSON \u2019s application . Having established that the semi - detached house had indisputably belonged to O.A.R. , ORG ruled as follows :", "\u201c ...

No judgment was adopted regarding a res nullius . ...", "... [ T]he ORG considers that by taking possession of the disputed property without paying any compensation and by making use of it subsequently , the municipality infringed the rights of the legitimate owner and adopted a policy of administrative arbitrariness .", "Under section CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Return of Real Estate to ORG , no court order can be made for the return of items of property acquired against payment by natural persons acting in good faith and on the basis of contracts certified by a notary .", "The file does not contain any evidence that the property came into the ownership of [ S. ] and [ B. ] on the basis of an official conveyance certified by a notary . ...", "That being so , ORG considers that [ B. ] and [ S. ] can not be regarded as purchasers acting in good faith within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Return of Real Estate to ORG . ...", "Since [ S. ] can not be deemed to have purchased the house in good faith , ORG considers the certificate of succession to the estate issued to PERSON [ and ] PERSON ... to be null and void ... \u201d", "The applicants appealed on points of law against the above judgment cited above to ORG of ORG .

SKC-CARDINAL ) ORG held that a decision taken by the municipal authorities in DATE whereby a private individual was granted title to an expropriated house provided that he paid a sum to the tax authorities corresponding to the value of the building was equivalent to a \u201c contract certified by a notary \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the PERSON .", "The relevant provisions of the NORP Civil Code ( Latvijas PERSON ) read as follows :", "\u201c The claimant must prove that he has title .
