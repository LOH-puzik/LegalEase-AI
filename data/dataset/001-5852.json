{"ITEMID": "001-5852", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "HARRISON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , born in DATE and living in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Mr M. Murdoch , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a Romany traveller or gypsy . In DATE she purchased her plot of land at CARDINAL FAC , GPE , GPE and since then she has lived in a caravan or caravans on the plot with her aged mother and the applicant 's CARDINAL grandchildren who attend local schools . The applicant 's mother suffers from poor health and requires constant attention . She has lived in caravans all her life . The applicant at the time of introducing the applicant had employment in a local supermarket , but herself also has difficulty reading and writing . A number of other gypsy families lived in caravans in adjacent sites . PERSON had been used by gypsies for DATE and the group resident there were known as the \u201c Dudmoor gypsies \u201d .", "The applicant 's request to ORG ( the \u201c Council \u201d ) for planning permission to station her caravans on her land was refused sometime in DATE . The reasons given for the refusal were :", "CARDINAL . NORP that the site fell within an area designated as LOC and was therefore contrary to LOC ;", "CARDINAL . NORP that a residential caravan as proposed was considered to be visually damaging to the landscape and was therefore contrary to LOC ;", "CARDINAL . NORP that the proposed development would be contrary to the provisions of ORG as adopted by ORG for this area , and", "CARDINAL . NORP that , whilst the foul water drainage arrangements were considered to be adequate for the proposed development , the ORG was concerned about the proliferation of such facilities in the immediately surrounding area which might ultimately cause environmental problems and necessitate a marine drainage scheme .", "An enforcement notice was issued on DATE concluding that there had been a breach of planning control due to a material change of use of land from uncultivated and uninhabited land to use for stationing a caravan for the purposes of human habitation . The notice required that the land be reverted to former use as uncultivated and uninhabited land by removing the caravan from the land within DATE .", "An appeal was made to the Secretary of ORG for the Environment against the refusal of planning permission ( under section CARDINAL of ORG DATE as amended by ORG DATE ) and the enforcement notice ( under PERSON CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) and ( h ) of ORG DATE as amended ) . An Inspector was appointed and he held a local public inquiry into the appeals on CARDINAL and DATE . Having visited the site and having heard submissions for the applicant , the ORG and third parties , the Inspector concluded that there was a \u201c small but identifiable need for accommodation in the area \u201d . However in respect to the impact of the unauthorised development , the ORG stated :", "\u201c The buildings , caravans and rectangular shaped plots are out of keeping with the area and considerably detract from its rural character and appearance ... [ T]hey have , in my opinion , a suburban appearance , quite alien in this setting , that unacceptably harms the visual quality of the area and serves to undermine the aims and application of the prevailing restrictive policies . \u201d", "Placing considerable weight on the serious harm that the sites caused to the area and the strong policy and amenity objections to the site , the Inspector concluded that on balance the use of the sites should not continue . Recognising that the applicant had local links of some longstanding to the extent that she was considered to be \u201c resident in the area \u201d , the Inspector concluded that the question of proliferation and precedent were of particular importance given that , if the present appeal were allowed , future requests would be difficult to refuse . As a result , the ORG found that the appeal should be dismissed and , recommending that the enforcement notice should be upheld , he proposed extending the period for compliance to DATE .", "The Secretary of ORG accepted the ORG 's recommendations on DATE and his conclusion that the appearance of the appeal sites was \u201c out of character with the generally rural nature of the area \u201d . He acknowledged that there was a need to provide accommodation for travelling families in GPE , but considered that in this case the objections put forward against the proposal outweighed that need . Furthermore , the Secretary of ORG reiterated the conclusions of the ORG in relation to the proposal to develop the area for leisure activities , in particular that although this development would substantially alter the area , he did not believe that the proposal would be incompatible with the status of the area as GPE , nor would it erode its visual qualities or conflict with its amenity value . The Secretary of ORG also agreed with the extension of the period for compliance on the grounds that the applicant had nowhere else to go .", "An offer of sites at PERSON was made to the applicant and other gypsies in or DATE . It was considered by them to be unacceptable . While the applicant 's husband moved to the site after separating from her , she did not believe that he stayed DATE . Her son took his wife and family to PERSON after she had been scared by council officials but had only stayed there DATE .", "In DATE , complaints were made by the applicant and her neighbours to the ORG Ombudsman alleging that ORG had not fulfilled its statutory obligations to them and that it had not dealt properly with their proposals for resolving the situation .", "By letter dated DATE , the ORG noted that ORG had been attempting to find alternative sites for the complainants for DATE and had offered a number of solutions which the complainants had refused . She concluded :", "\u201c Having considered the evidence , I am not persuaded that ORG have failed in their statutory duty to provide adequate accommodation for [ the complainants ] . I am more inclined to commend the ORG for the considerable efforts that they made to try and ensure that [ the complainants ] were able to remain in GPE . ... The offers of accommodation which the ORG made ... appear to me to be reasonable and consistent with their statutory obligations . \u201d", "Proceedings were instituted in ORG by the ORG in DATE and they resulted in an injunction being made on DATE that the applicant remove her caravan from her land by DATE . The applicant sought to vary this order by extending the time for compliance pending the decision by ORG in GPE v GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . This application was opposed by the ORG and ORG dismissed the application on DATE on the ground that the injunction was a final order under LAW DATE and the judge had no power to alter it .", "Subsequent appeal to ORG was available , but the applicant declined to appeal on the advice that such an appeal was bound to fail . In DATE , the ORG made an application to commit the applicant for contempt of court . On DATE , ORG dismissed the order for committal against the applicant and ordered costs in her favour . By letter dated DATE , the applicant 's solicitor informed ORG that the application for committal failed on a technicality , namely , that the local authority had failed to ensure that the documentation was adequately and properly served on the applicant .", "The ORG recommenced proceedings in ORG . An order was made by consent under which the applicant was given DATE to vacate the land . ORG had given notice that they were prepared to re - open a former gypsy site for the applicant and others . DATE in the order was renewable until the site opened .", "In DATE , the site at PERSON was inspected by the applicant and others with representatives of ORG . The applicant stated that the warden 's office had been destroyed by vandalism and fire ; no site warden had been appointed ; the site itself was in very poor condition and , when transient gypsy families left , reoccupation of their vacated sites was not being permitted . She alleged that there was a general consensus that she and the other gypsies could not be reasonably expected to move from a rural location to a site which was the equivalent of an inner city sink estate .", "The applicant 's further application for planning permission , along with other Dudmoor gypsies who occupied adjacent sites , concerning altogether CARDINAL residential caravans , CARDINAL touring caravans and associated structures , was refused by ORG during DATE .", "A public local inquiry concerning their appeals was held before an Inspector on CARDINAL and DATE .", "In his report dated DATE , the ORG stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL It is a matter of agreement that the appeal site and the surrounding area is within the Green Belt and the proposal is contrary to LOC policies of the statutory and emerging ORG for the area .", "CARDINAL LOC area is remote , being accessed over a long partly unmade country lane , but there are views over it from the adjacent PERSON which is a popular recreation area . Despite a scatter of buildings the area retains a predominantly rural appearance .", "CARDINAL NORP In my view the cluster of mobile homes the subject of this appeal form an obtrusive feature , harmful to the predominantly rural character and appearance of the area particularly when viewed from PERSON and from FAC . Despite the long history of the plots , screening has not been effective and in my view the mobile homes are not acceptable in terms of gypsy sites or affordable housing .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL earlier appeals in DATE and DATE were dismissed and efforts to relocate the appellants and others have been going on since DATE . A number of other gypsies have been relocated .", "CARDINAL NORP Despite the appellants ' protestations that the alternative sites offered were either unsuitable or unavailable , it seems to me that the evidence of the considerable efforts made to relocate them is much stronger . This was recognised by ORG in DATE and I find no reason to disagree with his findings .", "CARDINAL NORP The resident gypsies are acknowledged to be hard working families and there is no animosity towards them from local people . However there have been problems arising from the use of the plots as transit sites .", "QUANTITY NORP I am mindful of the disturbance and stress likely to be caused to the appellants and their relatives , particularly the very old , the frail and the young . However , in all the circumstances of this case I conclude that this is not sufficient to justify setting aside the Green Belt and country protection policies ... or outweigh the harm the presence of the mobile homes do to the predominantly rural character and appearance of this area ... \u201d", "In his letter of DATE , the Secretary of ORG for the Environment accepted the ORG 's recommendation to refuse the appeals . He considered that considerable efforts had been made to find alternatives for the applicant , including reasonable offers of accommodation at PERSON which were not taken up . He noted that the applicant had stated that she would move to the FAC site ( temporarily closed ) if that was reopened under suitable conditions and in a suitable state of repair .", "Offers of sites at ORG and GPE were made to the applicant . She refused them as inappropriate and unacceptable , as they were outside the GPE area with which she had long associations and where she had employment and her children had schools . There was no direct public transport and she could not drive .", "ORG as amended by ORG DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG 's decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "Again there is a further right of appeal on a point of law to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector 's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "The purpose of ORG and the operation of the policy to protect them is set out in the national policy document FAC ( DATE ) .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Government attaches great importance to GPE , which have been an essential element of planning policy for DATE . ...", "CARDINAL . The fundamental aim of LOC policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open ; the most important attribute of ORG is their openness . Green Belts can shape patterns of urban development at sub - regional and regional scale , and help to ensure that development occurs in locations allocated in development plans . They help to protect the countryside , be it in agricultural , forestry or other use . They can assist in moving towards more sustainable patterns of urban development .", "CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL purposes in GPE :", "\u2013 to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built - up areas ;", "\u2013 to prevent neighbouring towns from merging into one another ;", "\u2013 to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment ;", "\u2013 to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns ; and", "\u2013 to assist in urban regeneration by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land . ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The essential characteristic of GPE is their permanence . Their protection must be maintained as far as can be seen ahead . ...", "CARDINAL . The general policies controlling development in the countryside apply with equal force in Green Belts but there is , in addition , a general presumption against inappropriate development within them . Such development should not be approved , except in very special circumstances . ...", "CARDINAL . Inappropriate development is , by definition , harmful to LOC . It is for the applicant to show why permission should be granted . Very special circumstances to justify inappropriate development will not exist unless the harm by reason of inappropriateness , and any other harm , is clearly outweighed by other considerations . In view of the presumption against inappropriate development , the Secretary of ORG will attach substantial weight to the harm to the Green Belt when considering any planning application or appeal concerning such development . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
