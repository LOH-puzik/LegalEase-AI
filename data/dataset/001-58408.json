He was asked to tell the interviewers about the break - up of his marriage , whether he had extra - marital affairs , about his and his wife \u2019s sex life including their having protected sex and about their financial situation . He was also questioned on the cycling holiday , about a male colleague and the latter \u2019s sexual orientation .

The applicant also requested time to think and to take legal advice . The interview was adjourned at TIME", "CARDINAL . The applicant then took advice from a solicitor and his accommodation was searched . The interview recommenced at TIME with the applicant \u2019s solicitor and an observer present . Despite being pressed with numerous questions , the applicant answered \u201c no comment \u201d to most of the questions posed . Given the applicant \u2019s responses , his lawyer was asked what advice had been given to the applicant . The applicant \u2019s digital diary was taken from him .

The applicant continued to respond \u201c no comment \u201d . It was explained to the applicant \u2019s solicitor that the service attitude in relation to investigations involving acts of alleged homosexuality did not warrant the provision of legal advice and that the applicant \u2019s solicitor was only delaying matters . The investigators also mentioned that it was a security matter which they would not detail further since his solicitor did not have security clearance , but that the applicant should not be surprised if some counter - intelligence people came to talk to him and that there would be no legal advice for that .", "The applicant requested time to speak to his lawyer and the interview was interrupted at TIME The applicant then spoke to his lawyer and asked to think about matters TIME .", "CARDINAL . The interview recommenced at TIME on DATE with the same investigators and an observer , but the applicant did not require a solicitor . The applicant admitted his homosexuality almost immediately and confirmed that the reason he denied it at first was that he was not clear about the position as regards the retention of certain accumulated benefits on discharge and he was concerned about his family \u2019s financial position in that eventuality . However , he had since discovered that his discharge would be administrative and that he would get his terminal benefits , so he could be honest .", "The applicant was questioned further about a person called \u201c PERSON , whether his wife knew he was homosexual , whether a male colleague was homosexual and when he had \u201c come out \u201d . He was asked whether he was a practising homosexual , but he declined to give the name of his current partner , at which stage it was explained to him that the service had to verify his admission of homosexuality to avoid fraudulent attempts at early discharge . He was then questioned about his first homosexual relationship ( he confirmed that it began in DATE ) , his homosexual partners ( past and present ) , who they were , where they worked , how old they were , how the applicant met them and about the nature of his relationship with them , including the type of sex they had .", "During this interview , the personal items taken from the applicant were produced and the applicant was questioned about , inter alia , the contents of his digital diary , a photograph , a torn envelope and a letter from the applicant to his current partner . He was questioned further about when he first realised he was homosexual , who knew about his sexual orientation , his relationship with his wife ( including their sexual relationship ) , what his wife thought about his homosexuality , his HIV status and again about the nature of his sexual relationships with his homosexual partners . The interview terminated at TIME", "CARDINAL . The investigators prepared a report on DATE . In his certificate of qualifications and reference on discharge dated DATE , the applicant was described as a loyal serviceman and a conscientious and hard worker who could be relied upon to achieve the highest standards . It was also noted that he had displayed sound personal qualities and integrity throughout his service and had enjoyed the respect of his superiors , peers and subordinates alike . The applicant was administratively discharged with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Along with Mr PERSON and PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicants obtained leave to apply for judicial review of the decisions to discharge them from the armed forces . The applicants argued that the policy of ORG against homosexuals in the armed forces was \u201c irrational \u201d , that it was in breach of the LAW and that it was contrary to LAW . ORG maintained that the policy was necessary mainly to maintain morale and unit effectiveness , in view of the loco parentis role of the services as regards minor recruits and in light of the requirement of communal living in the armed forces .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application for judicial review , Lord Justice PERSON giving the main judgment of the court . He noted that the cases illustrated the hardships resulting from the absolute policy against homosexuals in the armed forces and that all CARDINAL of the applicants had exemplary service records , some with reports written in glowing terms . Moreover , he found that in none of the cases before him was it suggested that the applicants\u2019 sexual orientation had in any way affected their ability to carry out their work or had any ill - effect on discipline . There was no reason to doubt that , but for their discharge on the sole ground of sexual orientation , they would have continued to perform their service duties entirely efficiently and with the continued support of their colleagues . All were devastated by their discharge .", "PERSON reviewed the background to the \u201c age - old \u201d policy , the relevance of ORG report of DATE , the position in other armed forces around the world , the arguments of ORG ( noting that the security argument was no longer of substantial concern to the government ) together with the applicants\u2019 arguments against the policy . He considered that the balance of argument clearly lay with the applicants , describing the applicants\u2019 submissions in favour of a conduct - based code as \u201c powerful \u201d . In his view , the tide of history was against ORG . He further observed that it was improbable , whatever ORG would say , that the policy could survive for much longer and added , \u201c I doubt whether most of those present in court throughout the proceedings now believe otherwise . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , having considered arguments as to the test to be applied in the context of these judicial review proceedings , PERSON concluded that the conventional ORG principles , adapted to a human rights context , should be applied .", "Accordingly , where fundamental human rights were being restricted , the Minister of Defence needed to show that there was an important competing interest to justify the restriction . The primary decision was for him and the secondary judgment of the court amounted to asking whether a reasonable Minister , on the material before him , could have reasonably made that primary judgment . He later clarified that it was only if the purported justification \u201c outrageously defies logic or accepted moral standards \u201d that the court could strike down the Minister \u2019s decision . He noted that within the limited scope of that review , the court had to be scrupulous to ensure that no recognised ground of challenge was in truth available to an applicant before rejecting the application . When the most fundamental human rights are threatened , the court would not , for example , be inclined to overlook some minor flaw in the decision - making process , or to adopt a particularly benevolent view of the Minister \u2019s evidence , or to exercise its discretion to withhold relief . However , he emphasised that , even where the most fundamental human rights were being restricted , \u201c the threshold of unreasonableness is not lowered \u201d .", "It was clear that the Secretary of ORG had cited an important competing public interest . But the central question was whether it was reasonable for the Secretary of ORG to take the view that allowing homosexuals into the forces would imperil that interest . He pointed out that , although he might have considered the Minister wrong ,", "\u201c \u2026 [ the courts ] owe a duty ... to remain within their constitutional bounds and not trespass beyond them . Only if it were plain beyond sensible argument that no conceivable damage could be done to the armed services as a fighting unit would it be appropriate for this court now to remove the issue entirely from the hands of both the military and of the government . If the Convention \u2026 were part of our law and we were accordingly entitled to ask whether the policy answers a pressing social need and whether the restriction on human rights involved can be shown proportionate to the benefits then clearly the primary judgment \u2026 would be for us and not others : the constitutional balance would shift . But that is not the position . In exercising merely a secondary judgment , this court is bound to act with some reticence . Our approach must reflect , not overlook , where responsibility ultimately lies for the defence of the realm and recognise too that ORG is exercising a continuing supervision over this area of prerogative power . \u201d", "Accordingly , while the Minister \u2019s suggested justification for the ban may have seemed \u201c unconvincing \u201d , the Minister \u2019s stand could not properly be said to be unlawful . It followed that the applications had to be rejected \u201c albeit with hesitation and regret \u201d . A brief analysis of the Convention \u2019s case - law led the judge to comment that he strongly suspected that , as far as GPE obligations were concerned , DATE of the policy were numbered .", "CARDINAL . Simon Brown LJ also found that the Equal Treatment Directive was not applicable to discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and that the domestic courts could not rule on Convention matters . He also observed that GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and the GPE permitted homosexuals to serve in their armed forces and that the evidence indicated that the only countries operating a blanket ban were GPE and GPE ( and , possibly , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a consultation paper was circulated by ORG to \u201c management \u201d levels in the armed forces relating to ORG policy against homosexuals in those forces . The covering letter circulating this paper pointed out that the \u201c Minister for ORG has decided that evidence is to be gathered within ORG in support of the current policy on homosexuality \u201d . It was indicated that the case was likely to progress to the NORP courts and that the applicants in the judicial review proceedings had argued that ORG position was \u201c bereft of factual evidence \u201d but that this was not surprising since evidence was difficult to amass given that homosexuals were not permitted to serve . Since \u201c this should not be allowed to weaken the arguments for maintaining the policy \u201d , the addressees of the letter were invited to comment on the consultation paper and \u201c to provide any additional evidence in support of the current policy by DATE \u201d . The consultation paper attached referred , inter alia , to CARDINAL incidents which were considered damaging to unit cohesion . The first involved a homosexual who had had a relationship with a sergeant \u2019s mess waiter and the other involved an NORP on secondment whose behaviour was described as \u201c so disruptive \u201d that his attachment was terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal . The Master of the Rolls , Sir PERSON , delivered the main judgment ( with which the CARDINAL other judges of ORG agreed ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the court \u2019s approach to the issue of \u201c irrationality \u201d , he considered that the following submission was an accurate distillation of the relevant jurisprudence on the subject :", "\u201c the court may not interfere with the exercise of an administrative discretion on substantive grounds save where the court is satisfied that the decision is unreasonable in the sense that it is beyond the range of responses open to a reasonable decision - maker . But in judging whether the decision - maker has exceeded this margin of appreciation the human rights context is important . The more substantial the interference with human rights , the more the court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable in the sense outlined above . \u201d", "He went on to quote from , inter alia , the judgment of FAC in NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Appeal Cases CARDINAL , where it was pointed out that :", "\u201c the primary judgment as to whether the particular competing public interest justifies the particular restriction imposed falls to be made by the Secretary of ORG to whom ORG has entrusted the discretion . But we are entitled to exercise a secondary judgment by asking whether a reasonable Secretary of ORG , on the material before him , could reasonably make that primary judgment . \u201d", "Moreover , he considered that the greater the policy content of the decision , and the more remote the subject matter of a decision from ordinary judicial experience , the more hesitant the court had to be in holding a decision to be irrational .", "CARDINAL . Prior to applying this test of irrationality , the Master of the Rolls noted that the case concerned innate qualities of a very personal kind , that the decisions of which the applicants complained had had a profound effect on their careers and prospects and that the applicants\u2019 rights as human beings were very much in issue . While the domestic court was not the primary decision - maker and while it was not the role of the courts to regulate the conditions of service in the armed forces , \u201c it has the constitutional role and duty of ensuring that the rights of citizens are not abused by the unlawful exercise of executive power . While the court must properly defer to the expertise of responsible decision - makers , it must not shrink from its fundamental duty to \u2018 do right to all manner of people\u2019 \u2026 \u201d .", "CARDINAL . He then reviewed , by reference to the test of irrationality outlined above , the submissions of the parties in favour of and against the policy , commenting that the applicants\u2019 arguments were \u201c of very considerable cogency \u201d which called to be considered in depth with particular reference to past experience in GPE , to the developing experience of other countries and to the potential effectiveness of a detailed prescriptive code in place of the present blanket ban . However , he concluded that the policy could not be considered \u201c irrational \u201d at the time the applicants were discharged from the armed forces , finding that the threshold of irrationality was \u201c a high one \u201d and that it had not been crossed in this case .", "CARDINAL . On the Convention , the Master of the Rolls noted as follows :", "\u201c It is , inevitably , common ground that GPE obligation , binding in international law , to respect and ensure compliance with [ LAW ] is not one that is enforceable by domestic courts . The relevance of the LAW in the present context is as background to the complaint of irrationality . The fact that a decision - maker failed to take account of LAW when exercising an administrative discretion is not of itself a ground for impugning the exercise of that discretion . \u201d", "He observed that to dismiss a person from his or her employment on the grounds of a private sexual preference , and to interrogate him or her about private sexual behaviour , would not appear to show respect for that person \u2019s private and family life and that there might be room for argument as to whether the policy answered a \u201c pressing social need \u201d and , in particular , was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued . However , he held that these were not questions to which answers could be properly or usefully proffered by ORG but rather were questions for ORG , to which court the applicants might have to pursue their claim . He further accepted that ORG did not apply to complaints in relation to sexual orientation .", "CARDINAL . PERSON of ORG agreed with the judgment of the Master of the Rolls and , in particular , with the latter \u2019s approach to the irrationality test and with his view on the inability of the court to resolve Convention issues . He questioned the utility of a debate as to the likely fate of the \u201c longstanding \u201d policy of ORG before ORG with which the primary adjudicating role on the Convention lay . ORG did not entertain \u201c hypothetical questions \u201d . In PERSON view , the only relevance of the ORG was as \u201c background to the complaint of irrationality \u201d , which point had been already made by the Master of the Rolls . It was important to highlight this point since ORG had not given the domestic courts primary jurisdiction over human rights issues contained in the ORG and because the evidence and submissions before ORG related to that court \u2019s secondary jurisdiction and not to its primary jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . PERSON of ORG agreed with both preceding judgments and , in particular , with the views expressed on the rationality test to be applied and on its application in the particular case . The applicants\u2019 arguments that their rights under LAW had been breached were \u201c persuasive \u201d but the evidence and arguments that would ultimately determine that issue were not before ORG . He also found that the ORG challenge to the arguments in support of the policy was \u201c completely persuasive \u201d and added that what impressed him most in relation to the merits was the complete absence of illustration and substantiation by specific examples , not only in the Secretary of ORG \u2019s evidence filed in ORG , but also in the case presented to ORG in DATE . The policy was , in his view , \u201c ripe for review and for consideration of its replacement by a strict conduct code \u201d . However , the applicants\u2019 attack on the Secretary of ORG \u2019s rationality fell \u201c a long way short of success \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . At or around the time the applicants lodged their applications for leave to take judicial review proceedings , they also instituted proceedings before ORG alleging discrimination contrary to LAW DATE . The latter proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of the judicial review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicants confirmed to ORG that they had requested the withdrawal of ORG proceedings given the outcome of the judicial review proceedings and other intervening jurisprudence of the domestic courts and of the ECJ .", "CARDINAL .

In most circumstances , however , the interests of the individual and the armed forces will be best served by formal investigation of the allegations or suspicion .

ORG , ex parte Smith and Others CARDINAL Weekly Law Reports CARDINAL , ORG ( \u201c HPAT \u201d ) was established by ORG in order to undertake an internal assessment of the armed forces\u2019 policy on homosexuality . The ORG was composed of ORG civil servants and representatives of the CARDINAL services . The ORG \u2019s assessment was to form the basis of the ORG \u2019s evidence to the next ORG ( as confirmed in the affidavit of ORG Marshal Sir PERSON referred to at paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The ORG was to consult ORG , the armed forces\u2019 personnel of all ranks , service and civilian staff responsible for carrying out the policy together with members of the legal adviser \u2019s staff . It was also to examine the policies of other nations ( Annex D to the ORG report ) .", "The report of the ORG was published in DATE and ran to CARDINAL pages , together with voluminous annexes . The starting - point of the assessment was an assumption that homosexual men and women were in themselves no less physically capable , brave , dependable and skilled than heterosexuals . It was considered that any problems to be identified would lie in the difficulties which integration of declared homosexuals would pose to the military system which was largely staffed by heterosexuals . The ORG considered that the best predictors of the \u201c reality and severity \u201d of the problems of the integration of homosexuals would be the service personnel themselves ( paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . There were CARDINAL main areas of investigation ( paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) :", "( a ) The ORG consulted with policy - makers in ORG . The latter emphasised the uniqueness of the military environment and the distinctly NORP approach to service life and the ORG found little disagreement with this general perspective from the service people it interviewed ( paragraph CARDINAL ) ;", "( b ) A signal was sent to all members of the services , including the reserve forces , requesting any written views on the issues . By DATE the ORG had received CARDINAL letters . CARDINAL of these letters were against any change in the policy , CARDINAL of which were multiply signed . CARDINAL of those letters were anonymous ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) ;", "( c ) The ORG attitude survey consisted of a questionnaire administered to a total of CARDINAL service personnel chosen as representative of the services . The questionnaires were administered in examination - type conditions and were to be completed anonymously . The results indicated that there was \u201c overwhelming support across the services \u201d for the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces . Service personnel viewed homosexuality as clearly more acceptable in civilian than in service life ( paragraphs CARDINAL and ORG ) ;", "( d ) During the ORG \u2019s visit to CARDINAL military bases in DATE in order to administer the above questionnaire , individual one - to - CARDINAL interviews were conducted with personnel who had completed the attitude questionnaire . CARDINAL interviewees randomly selected from certain ranks and occupational areas were selected from each of the CARDINAL units visited . Given the small number of interviewees , the responses were analysed qualitatively rather than quantitatively ( Annex G ) ;", "( e ) A number of single - service focus group discussions were held with randomly selected personnel from representative ranks and functions ( ORG refers to CARDINAL such discussions whereas paragraph CARDINAL of the report refers to CARDINAL ) . The purpose of the group discussions was to examine the breadth and depth of military views and to provide insights that would complement the survey results . The ORG commented that the nature of the discussions showed little reticence in honestly and fully putting forward views ; there was an \u201c overwhelming view that homosexuality was not \u2018 normal\u2019 or \u2018 natural\u2019 whereas women and ethnic minorities were \u2018 normal\u2019 \u201d . The vast majority of participants believed that the present ban on homosexuals should remain ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and ORG ) ;", "( f ) CARDINAL sub - team of the ORG went to GPE , GPE and GPE and the other visited GPE , GPE and the GPE . The ORG interviewed an eminent NORP military psychologist since the NORP military would not accept the ORG visit ( paragraphs CARDINAL and ORG ) . It is also apparent that the ORG spoke to representatives of the police , the fire service and the merchant navy ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) ;", "( g ) ORG - service regional focus discussion groups were also held to examine the breadth and depth of the personnel \u2019s views . The groups were drawn from the CARDINAL services and from different units . CARDINAL such discussion groups were held and overall the results were the same as those from the single - service focus groups ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and ORG ) ;", "( h ) ORG single - service attitude surveys were also completed by a randomly selected sample of personnel stratified by rank , age and gender . The surveys were distributed to CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) of ORG and ORG personnel , to CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) of the ORG personnel and to CARDINAL ( PERCENT ) of the ORG personnel . On CARDINAL of the surveys were returned ( paragraphs CARDINAL and ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG report defined \u201c fighting power \u201d ( often used interchangeably with combat effectiveness , operational efficiency or operational effectiveness ) as the \u201c ability to fight \u201d which is in turn made up of CARDINAL components . These are the \u201c conceptual \u201d and \u201c physical \u201d components together with the \u201c moral component \u201d , the latter being defined as \u201c the ability to get people to fight including morale , comradeship , motivation , leadership and management \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The focus throughout the assessment was upon the anticipated effects on fighting power and this was found to be the \u201c key problem \u201d in integrating homosexuals into the armed forces . It was considered well - established that the presence of known or strongly suspected homosexuals in the armed forces would produce certain behavioural and emotional responses and problems which would affect morale and , in turn , significantly and negatively affect the fighting power of the armed forces .", "These anticipated problems included controlling homosexual behaviour and heterosexual animosity , assaults on homosexuals , bullying and harassment of homosexuals , ostracism and avoidance , \u201c cliquishness \u201d and pairing , leadership and decision - making problems including allegations of favouritism , discrimination and ineffectiveness ( but excluding the question of homosexual officers taking tactical decisions swayed by sexual preference ) , sub - cultural friction , privacy / decency issues , increased dislike and suspicions ( polarised relationships ) , and resentment over imposed change especially if controls on heterosexual expression also had to be tightened ( see Section F.II of the report ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also assessed other matters it described as \u201c subsidiary \u201d ( Section G and paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) . It found that , while cost implications of changing the policy were not quantifiable , it was not considered that separate accommodation for homosexuals would be warranted or wise and , accordingly , major expenditures on accommodation were considered unlikely ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Wasted training as regards discharged homosexuals was not considered to be a significant argument against maintaining the policy ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Should the wider social and legal position change in relation to civilian homosexual couples , then entitlements for homosexual partners would have to be accepted ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Large amounts of money or time were unlikely to be devoted to homosexual awareness training , given that it was unlikely to be effective in changing attitudes . It was remarked that , if required , tolerance training would probably be best addressed as \u201c part of an integrated programme for equal opportunities training in the military \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . There were strong indications that recruitment and retention rates would go down if there was a change in policy ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Concerns expressed about the fulfilment of the forces\u2019 loco parentis responsibilities for young recruits were found not to stand up to close examination ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Medical and security concerns were considered separately ( Sections H and I , respectively , and paragraph CARDINAL of the report ) . While it was noted that medical concerns of personnel ( in relation to , inter alia , Aids ) were disproportionate to the clinical risks involved , it was considered that these concerns would probably need to be met with education packages and compulsory Aids testing . Otherwise , real acceptance and integration of homosexuals would be seriously prejudiced by emotional reactions and resentments and by concerns about the threat of Aids . The security issues ( including the possibility of blackmail of those suspected of being homosexual ) raised in defence of the policy were found not to stand up to close examination .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observed that there were a wide variety of official positions and legal arrangements evolving from local legal and political circumstances and ranging from a formal prohibition of all homosexual activity ( GPE ) , to administrative arrangements falling short of real equality ( GPE and GPE ) , to a deliberate policy to create an armed force friendly to homosexuals ( the GPE ) . According to the ORG , those countries which had no legal ban on homosexuals were more tolerant , had written constitutions and therefore a greater tradition of respect for human rights . The report continued :", "\u201c But nowhere did ORG learn that there were significant numbers of open homosexuals serving in ORG . Whatever the degree of official toleration or encouragement , informal pressures or threats within the military social system appeared to prevent the vast majority of homosexuals from choosing to exercise their varying legal rights to open expression of their active sexual identity in a professional setting . \u2026 It goes without saying that the continuing reticence of military homosexuals in these armed forces means that there has been little practical experience of protecting them against ostracism , harassment or physical attack .", "Since this common pattern of a near absence of openly homosexual personnel occurs irrespective of the formal legal frameworks , it is reasonable to assume that it is the informal functioning of actual military systems which is largely incompatible with homosexual self - expression . This is entirely consistent with the pattern of NORP service personnel \u2019s attitudes confirmed by the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE there were over CARDINAL NORP service personnel ( PERCENT approximately of the NORP armed forces ) deployed overseas on operations , more than any other ORG country in LOC ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG concluded , nevertheless , that the policy had not presented significant problems when working with the armed forces of allied nations . The ORG remarked that NORP service personnel had shown a \u201c robust indifference \u201d to arrangements in foreign forces and no concern over what degree of acceptance closely integrated allies give to homosexuals . This is because the average service person considers that those others \u201c are not NORP , have different standards , and are thus only to be expected to do things differently \u201d and because personnel from different nations are accommodated apart . It was also due to the fact that homosexuals in foreign forces , where they were not formally banned , were not open about their sexual orientation . Consequently , the chances were small of the few open homosexuals happening to be in a situation where their sexual orientation would become a problem with NORP service personnel ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Important differences were considered by the ORG to exist between the armed forces and civilian disciplined services in GPE including the police , the fire brigade and the merchant navy which did not operate the same policy against homosexuals . It considered that :", "\u201c None of these occupations involves the same unremittingly demanding and long - term working environment as ORG , or requires the same emphasis on building rapidly interchangeable , but fiercely committed and self - supporting teams , capable of retaining their cohesion after DATE of stress , casualties and discomfort \u2026 \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . Alternative options were considered by the ORG including a code of conduct applicable to all , a policy based on the individual qualities of homosexual personnel , lifting the ban and relying on service personnel reticence , the \u201c do n\u2019t ask , do n\u2019t tell \u201d solution offered by the GPE and a \u201c no open homosexuality \u201d code . It concluded that no policy alternative could be identified which avoided risks for fighting power with the same certainty as the present policy and which , in consequence , would not be strongly opposed by the service population ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that :", "\u201c the key problem remains and its intractability has indeed been re - confirmed . The evidence for an anticipated loss in fighting power has been set out in section F and forms the centrepiece of this assessment . The various steps in the argument and the overall conclusion have been shown not only by the ORG authorities but by the great majority of Service personnel in all ranks . \u201d", "Current service attitudes were considered unlikely to change in the near future . While clearly hardship and invasion of privacy were involved , the risk to fighting power demonstrated why the policy was , nevertheless , justified . It considered that it was not possible to draw any meaningful comparison between the integration of homosexuals and of women and ethnic minorities into the armed forces since homosexuality raised problems of a type and intensity that gender and race did not .", "The ORG considered that , in the longer term , evolving social attitudes towards homosexuality might reduce the risks to fighting power inherent in change but that their assessment could \u201c only deal with present attitudes and risks \u201d . It went on :", "\u201c \u2026 certainly , if service people believed that they could work and live alongside homosexuals without loss of cohesion , far fewer of the anticipated problems would emerge . But the ORG must deal with the world as it is . Service attitudes , in as far as they differ from those of the general population , emerge from the unique conditions of military life , and represent the current social and psychological realities . They indicate military risk from a policy change \u2026", "\u2026 after collecting the most exhaustive evidence available , it is also evident that in the GPE homosexuality remains in practice incompatible with service life if the armed services , in their present form , are to be maintained at their full potential fighting power . ... Furthermore , the justification for the present policy has been overwhelmingly endorsed by a demonstrated consensus of the profession best able to judge it . It must follow that a major change to the ORG \u2019s current GPE - service Guidelines on homosexuality should be contemplated only for clearly stated non - defence reasons , and with a full acknowledgement of the impact on Service effectiveness and service people \u2019s feelings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Defence Council \u2019s \u201c Code of Practice on Race Relations \u201d issued in DATE declared the armed forces to be equal opportunity employers . It stated that no form of racial discrimination , harassment or abuse would be tolerated , that allegations would be investigated and , if proved , disciplinary action would be taken . It provided for a complaints procedure in relation to discrimination or harassment and it warned against the victimisation of service personnel who made use of their right of complaint and redress .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the army published an Equal Opportunities Directive dealing with racial and sexual harassment and bullying . The policy document contained , as a preamble , a statement of the Adjutant- General which reads as follows :", "\u201c The reality of conflict requires high levels of teamwork in which individual soldiers can rely absolutely on their comrades and their leaders . There can , therefore , be no place in the ORG for harassment , bullying and discrimination which will affect morale and break down the trust and cohesion of the group .", "It is the duty of every soldier to ensure that the ORG is kept free of such behaviour which would affect cohesion and efficiency . ORG policy is clear : all soldiers must be treated equally on the basis of their ability to perform their duty .", "I look to each one of you to uphold this policy and to ensure that we retain our acknowledged reputation as a highly professional ORG . \u201d", "The Directive provided definitions of racial and sexual harassment , indicated that the army wanted to prevent all forms of offensive and unfair behaviour in these respects and pointed out that it was the duty of each soldier not to behave in a way that could be offensive to others or to allow others to behave in that way . It also defined bullying and indicated that , although the army fosters an aggressive spirit in soldiers who will have to go to war , controlled aggression , self - sufficiency and strong leadership must not be confused with thoughtless and meaningless use of intimidation and violence which characterise bullying . Bullying undermines morale and creates fear and stress both in the individual and the group being bullied and in the organisation . The army was noted to be a close - knit community where team work , cohesion and trust are paramount . Thus , high standards of personal conduct and respect for others were demanded from all .", "The Directive endorsed the use of military law by commanders . Supplementary leaflets promoting the Directive were issued to every individual soldier . In addition , specific equal opportunities posts were created in personnel centres and a substantial training programme in LAW DATE was initiated .", "CARDINAL . Every DATE PERSON Forces\u2019 Bill goes through ORG and a ORG conducts a review in connection with that bill .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report of ORG dated DATE noted , under the heading \u201c Homosexuality \u201d :", "\u201c That the present policy causes very real distress and the loss to the services of some men and women of undoubted competence and good character is beyond dispute . Society outside the armed forces is now much more tolerant of differences in sexual orientation than it was , and this may also possibly be true of the armed forces . Nevertheless , there is considerable force to the [ ORG ] argument that the presence of people known to be homosexual can cause tension in a group of people required to live and work sometimes under great stress and physically DATE , and thus damage its cohesion and fighting effectiveness . It may be that this will change particularly with the integration of women into hitherto all - male units . We are not yet persuaded that the time has come to require the armed forces to accept homosexuals or homosexual activity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The DATE ORG report ( produced after that committee \u2019s review of LAW ) referred to evidence taken from members of ORG and from homosexual support groups and to the ORG report . Once again , the committee did not recommend any change in the government \u2019s policy . It noted that , since its last report , a total of CARDINAL officers and CARDINAL persons of other rank had been discharged or dismissed on grounds of homosexuality . The committee was satisfied that no reliable lessons could as yet be drawn from the experience of other countries . It acknowledged the strength of the human rights arguments put forward , but noted that there had to be a balance struck between individual rights and the needs of the whole . It was persuaded by the ORG summary of the strength of opposition throughout the armed services to any relaxation of the policy . It accepted that the presence of openly homosexual servicemen and women would have a significant adverse impact on morale and , ultimately , on operational effectiveness .
