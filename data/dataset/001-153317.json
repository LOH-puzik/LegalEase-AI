The applicant was born in DATE and lives in NORP .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant took up employment with the ORG ( FAC uprava sisa\u010dko - moslava\u010dka ) as a police officer . On DATE he was assigned to a post in FAC ( FAC postaja PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON is a municipality that receives special ORG support as defined by the legislation in force at that time , namely GPE receiving Special State Support ( PERSON o podru\u010djima posebne dr\u017eavne skrbi , ORG , ORG . CARDINAL , ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; hereinafter : the \u201c Special State Support Act \u201d ) . Among other things , that Act guaranteed to those employed in the public sector in areas receiving special ORG support a special salary uplift , which in the case of the PERSON municipality amounted to PERCENT of the salaries received in other parts of the country .", "CARDINAL . The amendments to GPE which entered into force on DATE ( ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) guaranteed the right to a special salary bonus only to those public sector employees in areas receiving special ORG support who had both their registered domicile ( prebivali\u0161te ) and also actually resided ( borave ) in the area at issue .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was assigned to another post in the ORG , with his place of work being ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action against the ORG in ORG ( PERSON ) , seeking payment of a salary bonus in accordance with GPE .", "CARDINAL . Soon afterwards ORG decided that it was not competent to hear the case and transferred it to ORG ( PERSON ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings before ORG , the NORP State Attorney \u2019s Office ( Op\u0107insko dr\u017eavno odvjetni\u0161tvo u PERSON ) \u2012 representing ORG objected to that court \u2019s territorial jurisdiction , arguing that the applicant had his domicile and lived in PERSON , which was also within an area receiving special State support but outside the territorial jurisdiction of ORG . The NORP State Attorney \u2019s ORG also submitted that the applicant had been receiving expenses for travel between ORG and PERSON and that he was not entitled to the special salary bonus as provided under LAW because NORP was not an area receiving special ORG support .", "CARDINAL . The applicant replied to these submissions with the argument that during his tenure in PERSON he had had authorisation to use a police car , and that he had in fact lived in PERSON , but since his house had not been fully reconstructed after the war , he had also spent some time in NORP .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the contentious submissions of the parties , ORG heard evidence from the applicant , who pointed out that during his tenure in PERSON his registered domicile had been PERSON , where he had actually resided \u2012 some of the time in his own house and some of the time with his sister , since his house had needed reconstruction . He also explained that he had had authorisation to use a police car and had also been entitled to travel expenses , even though he had actually lived in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s civil action , ordering the ORG to pay compensation for his special salary bonus in the total amount of NORP kunas ( HRK ) , together with the statutory default interest , for the period between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , and to reimburse him the costs of the proceedings in the amount of HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that the applicant \u2019s statement as to his domicile and his residence was credible and nothing called it into doubt . It also stressed that the NORP State Attorney \u2019s ORG had neither provided any evidence nor challenged the veracity of the applicant \u2019s statement . Instead , it had argued in its submissions that the applicant had both his domicile and his residence in GPE , within an area receiving special State support . As to the submission concerning travel expenses , ORG considered that this was a matter relating to the employment conditions of civil servants , which did not in itself have any bearing on the applicant \u2019s domicile and residence . Against this background , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s claim should be accepted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP State Attorney \u2019s Office challenged the first - instance judgment before ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u ORG ) contending that the applicant had only had his domicile in PERSON , whereas the travel expenses suggested that he had in fact lived in NORP . It thus considered that the applicant did not satisfy the criteria of the Special State Support Act necessary to qualify for a special salary uplift .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE endorsing all the factual and legal findings of the first - instance judgment , ORG dismissed the appeal by the NORP State Attorney \u2019s ORG . The first - instance judgment thus became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG opened enforcement proceedings against the ORG on the basis of the final and enforceable judgment in the applicant \u2019s favour .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was fully enforced on DATE by payment of the due amount to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the State Attorney \u2019s Office of GPE ( ORG odvjetni\u0161tvo PERSON ) lodged a request for the protection of legality ( zahtjev za za\u0161titu zakonitosti ) with ORG ( PERSON ) against the part of the final judgment of ORG by which the applicant had been awarded HRK CARDINAL for the period DATE and DATE on account of the special salary uplift . It reiterated that the travel expenses which the applicant had received suggested that he had actually resided in NORP in the period at issue , which could also be deduced from the fact that he had provided an address in NORP in the civil action he lodged before ORG . Thus , once the DATE amendments to LAW had entered into force ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the applicant had no longer been entitled to the special salary bonus since he had no longer resided in an area receiving special ORG support , which was a precondition for the special uplift , as explained in the judgment of ORG no . Gzz-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the request for the protection of legality , arguing that it could not be used as a remedy and that it substantially contradicted the general position on the matter adopted at the meeting of ORG of ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG approved the request for the protection of legality , quashed the second - instance judgment in the impugned part , and remitted the case to ORG . ORG held that the DATE amendments to LAW made it clear that civil servants employed in an area receiving special ORG support who applied for a special salary bonus should also have their domicile and residence in that area . It therefore ordered ORG to reassess the appeal arguments of the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG as to whether or not such conditions had been met in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG appeal , reversing the first - instance judgment of ORG in the part in which the applicant was granted HRK CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL for the period DATE and DATE on account of the special salary uplift , and ordering the applicant to repay that amount together with the statutory default interest . ORG also reversed the first - instance judgment in the part concerning the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the evidence adduced before the first - instance court suggested that in the period at issue the applicant had not in fact resided in an area receiving special State support , and thus had not met all the requirements under the DATE amendments to LAW concerning the right to a special salary uplift .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) against the judgment of ORG of DATE , challenging the use of a request for the protection of legality in his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint as ill - founded , holding that the lower courts had acted in accordance with the law . The decision of ORG was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to a certificate issued by ORG on DATE , pursuant to the above proceedings the applicant repaid the total amount of HRK CARDINAL from his salary to the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
