GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Not necessary to rule on the preliminary objection (non-exhaustion);No violation of Art. 8", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant was born in DATE and lived in GPE until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE he left GPE in order to complete his chemistry studies in GPE . In DATE he went to GPE in order to obtain a doctorate in chemistry . From DATE he worked as a university assistant at ORG . In DATE he moved to GPE , where CARDINAL of his brothers were living and where he worked in CARDINAL of his brother 's enterprises . Subsequently , he worked in his own kiosk . In DATE he started training with a view to becoming an expert in logistics .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the competent authorities granted the first applicant a temporary residence permit , which was prolonged first until DATE and then until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant married the second applicant . His residence permit was thus prolonged until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a daughter was born to the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) convicted the first applicant of aggravated theft and sentenced him to CARDINAL DATE fines of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and subsequently detained on remand .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) convicted the first applicant of rape . According to the facts established by ORG , on DATE he had forced a university student at knifepoint to engage in sexual contact with him . It sentenced him to DATE and DATE imprisonment . In its reasoning , ORG considered in particular the fact that the first applicant had for the most part confessed his crime , that he had used the knife only once at the beginning of the act and that he had lived an orderly life in spite of his difficulties in finding employment . ORG took further into account that the crime had to a large part been committed owing to the first applicant 's considerable intoxication and his growing frustration emanating from the lack of sexual contact with his wife . However , having regard to the fact that the first applicant had performed CARDINAL acts of sexual coercion , that the incident had lasted for an overall duration of TIME and that he had constantly used force against his victim by exerting pressure with his arm and his hand , respectively , these factors precluded further mitigation of sentence .", "CARDINAL . Following his conviction , the first applicant served his sentence in FAC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the psychological expert P. submitted an expert opinion to the prison authorities . He considered that the first applicant had acknowledged his crime and was willing to change , in particular with regard to his alcohol consumption and his sexual conduct . There was no indication of sexual deviance . The expert further noted that the first applicant 's upbringing in a traditional NORP family had led to a very restricted concept of masculinity , which he had not been able to revise . His relationship with the second applicant had been very burdened by the fact that the second applicant had refused sexual contact with him following the birth of their daughter and that he had not been able to talk to her about this . The expert further noted that there had been other situations prior to the rape where the applicant had harassed women , although such situations had not led to the commission of a sexual offence . He concluded that the first applicant was open - minded and self - critical . He was able to comprehend the circumstances which had led to the commission of the crime and to search for ways of overcoming his problems . Provided the first applicant engaged in pertinent couple therapy and managed to give up his illusionary concept of masculinity , a positive legal prognosis could be attributed to him .", "CARDINAL . According to the records of the regular conferences on the planning of sentence execution ( Vollzugsplankonferenz ) , the first applicant attempted to instigate couple therapy . In DATE , however , it was noted that the applicant 's wife had expressed that she was experiencing great difficulties with her own situation , which she preferred to solve on her own before dealing with her husband 's problems . She was uncertain whether she wished to continue the relationship .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until DATE the applicant attended meetings of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the record dated DATE the prison authorities noted that , in DATE , the second applicant had had a conversation with a prison social worker , who gained the impression that she was not interested in meeting her husband and that she could not cope with the situation . The second applicant had not made use of her visiting rights for DATE . In DATE the second applicant informed the social service by telephone that she agreed to meet her husband in spite of her doubts .", "CARDINAL . The participants in the conference of DATE noted that the first applicant had been undergoing psychotherapy . They had , however , not gained the impression that he had made sufficient progress , as he was continuing to exert pressure on his wife and was trying to control her . It was further noted that the applicant 's conduct during his detention was impeccable .", "CARDINAL . In the record dated DATE it was noted that the first applicant had been granted leave to visit his wife and daughter on CARDINAL occasions since DATE . The staff accompanying the visits considered that the state of the applicants ' marriage was still unclear . While there had been a certain rapprochement between the couple , the spouses still did not communicate much with each other , but rather via the child . The second applicant was not opposed to her husband 's continuing to visit their daughter . It still appeared , however , that she wanted a separation . The participants in the conference further consulted CARDINAL psychological experts , including PERSON , who considered that the applicant had not resolved his problems as regards his partnership and social contact with females . All CARDINAL considered , however , that the danger of recidivism was low .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) of GPE ordered the first applicant 's expulsion to GPE . PERSON to GPE was announced upon his release from prison . Although the applicant was in possession of a valid residence permit and married to a NORP national , they considered that his conviction for a serious crime made it necessary to expel him under sections CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , see Relevant domestic law below ) . The circumstances of the present case left no room for any discretion on the part of the NORP authorities . The circumstances leading to his last conviction proved that he possessed a considerable amount of criminal energy . As a recidivist ( Wiederholungst\u00e4ter ) , there was a risk that the first applicant would commit further criminal acts in the future . The first applicant 's assumption that his victim had willingly engaged in sexual contact with him gave rise to doubts as to whether he had fully comprehended and absorbed the extent of his crime .", "CARDINAL . According to the authorities , the long period spent in GPE could not preclude his expulsion , as his criminal offences had shown that he had so far not adapted to the living conditions in GPE . Neither his marriage to a NORP national , nor the fact that they had a child , could lead to a different conclusion in view of the seriousness of his crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) rejected an objection lodged by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) confirmed the deportation order of DATE . Having regard to the reasons given for the first applicant 's criminal conviction , it found that given the seriousness of his crime , his expulsion was necessary in the interest of general deterrence ( ORG ) . It also considered the expulsion justified in this particular case . ORG did not view the first applicant as a recidivist , as his prior conviction for theft could not lead to the conclusion that he would continue to commit sexual offences . However , although the psychological expert PERSON had given the first applicant a positive social prognosis , a positive legal prognosis could only be given on condition that the first applicant engaged in successful therapy for couples and took leave of his \u201c illusory concept of masculinity \u201d . At the relevant time in DATE when ORG gave its decision on the applicant 's objection , these requirements had not been met .", "CARDINAL . Despite the first applicant 's high professional qualifications and the fact that he had otherwise lived an orderly life , the CARDINAL criminal offences committed in GPE attested to the fact that he had not succeeded in fully integrating himself into NORP society . This finding was also based on ORG 's statement that there had been other situations prior to the rape where the first applicant had harassed women , even if such situations had not led to the commission of a sexual offence . If the first applicant did not learn how to deal adequately with problems and conflicts through pertinent therapy , ORG could not rule out the possibility that he might again commit criminal acts .", "CARDINAL . ORG further pointed out that , according to the legal practice in GPE , the existence of family ties alone could not preclude the first applicant 's expulsion . In any event , at the time of the expulsion decision , there were severe doubts as to the stability of the applicants ' marriage . It was not certain to what extent the second applicant knew about the details of the crime committed by her husband . The relationship between the spouses was considered to be problematic . The second applicant had also not reacted to an invitation to state her views on her husband 's expulsion . The first applicant had not substantiated why it was necessary for his wife and child that he remain in GPE , in particular as his wife financially supported the family and had , already prior to the first applicant 's imprisonment , arranged for their daughter to be cared for by a third person while she was at work .", "CARDINAL . The daughter 's interest in her father 's remaining in GPE could also not be considered as more important than the public interest in his expulsion . The right to have contact with his daughter was only protected in so far as that right had been exercised in the past . Despite regular meetings between the applicant and his daughter , which were apparently being continued , there was no indication that the daughter depended on these contacts . Having regard to the long periods of time which had elapsed between the visits and the fact that the daughter had not lived with the applicant since his arrest DATE , it appeared that they had a relationship based merely on occasional encounters ( GPE ) . Under these circumstances , the applicant had failed to substantiate that his ties with his daughter amounted to a strong parent - child relationship that would warrant his remaining in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Oberverwaltungsgericht ) upheld that decision and rejected the first applicant 's request for leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant 's complaint for adjudication .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a request for an interim order with the aim of obtaining a temporary suspension of deportation ( PERSON ) . On DATE ORG dismissed this request , stating firstly that his expulsion was not imminent as the first applicant was still serving his prison sentence . In any event , the applicant 's request was unfounded . Referring to its own judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which had been upheld by ORG , ORG held that the deportation order was in accordance with the law and that there was no cause for a suspension of the deportation . On DATE the first applicant lodged an appeal . Following consultation of the case file , the applicant 's counsel withdrew this appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a post - sentencing chamber ( PERSON ) , ordered the first applicant 's release on probation . Based on psychological expert reports and on the submissions of the prison authorities , ORG concluded that if the first applicant continued to abstain from abuse of alcohol , the risk that he might commit further crimes was comparatively low . It assumed that DATE spent in prison may have contributed to a complete cure from his former addiction and considered that he had comprehended the extent of his crime . While admitting that his relationship with the second applicant had probably deteriorated during the time spent in prison , ORG considered it noteworthy that the couple had so far not divorced , nor had either of the spouses petitioned for a divorce .", "CARDINAL . Following the first applicant 's release from prison on DATE the applicants lived together with their child . According to the applicants ' submissions , they started to follow couple therapy in DATE . On DATE GPE , on ORG request , issued a passport substitute document in order to allow the first applicant 's deportation . After that the first applicant left his family and went into hiding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG to set a time - limit on the exclusion from NORP territory , which was a legal consequence of his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and on QUANTITY September CARDINAL he was deported to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Hanover limited the applicant 's exclusion from the NORP territory to DATE from the time of deportation , that is until DATE . The applicant 's request for an earlier time - limit was rejected . The applicant was further granted the option to apply for a fresh examination of his request in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant re - entered NORP territory . On DATE he was arrested on suspicion of theft accompanied by violence committed under the influence of alcohol . According to police investigations , he had reached into a cash register in a bar in order to procure the means to acquire more alcohol . The applicant remained in detention pending deportation to GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicants ' counsel informed the ORG that the second applicant wished to withdraw her complaint .", "CARDINAL . The rights of entry and residence for foreigners were , at the relevant time , governed by LAW ) .", "Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL , of LAW , a foreigner was to be deported when he had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment for having wilfully committed CARDINAL or more criminal offences . If he was married to a NORP citizen , a foreigner could only be deported if serious reasons of public safety and order justified his expulsion ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . This was generally the case where section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL was applicable .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , a foreigner who had been deported was not permitted to re - enter NORP territory . A time - limit on the exclusion period was usually ( in der PERSON ) granted upon an application by the deportee .", "CARDINAL .

Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , a foreigner could be granted a temporary suspension of deportation ( PERSON ) for as long as there were legal or factual reasons making his deportation impossible .", "CARDINAL .
