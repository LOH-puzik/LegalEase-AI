The following day a general practitioner had issued the applicant with a sick leave certificate until DATE and had prescribed painkillers and sedatives . The applicant asked the prosecutor to order an appointment with a forensic medical expert , pointing out that there were haematomas on her upper arms .", "CARDINAL .

In the concluding part of her complaint , the applicant requested that the actions of the CARDINAL officers of the municipal police be investigated .

Since the applicant had not demonstrated resistance , PERSON and PERSON had released their hold and subsequently taken statements from the applicant \u2019s neighbours for the purpose of initiating administrative proceedings against her .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant had resisted and the officers had twisted her arms behind her back . After the applicant had stopped resisting , she had been released .", "CARDINAL .

Administrative proceedings were initiated on CARDINAL DATE and discontinued on DATE because procedural time - limits had not been observed by the police .", "CARDINAL . The decision stated that , since the applicant had refused to cooperate with the police and had started to walk away , the policemen had had legitimate grounds for detaining her , as long as they observed the requirements set out in the Law on Police ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) . Nevertheless , PERSON and PERSON had failed to fulfil the requirements of section CARDINAL in fine of the PERSON , which prohibits the use of special restraint techniques against women , other than in exceptional circumstances .

Furthermore , the decision noted that the applicant had failed to specify which paragraph of CARDINAL formed the legal basis of her complaint , and had not substantiated in any way her claim under section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE a single judge of ORG dismissed her appeal . The decision noted that DATE on which ORG and PERSON could have been charged by the way of private prosecution had been DATE . Since the applicant had lodged her complaint on DATE , it would have been physically impossible to initiate proceedings on DATE because of the large number of procedural steps that would have had to be taken ( for example , a copy of the complaint would have had to be sent to the accused , the accused would have had to be informed about their rights , the applicant would have had to be informed about the time and the place of the hearing , and the accused and other persons would have had to be called to the hearing ) . The judge further noted that the police \u2019s decision not to initiate criminal proceedings was made on DATE , yet the applicant had waited for DATE before lodging a request to initiate private prosecution proceedings . The decision had also explained that a refusal to initiate criminal proceedings did not preclude the applicant from lodging a civil claim in order to obtain compensation for the harm allegedly done . Finally it was remarked that the judge of the first - instance court had correctly held that the applicant had failed to specify which of the CARDINAL paragraphs of CARDINAL of LAW formed the legal basis of her complaint . Under LAW , the judge of the first - instance court had a duty to establish whether the legal categorisation of the alleged crime was correct , since the accused had a right to know the exact content of the accusations against them .
