The applicant is a NORP national . He was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a journalist and at the material time was the manager of a large - circulation DATE called ORG .", "CARDINAL . An article appeared in the DATE issue of ORG stating that ORG ( ORG ) had asked PERSON , a lawyer and journalist , to stand in ORG elections . That information had also been published by the NORP press agency LUSA .", "CARDINAL . On the same page the applicant published an editorial containing the following passages :", "\u201c ... [ the Chairman of the ORG / PP ] has shown himself capable of exceeding even the most vulgar of caricatures ... This is clear from the ORG leadership 's unthinkable choice of candidate to head the party 's list in ORG elections . CARDINAL need only read the extracts from recent articles by PERSON in the Jornal do Dia which we publish in this issue to form an idea of the character being backed by ORG in the country 's main city council elections . As ludicrous and grotesque as this will appear , it is nevertheless true . Not in the oldest or most delapidated ruins of NORP could an ideologically more grotesque and more buffoonish [ bo\u00e7al ] candidate have been dug out : such an incredible mixture of crude reactionaryism [ reaccionarismo alarve ] , fascist bigotry and coarse anti - Semitism . Any leading figure of the PERSON regime [ ORG ] or any mayor of GPE from the former regime would come across as singularly progressive compared to this brilliant find ... It would all be merely an inconsequential anecdote or a surreal political oversight if it were not revelatory of a hidden facet which the ORG is trying to disguise behind the diaphanous veil of the modern Right . Incapable of finding a credible candidate for ORG , which is already symptomatic of the fragility of a party desirous of presenting itself as a possible party of government , the leadership of the ORG has resorted to a character who represents the most complacent , stale and ridiculous aspects of the NORP right - wing . A character who seems never to have really existed and that no humorist of however dubious taste would have been capable of imagining as the last of the NORP abenc\u00e9rages [ salazarenta ] in DATE . We presume that the young leader [ of the ORG / PP ] believes he has found , in desperation , someone capable of attracting at least football fans , which is the domain in which Mr PERSON has forged a remarkable career . It would appear that the majority of young NORP among the leadership of the ORG have contented themselves with reading Mr PERSON 's football columns while remaining unaware of the rare pearls of his political beliefs ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the same issue of ORG numerous extracts of recent articles by PERSON were published on the same page as the applicant 's editorial . The following are a selection of those extracts :", "\u201c The bald - headed NORP [ Mr PERSON ] who spends his life , during his public appearances , militating in favour of secularism and GPE patriotic impiety are sufficient in themselves to enable any reader of average intelligence to decode his real intentions ) concluded after the elections that they [ the socialists ] were defeated because of their political practice and not because of their ideals . \u201d ( ORG do Dia , DATE )", "\u201c The PERSON ' past , and above all the style of their campaign for the PERSON , were very revelatory of a fresh conspiracy of the Left at its most deviant : war on the property of others , the cult of agnosticism , moral relativism , social hypocrisy , the inhuman secularism of life . To obtain an idea of the forces mobilised to catapult the PERSON to power , CARDINAL need only mention that the NORP lobby paid PERCENT of the electoral expenses whereas it represents PERCENT of the electorate . \u201d ( ORG do Dia , DATE )", "[ on the DATE revolution ]", "\u201c ... NORP and NORP reached an agreement to inflict a blow on GPE in GPE . We were betrayed by GPE , we were betrayed by ORG , which has placed a naval fleet at the gates of GPE in case their blow should fail . \u201d ( Jornal do PERSON , DATE )", "\u201c It is no coincidence if politicians everywhere are involved in serious corruption . This moral chaos , which threatens to suffocate the world and leads to generalised perversity and attracts divine punishment , began DATE when the machinery of ideological poisoning and agents of the propagation of error installed themselves comfortably everywhere , when they perverted youth , converting them to idols ; when they tore women from the sanctuary of the home ; when they flooded the world with their exhibition of vice ; and , lastly , when they infiltrated political parties , placing them at the service of impiety . \u201d ( ORG do NORP , DATE )", "\u201c ORG and ORG , even when not imposing their initiation rights and practices , are always flirting with the owners of power . Sometimes their members even succeed in being appointed to public posts . ORG movement is the only exception to this more or less subtle penetration . \u201c Lepenism \u201d is labelled a racist movement and is persecuted by the most unimaginable means , ranging from assault in broad daylight , sabotaging of meetings and systematic slander to the adoption of iniquitous laws to prevent it from penetrating the social fabric and above all climbing up the steps leading to power . ORG is certainly not above a number of political sins , but it is the only political force which openly fights for the restoration of a GPE which proclaims the values of NORP civilisation opposed to Leftism , which , DATE , has been plundering national energies and has turned the national flag into a symbol of heresy . \u201d ( ORG do Dia , CARDINAL DATE )", "\u201c It pains me to have to broach subjects which exude Satan 's breath . However , the city of mankind is made up of all sorts and the PERSON is undeniably exerting his influence throughout this world devastated by sin . ... DATE a survey of attitudes to sin was carried out in GPE . The vast majority of those questioned replied broadly that sin did not exist , but was a taboo invented by medieval obscurantism . The huge setback represented by that response gives us an idea of how decadent we have become and of the abyss into which contemporary society is falling . \u201d ( ORG do Dia , DATE )", "\u201c Most people are unaware that PERSON and PERSON were socialists and that it was in that capacity that they won power in their respective countries using all the tricks and violence supplied them by the canons of the Left . \u201d ( Jornal do Dia , DATE )", "CARDINAL .
