The judge dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection to his decision .", "On DATE CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s clients ( ORG ) sent the judge a personal telegram stating that his decision was \u201c very arbitrary , unheard of and biased \u201d . The client stated that if the judge did not change his former decision , he would , under LAW ( Hukuk Usulu Muhakemeleri GPE ) , hold him personally liable for any damage which may result .", "On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL of his other clients signed a warning letter which they sent to the judge through the intermediary of a public notary . The letter referred to the telegram dated DATE as \u201c our telegram \u201d and alleged that the judge \u2019s decisions were \u201c contrary to clear and definite provisions of a PERSON which needed no interpretation \u201d within the meaning of LAW . The warning letter also referred to LAW which requires that any judge who refuses to accept a petition or to commence proceedings be warned in a notarised warning letter before an action can be initiated against him .", "On DATE the judge lifted his stay of execution decision . On DATE the defendants were evicted from the building .", "On DATE the judge lodged a complaint with ORG of GPE , accusing the applicant and his clients of insulting ( hakaret ) and threatening ( tehdit ) a judge in their telegram and notarised warning letter . ORG eventually brought charges against the applicant under LAW of LAW which makes it a criminal offence to insult or threaten a judge in the exercise of his judicial functions .", "The first hearing before the CARDINALst ORG of GPE was held on DATE . On DATE , the judge happened to be sitting as a substitute member of the CARDINAL - judge ORG . When it was time for the case in question to be heard , the judge took off his robe , left his seat for another substitute judge who came to replace him and sat in the place designated for complainants . During the hearing the judge was heard in his capacity of complainant . The applicant and his lawyers did not challenge the objectivity of the CARDINAL other judges who were sitting with the judge prior to the hearing within the time - limit prescribed by LAW . After the hearing , the judge took his seat as the substitute judge of ORG of GPE for the hearings in the other cases listed for DATE .", "At a further hearing and in reply to the closing submissions of ORG , the applicant \u2019s lawyers argued that the applicant had not personally co - signed ORG \u2019s telegram of CARDINAL DATE and could not therefore be held liable for its contents . He maintained that he had no intention to insult or threaten the judge , his only purpose being to protect the interests of his clients by requesting that the impugned decision be changed and to remind the judge of his personal liability under LAW if the decision remained unchanged . In their final submissions the applicant \u2019s lawyers referred to the first hearing held on DATE . In this respect , they complained inter alia , about the fact that the complainant judge who had brought the criminal proceedings against him served as a member of the CARDINALst ORG of GPE in other cases . They argued that in the course of the proceedings the complainant wrongfully tried to influence his colleagues on the bench . Without making a motion for the disqualification of any of the judges ( \u201c hakimin reddi talebi \u201d ) , they concluded their observations on this issue with the words \u201c We convey this situation to the ORG \u2019s understanding of law and justice \u201d .", "On DATE ORG of GPE acquitted the applicant on the charge of threatening the judge . However , it convicted him of insulting the judge contrary to LAW and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY . The prison sentence was converted to a fine and suspended . The total fine imposed on the applicant was MONEY . In its reasoning , the court held that the applicant \u2019s reference to the telegram in the text of the notarised warning letter , with the words \u201c our telegram \u201d , was sufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant had been involved in preparing and sending the telegram . According to the court , the legal terminology used in the telegram indicated that it had not been drafted by a layman , but by a lawyer , namely the applicant . The court furthermore held that \u201c a telegram \u201d was not a method prescribed by law for warning judges . With reference to LAW ) , the court added that a judge could not be addressed in the exercise of his judicial powers in a manner intended to give him instructions . The court concluded , inter alia , that the sending of a notarised warning letter to the judge was not appropriate in the circumstances since the judge had not refrained from accepting petitions or commencing proceedings . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges on ORG of GPE dissented on the basis that the applicant could not be held responsible for a telegram which he had not co - signed and that he had not intended to insult the judge .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers appealed to ORG ( Yarg\u0131tay ) . They referred to the opinion of the dissenting judge . In his grounds of appeal the applicant relied on the argument that the trial court did not attach sufficient importance to the fact that immediately before his trial began the complainant judge had been sitting on the bench of that same court . They also requested a hearing before ORG .", "On DATE ORG submitted in writing its closing opinion to ORG . ORG submitted that the applicant \u2019s reference in the text of the notarised warning letter to the words \u201c our telegram \u201d was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant had in fact written the telegram which , moreover , had not been signed by him . ORG advised ORG that the applicant \u2019s conviction should be quashed . This written opinion was not served on the applicant .", "On DATE the CARDINALth Chamber of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for a hearing and upheld the judgment of ORG of GPE . It found that the applicant was able to submit and have considered at his trial all evidence in his defence to the charges . The court concluded that the reasoning in the trial court \u2019s judgment was sufficient , consistent and based on a proper evaluation of the evidence .", "B.
