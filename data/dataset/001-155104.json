NORP The applicant company was established in DATE and has its registered office in LOC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company bought real property registered on ownership certificate no . CARDINAL for the cadastral area of LOC in the city of ORG . The seller was a ORG - owned enterprise ( \u201c the seller \u201d ) acting through a receiver in insolvency .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the sale , in a decision ( uznesenie ) of DATE , ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) acting as an insolvency court had consented to the property being sold directly as opposed to through a public auction .", "CARDINAL . By way of an order ( opatrenie ) of DATE the insolvency court approved the sale of the property to the applicant company because it had fulfilled the conditions for the sale as set out in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . It observed that the proposed price was adequate in view of all the circumstances , including the fact that there were municipal and other roads situated on the land in question .", "CARDINAL . The order of DATE was not amenable to appeal . It became final and binding on DATE as it was issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the sale was registered in the land registry . The title to the property was thereby effectively transferred to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . The seller was subsequently dissolved and struck out of the companies register , whereby it ceased legally to exist .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE GPE ( \u201c the claimant \u201d ) brought an action against the applicant company seeking a ruling that it was the owner of the property .", "The claimant argued in principle that , by mistake , the property had not been registered as its own ; that accordingly it did not belong to the seller ; and DATE consequently \u2013 the sale had been void .", "CARDINAL . The action was examined and dismissed on DATE by ORG s\u00fad ) and , following an appeal lodged by the claimant , on DATE by ORG .", "ORG held a hearing and took complex documentary evidence and oral submissions from the parties .", "Both courts unanimously concluded that there was a non - rebuttable legal presumption , under LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as applicable at the relevant time ) , that the property belonged to the insolvency estate and could be lawfully sold to third parties unless its exclusion from the estate had been claimed by way of a special action ( vylu\u010dovacia \u017ealoba ) , which had not happened in the present case . The applicant company had acquired the property in good faith and the present action could not be used to contest that .", "CARDINAL . The dismissal of the action became final and binding on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claimant filed a petition with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) requesting the latter to exercise his discretionary power to challenge the above - mentioned judgments by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law ( mimoriadne dovolanie DATE \u201c extraordinary appeal \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Having decided to accede to the request and acting through his First Deputy , on DATE the ORG challenged the contested judgments in ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) .", "He argued that the courts had erred in applying the said legal presumption which , in his view , only applied if the party concerned had been invited by the insolvency court to seek the exclusion of the property in question from the insolvency estate by the special action mentioned above and if that party had failed to act on the invitation . This had however not been the case in the present situation . Moreover , the ORG argued that both the seller \u2019s receiver in insolvency and the insolvency court should have flagged up and treated the property as contentious , especially in view of the fact that there were public roads on it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the claimant were both given an opportunity to comment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the challenged judgments and remitted the case to the first - instance court for a new determination .", "It referred to a precedent of DATE in case no . CARDINALCdo CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which had been published in the \u201c Collection of Standpoints of the Supreme Court \u201d in DATE ( issue CARDINAL/CARDINAL , item CARDINAL ) , according to which there were conditions attached to the legal presumption applied by the lower courts . The present case fell within CARDINAL of the exceptions .", "In particular , ORG concurred with the ORG \u2019s argument that the presumption only applied on condition that the party concerned had been invited but had failed to seek to have the disputed items excluded from the insolvency estate .", "However , according to ORG , there was an exception to that condition , in that the latter would only apply if there were circumstances casting doubt on whether the disputed items rightfully fell within the insolvency estate .", "ORG found that , on the facts of the present case , the claimant had not been invited to seek to have the plots in question excluded from the estate . Moreover , there were reasons to doubt whether the seller had actually been the owner of those plots and whether the property had belonged to the seller \u2019s insolvency estate .", "As the receiver and the insolvency court had failed to flag up the property as being contentious , the presumption was not applicable and the sale contract was void .", "Moreover , in ORG assessment , in view of the circumstances , the applicant company could not be considered as having been the bona fide purchaser of the property .", "The contested judgments were therefore wrong in law and had to be quashed .", "CARDINAL . Since then the case has been pending at the first instance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a complaint under LAW no . PERSON . , as amended ) with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) .", "The applicant company relied , inter alia , on LAW and challenged ORG decision .", "In particular , it contended that ORG had wrongfully reexamined the lawfulness of the insolvency court \u2019s order of DATE , which was impermissible outside the framework of the insolvency proceedings . In any event , an extraordinary review of that order was also impermissible on account of the expiry of the applicable time - limits . In addition , the re - examination of that order was impermissible because it was in breach of the principle of res judicata .", "Lastly , the applicant company disagreed with ORG findings on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded . It found no constitutionally relevant arbitrariness , unfairness or irregularity in ORG decision and reasoning or in the underlying procedure .", "It added that , in so far as the applicant company could be understood as wishing to rely on the principle of res judicata with regard to the original insolvency proceedings , this principle did not apply in the present case because the insolvency proceedings had concerned the seller and not the claimant . Any rulings made in the insolvency proceedings therefore did not restrict the claimant from pursuing its own claims in the action at the origin of the present case .", "ORG decision became final and binding on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
