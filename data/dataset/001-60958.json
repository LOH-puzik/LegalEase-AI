The applicants were born in DATE in DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , acting in his capacity as a journalist , published an article in ORG , a DATE newspaper , under the headline \u201c Minister PERSON convicted of tax fraud \u201d ( Minister PERSON \u00fcberf\u00fchrt ) . He alleged in the article that the minister had broken the Seventh , Eighth and Ninth Commandments by committing value - added tax ( VAT ) frauds . He went on to say that a politician from the right might have been expected to take the rules so carefully drawn up by PERSON more seriously . He added that a fiscal fine of MONEY had been imposed on the minister . He said in conclusion that the minister \u2019s conduct was particularly shameful in that it involved a public figure , who should have set an example .", "CARDINAL . The applicants produced documents showing that the fine had been imposed on the minister concerned on DATE by the Director of the Registration and ORG et des domaines ) , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE . The decision had been served on the minister on DATE . It also appears that on DATE the minister appealed to ORG against the fine . In a judgment of DATE , ORG ruled that the fine was not justified as the offence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE had not been made out . An appeal was lodged against that judgment to ORG . The parties have not furnished any further information regarding developments in those proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE was the subject of comment in other newspapers , such as the DATE FAC and the weekly d\u2019L\u00ebtzebuerger Land . A NORP member of ORG also tabled a parliamentary question on the matter .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL sets of court proceedings were issued following the publication of the first applicant \u2019s article .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the minister brought an action in damages in ORG against the first applicant and ORG , arguing that they had been at fault in publishing the information concerning the fiscal fine and making comments which he said constituted an attack on his honour . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the minister \u2019s action on the ground that the article came within the sphere of freedom of the press . In a judgment of DATE , ORG overturned ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the minister lodged a criminal complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor requested the investigating judge to open an investigation into a suspected offence by the first applicant of handling information disclosed in breach of professional confidence , and by a person or persons unknown of breach of professional confidence . The public prosecutor stated in his submissions : \u201c The investigation and inquiries should determine which civil servant or civil servants from the Registration and ORG had any involvement in the case and access to the documents . \u201d The public prosecutor also requested the investigating judge to carry out or arrange for searches of the first applicant \u2019s home and any appurtenances , the offices of ORG and the ORG and ORG offices .", "CARDINAL . Various searches were then carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge issued CARDINAL warrants for searches to be made of the first applicant \u2019s home and workplace , the investigators being instructed to \u201c search for and seize all objects , documents , effects and/or other items that [ might ] assist in establishing the truth with respect to the above offences or whose use [ might ] impede progress in the investigation \u201d .

Both warrants were executed on DATE , but no evidence was found .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for orders setting aside the warrants issued on DATE and all the investigative steps taken pursuant thereto , in particular the searches carried out on DATE . In addition to arguments based on domestic law , he alleged a violation of LAW , emphasising that he was entitled to protect his journalistic sources .", "CARDINAL . ORG , sitting in closed session , dismissed both applications in CARDINAL orders of DATE . It noted that the minister had complained of a number of matters , including the unlawful disclosure of information to the first applicant by Registration and ORG officials , which the first applicant had allegedly gone on to use in a calumnious and defamatory newspaper article . Those matters were capable of falling within the definition of various criminal offences , including breach of professional confidence , breach of fiscal confidentiality , theft , handling , calumny and criminal defamation . ORG said that civil servants were prohibited by LAW ( statut g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des fonctionnaires ) from disclosing any information that was confidential by nature which they had acquired in the course of their duties . It was a criminal offence under LAW to disclose confidential fiscal information and an offence under LAW for anyone receiving confidential information as part of their professional duties to divulge it . As to the handling offence , ORG said that LAW applied to anyone who , by whatever means , knowingly benefited from the proceeds of a serious crime ( crime ) or other major offence ( d\u00e9lit ) . According to legal commentators and the leading cases , handling could extend to intangible property , such as claims , but also manufacturing secrets or material covered by professional privilege . In that connection , the fact that the circumstances in which the property had been obtained had not been fully established was of little relevance if the alleged handler was aware of its unlawful origin ; the classification of the primary offence was immaterial . ORG found that the investigating judge in charge of the investigation had been entitled to order an investigative measure to obtain corroboration of the incriminating evidence already in his possession . It added that there had been no violation of LAW , since the searches \u2013 which had been ordered to assemble evidence of and establish the truth concerning possible criminal offences that may have led to or facilitated the publication of a newspaper DATE had not infringed freedom of expression or freedom of the press .", "CARDINAL . By CARDINAL judgments of DATE , ORG , sitting in closed session , dismissed appeals that had been lodged against the orders of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Letter transmitted in confidence for your guidance . \u201d The applicants explained that the letter had been sent anonymously to the editorial staff of ORG and the first applicant had immediately passed it on to his lawyer , the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an application was made to have the search warrant and all subsequent investigative steps set aside .", "CARDINAL . ORG , sitting in closed session , granted that application on the ground that , in breach of section CARDINAL of LAW , the report of the police department that had executed the warrants on DATE did not contain the observations of the Vice President of ORG , who was present during the search and seizure operations . ORG ruled that the seizure carried out on DATE was invalid and ordered the letter of DATE to be returned to the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . The letter was returned on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , on DATE the investigating judge issued a fresh search warrant with instructions to \u201c search for and seize all objects , documents , effects and/or other items that might assist in establishing the truth with respect to the above offences or whose use might impede progress in the investigation and , in particular , the document dated DATE bearing the manuscript note to the heads of division \u201d . The letter was seized once again DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant applied for an order setting the warrant aside , arguing , inter alia , that there had been a breach of the principle guaranteeing the inviolability of a lawyer \u2019s offices and of the privilege attaching to communications between lawyers and their clients . That application was dismissed by ORG , sitting in closed session , on DATE . It noted , firstly , that investigating judges were empowered to carry out searches even at the homes or offices of persons whose professional duties required them to receive information in confidence and who were legally bound not to disclose it and , secondly , that the provisions of section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE had been complied with . The search and seizure operations had been executed in the presence of an investigating judge , a representative of the public prosecutor \u2019s office and the President of ORG . In addition , the presence of the President of ORG and the observations he had considered it necessary to make regarding the protection of the professional confidence attaching to the documents to be seized had been recorded in the police department \u2019s report .", "CARDINAL .
