Members of the applicant association include its founding members and any person admitted by a simple majority of the general meeting or by CARDINAL majority of the administrative board . The published list of the applicant association \u2019s founding members and administrators shows that they all reside in the above - mentioned municipalities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE , a cooperative society , applied to the delegated official of the province of GPE for planning permission to expand the class CARDINAL and CARDINAL technical landfill site at \u201c LOC \u201d . An increase of CARDINAL of the site \u2019s original capacity was sought . The preamble to the planning permission set out all the circumstances leading to its approval .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the municipality of PERSON wrote to the applicant association informing it that GPE had been granted planning permission on DATE and that the applicant association could apply to the ORG d\u2019Etat for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant association lodged an application for judicial review of the decision of the delegated official and requested that it be stayed . The applicant association based its arguments primarily on instruments such as ORG Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment , ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE on the landfill of waste , the decree of CARDINAL DATE on environmental impact assessment in GPE and LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Relying on LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the Regent \u2019s decree of CARDINAL DATE laying down the rules of procedure in ORG of the ORG d\u2019Etat , the opposing party argued that the application for judicial review should be declared inadmissible because it did not include a statement of the facts .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat dismissed the request for the impugned decision to be stayed . It pointed out that the statement of the facts should have been sufficiently thorough and accurate for the factual circumstances of the dispute to be understood merely from reading that document . It concluded that the documents attached to the request for the decision to be stayed could not be deemed to equate to a statement of the facts .", "CARDINAL . In its pleadings in reply , and in its final pleadings , the applicant association argued that in the context of an application for judicial review , the statement of the facts did not constitute an admissibility criterion , unlike the statement of the facts in the request for the decision to be stayed .

By a judgment of DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat declared the applicant association \u2019s application for judicial review inadmissible .

The statement of the facts , as submitted by the applicant association , was non - existent rather than incomplete . The fact that the opposing party might have been familiar with the background to the case was irrelevant in assessing whether or not the application for judicial review , which was supposed to provide the ORG d\u2019Etat and the legal adviser ( auditeur ) responsible for investigating the case with sufficient information , contained a statement of the facts satisfying the official requirements . Lastly , the ORG d\u2019Etat noted that no new or additional applications and no procedural documents had subsequently been filed within the statutory time - limits to rectify the omissions in the application for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON d\u2019Etat had dealt with an earlier application for planning permission concerning the same subject in a judgment of DATE on an urgent application and in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE on the merits , delivered by the same judges who had delivered the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .
