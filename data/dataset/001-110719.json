De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Flats represented PERCENT of the pre - war housing stock of GPE ( around CARDINAL housing units out of CARDINAL ) . By local standards , they were a particularly attractive type of home , equipped with modern conveniences and located in urban centres . Practically all flats were under the regime of \u201c social ownership \u201d \u2013 a concept which , while it does exist in other countries , was particularly highly developed in the former ORG ( \u201c the SFRY \u201d ) . They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees , who became \u201c occupancy right holders \u201d . All citizens of the SFRY were required to pay a means - tested contribution to subsidise housing construction . However , the amount an individual had contributed was not amongst the legal criteria taken into account in the waiting lists for allocation of such flats .", "CARDINAL . The rights of both the allocation right holders ( public bodies which nominally controlled the flats ) and the occupancy right holders were regulated by law ( LAW DATE , which is still in force in GPE ) . In accordance with this LAW , an occupancy right , once allocated , entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent , lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee . When occupancy right holders died , their rights transferred , as a matter of law , to their surviving spouses ( indeed , spouses held occupancy rights in common ) or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat ( sections DATE and CARDINAL of this Act ) . Furthermore , in the event of a divorce , the spouses were free to choose which CARDINAL of them would continue to use the flat ; in the absence of an agreement , either of them could apply to a court for a transfer of the occupancy right ( section CARDINAL of this Act ) . In practice , these provisions on transfer meant that occupancy rights originally allocated by public bodies to their employees could pass , as of right , to multiple generations for whom the initial employment - based link to the allocation right holder no longer existed . Occupancy rights could be cancelled only in court proceedings ( section QUANTITY ) on limited grounds ( sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of this Act ) , the most important of which was failure by occupancy right holders to physically use their flats for their own housing needs for a continuous period of DATE without justified grounds . Although inspections were foreseen to ensure compliance with this requirement ( section CARDINAL of this Act ) , occupancy rights were rarely , if ever , cancelled on these grounds prior to the DATE - CARDINAL war . Moreover , on DATE ORG annulled the inspection provisions .", "CARDINAL . Following its declaration of independence on DATE , a brutal war started in GPE . On DATE ORG , acting under LAW , adopted its Resolution CARDINAL urging that all units of the JNA , the armed forces of the SFRY , and all elements of ORG either be withdrawn from GPE , or be subject to the authority of ORG , or be disbanded and disarmed with their weapons placed under effective international monitoring . While the LAW formally withdrew from GPE on DATE , the ORG Secretary General ( report of DATE , ORG , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and ORG for the former GPE ( see its judgment in the PERSON case of DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) later established that JNA members born in GPE actually remained there with their equipment and joined the ORG forces and only those born in GPE and GPE left and joined the LAW forces .

During the DATE - CARDINAL war in GPE CARDINAL people left their homes as a consequence of \u201c ethnic cleansing \u201d or generalised violence . As a rule , they fled to areas controlled by their own ethnic groups . All parties to the conflict quickly adopted procedures allowing the flats of those who had fled to be declared \u201c abandoned \u201d and allocated to new occupants . While the alleged rationale for the allocation of \u201c abandoned \u201d flats was to provide humanitarian shelter to displaced persons , particularly attractive flats were often awarded to the military and political elites . In some cases , occupancy rights were cancelled pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE , because of failure by the pre - war occupancy right holders to use their flats for a continuous period of DATE . In most cases , however , the authorities applied legislation specially enacted for those purposes : GPE DATE , GPE , LAW DATE , LAW DATE and GPE . In the immediate aftermath of the war , legislation on abandoned flats remained in force in both ORG GPE ( namely , ORG and PERSON ) and reallocation of flats continued nearly unabated , which further reinforced ethnic separation .", "CARDINAL . All such legislation was repealed under international pressure in DATE , enabling pre - war occupants to claim restitution . However , that right was limited in time and failure to make a timely application led to the cancellation of occupancy rights . The general deadline in GPE was DATE , but in some cases an application could have been made by DATE or , for damaged flats , by DATE ( sections CARDINAL and DATE of ORG . Occupancy rights on military flats can be cancelled also under section CARDINAL of that Act on the following grounds . First , if the pre - war occupancy right holder served in foreign armed forces after DATE ( when the PERSON formally withdrew from GPE ) . Since those who were granted refugee or equivalent status in a country outside the former SFRY are exempted , the restriction affects only those who served in the forces of the successor ORG and , in reality , almost exclusively those who served in the VJ forces . The second category is those who acquired an occupancy or equivalent right to a military flat in a successor State of the SFRY . On DATE ORG , on an application for abstract constitutionality review , declared that provision constitutional ( decision LAW , published in ORG Herzegovina no . CARDINAL of DATE ) . It has afterwards rejected numerous individual cases raising the issue of inability to return to military flats .", "CARDINAL . Once occupancy right holders have repossessed their pre - war flats , they are entitled to purchase them under very favourable terms pursuant to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Upon the cancellation of a pre - war occupancy right on a civilian flat , due to failure to make a timely application , the flat in issue may be given to another person provided that his or her housing needs have not already been met ( see section DATE of ORG . In accordance with sections CARDINAL of that Act , it is deemed that one \u2019s housing needs have already been met when that person or his or her spouse , child or parent has another habitable flat or house ; the person concerned has sold his or her pre - war home ; the person concerned earns as a minimum CARDINAL of the average consumer basket per member of his or her household plus BAM CARDINAL ; or falls into any other category specified therein .", "CARDINAL . Different rules apply to military flats . Upon the cancellation of a pre - war occupancy right , due to failure to make a timely application or due to a final decision rejecting a restitution claim pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG , the flat may be allocated to current and retired military officials , current and retired staff of ORG , war veterans , war invalids or families of killed members of the former ORG or ORG forces provided that their housing needs have not otherwise been met ( see section CARDINAL of the Military Flats Allocation Ordinance DATE ) . LAW of that Ordinance also provides that a person can not be allocated a military flat if he or she or his or her spouse or minor child had a house or a flat in GPE before the war ( even if it has meanwhile been sold or gifted ) . Other conditions set out in paragraph CARDINAL above , such as one \u2019s income , do not apply to the allocation of military flats . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Military Flats Allocation Ordinance CARDINAL , PERCENT of flats should be allocated to senior officers and the highest ORG officials ; PERCENT to junior officers ; and PERCENT to non - commissioned officers , other soldiers and Ministry staff . The remaining flats should be allocated to war veterans , war invalids or families of killed members of the former ORG or ORG forces . During and immediately after the war many military flats were reportedly allocated to the highest military and civilian officials whose housing needs had otherwise been met ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . In DATE the High Representative therefore requested the local authorities to ensure that all flats be allocated in accordance with the law . It would appear that during that process , which led to some evictions and which was monitored by ORG and ORG , the deficiencies mentioned above were for the most part remedied .", "CARDINAL . Applications for restitution are dealt with under an administrative procedure . First - instance decisions are , as a rule , subject to appeal within DATE of delivery ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) . Second - instance decisions are , as a rule , subject to judicial review within DATE of delivery ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ) . Decisions on applications for judicial review were earlier subject to appeal to ORG within DATE of delivery ( section DATE of LAW DATE , replaced by LAW DATE in DATE ) , but they are no longer subject to appeal . An administrative decision enters into effect when upheld by the competent Ministry , the competent ORG and , until DATE , by ORG ; when the parties declare that they will not use either of those remedies ; or when the time - limit for any of them expires .", "CARDINAL . It has no longer been possible to acquire occupancy rights in GPE since DATE ( see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ) . Instead , current and retired members of the armed forces and current and retired staff of ORG have afterwards been entitled to an equivalent tenancy right of unlimited duration on military flats or , in case of a lack of suitable flats , mortgage loans co - financed by the ORG on condition that they or their spouses or children do not have an occupancy or equivalent right on a flat in any of the former ORG ( the Military Housing Ordinances DATE and the Military Pensioners Ordinances DATE and DATE ) . Therefore , those who occupied military flats in GPE before the war have as a rule been required to give up their rights on those flats in order to qualify for a military flat or a loan in GPE or GPE ( see sections DATE of LAW DATE ; sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Military Pensioners Ordinances DATE ; and sections DATE CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Housing Act DATE provides that the holder of a tenancy right of an unlimited duration on a flat may purchase that flat under the same conditions as an occupancy right holder .", "CARDINAL . While the number of people who left their homes in GPE after the dissolution of the former SFRY is far from the number of such people in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , there were nevertheless some cases . For example , in DATE a number of NORP left PERSON , a NORP town bordering on GPE , as the local authorities were unable to protect them from militias from across the border . Although their flats were allocated to other people immediately after their departure , some of them have subsequently been reinstated by the NORP courts ( see decisions of ORG Rev/CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE and ORG of CARDINAL DATE and decisions of ORG in those cases ) . The NORP courts held that the flats in issue should not have been considered as abandoned as the persons concerned had left them under duress . However , some other persons in a similar situation have not been able to repossess their flats ( see decision of ORG Rev/CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE finding that the restitution claim should have been made much earlier than in DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
