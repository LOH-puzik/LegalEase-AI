They all live in GPE and they were born respectively in DATE , DATE , DATE , and DATE . They were represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Attorney General .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Following a project launched by the ORG in DATE asking the public to identify features of the NORP cultural and natural heritage which deserved to be included in ORG for the protection of the environment , a villager suggested protecting the picturesque view , across open sloping fields leading down to the sea , which was visible from north of GPE , GPE , in the area at issue in the present case .", "CARDINAL . NORP Some time later \u2013 the Government having accepted the proposal \u2013procedures for the execution of the project commenced . In DATE the Commissioner of Land ( CoL ) expropriated a plot of land in the above - mentioned area \u2013 it is not clear whether this land belonged exclusively to the applicants or in part also to ORG DATE in order to widen an existing road and develop an open panoramic view , known locally as a \u201c belvedere \u201d . In the development phase of the belvedere , the Government demolished a rubble wall on the boundary between expropriated land and the applicants\u2019 property and installed iron railings to permit an unobstructed view . In due course the area became a designated belvedere , with an unobstructed view overlooking the fields sloping down to the sea . No dispute arose in relation to this ( first ) expropriation . The applicants\u2019 property abuts immediately onto and is slightly below the site of the belvedere and is , in effect , part of the view from the said belvedere and part of the sloping fields .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants sought planning permission to develop the remaining part of the land owned by them , but ORG refused the application on the grounds that the site , although within a development zone , was a protected green area .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , the applicants brought an action against the ORG , asking the court to declare that they had the right to erect a wall on the boundary between their land and the expropriated plot ( see Relevant domestic law ) . The ORG did not submit any pleas countering the claim , although he was served with the claim on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since the applicants did not own all the land expropriated in conjunction with the belvedere , the wall in question would not have been built along the entire length of the belvedere . It would only have been built on the CARDINAL plots owned by the applicants , these being QUANTITY and QUANTITY wide respectively . Although not specified , from the photos and plans provided it would appear that the entire belvedere is QUANTITY long .", "CARDINAL . The case was set down for hearing for DATE . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) in its superior jurisdiction gave judgment in default , upholding the ORG claim , finding that they had the right to build such a \u201c boundary \u201d wall and authorising them to build such a wall \u201c up to the height required by law \u201d under the supervision of a court - appointed architect .", "CARDINAL . Since no appeal was lodged , the judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . In the ensuing DATE , numerous applications were made to the court by both parties to the suit in respect of technical issues connected with the execution of the above - mentioned judgment , that is , the erection of the proposed wall ( these included the removal of items installed on the belvedere so that the wall could be constructed , the question of distances , given the sloping terrain , and the manner in which the boundary wall should be built \u2013 over which the ORG disagreed with the interpretation of the architect ) . A decision in the form of a decree of CARDINAL DATE , given pursuant to CARDINAL of the applications , held that the wall had to be built along the boundaries of the land expropriated for the purposes of the belvedere ( where a retaining wall already existed ) and that it had to be QUANTITY high measured \u201c from the belvedere \u201d . A request by the ORG to have the height of the wall measured from the boundaries ( the level where the properties met ) and not from the surface level of the belvedere was rejected on DATE . The court therefore rejected the ORG \u2019s interpretation as to how the wall had to be built .", "CARDINAL . NORP The execution of the judgment of DATE was to take place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of GPE declared that as from DATE the Minister for ORG was to assume the additional duties of Prime Minister during the Prime Minister \u2019s absence from GPE . By virtue of a declaration made by the acting President of GPE on DATE , a piece of land QUANTITY ) owned by the applicants DATE which included part of the strip of land on which they were to build the boundary wall \u2013 was expropriated by the ORG for the price of MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG asked the court to suspend execution of the judgment in the applicants\u2019 favour in view of the above - mentioned expropriation , which included part of the applicants\u2019 land adjacent to the existing retaining wall . According to the ORG there was a public interest in the expropriation for the purposes of safeguarding the environment and particularly the belvedere ( and the view therefrom ) , built at the expense of the taxpayer , from the actions proposed by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the request as it could not suspend the execution of a judgment which had become final and in respect of which there had been no appeal or retrial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged a further application asking the court to prohibit the applicants from undertaking any works on the aforementioned plot by reason of the expropriation of DATE . Given the circumstances , the applicants agreed not to proceed with the building of the wall until the competent court had decided on the validity of the second expropriation . That being so , the court did not consider it necessary to issue the relevant prohibitory injunction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a judicial protest noting that they were not accepting the compensation offered and declaring their intention to institute constitutional redress proceedings in relation to the expropriation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG instituted fresh ordinary civil proceedings , asking the court to declare that the land where the wall was to be built was Government land , to declare the decision of DATE null and void \u2013 given that the land on which the wall was to be built had now been expropriated for a public purpose DATE and to revoke any other court decision issued after the DATE intended to establish the boundaries between the property of the ORG and that of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The hearing of the case was suspended in view of the constitutional redress proceedings lodged by the applicants ( see below ) . It does not transpire that they have been resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings claiming a violation of LAW in so far as they had been denied execution of a judgment in their favour \u2013 and LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention in that the expropriation of DATE had not been in the public interest . They further invoked LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional competence rejected the ORG claims . It considered that under domestic law an owner had no right to be exempted from an expropriation of property which was carried out in the public interest and in exchange for adequate compensation . That being so , no fair - trial rights arose in relation to the expropriation itself , the right of the individual being limited to contesting the public interest and the compensation at issue in any given expropriation . It held that in the present case the expropriation in DATE had been made in the public interest to ensure the effectiveness of the DATE expropriation , the public interest of which ( the creation of a belvedere ) was not disputed . The fact that certain third parties ( people living in the area of GPE ) had more to gain than others did not deprive the expropriation of its public interest , given that the entire NORP and GPE population would benefit from the view . There was nothing wrong in the ORG ensuring that a plan it had embarked on DATE before was not frustrated . The court considered that , while the ORG \u2019s negligence in the proceedings before ORG in GPE was grave , they had been entitled to take action to correct their mistakes . It further considered that there had not been any discriminatory treatment . The project in DATE had been started by a socialist Government and then continued by a nationalist Government , and neither the initiation nor the continuation thereof appeared to have been politically motivated . Both administrations were taking action solely for the preservation of the environment . Moreover , while it was true that the DATE expropriation had been made at a time when the Minister for GPE was acting Prime Minister and that such an action probably brought most benefit to the residents of GPE \u2013 who were , in the main , of the same political persuasion as the Minister for GPE \u2013 it did not appear that the expropriation ( which had been decided on DATE , that is to say prior to the Minister \u2019s being assigned the duties of acting Prime Minister ) was a result of any intervention on her part . Neither had it been proved that the applicants were treated differently from others in their position or that the expropriation had been politically motivated .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected an appeal lodged by the applicants . It confirmed in full the first - instance judgment in respect of the claim under LAW No . CARDINAL , as the expropriation was indeed necessary to protect the view which was in the general interest and which would have been frustrated by the building of a wall . It further considered that the applicants had not been denied access to a court as they could still contest the merits of the expropriation in relation to the public interest and the amount of compensation . The fact that the applicants had a judicially recognised right over that land ( in the instant case , the right to build a dividing wall when CARDINAL properties belong to different owners ) did not mean that that land could not be expropriated in accordance with the existing legal procedures , subject always to the judicial review of the administrative act of expropriation . Lastly , in relation to the complaint under LAW it considered that \u2013 even if the Minister had been involved in the expropriation \u2013 it had already been found that the expropriation was legitimate , and it was self - evident that a minister had to act , even if it happened that the beneficiaries shared the same political opinion . In the court \u2019s view , the argument that \u2013 unlike the applicants \u2013 the neighbours had direct access to the Minister , enabling them to influence decision - making , did not mean that there had been discriminatory treatment . Similarly , the fact that other people \u2019s property had not been expropriated did not mean that the expropriation was discriminatory , as not everyone \u2019s property was relevant for the purpose sought to be achieved by the expropriation . Moreover , the applicants were entitled to compensation for the taking of their property .", "CARDINAL . Pending the proceedings before this ORG and after the parties had submitted their observations , by means of a publication in ORG of DATE , the President of GPE revoked the President \u2019s Declaration of DATE which had expropriated the applicants\u2019 land .", "CARDINAL . According to information submitted by the parties , the applicants became aware of the revocation on an unspecified DATE , DATE after it happened . Subsequently , the applicants informed ORG , who according to the applicants was unaware that the measure had been lifted . The parties met and agreed that the Government agent would inform the ORG about the matter .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was eventually informed of the matter on DATE , both parties having claimed that the delay in informing the ORG was due to an oversight and a lack of co - ordination , for which they apologised to the ORG .", "CARDINAL .
