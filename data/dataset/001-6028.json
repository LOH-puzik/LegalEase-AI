They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE early in the morning , ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) , reinforced by a special ORG group of ORG and in co - operation with armed forces and ORG , made a search in a clubhouse of the motorcycle club ORG . The search was intended to apprehend certain persons suspected of aggravated assault . CARDINAL members were caught during the search . The president of the club was apprehended later . The police also seized several weapons at the clubhouse . It proved later that they all were permissible and legal , except CARDINAL which was useless and not a gun at all .", "Officer PERSON from ORG was in charge of the investigation . After the search PERSON gave interviews . His statements were widely spread in the media by the press and a TV channel . P. had also been assigned to be responsible for making any announcements to the media .", "In TIME of DATE a NORP TV channel had a report about the search , in which P. was interviewed . To a reporter \u2019s question as to what type of offences members of the club had been found guilty of , PERSON stated that the police had earlier registered to their records the members in question and that they had been convicted of aggravated drug offences and assaults .", "DATE several newspaper articles were published , where a similar statement was quoted .", "The applicants have made several complaints to various authorities . On DATE they complained to ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) . In its statement of CARDINAL DATE to the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman the Ministry of the ORG ( sis\u00e4asiainministeri\u00f6 , inrikesministeriet ) observed , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c The search carried out by the police on the premises of the motorcycle club received a lot of public attention . Soon after the search ORG informed the mass media of the criminal background of the members , and of the activities of the club .", "An article published in PERSON on DATE ( under the heading \u2018 CARDINAL motorcycle club members ORG ) directly quoted an interview with P. According to the newspaper , ORG had said that \u2018 the members of the club had been convicted of narcotics offences and assaults , including robberies\u2019 .", "According to [ the applicants ] , the information given by the police was incorrect . [ The applicants ] attached extracts from their criminal records , of which CARDINAL contained an indication of an offence , to their complaint to the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman .", "According to P. , the police did not tell the mass media that the applicants had been convicted of narcotics offences , but it was mentioned that another motorcycle club , ORG , had been involved in selling narcotics . The information was given from an international point of view , with reference to public information given by the ORG .", "The police shall be prudent in giving information to the public on the background of persons suspected of an offence . Any labelling of suspects shall be avoided . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the information given by ORG indeed gave the public an image that the said members of the motorcycle club had committed various offences . In this respect the public information was not appropriate , as far as the criminal background was concerned . \u201d", "On DATE the applicants made a request of pre - trial investigation to the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman and on DATE to ORG . On DATE the applicants complained to ORG , arguing that the police neglected their duty as they did not respond as required in LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( esitutkintalaki , f\u00f6runders\u00f6kningslag )", "The applicants made a complaint also to ORG ( julkisen sanan neuvosto , opinionsn\u00e4mnden f\u00f6r massmedier ) which , on DATE , found that the TV channel and CARDINAL of the newspapers had failed to comply with good journalistic practice when reporting on the events concerning the motorcycle club .", "On DATE the Deputy ORG stated that , on the basis of the documents , she did not find anything that would require her measures . She noted , however , the following in respect of the treatment of the suspects during the pre - trial investigation :", "\u201c It was mentioned by the mass media that the relevant members of ORG had been convicted of narcotics offences and assaults . According to [ the applicants ] , the police had given incorrect information on those members of the motorcycle club .", "There is no evidence that the police had deliberately given incorrect information on the members of the motorcycle club . However , it is worth observing that the telephone interview with P. on DATE easily gave the impression that members of ORG had been convicted of narcotics offences and assaults . \u201d", "The Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman concluded in this respect that authorities and public officials must be especially careful when informing the public for example of matters relating to criminal investigations and suspects . P. had been careless when giving information on the search of the premises of Overkill MC and on related matters . \u201d PERSON was informed of her opinion .", "On DATE the applicants instituted criminal proceedings against P. who was charged with libel and violation of his official duty on account of his statements . The applicants requested that P. and ORG be ordered to pay compensation in the amount of LAW with interest to each applicant . They argued that they had been subjected to public interest since the search . The applicants had been labelled as having committed offences they had never committed . According to the applicants , P. had been the most active one to give statements to the media and had specially named PERSON to the journalists .", "P. denied all the charges as well as the ORG claim for compensation . He stated that he had not been active but only answered questions presented by reporters . Before the search he had prepared a press release in which the name of the club or names of its members were not mentioned . According to P. , he or the police had not had any advance information about the members of the club . The police had monitored the clubhouse and assumed , on the basis of the number of people visiting the house , that the number of the members was greater than that established later .", "On DATE after CARDINAL hearings at which several witnesses were heard , ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE rejected all the applicants\u2019 claims and acquitted PERSON , basing itself on P. \u2019s statements and on statements given by several witnesses heard during the hearings . ORG found as follows :", "\u201c ORG finds that P. , by acting in the way described above , has not deliberately or of carelessness or lack of caution made himself guilty of a violation of official duties , when informing the public of the pre - trial investigation , so that his statements would have subjected [ the applicants ] to suspicion or that he would have unnecessarily caused them damage and harm . \u201d", "It appears from the judgment that P. had mentioned the name of applicant PERSON when asked by a journalist about persons whose detention on remand would be requested .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and requested an oral hearing . On DATE ORG refused the ORG appeal , without a hearing , and upheld ORG judgement , finding as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicants ] have considered that PERSON clearly identified PERSON MC in his statements concerning the present case , and thus his allegations included in the statements directly referred to this club . According to [ the applicants ] , PERSON , which was a non - registered association , had CARDINAL members at the relevant time . However , the police had reason to believe that the club consisted of a considerably larger number of persons , inter alia , because there had been large numbers of people on the club LOC and in events organised by the club . The statements given by PERSON reveal that he meant a considerably wider circle of people than [ the applicants ] or other members of Overkill MC named as such by the club . Nor did PERSON name any persons in his statements . The identification of club members has only been possible on the basis of distinctive marks . Those distinctive marks were not widely known among the public at the relevant time .", "ORG considers that P. did not deliberately allege that [ the applicants ] , in particular , had committed the offence in question or other despicable acts . Nor did the articles clearly indicate which parts of the text were directly based on the statements of P. and which parts were based on the reporter \u2019s own interpretations of those statements or on information received from other sources .", "On these grounds and for the reasons given by ORG , ORG finds that there is no reason to alter the judgment of ORG as to the merits . \u201d", "ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicants leave to appeal on DATE .", "According to LAW ) of FAC ( DATE ) , the suspect must be presumed not guilty in a criminal investigation .", "According to LAW ) of FAC , in a criminal investigation , the rights of no one must be infringed more than what is necessary for the achievement of the purpose of the criminal investigation .

In case there is reasonable doubt as to the guilt , the case must be decided in favour of the defendant .
