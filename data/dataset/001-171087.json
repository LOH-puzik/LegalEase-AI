On DATE the applicant acquired a share in ORG , a limited liability company based in GPE . His name was entered in the court register of legal entities ( hereinafter \u201c the court register \u201d ) and he became CARDINAL of CARDINAL equal registered members of the company , each holding an PERCENT share . The share capital of ORG stood at CARDINAL NORP tolars ( SIT ) ( PERSON euros ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the founding members withdrew from company ORG DATE . On DATE the applicant , in addition to being a member , was also employed by company ORG as head of its IT department . In addition , he provided assistance to the finance director .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL key members and managers of company ORG died in a car accident and CARDINAL others were seriously injured . As a result , the company \u2019s business operations could not be carried out and the company sustained a large financial loss . Moreover , its management was seriously undermined and during the course of DATE all members except the applicant and another person withdrew from the company \u2019s management board . Following those events , the applicant first assumed the role of acting director of company ORG on DATE , and then the role of managing director on DATE . In that capacity he acted as the company \u2019s representative .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG of GPE ( Slovenske \u017eeleznice ) had applied for an enforcement order against ORG based on an authentic document for unpaid transport services . ORG challenged the enforcement order and the parties were directed to settle the issue in contentious proceedings . ORG lodged a civil action , claiming the payment of CARDINAL sums totalling approximately SIT CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG was converted into a limited liability company in accordance with LAW , which required companies falling under its jurisdiction to increase their share capital and to align their operations with the provisions of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , at the time of the conversion the company was no longer liquid or solvent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant stepped down as managing director of ORG following a decision of the general meeting of the company . The members failed to appoint a new managing director and henceforth the company existed without any management . The applicant \u2019s resignation from the post of managing director was not entered in the court register of legal entities ( hereinafter \u201c the court register \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the members of company ORG decided at its general meeting to apply for bankruptcy on account of the company \u2019s insolvency . ORG filed a bankruptcy petition with the competent court , but it was rejected as the company had failed to make the required advance payment to cover costs and expenses of the bankruptcy proceedings in the amount of SIT CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The members established that they could not incur the costs of bankruptcy and thus decided to wait for the courts to liquidate the company proprio motu , in accordance with the then applicable legislation , namely , the Compulsory Composition , Bankruptcy and LAW as amended , which entered into force on DATE . The amendment to the LAW authorised the courts to initiate bankruptcy proceedings of their own motion in certain specified circumstances ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant stopped working for company L.E. Moreover , by DATE , another CARDINAL members of the company had died .", "CARDINAL . In the civil proceedings initiated by ORG against ORG the applicant was summoned to appear at a hearing to be held on DATE . As he was unable to attend the hearing , he made written submissions explaining that the company had not been solvent for DATE . On DATE ORG rendered a judgment ordering ORG to pay ORG the CARDINAL sums claimed .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE LAW was again amended , inter alia , to repeal the provisions on bankruptcy proprio motu . Moreover , on DATE ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the PERSON \u201d ) entered into force . It introduced a measure decided proprio motu whereby insolvent and/or inactive companies were struck off from the court register without winding up . Thus those companies could be dissolved without the prior procedure of disposing of their assets and repaying DATE to the extent possible \u2013 their creditors . However , in order to ensure that creditors of struck - off companies were protected , the PERSON provided that the members of those companies would assume joint and several liability for the former ORG debts .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of a notification from ORG that company ORG had not performed any transactions through its bank account in a period of DATE , on DATE ORG , acting in its capacity as the registry court , initiated proceedings to strike off the company from the court register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the decision to initiate strike - off proceedings was entered in the court register and an unsuccessful attempt was made to serve it on the company at its registered office . The document was sent to the address of the company , but since no representative of the company was there to receive it , a delivery slip was left in its mailbox , informing the company that the relevant correspondence could be collected at the post office . On DATE the document was returned to the registry court with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it . The registry court then served it by posting it on its notice board , as provided for by ORG . According to the applicant , company ORG had ceased to operate at the address of its registered office already in DATE and had not been present at those or any other LOC since . Moreover , there were no mailboxes at the office building at issue and all mail would have been left at the reception desk .", "CARDINAL . No objection was made to the decision to initiate strike - off proceedings either by company ORG or by its members . Consequently , on CARDINAL DATE the registry court issued a decision to strike off company ORG from the court register . The decision was published in ORG on DATE . The registry court also attempted to serve the decision on company ORG by sending it to the company \u2019s address , but like the previous document it was returned on DATE with the information that the addressee had failed to collect it . Again , the decision was posted on the registry court \u2019s notice board . Neither company ORG nor any of its members , who were entitled to lodge an appeal against the strike - off decision , appealed against the decision , so on DATE it became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE company ORG was struck off from the court register and thus ceased to exist . Notification of the strike - off was published in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he had become aware that ORG had been struck off from the court register on DATE , when an enforcement order was served on him for seizure of his property .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , based on the judgment ordering ORG to pay ORG approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE the creditor lodged an application for enforcement with ORG against CARDINAL members of the company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the creditor an enforcement order to seize the applicant \u2019s personal possessions , which was later expanded to include his salary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection to the enforcement order , arguing that the local court had failed to establish his actual role in company ORG and to acknowledge his status of an \u201c inactive member \u201d ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , which would have exonerated him from liability for the company \u2019s debts . He maintained that the creditor \u2019s claim against the company had arisen before he had joined it , and that he had only become involved in the management of the company because the CARDINAL members who had previously performed that role had died . Moreover , the applicant was of the view that the onus rested on the creditor to establish that he had been an active member of the company , and that the matter should be examined in contentious civil proceedings . Lastly , he applied for a stay of enforcement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s objection was dismissed . ORG found that the onus of proving his inactive status was on the applicant , and that he had failed to prove that he had not been an active member of ORG established that with his PERCENT share in the company , the applicant had enjoyed the rights of a minority member , and furthermore , he had been employed by the company and actively involved in its management since DATE . In his capacity as acting director and later managing director , he had been authorised to act on behalf of the company . Moreover , even after the applicant had resigned as managing director , he had still been active in the operations of the company and had also signed the bankruptcy petition . ORG further dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a stay of enforcement , as he had failed to demonstrate that the enforcement would have caused him irreparable or serious damage . The applicant appealed against that decision , reiterating the arguments he had raised in the objection to the enforcement order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant attended a hearing with regard to an objection to the enforcement order raised by PERSON , another member of company ORG", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on essentially the same grounds as the first - instance court , and the enforcement order thus became final . The court noted , inter alia , that ORG had found the measure of \u201c lifting the corporate veil \u201d under the applicable Financial Operations of Companies Act to be in accordance with the principle of separation of a company \u2019s assets from those of its member , and thus consistent with LAW . ORG considered it irrelevant whether the applicant had become a member of ORG before or after the creditor \u2019s claim had arisen . Having joined the company , he had assumed its assets as well as its liabilities , and moreover , he had had the rights of a minority member . ORG placed considerable emphasis on the fact that the applicant had been actively involved in the management of the company . It explained that the reasons for lifting the corporate veil under the PERSON were not identical to those provided for in LAW . The PERSON established a non - rebuttable presumption that members of inactive companies intended to have the companies dissolved and , to that end , made it clear that they assumed joint and several liability for their outstanding debts ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged CARDINAL constitutional complaints before ORG , CARDINAL concerning the strike - off proceedings and the other the enforcement proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint regarding the strike - off proceedings . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE . The court observed that the applicant lacked legal interest in challenging the decision of the registry court , as company ORG had already been struck off from the court register . Therefore , even a positive outcome of the constitutional complaint could not improve the applicant \u2019s legal position . On DATE ORG rejected also the complaint regarding the enforcement proceedings , finding that the applicant \u2019s human rights had manifestly not been violated . Reiterating that only active members of struck - off companies could be held liable for the ORG debts , ORG found that the lower courts had correctly established that the applicant \u2019s active involvement in the management of company ORG could not exempt him from personal liability for the latter \u2019s debts .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the enforcement order against the applicant \u2019s salary was executed and part of each of the applicant \u2019s DATE salaries was seized to pay off his debt . On DATE the applicant reached an out - of - court settlement with ORG and paid the agreed amount , and the application for enforcement against him was withdrawn . The proceedings against the applicant were terminated on DATE . In total , the applicant paid ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to his creditor ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
