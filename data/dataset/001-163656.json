On DATE ORG of FAC ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) authorised the applicant \u2019s detention pending investigation . The court noted as follows :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is charged with a serious offence representing an increased danger to society ; the material submitted contains sufficient data about [ his ] involvement in the crime , including the testimony of the victim ... [ The applicant ] is an acting police officer , and under such circumstances the court finds that the ORG has made a well - founded argument about the necessity to isolate [ the applicant ] in view of the risk of [ his ] absconding and obstructing the establishment of the truth in the early stage of the investigation by putting pressure on witnesses using his [ status ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Under these circumstances , if released , [ the applicant ] may put pressure on the victim and the witnesses . The sanction for the offence with which [ the applicant ] is charged varies from CARDINAL to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ; therefore the arguments of the prosecution that [ the applicant ] may abscond from justice and render the examination of the case on the merits impossible are well - founded . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
