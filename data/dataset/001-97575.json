ORG was of the view it would be easier to secure witness evidence in any CCCI case owing to the fact this internee , together with DATE , were senior Ba\u2019athists .

On DATE the cases against the applicants concerning the deaths of Staff PERSON and ORG were formally referred by the GPE contingent of the ORG to the Chief Investigative Judge of ORG . The cases were subsequently transferred to ORG and on DATE a NORP officer attended that court to make a statement of complaint in respect of the killing of the CARDINAL soldiers .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG first requested that the applicants be transferred into its custody on DATE and repeated that request on several occasions until DATE . When asked by ORG to clarify why the applicants were not transferred by the GPE contingent of the ORG to the ORG DATE , counsel for the Government explained :", "\u201c We took the view that there was then a genuine issue , because there had been no decision by any court as to whether or not there was the international - law obligation that we say existed or any decision on the question of jurisdiction . That was resolved by ORG , and thereafter we have said it is not now possible for us to give that undertaking [ not to transfer them ] . \u201d", "DATE . On DATE the applicants issued judicial review proceedings in GPE challenging , inter alia , the legality of their proposed transfer . Shortly after proceedings were issued , the Government provided an undertaking that it would not transfer the applicants pending the determination of their claim before the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , PERSON ( Legal Adviser at the NORP embassy in GPE ) met with the President of the ORG , President PERSON , to reiterate GPE strong opposition to the death penalty . During this discussion President PERSON invited letters from the GPE families and from the NORP embassy in GPE opposing the imposition of the death penalty in this case , as that would be a factor which would be taken into account by the court .

Claims by the applicants concerning the legality of their detention by NORP forces were adjourned .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the court expressed its concerns about what would happen to the applicants after the expiry of ORG mandate on DATE . The Government put before the court evidence about the intergovernmental negotiations between GPE and GPE that were then continuing as to whether and pursuant to what terms NORP forces would be permitted to remain in GPE post-CARDINAL DATE . This included the following statement of PERSON , one of the leaders of GPE negotiating team :", "\u201c ... I recognised that , if possible , it would be desirable for GPE forces to be in a position to continue to hold the claimants for a period of time whilst this litigation is resolved . I therefore considered with colleagues whether it would be appropriate to raise this issue with the NORP negotiating team . I can not comment in detail on sensitive inter - governmental negotiations , but the judgment was made that to introduce the issue of GPE forces continuing to hold detainees , whether generally or specifically in relation to these CARDINAL claimants , risked adversely affecting the conduct and outcome of these important and urgent negotiations .", "Furthermore , the judgment was made that raising the issue would not in any event have resulted in any agreement with the NORP authorities whereby the claimants remained in the custody of the NORP forces in GPE , still less that they would agree to the removal of the claimants from GPE . Given the fact that the NORP are seeking the transfer of detainees from the GPE to GPE and the fact that these CARDINAL claimants are NORP nationals accused of crimes within GPE and that the NORP courts have repeatedly requested the transfer of these QUANTITY claimants in order to complete investigations and if appropriate try them , there was no realistic prospect of GPE agreeing to allow them to remain within the custody of the GPE . To have raised the issue would therefore have resulted in my judgment in no change in relation to the position of the claimants , but would have risked adversely affecting the conduct and outcome of the negotiations with the government of GPE .", "... I have considered whether there may be any other means whereby GPE forces could continue to hold the claimants for a period of time beyond DATE pending the outcome of this litigation . Conceivably , we might ask the government of GPE to submit draft legislation to the CoR [ ORG ] specifically to permit the GPE to hold the claimants indefinitely or pending the outcome of this litigation . Given the facts set out in the previous paragraph , I consider that there is no reasonable prospect that the government of GPE would accede to such a request . Furthermore , the process of drafting and passing such legislation would extend beyond DATE . And even raising the issue would in my considered opinion risk adversely affecting the passage of the legislation and finalising of the inter - governmental arrangement .", "There is no likelihood in my view of the GPE being able to secure any agreement from the NORP authorities that we may continue to hold the claimants either indefinitely or pending the outcome of this litigation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Judgment was delivered on DATE . ORG noted that the applicants had been subject to the jurisdiction and legal authority of the NORP courts since no later than CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . CPA Memorandum No . CARDINAL ( Revised ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which was the NORP law in force at the time , required the NORP forces to hand over \u201c criminal detainees \u201d to the NORP authorities as soon as practicable . This requirement was also reflected in GPE ORG of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) . Nonetheless , ORG rejected the ORG \u2019s argument that the actions of GPE in respect of the applicants were attributable to the NORP authorities : the NORP forces were lawfully present in GPE , pursuant to a ORG mandate , as part of the ORG subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of GPE and independent of ORG . The NORP forces had physical custody and control of the applicants and had it in their power to refuse to transfer them to the custody of the ORG , even if to act in such a way would be contrary to GPE international - law obligations . The applicants therefore fell within GPE jurisdiction for the purposes of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG then considered whether the applicants could rely on the principle against refoulement in GPE v. GPE , ( DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) . It rejected the ORG \u2019s argument that the PERSON principle could apply only to transfers across territorial boundaries , but it considered itself bound by ORG judgment in R(B ) v. Secretary of ORG ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL : see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which held that where a fugitive was within the jurisdiction of GPE but on the territory of another sovereign ORG ( for example , within an embassy or consulate ) , GPE was under an international - law obligation to surrender him unless there was clear evidence that the receiving ORG intended to subject him to treatment so harsh as to constitute a crime against humanity .", "CARDINAL . The Divisional Court considered expert evidence relating to the fairness of proceedings before the ORG . It found no cogent evidence to support the ORG claims that detainees held by the NORP authorities were subjected to torture to extract confessions and that evidence obtained by torture would be used against them . It found that although , during the first CARDINAL trials before the ORG in which PERSON was CARDINAL of the defendants ( the PERSON and PERSON trials ) , there had been a number of fatal attacks on ORG staff and defence lawyers , the situation had improved and no lawyers , witnesses or ORG staff members had been kidnapped or killed in DATE . It did not , therefore , consider that ORG staff and counsel would be so concerned about their safety as to prevent the applicants from having a fair trial and it found that adequate security measures were taken to protect witnesses . There had been no permanent replacements of judges in current trials and there was not a sufficient risk of replacement of the judiciary to operate as a factor prejudicing the possibility of the applicants\u2019 receiving a fair trial . The court noted examples of concerns expressed by third parties relating to the independence of the ORG , but observed that these related to events during the PERSON and PERSON trials in DATE , with no more recent examples of such concerns . Taking everything together , it was satisfied that the ORG was sufficiently independent to meet the requirements of a fair trial . There was no real risk of defence counsel being prevented from doing a proper job for the applicants in the event of a trial . The IHT Statute and its rules had been modelled on FAC for the Former GPE and GPE and ORG . The protection afforded to defendants included the presumption of innocence ; the right to be informed of charges ; the right to defence counsel ; the right to be tried without undue delay ; the right to be present during trial ; the right to examine or confront witnesses ; the privilege against self - incrimination ; the right not to have silence taken into account in determining guilt ; the right of disclosure of exculpatory evidence and witness statements ; the exclusion of coerced evidence ; the right to ensure that interrogations are videotaped ; the right to pose questions directly to the witness ; and the right to appellate review . ORG concluded with regard to the risk of a breach of LAW :", "\u201c The overall picture which emerges is that , although initially there were deeply unsatisfactory aspects of the ORG and trial environment , which cast doubt on the ability to provide defendants with a fair trial at that time , there have been many significant improvements since then .", "... To date the claimants have appeared before the NORP courts and have denied the allegations made against them ; and there can be no complaint about the way in which the courts have dealt with them . As to the future , looking at the various points individually and cumulatively , the evidence before us falls a long way short of establishing substantial grounds for believing there to be a real risk that a trial of the claimants would involve a flagrant breach of the principles guaranteed by LAW . Thus , even if the LAW were to apply in the normal way , we would reject the claim that transfer of the claimants into the custody of the ORG would be contrary to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Next , ORG considered the evidence relating to the likelihood that the applicants would be subjected to the death penalty . It concluded :", "\u201c Taking the evidence as a whole , we are satisfied that substantial grounds have been shown for believing there to be a real risk of the claimants being condemned to the death penalty and executed , contrary to LAW No . CARDINAL , if they are transferred into the custody of the ORG . In particular : ( a ) the penalties for the offences with which the applicants are charged include the death penalty ; ( b ) there is clear evidence that persons convicted of such offences are liable in practice to be sentenced to death ; ( c ) the matters relied on as mitigating against the imposition of the death penalty are not sufficiently cogent or certain to negative the real risk ; ( d ) in spite of the efforts made on behalf of the Secretary of ORG , no assurance has been given that the death penalty will not be imposed in this case ; and ( e ) in any event , even if President PERSON [ the President of the ORG ] had given such an assurance , we are not satisfied it would necessarily be effective because he does not have the authority to bind the appeal chamber which would automatically have to consider the appropriate sentence , whatever decision the trial chamber had reached . \u201d", "However , the court found that although the death penalty was prohibited by the Convention , it was not yet contrary to internationally accepted norms , at least where it was imposed for serious crimes following conviction at a trial that met minimum standards of fairness . It followed that \u201c however repugnant the death penalty may be within our domestic legal system and under the Convention , its imposition would not be contrary to international law \u201d and the risk that the applicants might be executed did not therefore operate to relieve GPE of its public international - law obligation to transfer them to the custody of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Divisional Court next examined the issues under LAW . It found that the ORG had requested that , prior to trial , the applicants should be detained in LAW of FAC , which was run by ORG ; if the applicants were convicted and sentenced to over DATE of imprisonment , they would be sent to FAC , also run by ORG . The court referred to a report by ORG , the NORP army officer responsible for conducting inspections of NORP overseas military detention facilities , who had inspected PERSON in DATE and found that Compound CARDINAL \u201c satisfied the requirements [ of FAC ] \u201d in respect of the applicants , providing \u201c relative segregation , protection from elements and reasonable living conditions \u201d . Although the Provost PERSON \u2019s inspectors had received complaints from some detainees about the lack of visits and the quality of the food , no one had complained of mistreatment . ORG also referred to an inspection report by ORG to CARDINAL at FAC , which found no indication that detainees were subjected to intentional or overt acts of mistreatment . Conditions at Compound CARDINAL were found to comply with basic human rights standards ; detainees were allowed regular visits from legal representatives and relatives ; force was used only as a last resort when necessary to prevent prisoners from harming themselves or others ; corporal punishment was forbidden and the prisoners interviewed stated that they had never known it to be used ; and there was a robust system for the reporting of any mistreatment . In addition , the court had reference to the fact that , in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL(c ) of section CARDINAL of the MOU of CARDINAL November CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the NORP authorities had provided an assurance that , following transfer to NORP facilities , the applicants would be treated humanely . Although the applicants had adduced expert evidence concerning the conditions at FAC , this evidence did not establish any instances of actual mistreatment of prisoners . The evidence relating to FAC did not indicate that , if detained there , the applicants would be at risk of ill - treatment . The court therefore concluded that the evidence fell well short of establishing substantial grounds for believing that the applicants would face a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW if transferred into the custody of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the proposed transfer would be lawful and it dismissed the claim for judicial review , but added :", "R(B ) v. Secretary of ORG , as we have understood the judgment of ORG in that case . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Divisional Court granted the applicants leave to appeal to ORG and , on DATE , granted an interim injunction prohibiting their transfer until TIME on DATE to allow an application for interim relief to be made to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against ORG judgment , principally on the grounds that ( CARDINAL ) the court had erred in concluding that there was a relevant public international - law context which could have the effect of modifying the principle in PERSON ( cited above ) ; ( CARDINAL ) even if the court had applied the right test , it had been wrong to hold that the death penalty and execution were not contrary to internationally accepted norms ; ( CARDINAL ) LAW and international law prevented transfer in circumstances where substantial grounds had been shown for believing there to be a real risk of the applicants being condemned to death by hanging ; ( CARDINAL ) it was incorrect to conclude that any GPE jurisdiction to try the applicants either did not exist or was subordinate to NORP claims ; ( CARDINAL ) the court had applied the incorrect test in respect of the ORG claims concerning the fairness of any trial before the ORG ; and ( CARDINAL ) the court had erred in concluding that the evidence before it did not establish substantial grounds for believing there to be a real risk that the ORG trial would involve a flagrant breach of the principles guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG directed that the full appeal hearing would take place on DATE . It made an injunction prohibiting the applicants\u2019 transfer before TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Among the evidence placed before ORG was a further statement by PERSON concerning the ongoing negotiations with GPE . He explained , inter alia , that the question of NORP forces being permitted to exercise detention powers in GPE had been expressly rejected by GPE in the course of the negotiations :", "\u201c In the course of discussions on DATE , NORP officials made clear that , even in relation to any proposed authorised tasks , they did not consider it acceptable for GPE forces to exercise detention powers after DATE .", "It remains my firm and considered view that , in all the circumstances , there is no likelihood of the GPE being able to secure any agreement from the NORP authorities that we may continue to hold the claimants either indefinitely or pending the outcome of this litigation . Further , as I said in my first witness statement , even raising the issue would risk adversely affecting the conduct and outcome of the current negotiations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal at TIME on DATE , with the following short oral reasons .", "\u201c ( i ) On the facts GPE is not exercising jurisdiction over the appellants within the meaning of ORG , LAW . See in particular PERSON v. GPE ( DATE ) CARDINAL BHRC CARDINAL . In essence GPE detains the appellants only at the request and to the order of the ORG , and is obliged to return them to the custody of the ORG by force of arrangements made between GPE and GPE , and GPE has no discretionary power of its own to hold , release or return the appellants . They are acting purely as agents of the ORG .", "( ii ) R(B ) v. Secretary of ORG for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [ DATE ] CARDINAL shows that an obligation of this kind to return persons to the host ORG has to be respected , albeit that the holding ORG in question is subject to ORG obligations , unless \u2013 paragraph DATE to return the appellants would expose them to a crime against humanity . We are bound by that decision , being a decision of this court .", "( iii ) Neither the death penalty generally , nor the death penalty by hanging , is shown to be a crime against humanity or an act of torture .", "( iv ) Accordingly , even if GPE is exercising LAW , contrary to our opinion , it is obliged to return the appellants to the custody of the ORG . That is so before DATE ; a fortiori after DATE , when there will be no ORG mandate , no provision as between GPE and GPE granting inviolability to the NORP base or allowing for any detention of the appellants by the GPE forces , save to the order of the ORG . In short , GPE will have no colour of legal power whatever after DATE to do anything other than return the appellants to the order of the ORG . There will be no power to move the appellants anywhere else , nor indeed to prevent the NORP taking the appellants from NORP custody . NORP troops could not be ordered to take any steps to prevent that happening . Before DATE it is true that the base at GPE is inviolable under local arrangements made between GPE and GPE , but that inviolability ceases DATE . That is why GPE is thereafter entirely legally powerless to take action other than in compliance with the wishes of the ORG or to resist any action taken by the NORP authorities .", "( v ) No freestanding claim against GPE under customary international law can run , nor is there on the facts any viable claim under ORG , LAW . \u201d", "DATE . ORG refused the applicants permission to appeal to ORG , stating that :", "\u201c Certainly there are some important issues that have been raised but in the context of this case , having regard to the position that obtains post-CARDINAL DATE , it would not be right to grant permission . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also refused to grant the applicants interim relief pending either an application to ORG for permission to appeal and for interim relief , or to this ORG for interim measures . Shortly after TIME ORG lifted the injunction which had prevented the applicants\u2019 transfer until TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG handed down its full written judgment on DATE ( [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . It found , firstly , that there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicants would face a real risk of execution if they were transferred to the custody of the ORG , for the following reasons .", "\u201c It is common ground that the death penalty is a punishment available under NORP law for the offences with which the appellants are charged . ORG held ( paragraph CARDINAL ) that that was enough to give rise prima facie to a real risk of its being applied to the appellants . Accordingly , following the approach commended by ORG in GPE v. GPE ( application no . DATE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE ) , in particular at paragraph CARDINAL , the burden effectively shifted to the Secretary of ORG to show that such a risk was not in fact made out .", "Mr PERSON for the Secretary of ORG relied on evidence to the effect that the family of one of the victims had written to President PERSON of the ORG to seek clemency for the appellants if they were found guilty . President PERSON had earlier invited letters of this kind through the NORP embassy , indicating that it would be helpful if the embassy could waive claims to civil compensation and that he would then pass such letters to the trial chamber for their consideration . PERSON , Legal Adviser and Head of the Justice and Human Rights Section at the NORP embassy in GPE , has given evidence of legal advice to the effect that the impact of a plea of clemency by the families of the victims in GPE is likely to be that the NORP court \u2018 will not impose the death penalty in any particular ORG . PERSON says that President PERSON has confirmed that such a plea for clemency is likely to be an important factor for any court in assessing what sentence would be imposed on the claimants . She also produces a letter from President PERSON , given to her at a meeting on DATE , in which the court \u2019s procedures for considering sentence are described in some detail . ORG observed ( paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u2018 That letter represents President PERSON \u2019s considered written position . It is striking that the letter gives no indication whatsoever that the death penalty would not be or even probably would not be imposed.\u2019", "PERSON relied on the evidence of PERSON , an NORP attorney who was LAW to the ORG DATE and DATE . Mr ORG had also met President PERSON , on DATE . The President explained the factors which would influence the ORG against imposing a death sentence . These were \u2018 an admission of the crime by the claimants , a request for forgiveness from the family of the victims , a request for forgiveness of the court for the acts , and a request for leniency from the family of a victim\u2019 ( ORG , paragraph CARDINAL ) . Mr Spillers reported the President as indicating that an assurance that the death penalty would not be imposed was \u2018 implicit\u2019 in his account of these factors .", "Mr PERSON has provided a further statement since ORG judgment was delivered . He describes the outcome of the ORG proceedings in what has been called the DATE Uprising case . The CARDINAL defendants were all former high - ranking members of PERSON regime charged with crimes against humanity . CARDINAL were acquitted . CARDINAL received very substantial terms of imprisonment . Only the remaining CARDINAL were sentenced to death , including CARDINAL ( \u2018 ORG Ali\u2019 ) who was already under sentence of death following an earlier trial .", "...", "In my judgment there is no sufficient basis for departing from the balanced assessment of ORG on this point . Mr Spillers\u2019 new evidence concerning the DATE Uprising case , while helpful to the Secretary of ORG , is not so substantial as to overturn the lower court \u2019s conclusion . The real risk test is satisfied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In support of its conclusion that the applicants did not fall within GPE jurisdiction for the purposes of the Convention and LAW DATE , ORG observed as follows .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the GPE forces at GPE enjoyed the guarantees of immunity and inviolability provided by CPA Order No . CARDINAL ( Revised ) . But those measures prohibited invasive sanctions ; they did not confer executive power . In my judgment , from DATE until DATE , the NORP forces at GPE were not entitled to carry out any activities on GPE \u2019s territory in relation to criminal detainees save as consented to by GPE , or otherwise authorised by a binding resolution or resolutions of ORG . So much flows from the fact of GPE \u2019s sovereignty and is not contradicted \u2013 quite the reverse \u2013 by any of ORG measures in the case . Thus the ORG mandate was extended by ORG at GPE \u2019s express request . The letter requesting its extension ( which was attached to LAW ( DATE ) ) expressly stated at paragraph CARDINAL , \u2018 [ CARDINAL government of GPE will be responsible for arrest , detention and imprisonment ORG . The various material ORG ( DATE ) , DATE ) and DATE ( DATE ) ) all emphasise the primacy of NORP sovereignty . As regards criminal detentions , CPA Memorandum No . CARDINAL ( Revised ) makes it [ plain ] that so far as criminal detainees may be held by any national contingent of the ORG , they are held , in effect , to the order of the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . In these circumstances GPE was not before DATE exercising any power or jurisdiction in relation to the appellants other than as agent for the NORP court . It was not exercising , or purporting to exercise , any autonomous power of its own as a sovereign ORG .", "CARDINAL . As I stated earlier , once the mandate expired there remained under international law no trace or colour of any power or authority whatever for the ORG , or any part of it , to maintain any presence in GPE save only and strictly at the will of the NORP authorities . [ Counsel for the applicants ] sought to submit that the NORP base at GPE would by force of customary international law remain inviolable after DATE . But she was unable to identify any principle which might , on the facts , support that position ; and it is to my mind wholly inescapable that after that date NORP forces remaining in GPE have done so only by consent of the NORP authorities and on such terms as those authorities have agreed . And it must have been plain , as soon as it was known when the mandate would come to an end , that this would be the true state of affairs .", "CARDINAL . And there is no sensible room for doubt but that the terms on which NORP forces would be permitted to remain in GPE by the NORP authorities would not encompass any role or function which would permit , far less require , NORP ( or any other ) forces to continue to hold detainees . ...", "CARDINAL . After DATE NORP forces enjoyed no legal power to detain any NORP . Had they done so , the NORP authorities would have been entitled to enter the premises occupied by the NORP and recover any such person so detained .", "CARDINAL . It is not easy to identify precisely the scope of the LAW where it is said to be exercised outside the territory of the impugned ORG , because the learning makes it clear that its scope has no sharp edge ; it has to be ascertained from a combination of key ideas which are strategic rather than lexical . Drawing on the PERSON judgment and their Lordships\u2019 opinions in PERSON , I suggest that there are CARDINAL core propositions , though each needs some explanation . ( CARDINAL ) It is an exceptional jurisdiction . ( CARDINAL ) It is to be ascertained in harmony with other applicable norms of international law . ( CARDINAL ) It reflects the regional nature of the Convention rights . ( CARDINAL ) It reflects the indivisible nature of the Convention rights . The first and second of these propositions imply ( as perhaps does the term jurisdiction itself ) an exercise of sovereign legal authority , not merely de facto power , by CARDINAL ORG on the territory of another . That is of itself an exceptional state of affairs , though well recognised in some instances such as that of an embassy . The power must be given by law , since if it were given only by chance or strength its exercise would by no means be harmonious with material norms of international law , but offensive to them ; and there would be no principled basis on which the power could be said to be limited , and thus exceptional . ... It is impossible to reconcile a test of mere factual control with the limiting effect of the first CARDINAL propositions I have set out , and , indeed , that of DATE , as I shall explain .", "CARDINAL . These first CARDINAL propositions , understood as I have suggested , condition the others . If ORG is to exercise LAW outside its own territory , the regional and indivisible nature of the Convention rights requires the existence of a regime in which that ORG enjoys legal powers wide enough to allow its vindication , consistently with its obligations under international law , of the panoply of Convention rights \u2013 rights which may however , in the territory in question , represent an alien political philosophy .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s natural setting is the espace juridique of the GPE Parties ; if , exceptionally , its writ is to run elsewhere , this FAC juridique must in considerable measure be replicated . In short ORG must have the legal power to fulfil substantial governmental functions as a sovereign ORG . It may do so within a narrow scope , as an embassy , consulate , military base or prison ; it may , in order to do so , depend on the host ORG \u2019s consent or the mandate of ORG ; but however precisely exemplified , this is the kind of legal power the ORG must possess : it must enjoy the discretion to decide questions of a kind which ordinarily fall to the ORG \u2019s executive government . If the LAW is held to run in other circumstances , the limiting conditions imposed by the CARDINAL propositions I have set out will be undermined . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered the question of conflicting international - law obligations , which arose only if it was wrong about the lack of jurisdiction , and held that ORG had been correct in having regard to GPE obligation under international law to transfer the applicants to the custody of the ORG :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... ORG to the ORG , exercising LAW in a foreign territory , may certainly owe duties arising under international law to the host ORG . LAW [ on ORG , DATE ] , referred to in R(B ) at paragraph CARDINAL , offers an obvious platform for such a potential duty . In this case GPE was plainly obliged under international law to transfer the applicants pursuant to the ORG \u2019s request . In such instances , there may be a conflict between ORG obligations and its international obligations .", "CARDINAL . One solution might have been to hold that the existence of such an international obligation is incompatible with the exercise of LAW , because it would show that ORG legal power in the relevant foreign territory lacked the amplitude required to guarantee the Convention rights . In that case there would be no conflict . Such a comfort would of course be no comfort to the appellants \u2013 the duty to transfer them would without more negative the ORG jurisdiction , so that they would enjoy no Convention rights . However , such an outcome would , I think , have been consistent with PERSON ; but this is not the direction our courts have taken . Both PERSON and R(B ) recognise that a ORG may be fixed with potentially inconsistent obligations arising under the ORG and international law respectively .", "CARDINAL . With great respect I see no reason to doubt this position . While I have certainly asserted that the scope of the LAW has to accommodate the pressure on GPE Parties of international obligations apart from the ORG , it by no means follows that the ORG duty must always yield to the other obligation , so that no conflict can arise . No doubt it will be a matter for assessment in any case ( where the issue sensibly arises ) whether the international - law obligations are so pressing , or operate on so wide a front , as in effect to deprive the relevant ORG of the espace juridique which the LAW demands . They may not do so ; and where they do not , this court \u2019s decision in R(B ) shows the correct juridical approach . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicants\u2019 argument , based on GPE v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-IV ) , that where the proposed refoulement was to a ORG where after the trial the applicant might suffer the death penalty , no flagrant breach of the right to a fair trial under LAW needed to be shown , only a real risk of an unfair trial . The court observed that \u00d6calan was not a refoulement case and that in PERSON and GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-XI ) , the ORG had held that it was necessary in a deportation or extradition case for the applicant to establish a risk of suffering a flagrant denial of a fair trial in the receiving ORG , the outcome of which was or is likely to be the death penalty , before the ORG could find a violation of LAW . ORG accepted ORG assessment of the evidence about the fairness of proceedings before the ORG and therefore also dismissed the complaint under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG rejected the ORG argument under international law that execution by hanging fell to be regarded as a crime against humanity , inhuman or degrading treatment or a form of torture . While terrible errors occurred from time to time , where for example the hanged man \u2019s neck was not broken so that he suffocated , or the drop was too long so that he was decapitated , such evidence was anecdotal and partial . There was other evidence , such as that considered by ORG , in its report of DATE , which found that hanging was \u201c speedy and certain \u201d . The court concluded that , since the evidence before it regarding this method of execution was very limited , it was in no position to arrive at any overall finding as to the effects of hanging for the purpose of making an assessment of its compatibility or otherwise with norms of customary international law .", "CARDINAL .

In R(B ) v. Secretary of ORG for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , cited above , ORG observed as follows :", "\u201c In a case such as ORG commits no breach of international law by permitting an individual to remain within its territorial jurisdiction rather than removing him to another ORG . The same is not necessarily true where a ORG permits an individual to remain within the shelter of consular LOC rather than requiring him to leave . It does not seem to us that the LAW can require GPE to give refuge to fugitives within consular premises if to do so would violate international law . So to hold would be in fundamental conflict with the importance that FAC attached in GPE to principles of international law . Furthermore , there must be an implication that obligations under a Convention are to be interpreted , insofar as possible , in a manner that accords with international law . What has public international law to say about the right to afford \u2018 diplomatic PERSON ?", "Oppenheim [ ORG \u2019s International Law edited by the late Sir PERSON and Sir PERSON vol CARDINAL ] deals with this topic at paragraph CARDINAL , from which we propose to quote at a little length :", "\u2018 Paragraph CARDINAL : So - called diplomatic asylum", "The practice of granting diplomatic asylum in exceptional circumstances is of long - standing , but it is a matter of dispute to what extent it forms part of general international law .", "There would seem to be no general obligation on the part of the receiving ORG to grant an ambassador the right of affording asylum to a refugee , whether criminal or other , not belonging to this mission . Of course , an ambassador need not deny entrance to refugees seeking safety in the embassy . But as ORG noted in the ORG case ... in the absence of an established legal basis , such as is afforded by treaty or established custom , a refugee must be surrendered to the territorial authorities at their request and if surrender is refused , coercive measures may be taken to induce it . Bearing in mind the inviolability of embassy LOC , the permissible limits of such measures are not clear . The embassy may be surrounded by soldiers , and ingress and egress prevented ; but the legitimacy of forcing an entry in order forcibly to remove the refugee is doubtful , and measures involving an attack on the envoy \u2019s person would clearly be unlawful . Coercive measures are in any case justifiable only in an urgent case , and after the envoy has in vain been requested to surrender the refugee .", "It is sometimes suggested that there is , exceptionally , a right to grant asylum on grounds of urgent and compelling reasons of humanity , usually involving the refugee \u2019s life being in imminent jeopardy from arbitrary action . The practice of GPE has afforded instances of the grant of asylum in such circumstances . The grant of asylum \u2018 against the violent and disorderly action of irresponsible sections of the population\u2019 is a legal right which , on grounds of humanity , may be exercised irrespective of treaty ; the territorial authorities are bound to grant full protection to a diplomatic mission providing shelter for refugees in such circumstances . There is some uncertainty how far compelling reasons of humanity may justify the grant of asylum in other cases . ORG judgment in the ORG case suggests that the grant of asylum may be justified where \u2018 in the guise of justice , arbitrary action is substituted for the rule of law . Such would be the case if the administration of justice were corrupted by measures clearly prompted by political ORG . However , the ORG went on to emphasise that \u2018 the safety which arises out of asylum can not be construed as a protection against the regular application of the laws and against the jurisdiction of legally constituted ORG . Thus it would seem not to be enough to show that a refugee is to be tried for a \u2018 political\u2019 offence : it must be shown that justice would be subordinated to political dictation and the usual judicial guarantees disregarded . Even where permissible , asylum is only a temporary expedient and may only be afforded so long as the reasons justifying it continue to subsist.\u2019", "The propositions in ORG are based , to a large extent , on what seem to be the only juridical pronouncements on the topic to carry authority . On DATE ORG gave judgment in a dispute between GPE and GPE that GPE had referred to ORG GPE ) ( DATE ) ICJ Rep. CARDINAL . GPE had given refuge in its embassy in GPE to the leader of a military rebellion , which had been almost instantaneously suppressed . At issue was the effect of CARDINAL Conventions to which both GPE and GPE were party which made provision in relation to the grant of asylum to political refugees but not to criminals . GPE \u2019s arguments included the contention that by customary international law it was open to GPE unilaterally to determine that the fugitive fell to be classified as a political refugee . Much of the judgment related to the effects of the CARDINAL Conventions , but the ORG made some general comments in relation to \u2018 diplomatic asylum\u2019 :", "\u2018 The arguments submitted in this respect reveal a confusion between territorial asylum ( extradition ) , on the one hand , and diplomatic asylum , on the other .", "In the case of extradition , the refugee is within the territory of the ORG of refuge . A decision with regard to extradition implies only the normal exercise of the territorial sovereignty . The refugee is outside the territory of the ORG where the offence was committed , and a decision to grant him asylum in no way derogates from the sovereignty of that ORG .", "In the case of diplomatic asylum , the refugee is within the territory of the ORG where the offence was committed . A decision to grant diplomatic asylum involves a derogation from the sovereignty of that ORG . It withdraws the offender from the jurisdiction of the territorial ORG and constitutes an intervention in matters which are exclusively within the competence of the ORG . Such a derogation from territorial sovereignty can not be recognised unless its legal basis is established in each particular ORG", "In DATE CARDINAL fugitives who were subject to detention orders issued by the NORP government sought refuge in FAC in GPE . They became known as the GPE CARDINAL . ORG decided that it would not compel them to leave but that it would not intervene on their behalf with the NORP authorities . They were told that they could not stay indefinitely and , eventually they left . CARDINAL of them were immediately arrested and charged with high treason , which carried the death penalty . We were referred to an LAW ( CARDINAL ) by PERSON , which included the following propositions :", "\u2018 There exists no universally accepted international agreement to assure a uniform response by ORG to grant refuge in a mission in an emergency . Most countries , with the exception of those in LOC , deny outright the claim to diplomatic asylum because it encroaches upon the ORG \u2019s sovereignty .", "Some countries give limited recognition to the practice , allowing \u2018 temporary safe stay\u2019 on a case - by - case basis to persons under threat of life and limb . It should be recognised that a ORG has the permissible response of granting temporary sanctuary to individuals or groups in utter desperation who face repressive measures in their home countries . Moreover , this should be considered a basic human right , to be invoked by those fleeing from the persecution for reasons of race , religion , or nationality , or for holding a political opinion in an emergency situation involving the threat of ORG", "Discussion", "We have concluded that , if the PERSON approach is to be applied to diplomatic asylum , the duty to provide refuge can only arise under the Convention where this is compatible with public international law . Where a fugitive is facing the risk of death or injury as the result of lawless disorder , no breach of international law will be occasioned by affording him refuge . Where , however , the receiving ORG requests that the fugitive be handed over the situation is very different . The basic principle is that the authorities of the receiving ORG can require surrender of a fugitive in respect of whom they wish to exercise the authority that arises from their territorial jurisdiction ; see LAW . Where such a request is made the LAW can not normally require the diplomatic authorities of the sending ORG to permit the fugitive to remain within the diplomatic LOC in defiance of the receiving ORG . Should it be clear , however , that the receiving ORG intends to subject the fugitive to treatment so harsh as to constitute a crime against humanity , international law must surely permit the officials of the sending ORG to do all that is reasonably possible , including allowing the fugitive to take refuge in the diplomatic LOC , in order to protect him against such treatment . In such circumstances the Convention may well impose a duty on a Contracting State to afford diplomatic asylum .", "It may be that there is a lesser level of threatened harm that will justify the assertion of an entitlement under international law to grant diplomatic asylum . This is an area where the law is ill - defined . So far as NORP law was concerned , the applicants had escaped from lawful detention under the provisions of LAW . On the face of it international law entitled the NORP authorities to demand their return . We do not consider that the GPE officials could be required by the ORG and LAW to decline to hand over the applicants unless this was clearly necessary in order to protect them from the immediate likelihood of experiencing serious injury . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

For countries which have de facto and de jure abolished the death penalty ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ( observer ) , GPE and GPE ) , or which maintain a moratorium ( NORP Federation ) , the ratification of LAW to the ORG would be a valuable gesture of political support for abolition , and would contribute to further isolating the remaining retentionist countries .", "CARDINAL .

The bill aims to delete from LAW the following words : \u2018 unless in the cases provided for by military laws in case of war\u2019 , thus eliminating any reference to the death penalty in LAW and making it possible to ratify LAW . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Also , the ORG reiterates its view , noted in LAW ( DATE ) on the position of ORG as regards ORG member and observer GPE which have not abolished the death penalty , that the death penalty should be abolished in GPE , GPE and GPE , and that the sentences of all prisoners currently on death row in these territories should be immediately commuted to terms of imprisonment in order to put an end to the cruel and inhuman treatment of those who have been kept on death row for DATE in a state of uncertainty as to their ultimate fate .", "CARDINAL . The ORG fully supports the Conference to establish a NORP Day against the Death Penalty , to be held in GPE on DATE , and expects all member ORG also to show their unstinting support . Given its pioneering work on the abolition of the death penalty in LOC and beyond , the ORG must play a central role , including through involvement in the drafting of the joint declaration , which its President should co - sign at the inaugural conference .
