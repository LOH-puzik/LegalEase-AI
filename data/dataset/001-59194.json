The verbatim record of the interview records this part of the proceedings as follows :", "\u201c Q [ Question ] On DATE Mr PERSON sent the private office a draft contract for a preliminary study to be carried out among small and medium - sized businesses in the GPE area for a total fee of CARDINAL net of ORG .

Did you have instructions to do that ? Did you inform yourself about the possibility of a call for tenders for the creation of such a data bank ?", "A [ Answer ] I had no instruction to do that . As for finding out about calls for tenders , I left that to the administration , for the reasons I have already mentioned .", "...", "Q What is the procedure to be followed where the ORG inspector 's opinion on a draft contract is unfavourable ?", "A I now know that it was possible to apply to the regional government for arbitration . At the time , I was unaware of that procedure and nobody told me about it . I was determined to get things moving and the opinion of the ORG inspector , L. in this case , concentrated very much on the regulations and was little concerned with financial viability . In substance , I was irked by the inflexibility and resistance to change of the ORG inspectorate . In my private office I was advised to do things differently , namely to split the contract into CARDINAL parts so that the fees would be lower than the CARDINAL threshold triggering compulsory scrutiny by the ORG inspector . I must emphasise that , despite doing things that way , I once again submitted the subdivided project to the ORG inspector , but the second time he gave a favourable opinion .", "Q Here you see CARDINAL contracts signed on DATE between LOC , represented by Minister PERSON , and the \u201c I \u201d association , represented by Mr PERSON ( see appendices CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the expert report ) . Each of these contracts concerns a preliminary study to be carried out among small and medium - sized businesses in the GPE area to determine which of them would be interested in appearing in a data bank as described in the initial project . Each of these contracts concerns CARDINAL of the CARDINAL above - mentioned criteria . They represent a total cost for the preliminary study of CARDINAL net of ORG , as compared with the initial project , which would have cost CARDINAL net of ORG . Did not that reduction result from the need to split the initial project into CARDINAL , since there were CARDINAL criteria , while at the same time making sure that none of the CARDINAL contracts exceeded CARDINAL net of ORG , the threshold for intervention by the ORG inspector ?", "A I wish to make it clear that I once again requested the opinion of the ORG inspectorate even though in each case the fee was below the BEF CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL threshold . I would also point out that splitting the project into CARDINAL led to a significant reduction in cost amounting to PERCENT of the overall fees .", "Q Does the fact that Mr PERSON agreed to do the same work for LAW not show that the initial contract accepted by the private office and the administration was overpriced ?", "A NORP Your point about the initial price is not wrong , but the agreement on CARDINAL was probably the result of a tripartite or quadripartite agreement between the private office , the administration , the ORG inspectorate and \u201c I \u201d . That is a guess , because I ca n't remember the precise details of that transaction now .", "...", "Q Here is the commitment slip for CARDINAL of the contracts signed with \u201c I \u201d on DATE . This document bears the signature of ORG inspector PERSON , dated DATE , authorising the expenditure . Could Mr L. have opposed implementation of the contract , his opinion not having been sought , it would appear , before it was signed ?", "A I would observe on this point that I was not obliged to submit the file to PERSON in view of the size of the fee . But as I was working more with the administration than with the private office , the administration automatically sent the ad hoc expenditure commitment slip to the ORG inspector for authorisation . In my opinion , PERSON must have received the contract before it was signed .", "Q When these CARDINAL contracts were received the administration gave them CARDINAL commitment number , which was the number of CARDINAL of them ( see appendices CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the same report ) . Here is another series of documents which indicate that the administrative authorities wrongly thought they were dealing with a single contract , so much so that when \u201c I \u201d sent them CARDINAL invoices for part - payment of each of the CARDINAL contracts PERSON informed PERSON that he thought \u201c I \u201d must have made a mistake . In fact , he requested CARDINAL original copies of what he believed to be a single invoice and these copies could not bear CARDINAL different numbers ( see appendices CARDINAL of the same report ) . So PERSON could only have authorised expenditure in respect of CARDINAL commitment slip relating to a single contract ?", "A Yes , that 's true . But it 's not my fault . The paperwork was entirely a matter for the administration .", "...", "Q As regards approval of expenditure by the ORG inspectorate in respect of contracts where the fee was lower than its intervention threshold , was it still possible for the inspector to give his views on the advisability of proceeding ?", "A It is true that from the administrative - law point of view his approval does not seem to be required for the commitment of such sums . However , as far as I am concerned , and in view of my lack of technical experience of budgetary matters , I preferred on all occasions to seek the approval of the ORG inspector , seeing that for me this represented a guarantee of lawfulness from the Minister 's budgetary adviser . Therefore , if PERSON had formally refused to sign the commitment slip , I would not have gone ahead . You tell me that there is a contradiction between what I am telling you and the splitting of the original project refused by PERSON My reply is that I was advised to do things that way and that I made sure that PERSON approved the CARDINAL new contracts .", "Having read through the above record , [ Mr Stalport ] stands by his statements and adds his signature to ours . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By a DATE letter of DATE ORG at ORG transmitted to the President of ORG \u201c a file disclosing , in [ his ] opinion , evidence of offences committed by PERSON ...

The letter implicated another minister , a former minister and CARDINAL other members of parliament , although ORG considered that in respect of CARDINAL of these prosecution was probably time - barred .", "ORG also mentioned a general problem concerning limitation of prosecution arising from the fact that under LAW of DATE , which had come into force on DATE , the limitation period had been extended from DATE and the change applied to \u201c all prosecutions brought before the PERSON 's entry into force which have not yet become time - barred by that date \u201d . ORG accordingly submitted the following opinion : \u201c In the present case all the offences committed before DATE , at least , are subject to limitation . In respect of the offences committed after that date the first DATE time - limit , expiring on DATE , began to run . The first procedural step causing time to begin to run again occurred in DATE , more specifically on DATE , when the information in writing was laid before the investigating judge . \u201d", "ORG sent this report to the President of ORG to enable the ORG to \u201c exercise the prerogatives conferred on it by LAW . He further requested , in any event , the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of the CARDINAL ministers implicated , including PERSON and Minister PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG , sitting on DATE in plenary session , set up a special committee composed in accordance with the proportional representation rule .

On DATE this recommendation was adopted in exactly the same terms by ORG by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , with CARDINAL abstentions .", "CARDINAL . After ORG had reached this decision , ORG at ORG asked the President of ORG , in the interests of the proper administration of justice , to appoint a judge of the ORG , as a matter of urgency , as investigating judge , with the task of extending and continuing the investigation of the facts in close collaboration with the investigating judge dealing with the case .", "CARDINAL .

In addition to PERSON , the prosecuting authorities at ORG decided to prosecute before that court CARDINAL other defendants , including the other CARDINAL applicants . They considered that the investigation had revealed a system for the illegal financing of the activities of certain politicians . This involved public authorities entering into contracts for the provision of over - priced services so that the provider of the services could transfer a portion of the sums paid to third parties in order to cover the costs of the activities in question . The practices concerned consisted in negotiating and signing contracts for various opinion polls or surveys to be conducted mainly by \u201c I \u201d for the \u201c benefit \u201d of government ministries . The prices stipulated in these contracts were too high in relation to the real cost of the surveys carried out and their likely benefits . In addition , care had been taken to avoid the competitive procedure laid down for contracts entered into by the administrative authorities , which might have prevented \u201c I \u201d from winning some of these contracts , and internal checks carried out by the administrative authorities , mainly by ORG inspectors , which might have revealed the fact that some of them were over - priced . In order to do so , care had been taken to ensure that the thresholds which triggered application of the regulations and circulars relevant to public works and supply contracts and of the administrative authorities ' internal control procedures were not exceeded . The prosecuting authorities also accused some defendants ( including Mr PERSON ) of obtaining the payment of certain fees by false pretences . Lastly , they considered that although CARDINAL of the applicants , Mr Stalport and PERSON , had obtained no financial gain from these contracts , they had taken part in drawing them up .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE ORG at ORG held a meeting with the lawyers of CARDINAL of the persons under investigation , including PERSON and PERSON , to inform them of the measures taken for organisation of the trial . He handed them copies of the summons he intended to serve on their clients and allegedly suggested that the case should come on in DATE . When the lawyers protested , he apparently put off the trial until DATE , despite the reservations they expressed about the shortness of the time they had been given to prepare their clients ' defence . He also allegedly told them that the trial in ORG would follow the procedure of the ordinary criminal courts .", "Mr Stalport was not invited to this meeting . He explained that at that time he had not consulted a lawyer , not considering himself to be implicated .", "CARDINAL . By summonses served CARDINAL DATE the QUANTITY persons under investigation by the prosecuting authorities at ORG were summoned to appear in that court on DATE , to answer various charges relating to offences allegedly committed in connection with public supply contracts awarded to \u201c I \u201d , at a time when PERSON PERSON was a member of the government .", "Mr PERSON was the only defendant to whom LAW applied ; the others were summoned , pursuant to ORG and CARDINAL of LAW , on account of the connection between the offences they stood accused of and the charges PERSON had to answer .", "CARDINAL .

The defendants concerned lodged pleadings to that end . By an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG ruled that these defendants had had sufficient time to prepare their arguments regarding both the criminal and the civil aspects of the case .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE Mr PERSON filed a first pleading concerning the fact that no legislation had been enacted to implement Article CARDINAL of the LAW , despite the expressly stated intention of ORG . This legislative deficiency had caused the provision originally intended to be transitional , adopted by ORG to fill the legal vacuum \u2013 namely LAW , which had later become the transitional provision of LAW to remain in force indefinitely .", "He submitted in the first place that although the constitutional revision of CARDINAL DATE had replaced the words \u201c and in so doing classify the offence and determine the appropriate sentence \u201d in the transitional provision of LAW with \u201c in the cases contemplated by the criminal law and applying the penalties laid down therein \u201d , this constitutional revision could not apply retrospectively to the charges against him concerning offences committed DATE and DATE without breaching LAW .", "He further submitted that , although the transitional provision gave ORG discretion to try ministers indicted by ORG as regards the question of their guilt and the penalties to be imposed , it did not confer on either ORG or ORG an analogous power concerning the procedure to be followed in such proceedings . ORG had therefore imposed the applicable procedural rules on its own authority , contrary to the principle that a tribunal 's procedure must be established by law .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE Mr PERSON filed a second pleading concerning the procedure followed by the special committee of ORG and reference of the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE Mr ORG filed a pleading arguing that no provision of NORP law permitted his committal for trial in ORG as court of first instance . In a separate pleading he further submitted that there was no connection between the offence he stood accused of and the offence allegedly committed by PERSON . If ORG thought otherwise , it should refer a preliminary question to ORG as to whether legal provisions which permitted a defendant who was not a minister to be committed for trial in ORG infringed the principles of equality and non - discrimination . He therefore asked ORG to rule that it did not have jurisdiction to try him in the absence of any connection or , in the alternative , to submit to ORG the following preliminary question :", "\u201c In so far as ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW have the effect of referring to ORG , sitting as a court of trial , criminal proceedings against a defendant who is not a minister , do they breach Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW taken together with LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE Mr PERSON filed a third pleading in which he asked ORG to stay its decision on the prosecution 's submissions until ORG had answered the following preliminary question :", "\u201c Does the extension of the limitation period for criminal proceedings resulting from LAW DATE containing the preliminary part of LAW , as amended by LAW , in so far as that provision applies to all prosecutions brought before its entry into force which were not yet time - barred on that date and introduces longer limitation periods , create discrimination contrary to LAW in relation to the situation of persons who are subject , on account of the date on which their offences were committed , to the limitation period laid down in the former version of the above - mentioned LAW ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the beginning of the hearing on CARDINAL DATE the President read out an interlocutory judgment in which ORG ruled that the case had been lawfully referred to it , that it had jurisdiction to hear it and that it was not necessary to refer to ORG the preliminary questions proposed by the defendants on the principle of connection . In the reasons for its judgment ORG held : \u201c The transitional provision in LAW ... applies both to the offences committed after the constitutional revision of CARDINAL DATE and to those committed before it \u201d . It went on to say that its discretion was limited by the obligation to follow certain procedural rules and added :", "\u201c Where ORG is sitting as a court of trial it must comply , in procedural matters , with the provisions \u2013 directly applicable in NORP law \u2013 of ORG and LAW , with the LAW , with the rules of LAW , with the common provisions applicable to all criminal proceedings and with the general principles of law .", "In giving ORG the power to try ministers ' in those cases where the criminal law so provides ' , the framers of the LAW were necessarily referring , as regards the form of procedure , to the CARDINAL laid down by ORG for such cases , namely LAW , in so far as that is compatible with the provisions governing procedure before ORG when it sits as a full court .", "To that extent , this ORG will apply the procedural rules laid down in Book II , Part CARDINAL , LAW of LAW , entitled ' The criminal courts ' .", "These rules , which are prescribed by law , accessible and foreseeable as to their effects , guarantee full exercise of the right to due process and to a fair trial .", "In applying existing rules , the ORG is not usurping the function of the legislature . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
