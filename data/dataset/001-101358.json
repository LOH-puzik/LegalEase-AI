The applicants were born DATE and live in different cities in the former GPE .", "CARDINAL . They were toll collectors , controllers or senior staff ( \u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 ) in a public roads enterprise .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were detained in several police stations in GPE , some on DATE and some on DATE on suspicion of abuse of office , namely that they had acted as an organised group and misappropriated over MONEY ( ORG ) from toll charges collected DATE . An individual report was drawn up for the detention of each applicant .", "CARDINAL . A group of applicants were brought before an investigating judge of ORG ( \u201c the trial court \u201d ) on DATE , and the remainder on DATE . By CARDINAL separate decisions of CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE respectively , after having heard oral evidence from the applicants , the investigating judge started the investigation and remanded them in custody . The orders were based on all the grounds specified in section CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely a risk of absconding and reoffending , and of interference with the investigation . The judge relied on the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty and the fact that the applicants had acted as a well organised group .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL applicants and other co - accused appealed against the detention order , requesting its replacement by a more lenient measure . The appellants relied on their family situation in the respondent State , the absence of a previous criminal record , the fact that some of them had appeared voluntarily in police stations and the failure of the investigating judge to give concrete reasons justifying the detention of each of them separately . A CARDINAL - judge panel of the trial court ( \u201c the panel \u201d ) , set up under section QUANTITY of the LAW , dismissed appeals submitted by CARDINAL applicants . No evidence was produced that the panel decided the remaining appeals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , the panel extended the applicants ' detention for DATE on all CARDINAL counts specified under section CARDINAL of the LAW . The risk of absconding was justified by the gravity of the charges , the potential penalty and the fact that CARDINAL applicants had no possessions and no family in the respondent ORG . CARDINAL applicants appealed , alleging lack of reasons . Their requests for a more lenient measure were supported with evidence about their poor health , copies of their passports and certificates attesting to their possessions in the respondent ORG . Some of them also requested release on bail .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , ORG dismissed the appeals and confirmed the orders . Only in respect of Mr PERSON , who produced the original copy of his employer 's decision dismissing him from work , did the court exclude \u201c the possibility of reoffending \u201d from the list of grounds for his detention . It did not admit in evidence the uncertified copies of the dismissal decisions submitted by the other appellants . As to the remainder , it stated inter alia :", "\u201c ... circumstances related to the type and nature of the criminal offence for which the investigation has started against the accused , the potential penalty prescribed for the offence , as well as the personal circumstances of the accused , taken as a whole , suggest that there is a real risk of flight if they are released at this stage of the proceedings ... a reasonable risk that they may interfere with the investigation , as well as grounds to reoffend ... it is this court 's view that there are no statutory grounds at this stage of the proceedings to replace custody with a more lenient measure that would guarantee that the accused would appear for trial ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigation was subsequently extended and involved , in total , CARDINAL accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , the panel extended the applicants ' pre - trial detention for DATE , relying on all the grounds specified in section CARDINAL of the Act , namely the risk of absconding and reoffending , and of interference with the investigation . CARDINAL applicants appealed against these orders , seeking release .", "CARDINAL . With decisions of DATE and DATE respectively , ORG ruled partly in favour of those applicants who appealed and presented originals or certified copies of the employer 's decisions dismissing them from work . \u201c The possibility of them reoffending \u201d was no longer relied on as a ground for their continued detention . Furthermore , of its own motion and relying on section CARDINAL of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the court excluded in respect of all the accused included in the panel 's decision of DATE , \u201c the possibility of them interfering with the investigation \u201d from the list of grounds for their detention . In so doing it reasoned that the accused could not interfere with the examination of protected witnesses and the viewing of a DVD , which were the only remaining investigative measures . The court confirmed the panel 's concern about the risk of flight , however , relying on the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor lodged an indictment against all the accused , including the applicants . On DATE , the panel partly upheld the public prosecutor 's request and extended the applicants ' detention , but only on account of the risk of them absconding . In this connection it stated :", "\u201c ... the detention in prison is justified given the fact that there is a real risk of flight in view of the gravity and nature of the offences with which the accused are charged , and the potential penalty ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was challenged by CARDINAL accused , including CARDINAL applicants . They alleged that the panel had not given sufficient reasons to substantiate the risk of them absconding , given their family situation , their state of health , the absence of any previous criminal record and the fact that some of them had already had their passports seized .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the panel 's decision , stating that the risk of flight was substantiated by the gravity of the charges , the potential penalty and the way in which the offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . By individual decisions rendered DATE and DATE , PERSON and PERSON were released on bail . PERSON Jovanovska , and ORG , were also released on condition that they appeared in court on a regular basis . These decisions were given in response to separate requests from these applicants for the detention order to be replaced by a more lenient measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the panel ordered a DATE extension of the pre - trial detention of the remaining applicants . \u201c The risk of them absconding \u201d was once again based , in respect of all of them , on the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty . CARDINAL accused appealed against that decision , including CARDINAL applicants who argued that the panel had not given specific reasons to substantiate the risk of them absconding . They submitted that they had not gone into hiding ; their identity was known and they had appeared in court regularly . ORG dismissed those arguments , holding that the risk of flight lay in the nature of the offence , the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial started . Given the high number of accused , the trial court decided to hold hearings outside the court building . After taking oral evidence from the applicants , on DATE the trial court accepted the proposal of the public prosecutor and replaced the order for prison custody with an order for house arrest in respect of all remaining applicants , except Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , PERSON PERSON ORG , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , who remained in prison . In taking that decision the court relied on section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , under which prison custody should be as brief as possible . The police were also ordered to supervise compliance with the house arrest . For the same reasons as in earlier decisions , the detention in respect of the remaining applicants was ordered on account of the risk of them absconding .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that only Mr PERSON appealed against that decision . On DATE his appeal was dismissed with the explanation that the panel had given sufficient reasons for extending his detention , namely that the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty pointed to a risk of him absconding .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the panel extended the detention of the remaining applicants for the same reasons as before . On DATE , of its own motion , the panel substituted the order for detention in prison with an order for house arrest in respect of the CARDINAL applicants mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , the house arrest of the remaining applicants was extended on several occasions . The extension was grounded on their potential to abscond in view , once more , of the gravity of the charges and the potential penalty .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE , the panel extended the house arrest for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... the criminal proceedings are about to end ... for the sake of expediency it is considered that the risk of flight still persists in view of the gravity of the charges , the potential penalty and the number of accused , suggesting the need to extend the house arrest as the most lenient means of securing attendance at the trial ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In decisions of CARDINAL and DATE respectively , the panel gave the same reasons for extending the house arrest of the remaining applicants . For failure to comply with the house arrest order , Mr PERSON PERSON and Mr PERSON were ordered to be sent back to prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court found the applicants guilty and imposed a prison sentence in respect of CARDINAL applicants and a suspended sentence in respect of the others . As the trial had ended and the applicants had a permanent residence and family in the respondent ORG , the court also ordered their release , considering that there was no risk of them absconding .", "CARDINAL . At a public hearing held on DATE and DATE , ORG quashed the trial court 's decision and referred the case for fresh consideration . It would appear that the proceedings are pending at the trial level .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , the applicants made numerous unsuccessful requests for their detention in prison to be replaced by a more lenient measure , or sought their release on bail .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of DATE provides for a CARDINAL - judge panel of the trial court to rule , inter alia , on appeals against decisions of the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . The Act specifies the measures which the court may issue in order to secure the attendance of an accused at a trial ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Act detention in prison should be as brief as possible .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) of the LAW detention in prison may be ordered on reasonable suspicion that the person concerned has committed an offence if there is a risk of absconding , interference with the investigation or reoffending .", "CARDINAL .
