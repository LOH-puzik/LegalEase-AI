In TIME of CARDINAL September CARDINAL it was discovered that a bag with medicines had been stolen from a pharmacy in GPE TIME . The police inspected the crime scene and took fingerprints , but the ensuing tests could not establish to whom they belonged .", "CARDINAL . DATE , DATE , police officer GPE , who was in charge of the area where the applicant resided , visited the applicant at his GPE home , where he lived . The officer invited the applicant to the police station , where the applicant apparently confessed to stealing the bag . The applicant then took the officer back to his home and produced the bag . After that both of them went again to the police station , where a record was drawn up stating that the applicant had voluntarily surrendered the bag , explaining that he had found it near a kindergarten . When later testifying at the trial against him , the applicant said that he had voluntarily followed the officer to the station and had been aware that he could refuse to go there . After surrendering the bag , the applicant was charged and interviewed by an investigator . He said that he understood the charge , was aware of his right to counsel but chose not to have one , and would make a statement . He then went on to confess to stealing the bag . He also said that he had not been sure what to do with the medicines and had decided to surrender them to the police . He expressed regret for his actions .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the police investigator in charge of the case interviewed witnesses and gathered written and expert evidence . On DATE he proposed that the applicant be brought to trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted . His trial took place on DATE and DATE and CARDINAL and DATE before ORG . At the outset the court apprised the applicant of his right to counsel , but he said that he did not wish to have one . The court heard as witnesses the owner and an employee of the pharmacy , QUANTITY police officers who had patrolled the area on TIME the theft , the applicant \u2019s father and officer GPE It also admitted in evidence , among other items , written statements by other officers who had patrolled the area , and the record stating that the applicant had surrendered the bag . The applicant initially objected to officer GPE testifying on the ground that he had taken part in the investigation . However , noting from documents presented to him in the courtroom that this was not the case , he withdrew his objection and the court allowed officer GPE to testify .", "CARDINAL . Officer GPE said that , having learned about the theft , he had visited the applicant at his GPE home and had invited him to go to the police station for \u201c a conversation \u201d , because the applicant \u2019s name featured on a list of offenders who had previously committed thefts . During the conversation the applicant had confessed to committing the theft , specifying that he had done so to obtain money which he needed for his defence in other criminal cases against him , but not providing any details as to the manner in which he had gone about perpetrating the offence . He had also agreed to produce the stolen medicines , and , although at first asserting that they were not at his GPE home , had later on admitted that they were there . He had then taken officer GPE to his GPE home and had produced the medicines . After that , the officer and the applicant had returned to the police station , where the applicant had signed a record to the effect that he was surrendering the medicines voluntarily . This had obviated the need formally to impound them .", "CARDINAL . In his closing speech the applicant pointed out , inter alia , that officer GPE was employed by the criminal investigation department of ORG , and was in charge of the area in which the theft had taken place and where the applicant lived . He had thus been under pressure to identify the person who had committed the theft . His testimony was the only evidence linking the applicant to the commission of the offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment . It based its finding that the applicant had stolen the medicines chiefly on the testimony of officer GPE It noted that that testimony was fully corroborated by the statements made by the applicant during his interview with the investigator , but added that it could not take those statements into account because they had not been given in the presence of a judge ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court went on to say that officer GPE \u2019s testimony was corroborated , albeit indirectly , by the statements of the officers who had patrolled the area around the pharmacy at the time when the theft had taken place .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the court of its own motion decided to combine the sentences imposed in DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) . The resulting sentence , determined in line with the relevant sentencing rules , was QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment . Applying a rule which allowed the combined sentence to be increased by DATE , and taking into account the periods which the applicant had already spent in prison , the court ordered that the total amount of time which he was to serve under the combined sentence was DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment the court noted that the applicant was unemployed and was financially dependent on his parents .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that it had not been proved that he had stolen the medicines , and , in the alternative , that his sentence was too harsh . He also said , without giving particulars , that the proceedings against him had been in breach of the rules of criminal procedure and of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The court examined the case at CARDINAL hearings . At DATE of those hearings it heard a number of witnesses . At the third , noting that a judge who had taken part in the first CARDINAL hearings could not continue to sit in the case , the court decided to start hearing the case afresh .", "CARDINAL . At that third hearing , held on DATE , the applicant called CARDINAL witnesses with a view to undermining officer GPE \u2019s credibility . The court acceded to his request over the prosecution \u2019s objection . The first witness said that when investigating a theft of which he had been suspected by officer GPE of committing , officer GPE had threatened him that he would frame him in the same way in which he had framed the applicant . The second witness , detained in the same facility as the applicant , said that officer GPE , when arresting him in relation to other offences , had enquired whether he had been aware of any offences committed by the applicant . The tone of his voice had indicated that he bore a personal animosity towards the applicant and wished to frame him . After that the court heard officer GPE , who repeated his account of the events of DATE . He additionally said that he knew the witnesses called by the applicant , who were either suspected of criminal offences or had previous convictions , and that their statements were not truthful . The court organised a confrontation between them and officer GPE All CARDINAL reiterated their positions . Officer PERSON was then crossexamined by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At the close of the hearing the applicant , saying that he could not afford to retain counsel , asked the court to appoint CARDINAL for him . The prosecution objected , observing that the applicant had not made such a request during the preliminary investigation and before the firstinstance court . The applicant retorted that he had changed his mind . The court , relying on a declaration about the applicant \u2019s financial situation , decided to appoint counsel for him under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . At the last hearing , held on DATE , the court once again heard officer GPE It also heard the parties\u2019 closing arguments . The applicant pointed out that the only evidence linking him to the commission of the offence was the officer \u2019s testimony , which was highly suspect and could be the result of collusion between him and the prosecution . Moreover , the officer bore a personal animosity towards him because he had dealt with him on many previous occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and sentence . It agreed with the lower court \u2019s findings of fact , but observed that it had erred in even mentioning the statement made by the applicant during his interview with the investigator \u2013 this was not admissible evidence . However , there was other evidence showing that the applicant had committed the theft . This was , in the first place , officer GPE \u2019s testimony , which was coherent and reliable . The court analysed in detail the challenge to officer GPE \u2019s credibility and concluded that it could not be thrown into doubt by the statements of the CARDINAL witnesses called by the applicant . It also observed that officer GPE \u2019s testimony was corroborated by indirect evidence , such as the record of voluntary surrender signed by the applicant . After that the court gave detailed reasons why it did not believe the statements of the CARDINAL witnesses who had purported to provide an alibi for the applicant and the testimony of the applicant \u2019s father .", "CARDINAL . The court additionally dealt with the question of the combination of the sentences imposed in DATE and DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , and upheld the lower court \u2019s ruling on that point .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law . In a twelvepage additional brief he argued that the lower courts had erred in assessing the evidence . In particular , they had lent too much credence to officer GPE \u2019s testimony , which was not supported by other evidence , was unspecific , hearsay , based on an informal conversation which had taken place before the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant , and had been possibly due to officer GPE \u2019s personal animosity towards the applicant . The lower courts had also failed to analyse properly the testimony of the witnesses called by the applicant . The applicant went on to argue that the lower courts had incorrectly combined his earlier sentences . Lastly , he asked the court to reduce his sentence with a view to providing reparation for the excessive length of the proceedings against him . The brief , although signed by the applicant , gave the impression of having been drafted by a lawyer : it used terms of art , contained numerous citations of caselaw and referred to the applicant in the third person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to appoint counsel for him . Referring to LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he pointed out that he did not have the means to retain one because he was unemployed , that he risked imprisonment , and that he was unable to conduct effectively his defence in person .", "CARDINAL . ORG heard the appeal on DATE . The hearing was not attended by the applicant , but was attended by a public prosecutor . The prosecutor opposed the applicant \u2019s request for the appointment of counsel , saying that this was not mandatory . The court turned the applicant \u2019s request down . It said that the applicant had not pointed out why he had been unable to retain counsel , that he had had a courtappointed counsel in the proceedings before the lower court , and that the manner in which his appeal on points of law had been drafted made it clear that it had been prepared with the help of a qualified lawyer . After that , the court heard the prosecutor , who submitted that the applicant \u2019s appeal should be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ( \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 CARDINAL \u043e\u0442 CARDINAL \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 DATE \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u043d. \u0434. \u2116 CARDINAL \u0433. , ORG , ORG \u043d. \u043e. ) ORG upheld all parts of the lower court \u2019s judgment save the part in which it had confirmed the increase of the applicant \u2019s combined earlier sentence to DATE . It found that there had been no grounds to increase that sentence from DATE , because the applicant had served it DATE and an increase would not further the aims of the punishment . As for the merits of the criminal case against the applicant , the court observed that , in the absence of breaches of procedural rules on the part of the lower courts , it was not competent to deal with arguments concerning the assessment of evidence and those ORG findings of fact . There was no appearance of a breach of the rules of procedure and no error in the application of the substantive law . The applicant \u2019s arguments concerning the establishment of the facts had been rejected by the lower courts after careful consideration of all the evidence . The appellate court had allowed the applicant to call witnesses and had reexamined officer GPE The claim that it had failed to examine the case with due care was therefore illfounded . The lower ORG findings of fact were based on evidence which had been properly admitted and assessed .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and QUANTITY DATE , superseded on DATE by LAW and CARDINAL of LAW DATE , provided that a conviction could not rest solely on the confession of the accused , and that a confession did not relieve the authorities of their duty to gather other evidence .", "CARDINAL . The accused may refuse to give explanations ( LAW of LAW and ORG CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE Code ) . Witnesses may also refuse to make statements or give answers that would incriminate them ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW and LAW ) . Unlike LAW , which was silent on the point , DATE Code specifically provides , in LAW , that witnesses have the right to consult a lawyer if they consider that by answering a question they may incriminate themselves .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code provided that a person who had taken part in the proceedings in another capacity could not be a witness . An exception was made for former accused , private prosecutors , civil claimants , civil defendants , and persons who had attested the carrying out of investigative steps ( \u043f\u043e\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430 ) . LAW maintained the same position . Its paragraph CARDINAL specifies that the bar also applies to persons who have carried out investigative actions or conducted trial proceedings even if the records of those proceedings have not been drawn up in line with the PERSON \u2019s requirements .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code , as amended in DATE , provided that counsel for the accused was entitled to take part in the proceedings from the point when the accused had been arrested or charged . LAW , as amended in DATE , provided that the authorities had to explain to the accused that he or she was entitled to the assistance of counsel , and to give him or her the opportunity to contact a counsel . It went on to specify that the authorities could not take any investigative steps until they had done so . LAW and DATE Code maintained the same position , with slightly different wording .", "CARDINAL . Following an amendment that came into force on DATE , LAW allowed the admission in evidence of statements made by the accused during interrogation in the course of the pretrial investigation only if the interrogation had taken place in the presence of a judge . LAW DATE Code kept the same rule , but paragraphs CARDINAL of that Article allow for exceptions in certain circumstances , with paragraph CARDINAL adding the proviso that a conviction can not be based solely on statements not made before a judge .", "CARDINAL . Points ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE Code listed certain situations in which an accused who could not retain counsel had to be provided with courtappointed counsel . None of these is relevant to the present case . On DATE a new point CARDINAL was added . It was part of a comprehensive overhaul of the LAW intended to bring it into line with the LAW . It was based on LAW ( c ) of the LAW , and provided that the appointment of counsel was mandatory if the accused could not afford CARDINAL but wished to be legally represented and the interests of justice so required . The text of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Code matches exactly that of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , as originally enacted , provided that the participation of counsel in the proceedings before ORG was compulsory in all cases , with the result that counsel had to be appointed if not retained by the accused ( LAW ) . However , in DATE the Government laid before ORG a bill for the amendment of the LAW , which proposed , among other things , the repeal of that provision . The explanatory notes to the bill stated that the system of mandatory appointment of counsel before ORG in all cases without exception had proved ineffective and that the accused did not show any great interest in it . Moreover , LAW ) often coincided with other grounds for the mandatory appointment of counsel , for instance those predicating such appointment on the subject matter of the case or the situation of the accused .
