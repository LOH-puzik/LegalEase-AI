The second applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The third applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr D. Foussard , of the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG , and PERSON , of ORG .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Director of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant is the production manager of ORG , a company incorporated under NORP law . The second applicant is the production manager of ORG , a company incorporated under GPE law . The third applicant is the managing director of ORG", "These CARDINAL companies manufacture several brands of cigarettes and distribute them in GPE . In accordance with the legislation and regulations passed pursuant to ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , they printed the words \u201c Tobacco seriously damages health \u201d on CARDINAL side of the cigarette packets sold on the NORP market . However , the message was preceded by the phrase \u201c According to Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL \u201d .", "On DATE the National Anti - Smoking Committee ( ORG national contre le tabagisme \u2013 \u201c the LAW \u201d ) brought proceedings against ORG and ORG , and against the CARDINAL applicants in their capacity as managers of the companies , in ORG . It accused them , inter alia , of breaching LAW of LAW and LAW DATE ( see below ) by printing that phrase on the cigarette packets .", "On DATE ORG found the applicants guilty of the offence punishable under LAW of LAW . It sentenced them to a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) each and declared ORG and ORG jointly and severally liable for payment . It also ordered the applicants and the CARDINAL companies jointly and severally to pay ORG CARDINAL in damages to the LOC .", "The judgment states , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c ...", "The addition of the phrase \u2018 According to Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL\u2019", "...", "Under LAW of the Directive of ORG of DATE , \u2018 member ORG may stipulate that the warnings referred to in DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL be combined with the indication of the authority that is their ORG .", "ORG has not opted to do so .", "It is clear [ from Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL II and III of LAW , LAW DATE and Article CARDINAL of the aforementioned directive ] that there is an obligation to print health warnings aimed at informing consumers and , accordingly , complying with the formal requirements binding on cigarette manufacturers ; that the possibility of adding an indication of the authority that is their author is in all cases reserved to member GPE of the ORG alone ; and that on pain of breaching those provisions cigarette manufacturers must print at least the minimum statutory message , the wording of which is strictly defined by the legal provisions , and can only supplement it on condition that the addition reinforces the message .", "That is not the case regarding the phrase \u2018 According to Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL\u2019 which ORG and ORG have printed before the health warning on cigarette packets since that addition distorts the meaning of the message in question by weakening its import because it may suggest that the basis for alerting consumers to the harm done by tobacco is not medical but legal , whereas the harmfulness of tobacco has been proved by recognised scientific studies .", "Under the aforementioned provisions , the phrase in question is therefore unlawful .", "Despite having been warned by letters of DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE [ from the LAW ] that the packets they were manufacturing and importing into GPE did not comply with the applicable regulations , the ORG company managers refused to change the packaging even when injunction proceedings to that end were brought against them in the CARDINAL tribunal de grande instance in DATE .", "The wilful and persistent violation of the applicable legal and regulatory provisions attest to the guilty intention of the defendants , who can not validly rely on the fact that the additional phrase in question had been tolerated for DATE in GPE since that tolerance did not create rights . Nor can they properly argue that it was compulsory in their country of origin since that fact does not alter their liability under NORP law .", "The CARDINAL elements \u2013 statutory , material and intentional \u2013 of the offence constituted by the unlawful addition of the words \u2018 According to Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL\u2019 therefore appear to have been made out .", "...", "Responsibility for the offence", "It is not disputed that at the material time PERSON was the managing director of ORG , ORG the manufacturing director of that company and PERSON the production manager of ORG ...", "... it would appear that , having regard to their level of responsibility and their sphere of action , the CARDINAL [ applicants ] ( managing director and manufacturing directors ) could not have been unaware of the particular sphere of application of the relevant NORP regulations and were under a duty to ensure that their manufacturing processes complied with those regulations .", "... \u201d", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG modified the sentence imposed by the lower court \u2013 increasing it to a fine of ORG CARDINAL against each applicant \u2013 and upheld the remainder of the judgment . ORG indicated , in particular :", "\u201c ...", "Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW requires that both a general and a specific health warning be printed on cigarette packets in accordance with the terms of the implementing decree of DATE , which uses the terms \u2018 ORG and \u2018 specific ORG . These terms presuppose the transmission of information in writing .", "It is clear from those provisions that if the warning is worded in such a way that , for reasons of form or presentation , it no longer constitutes the \u2018 ORG or \u2018 notice\u2019 required by the LAW the law will have been breached .", "The phrase \u2018 According to Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL\u2019 indicates the authority that is the author of the warning elliptically , with a misleading definition and only a vague reference to the identity ( references to legislation customarily being made by the date or sometimes by the date and number , but never the latter alone ) ; the conclusion must therefore be drawn that the phrase \u2018 According to Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL\u2019 is not informative .", "An examination of the wording used shows that a distancing effect is created between the emitter of the message and the opinion of its author . That distancing effect can only be perceived by readers as a formally neutral position to which they do not have to adhere and which is open to criticism . It amounts to a form of implicit comment on a compulsory and unjustified measure , which absorbs and transforms the sense of the health message .", "These considerations show that the obligation to provide the statutory information is circumvented in such a way as to load the wording of the compulsory notice with an implicit but clear meaning that twists and distorts the sense and import of the statutory message .", "The conclusion that has to be drawn in these circumstances is that where the statutory message is combined with the words \u2018 According to Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL\u2019 it is emitted in conditions which breach Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW .", "[ The applicants ] can not justify infringing the law on the basis of foreign practices or obedience to a NORP directive in a situation in which the directive was not binding on them and , moreover , they have respected neither the letter nor the spirit of it .", "The intentional element is sufficiently made out by the subtle nature of the enigmatic wording of the text added to the statutory message , which allows it both to avoid conveying any information and potentially to take refuge behind the legislative authority .", "... \u201d", "The applicants appealed on points of law against that judgment . Relying on , inter alia , LAW , they argued in particular that in finding them guilty of a criminal offence , whereas Article PERSON of LAW and LAW DATE did not penalise an addition such as \u2018 According to PERSON no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL\u2019 before \u2018 Tobacco seriously damages FAC , the lower courts had violated the principle that only the law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty and the principle that the criminal law must be strictly interpreted . They added that Article PERSON of LAW was in any case imprecise and that the lower courts should therefore have refused to apply it .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c ...", "As stated in ORG judgment , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , the respective managers of the companies of the ORG group , were prosecuted for adding the words \u2018 According to Law no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL\u2019 before the health warning \u2018 Tobacco seriously damages health\u2019 on cigarette packets marketed by the companies .", "In holding that the offence had been made out , ORG found that by modifying the text of the general health warning required by the legal and regulatory provisions the defendants had distorted its meaning .", "Accordingly , ORG justified its decision .", "As the optional provisions of LAW CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of CARDINAL DATE were not transposed into domestic law , any alteration of the text of the health warning required by the provisions of Article PERSON of LAW amounts to an offence punishable under LAW of LAW .", "... \u201d", "On DATE ORG adopted Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC on the approximation of the laws , regulations and administrative provisions of the member GPE concerning the labelling of tobacco products .
