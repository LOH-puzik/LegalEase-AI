The applicant , who was born in DATE , was a lawyer by profession . He is now retired and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

Dissatisfied with that refusal , the applicant wrote CARDINAL letters to the prefect in which he protested against the abolition of freedom of expression by the new people 's regime . As a result of these letters , the applicant was arrested on DATE . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant on a charge of insulting behaviour and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after the communist regime had been overthrown , the new government caused Legislative Decree no .

It consequently allowed his application and awarded him the compensation provided for in Legislative Decree no . PERSON .", "CARDINAL .

The letter read as follows :", "\u201c In reply to your letter of DATE , here are the results of our checks on PERSON , who lives in GPE :", "( a ) during his studies in ORG at ORG the aforementioned person was a member of ORG , a ' legionnaire ' [ legionar]-type [ ] movement .", "( b ) in DATE he applied to the ORG censorship office for permission to publish CARDINAL pamphlets entitled ' Student Soul ' and ' NORP ' but his request was turned down because of the anti - government sentiments expressed in them ;", "( c ) he belonged to the youth section of ORG , as appears from a statement he made in DATE ;", "( d ) he has no criminal record and , contrary to what he maintains , was not imprisoned during the period he mentions ;", "( e ) in DATE he was summoned by the security services on several occasions because of his ideas and questioned about his views ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant brought proceedings against the RIS , stating that he had never been a member of the NORP legionnaire movement , that he had not been a student in ORG at ORG but in LAW and that some of the other information provided by the RIS in its letter of DATE was false and defamatory . Under the Civil Code provisions on liability in tort he claimed damages from the RIS for the non - pecuniary damage he had sustained . He also sought an order , without relying on any particular legal provision , that the ORG should amend or destroy the file containing the information on his supposed legionnaire past .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG Instance dismissed the applicant 's application on the ground that the statutory provisions on tortious liability did not make it possible to allow it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the information that the applicant had been a legionnaire was false . However , it dismissed the appeal on the ground that the RIS could not be held to have been negligent as it was merely the depositary of the impugned information , and that in the absence of negligence the rules on tortious liability did not apply . The court noted that the information had been gathered by the ORG 's security services , which , when they were disbanded in DATE , had forwarded it to the ORG ( ORG ) , which had in its turn forwarded it to the ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant against the judgment of DATE in the following terms :", "\u201c ... the ORG finds that the applicant 's appeal is ill - founded . As the statutory depositary of the archives of the former ORG security services , the ORG in letter no . DATE forwarded to ORG information concerning the applicant 's activities while he was a university student , as set out by the ORG security services . It is therefore apparent that the judicial authorities have no jurisdiction to destroy or amend the information in the letter written by the ORG , which is merely the depositary of the former ORG security services ' archives . In dismissing his application , the judicial authorities did not infringe either LAW but stayed the proceedings in accordance with the jurisdictional rules laid down in LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action for damages against all the judges who had dismissed his application to have the file amended or destroyed . He based his action on LAW , relating to denials of justice , and LAW . According to the applicant , both ORG and ORG refused to register his action .", "In this connection , the applicant lodged a fresh application with the ORG on CARDINAL DATE , which was registered under file no . MONEY and is currently pending before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Minister of ORG informed the Director of the RIS that ORG had declared the applicant 's present application admissible . The Minister consequently asked the Director of the RIS to check once again whether the applicant had been a member of the legionnaire movement and , if that information proved to be false , to inform the applicant of the fact so that he could subsequently make use of it in any application for review .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of the RIS informed the Minister of ORG that the information in the letter of DATE that the applicant had been a legionnaire had been found by consulting their archives , in which a table drawn up by the Ia\u015fi security office had been discovered that mentioned , in entry CARDINAL , CARDINAL PERSON , a \u201c science student , rank - and - file member of ORG , legionnaire \u201d . The Director of the PERSON mentioned that the table was dated DATE and expressed the view that \u201c since at that date Mr PERSON was only CARDINAL , he could not have been a student in ORG . [ That being so , ] we consider that there has been a regrettable mistake which led us to suppose that Mr PERSON of GPE was the same person as the one who appears in that table as a member of a legionnaire - type organisation . Detailed checks made by our institution in the counties of GPE and ORG have not provided any other information to confirm that the CARDINAL names refer to the same person . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A copy of that letter was sent to the applicant , who on DATE applied to ORG to review its decision of DATE . In his application he sought a declaration that the defamatory documents were null and void , damages in the amount of CARDINAL leu in respect of non - pecuniary damage and reimbursement of all the costs and expenses incurred since the beginning of the proceedings , adjusted for inflation .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON submitted that the application for review should be dismissed , holding that , in the light of the RIS Director 's letter of DATE , the application had become devoid of purpose .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and allowed the applicant 's action , in the following terms :", "\u201c It appears from letter no .

CARDINAL ) there is a table which lists the names of the members of legionnaire organisations who do not live in GPE , entry CARDINAL of which contains the following : ' PERSON \u2013 science student , rankand - file member of ORG , legionnaire ' . Since the applicant was DATE when that table was drawn up , on DATE , and since he did not attend lectures in ORG , and since it appears from subsequent checks in the documents listing the names of the members of legionnaire organisations that the name ' PERSON does not seem to be connected with an individual living in GPE whose personal details correspond to those of the applicant , ORG considers that a regrettable mistake has been made and that the person mentioned in the table is not the applicant .", "Having regard to this letter , the ORG holds that it satisfies the requirements of LAW as it is such as to completely alter the facts previously established . The document contains details which it was not possible to submit at any earlier stage in the proceedings for a reason beyond the applicant 's control .", "That being so , the date on which the ORG was formed and the way in which the former security services were organised are not relevant factors . Similarly , the fact , albeit a true one , that ORG is only the depositary of the archives of the former security services is irrelevant . What matters is the fact that letter no .
