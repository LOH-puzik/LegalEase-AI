On DATE ORG ( Landgericht ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal in which he had asked that the execution of his sentence be suspended on probation .

ORG found , in particular , that the applicant \u2019s offences could not be regarded as being of a minor nature , taking into account the high importance of the safety of road traffic within society . The court further confirmed that there was a danger of recidivism , because the applicant had not proved that he had overcome his alcohol problem . It finally found that ORG duly considered the applicant \u2019s family situation . Having regard to the considerable danger the applicant posed for other road users and to the fact that his family could live with him in GPE , the expulsion did not violate the applicant \u2019s right to the enjoyment of his family life as guaranteed by LAW by LAW .", "CARDINAL .
