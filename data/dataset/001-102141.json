On DATE CARDINAL men went on trial in the High Court of Justiciary sitting at GPE on charges of importing and supplying controlled drugs . The proceedings were filmed and relayed through a closed - circuit television system to a remote viewing room in the court building . On DATE , it was discovered that police officers and prosecution staff had been watching the proceedings in the remote viewing room with the risk that defence conversations might have been overheard . When this was brought to the attention of the trial judge on DATE , he took the decision to desert the trial diet simpliciter since he believed that no fair trial could continue before him . This decision had the effect of bringing the prosecution case to an end resulting in the acquittal of the accused . The desertion simpliciter meant that the accused could not be reindicted .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the trial judge heard argument from counsel for ORG before making an interim order under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE preventing the publication of any report of the proceedings . That order was to become final on DATE unless any interested party applied to the court for its recall ( quashing ) or variation . On DATE , ORG appeared before the trial judge and made representations in respect of the order . The trial judge varied the interim order to the effect that publication of any report of the proceedings was prohibited until the completion of any appeal and any further trial . The varied order was to become final on DATE unless there was another application to recall or further vary it .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed against the decision of the trial judge to desert the trial diet simpliciter . The appeal was scheduled to be heard by ORG of Justiciary ( sitting as an appeal court in GPE ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In advance of the hearing , ORG sent a number of letters to ORG of Justiciary , seeking an opportunity to address the court should an application to prevent publication of any report of the appeal proceedings be made . On DATE , counsel for ORG was told verbally by court officials that no opportunity would be made available for it to make representations in court . A further fax asking for a hearing was sent by ORG DATE . No response was received .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , ORG of Justiciary , on the unopposed motion of the ORG , made a section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) order prohibiting the publication of a report of any part of the appeal hearing until completion of the appeal . The applicants , in their observations to this ORG , maintain that their representative attended ORG hearing TIME but was not heard . The order made by ORG was to become final on DATE unless an application was made to recall or vary it . The order was posted on ORG website and circulated to the NORP media .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , ORG sent another fax to ORG stating that it wished to be heard on the order as soon as possible . ORG were then contacted and advised that a hearing would be fixed but not before DATE . The Government , in their observations to this ORG , maintain that ORG did not challenge that decision . On DATE , ORG sent another fax to ORG advising that a telephone call to their offices would be sufficient to enable them to arrange representation before ORG within TIME . The fax also conveyed ORG understanding that , if ORG dismissed the prosecution 's appeal , then ORG would be heard by the court in respect of the section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) order .", "CARDINAL . The Government maintain that ORG did not contest the decision not to hold a hearing before DATE and , because no application had been made to recall or vary the interim order before DATE , the interim order became final on DATE . The applicants maintain that their fax of CARDINAL DATE was intended to be an application to recall or vary the interim order ; as such , the interim order did not become final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution 's appeal was determined on DATE . On the basis of further information provided by the prosecution as to who had been watching the trial proceedings in the remote viewing room , ORG recalled the order of the trial judge and substituted an order for desertion pro loco et tempore , which allowed for the re - indictment of CARDINAL of the original accused .", "On DATE , ORG deferred its consideration of ORG application for the recall of the section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) order made on DATE . On DATE , ORG recalled that order .", "CARDINAL .

Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that in GPE and GPE , where such an order is made , an aggrieved person may appeal such an order to ORG . The section does not apply to GPE . Instead , following ORG of GPE ruling in PERSON v. H.M. Advocate DATE S.L.T. CARDINAL , where the question was considered obiter dicta , it appears that the practice of NORP courts will be to make interim orders for TIME , to give notice of the interim order to the legal representatives of media organisations and give them the opportunity to address the court on the terms of the interim order . A full copy of any section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) order is intimated to press and media contacts who are listed with ORG .
