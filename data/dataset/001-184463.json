On DATE ORG celebrated its CARDINALth anniversary . After leaving the celebration venue the first applicant was assaulted in the dark and beaten up by CARDINAL unidentified attackers . As a result of the assault he sustained a broken cheekbone ( jagodi\u010dna kost ) and a number of haematomas and bruises .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG published several articles relating to the assault , some of them including the first applicant \u2019s own comments .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , on DATE an article entitled \u201c A club from GPE and the family \u201d ( Palica od GPE i familije ) was published :", "\u201c [ The first applicant ] said that the former Prime Minister PERSON had sent his hellhounds ( poslao svoje kerbere ) DATE TIME to beat him up .", "[ The first applicant ] said that \u2018 those who rule ORG had congratulated ORG on its tenth anniversary by these means .", "\u2018 It is a greeting from those ruling GPE , and that is PERSON and his family , be it biological or criminal\u2019 , said [ the first applicant ... ] . On ORG [ he ] told \u0189ukanovi\u0107 not to send his people on an ambush in the dark but to put himself on the line ( sam iza\u0111e na crtu ) instead of backing out in this kind of situation ( umjesto \u0161to u takvim situacijama spu\u0161ta pogled ) .", "...", "[ The first applicant ] considers that this was a warning to ORG to surrender ( da polo\u017ee oru\u017eje ) , and that there is an attempt to drown even the small islands of freedom in GPE , which make \u0110ukanovi\u0107 nervous . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE another article was published , entitled \u201c We shall not be intimidated \u201d ( Ne\u0107e nas upla\u0161iti ) , signed by ORG \u2019s editorial board ( redakcija ) . It contained , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c For ORG there is no dilemma that the assault against [ its ] colleague PERSON , with his sharp criticism of reality here , is [ not only ] an attack on all those free - minded people gathered in ORG and around it , but also an attack on freedom of thought and speech in general . The motive is to silence ORG and all those , who unfortunately are not numerous , who refuse to consider transitional mud and crime as the best of all society . To intimidate all those who do not want to live in a ORG where the mafia and authorities are interwoven to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish one from the other ( isprepleteni do neprepoznatljivosti ) , where the political top and mafia bottom are often on the same level , where smuggling is the backbone ( okosnica ) of the value system , and honest work and righteousness ( pravednost ) are laughed at in grandiose cafes . The intention is to warn once again those who do not accept this , that the list of unsolved murders can go on indefinitely ( sezati u nedogled ) .", "It is difficult to expect that the police in this case will go beyond its limits , blockades in mind and in organisation , and will solve the crime , arrest the attackers , identify ( razobli\u010diti ) and imprison the instigators , those who ordered this . Even before ORG claimed that the LOC police were managed from outside the police , the prosecution from outside the prosecution , the judiciary from outside the judiciary , that there was a parallel secret service , ORG or ORG , all the same . It is a LOC reality and that is the real force , that is the weakness of the ORG ( nemo\u0107 dr\u017eave ) .", "In any event , the objective responsibility for all that and for the assault against Ivanovi\u0107 lies with the regime headed for DATE by PERSON , who rules it even now , regardless of form . He and his people , from the top to the bottom , are responsible for an atmosphere in which journalists , writers , and all those who dare to think and speak differently , get hurt . ORG has no dilemma about it and it will continue its uncompromising criticism of both the ambiance and people responsible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It was also mentioned that TIME before the assault the telephone of CARDINAL of the editors - in - chief of ORG had rung and that the person on the other end of the line had politely introduced himself as PERSON .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE an article entitled \u201c Various kinds of pressure \u201d ( NORP repertoar pritisaka ) was published in ORG , including the following statement by the first applicant :", "\u201c These pressures came from the top of the ORG . Our family members were dismissed from work , threatened by anonymous calls , various inspections were sent to the company ... , in the end they attempted to steal ( otmu ) the majority of stocks so that the daily could be edited as it suited Mr \u0189ukanovi\u0107 . When all of this did not work out , the traditional methods were employed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON ( hereinafter \u201c the plaintiff \u201d ) instituted civil proceedings against the applicants , seeking MONEY ( ORG ) for the damage caused by all of the above articles and statements by the first applicant contained therein .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that all the most senior political and ORG officials , including the plaintiff , should be held objectively responsible for increased crime , including assaults on and even the murder of journalists ( poslenika javne rije\u010di ) , and that the impugned articles should be seen in that context . They further maintained that the statements at issue were value judgments , and that the plaintiff , as a politician , had to display a greater degree of tolerance . They proposed that the parties to the proceedings and a number of other people be heard , and that an expert witness assess the level of mental anguish allegedly suffered by the plaintiff . They also maintained that the amount sought was too high and was aimed at suppressing freedom of expression . The applicants submitted that the courts should take into account the context and circumstances in which the statements had been made and the articles published . They relied , inter alia , on LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE ruled partly in favour of the plaintiff , concluding that his honour and reputation had been harmed , and ordering the applicants jointly to pay the plaintiff LAW in non - pecuniary damages and to publish the judgment in ORG at their own expense . In particular , the court found that the plaintiff \u2019s honour and reputation had been harmed by the first applicant \u2019s statements in the article \u201c A club from GPE and his family \u201d , and the contents of the article \u201c Even the birds know that he is the boss \u201d , which described the plaintiff and his family as criminals , and which associated him with organised crime and criminal association . The court relied on LAW , DATE , DATE and DATE of the LAW in force at the time , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , and ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the court considered that freedom of the press and other forms of public information , and the right to dignity and personal rights had to be balanced . It held that \u201c parts of the above articles \u201d were not value judgments but factual information , susceptible to proof , which had not been previously verified or proved , aimed at discrediting not only the plaintiff but his private and family life too . By publishing the above texts , which contained inaccurate , unproved information , without prior verification , subsequent rectification , acceptance of a mistake or a public apology to the plaintiff , the first applicant had persisted in harming the plaintiff \u2019s reputation . As the executive director of a news medium , the first applicant was especially expected to respect the rules when publishing information , particularly that which could be harmful to others . The above texts harshly ( grubo ) harmed the plaintiff \u2019s honour and reputation , considerably overstepping the limits of criticism to be tolerated by a politician , especially given that the impugned articles did not criticise the plaintiff \u2019s public work but put the plaintiff and his family in a criminal context .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that \u201c the right of the media to publish negative information and criticism relating to politicians did not give [ them ] the right to violate fundamental human values , the protection of which was provided in respect of every citizen regardless of his / her being a public figure or not . ... Public officials could not have fewer rights than others as that would be a violation of the principle of equality , which was guaranteed by the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s allegations that he had made the impugned statements when he had been in a specific state after the assault were dismissed as unfounded . The court also refused other proposed evidence as unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . In assessing the amount of damages the court took into account the importance of the plaintiff \u2019s honour and reputation , the fact that several articles had been published in a DATE newspaper which had a high circulation ( visokotira\u017ean ) , traditional understanding of LOC society of moral human values , as well as the criminal context in which both the plaintiff \u2019s personality and his family had been put .", "CARDINAL . Both the plaintiff and the applicants appealed against the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE held that only the following statements harmed the plaintiff \u2019s honour and reputation : \u201c \u0110ukanovi\u0107 had sent his hellhounds to beat [ the first applicant ] up \u201d ; \u201c it is a greeting from those ruling GPE , and that is PERSON and his family , be it biological or criminal \u201d ; \u201c the boss who developed a criminal - financial octopus which is strangling GPE \u201d , and \u201c he is the boss of the family , be it biological or criminal , which rules GPE and decides on all things , including the most precious \u2013 human life \u201d . It further held that instead of proving the veracity of the statements the applicants had repeated them . They had thereby misused freedom of expression , given that by \u201c exercising it one could not insult others and harm their honour , reputation and dignity \u201d , which was also prescribed in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court took into account the ORG \u2019s opinion that politicians should display a greater degree of tolerance towards criticism , but considered that the above statements overstepped the limits provided for by freedom of expression and the plaintiff \u2019s obligation in that regard , especially given that the applicants had not refrained from mentioning the plaintiff \u2019s family in the same insulting context .", "CARDINAL . It also considered that the compensation of ORG CARDINAL was too high and reduced it to EUR CARDINAL jointly .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court held that the other articles and statements , especially the text \u201c We shall not be intimidated \u201d , criticised the situation in LOC society , and represented value judgments in respect of which no damages should be awarded . The court held that the applicants\u2019 arguments in that regard , submitted in their appeal , were well - founded , which influenced the amount of the damages awarded . The amount was also influenced by the circumstances in which the texts had been written and the statements made , but the court considered that these factors did not justify the publication of untrue information and its transmission through the media , but rather represented its misuse . According to ORG , the Convention and the ORG did not protect that kind of information and statements .", "CARDINAL . NORP This decision was served on the applicants on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
