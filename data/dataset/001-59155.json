The applicants are gypsies by birth . All their lives , they have moved between official sites and unofficial stopping places , mostly in the GPE area .", "CARDINAL . The applicants regard themselves as being GPE folk . The first applicant is a carpet seller and does most of his business in GPE . Both their children were born in GPE , and at present their daughter lives with them and works nearby . Their son travels independently , but stays with them frequently .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE , the applicants had to move between a number of sites in GPE , often staying in unofficial stopping places . As they wanted to set up a family site , in DATE they bought a piece of land , known as ORG , PERSON , PERSON in GPE . The site is QUANTITY in area , and is positioned in the countryside between the MCARDINAL motorway and the GPE - Carlisle railway line . When the applicants bought it , they stated that it was generally regarded as being an eyesore . They referred to letters from local residents describing the site as having been used for car breaking and tipping rubbish , being littered and infested with rats . They spent DATE cleaning it up and developing it . The Government disputed this assertion , stating that local authority records indicate that it was after the applicants had occupied it that complaints were received about its condition . They stated that the land was previously used for grazing and growing crops .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants moved onto the site and on DATE they applied for planning permission to ORG ( \u201c the Council \u201d ) for a small close - knit gypsy family site for CARDINAL caravans .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , they were prosecuted in ORG for being on the land unlawfully . They were convicted and fined MONEY ( GBP ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants ' planning application was refused , by letter , on the grounds of adverse effect on highway safety and impact on visual amenity . On DATE , the applicants submitted an appeal to the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , they were served with an enforcement notice requiring them essentially to move the caravans off the land and to reinstate the land to its former condition . They were given DATE to comply with the latter condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants submitted a further appeal against the enforcement notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a public local inquiry was held to consider both appeals . These appeals were heard by an ORG appointed by the Secretary of ORG for the Environment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , these appeals were dismissed . In his report , the ORG stated inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Planning policies for the area are contained in the DATE Lancashire Structure Plan . Policy CARDINAL seeks to limit development of land in the open countryside outside LOC to that needed for the purposes of agriculture and forestry , or other uses appropriate to a rural area . ... Policy CARDINAL refers to Areas of Special Landscape , the appeal site is within such an area . The object is to safeguard such areas from development that is not in keeping with the special character of the landscape and is a of a standard of design appropriate to the area . The site is in an area of open countryside , it is undulating pasture land with a few buildings in the locality and can be seen from a number of public viewpoints , including the canal towpath close at hand , and further afield , from points along LOC . In my opinion , the appearance of CARDINAL caravans on the site would cause serious harm to the character of the landscape and be in conflict with Policy CARDINAL , even allowing for the proximity of the site to LOC . ...", "CARDINAL . By all accounts the land was overgrown until DATE or thereabouts ; it is not overgrown now but I consider that the harm caused to the character of the area by using the site for stationing CARDINAL caravans for residential purposes materially outweighs any benefits that may have accrued from < the applicant 's > cleaning up operation . Hedging can reduce the visual impact of a development , < the first applicant > proposed to plant hedging along CARDINAL of the boundaries and he has already done some of this . The types of hedging which are characteristic of the area would not provide much in the way of screening for DATE , < the applicant 's > approach is to plant quick growing conifers but I share the ORG 's view that these are not in keeping with the character of the area .", "CARDINAL . With regard to highway safety , you suggest that a common sense view be taken . PERSON is an unclassified road QUANTITY long , it is narrow for much of its length and contains a number of bends . In many places , CARDINAL cars could not pass . The hedges along the lane obstruct the visibility at bends , alterations in the hedge line along the site would be a help but in my view such alterations would not go far towards improving the overall situation . The land leads to the FAC at one end where visibility is significantly below the standards recommended in Planning Policy Guidance Note CARDINAL . At the other end , access to and from the ACARDINAL can be obtained via GPE , where visibility at the junction is adequate , and directly along ORG lane ; the visibility of the junction of this land with the main road is significantly below the recommended standards . < The first applicant > says he uses only the GPE junction , but I consider that others may well use the other junctions either because of convenience or because they do not appreciate the different standards of visibility at the CARDINAL junctions . ...", "CARDINAL . Cinderbarrow lane and its junctions with the main roads clearly have hazards for traffic . < The first applicant 's > use of the appeal site adds to those hazards , in my opinion , because of the increase in the number of traffic movements likely to result from the use and the increased likelihood of vehicles having to be reversed when meeting vehicles coming the other way . I accept that caravans are not likely to be towed onto and off the site on many occasions DATE , and if that were the only consideration I would not have regarded the implications for highway safety to be so unacceptable as to warrant a refusal of permission . It is , however , CARDINAL of a number of drawbacks and I consider that , overall , the highway objection is sustained .", "CARDINAL . The effect of Section CARDINAL(A ) of LAW is that the determination of these appeals shall be made in accordance with the development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise . The development plan in this case is ORG and on the basis of the evidence I consider that < the first applicant 's > development does not accord with it . Highway safety is a material consideration but it is one , which in my view , weighs against his case . A further material consideration , an important one , namely a special need for accommodation to be provided for gypsies , remains to be considered .", "CARDINAL . < The first applicant 's > gypsy status is not a matter of dispute , nor is the fact that , since DATE , the ORG 's district is designated under the provisions of LAW DATE , ... , as an area where adequate provision has been made for gypsies residing in , or resorting to the area . Circular CARDINAL emphasises , at paragraph CARDINAL , that the additional power accruing from a designation order should be seen by ORG as a means of ensuring that gypsies use the accommodation available to them rather that as a means of avoiding the need to provide further sites . Authorities may also have to be prepared to increase the provision they have made if there is a subsequent expansion of the gypsy population in their area . The ORG say that provision has been made over and above that which led to the area being designated . CARDINAL additional residential pitches and CARDINAL pitches for touring caravans have been provided on CARDINAL private sites ... The ORG 's own site at FAC has CARDINAL double pitches and can , therefore , accommodate CARDINAL caravans .", "CARDINAL . The larger picture for the LOC is that , under LAW of the Structure Plan and in the context of residential development , the aim is to provide land for caravan sites for gypsies within , or close to , the main urban areas . There are CARDINAL permanent gypsy sites in GPE , including the one at FAC . ORG are actively pursuing the provision of CARDINAL further sites , none of which are in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE count of gypsy caravans since DATE discloses that there have been spaces available on authorised sites on every count , except the last one in DATE . In DATE , during the period when < the first applicant > was evidently clearing up the appeal site prior to moving onto it in DATE , the ORG say there were CARDINAL vacancies on authorised sites . The ORG also say that on DATE before the inquiry there were CARDINAL vacancies .", "CARDINAL . In my view the special need for accommodation to be provided for gypsies is not so weighty in the present case as to outweigh the harm caused to the character of the area and the adverse effects on highway safety .", "CARDINAL . < The applicants > put forward a number of reasons why they did not wish to go onto authorised sites in the area . Some of the reasons related to incidents in DATE which led them to embrace the concept of self - help and moving onto the appeal site , which they bought in DATE . I have accorded some weight to these matters but I remain of the opinion that the ORG 's case is the one that should prevail . ... \u201d", "The time period for compliance was extended to DATE . The ORG also revoked the condition of returning the land to its former condition finding it excessive due to the tidying work carried out by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The applicants did not appeal against this decision to ORG , as such appeals can only be made on limited grounds ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants tried unsuccessfully to find an alternative site both in the ORG area and in the nearby ORG area . They were offered places on an authorised site , GPE , which they turned down for strong personal reasons , namely , since this particular site was occupied by a large , violent gypsy family who had attacked them on CARDINAL occasion . In DATE , the first applicant received serious injury , being beaten with a baseball bat and being showered with glass as his car was smashed . His assailant was convicted of actual bodily harm . The applicants were advised by the police to stay away from the area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants were prosecuted in ORG and given a conditional discharge for DATE , which would expire on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , they applied for planning permission for a smaller gypsy site which would consist of CARDINAL mobile home and a transit pitch .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , their application was refused and they appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a public local inquiry was held . On DATE , the appeal was dismissed again , on grounds of visual amenity and adverse effect on highway safety . Even though the applicants had offered to provide whatever form of screening was necessary , the Inspector considered that an effective screen would take too long to establish and would look alien . The use of the site for the stationing of a caravan and the addition of a second would \u201c seriously harm the character and appearance of the surrounding area \u201d . He gave weight to the highway authority evidence that the exit from FAC to the ACARDINAL suffered from lack of visibility . While he noted that the applicants'submission that they could use the alternative exit in GPE , he considered that the greater convenience of the shorter route would be likely to encourage its regular use . Given the lightly trafficked nature of the road , he did not find this to be a crucial matter however . As regarded the needs of the applicants , he stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE LOC has been designated under the provisions of LAW DATE , as amended , as an area where adequate provision has been made for gypsies residing in or resorting to the area . The current level of authorised provision within the district is CARDINAL caravan pitches of which CARDINAL pitches are on a council - owned site . Surveys taken during DATE show that an average of CARDINAL vacancies existed DATE on private sites in the district , and an average of CARDINAL vacancies on the council owned site .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL states that it may be necessary to accept the establishment of gypsy sites within areas of open land where the land use policies which apply are severely restrictive to development , but in such cases there will be a special obligation to ensure that the arguments in favour of a departure from the development plan are convincing . < The applicants > put forward reasons why they did not wish to go to authorised sites in the area . Although these reasons were understandable , these are essentially personal reasons which do not , in my opinion , outweigh the harm caused to the character of the area and the adverse effects on highway safety . In my judgment the provision made within the district and the site availability revealed by survey is sufficient for me to conclude that the special need for accommodation to be provided for gypsies is not so weighty in this case as to justify a departure from established planning policy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , further prosecution was adjourned to DATE . On DATE , the applicants were convicted of failing to comply with the enforcement notice and were fined GBP CARDINAL plus costs .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicants appeared once more in the magistrates ' court charged with failing to comply with the enforcement notice . The proceedings were adjourned until DATE , when the applicants elected to be tried in ORG by judge and jury . At a hearing on DATE , the applicants were directed by the judge that they had no alternative but to plead guilty as they did not have a defence to the charges . He deferred sentence and granted leave to appeal to ORG . On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal , inter alia , endorsing the judge 's finding that :", "\u201c Subsection CARDINAL < of ORG is not concerned with a balance of social factors . It is not concerned with the policy issues as arise in relation to the circumstances in which gypsies live . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The case was remitted to the ORG judge , who took the view that there was \u201c powerful mitigation \u201d and sentenced the applicants to a fine of ORG and GBP CARDINAL costs . He observed that it would have been inappropriate to commence a third prosecution and that it would have been more appropriate to commence civil injunctive proceedings in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG decided to take injunctive action against the applicants . At the hearing on DATE , ORG had before it an affidavit from the first applicant and CARDINAL affidavits from the ORG . In the affidavit of PERSON for the ORG , it was accepted that the applicants had not been able to secure accommodation within the area for their caravan elsewhere but it was suggested that insufficient efforts had been made . In his affidavit , to which were annexed refusals from CARDINAL sites , the first applicant stated that :", "\u201c Since DATE my wife and I have been making extensive enquiries about alternative situations ... It is wrong for the ORG to suggest that we have only tried holiday sites thereby implying that we knew they would fail ; to the best of my knowledge and belief all the sites we tried had some residential accommodation . We repeated these efforts prior to the most recent proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Due to the pressure of the proceedings , the first applicant made an undertaking to the ORG to remove his caravans from his land and to break up the hard surface laid out on the land by DATE . On DATE , the applicants applied for a variation of the undertaking , seeking an extension of the time for compliance as they had been unable to find anywhere else to site their caravan and due to the first applicant 's ill health . The second applicant submitted in an affidavit to ORG that they had made continuous and strenuous enquiries since DATE , but had been met with refusals \u2013 letters from CARDINAL sites were enclosed . The application was refused and the applicants ordered to pay the ORG 's costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG served on the first applicant a \u201c Notice to Show Good Reason why an Order for Your Committal to Prison should not be made \u201d which applied for the first applicant to be committed to prison . At the hearing on DATE , the judge committed the first applicant to prison for DATE but suspended the imprisonment on condition that the applicant complied with his undertaking by QUANTITY DATE . Counsel 's notes of the judge 's judgment indicated that the order was made to enforce the law as fining had achieved nothing \u2013 \u201c If it means that the applicants have to seek something other than static caravan accommodation , so be it \u201d . In order to avoid committal and the ensuing deleterious consequences on the first applicant 's health and the applicants ' family , the applicants vacated their land and are currently without a fixed address . They have been unable to find alternative accommodation elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . As regards the availability of pitches elsewhere , the ORG submitted that during the period of DATE CARDINAL CARDINAL vacancies arose on GPE , the official site in the district . There was a waiting list but the applicants would only have had to wait DATE for a vacancy to occur . The conditions on this site were closely monitored by DATE inspections by a resident warden . In the local authority 's area , there were also , according to the figures given to the Commission by the Government , space for CARDINAL caravans on CARDINAL authorised private sites , where there were currently CARDINAL vacant pitches and a further CARDINAL private authorised / touring and residential sites , comprising , respectively , CARDINAL and CARDINAL pitches , with substantial numbers of vacancies . Some of these sites were used by travellers particularly in DATE . The applicants stated that these sites are largely seasonal for tourists and that gypsies were not welcome . CARDINAL of them has been designated as official gypsy site but is still inhabited mostly by non - gypsies . This site had QUANTITY .", "According to the DATE statistics of ORG however , the number of authorised private sites had increased by CARDINAL ( from DATE to CARDINAL ) , while the number of public sites had decreased by the same number ( from CARDINAL to DATE ) . However , the total number of unauthorised encampments in the area had almost doubled from CARDINAL to CARDINAL .", "PERSON . RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE", "CARDINAL . ORG DATE ( as amended by LAW DATE ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) consolidated pre - existing planning law . It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development ( ORG v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and GPE [ DATE ] ORG Law CARDINAL ; PERSON v. Secretary of ORG for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ) . There is a further appeal to ORG on the ground that the Secretary of ORG 's decision was not within the powers conferred by LAW , or that the relevant requirements of LAW were not complied with ( section FAC ) .", "CARDINAL . If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission , the local authority may issue an \u201c enforcement notice \u201d if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of ORG on the grounds , inter alia , that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question ( section CARDINAL ) . As with the appeal against refusal of permission , the Secretary of ORG must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector .", "CARDINAL . Again there is a further right of appeal \u201c on a point of law \u201d to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a ORG decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector 's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority .", "CARDINAL . Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice , the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Part II of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to gypsies as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in DATE , in particular the closure of commons carried out by local authorities pursuant to section CARDINAL of GPE and ORG DATE . LAW of LAW defined \u201c gypsies \u201d as :", "\u201c persons of nomadic habit of life , whatever their race or origin , but does not include members of an organised group of travelling showmen , or of persons engaged in travelling circuses , travelling together as such \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The Secretary of ORG could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Where the Secretary of ORG was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of GPE , or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision , he could \u201c designate \u201d that district or county ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway , on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a magistrates ' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By DATE it had become apparent that the rate of site provision under section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act was inadequate , and that unauthorised encampments were leading to a number of social problems . In DATE , therefore , the Government asked Sir PERSON to carry out a study into the operation of LAW . He reported in DATE ( Accommodation for Gypsies : A report on the working of GPE DATE , \u201c the Cripps Report \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Sir PERSON estimated that there were CARDINAL NORP living in GPE and GPE .

The report made numerous recommendations for improving this situation .", "CARDINAL . Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL was issued by ORG .

Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which was issued on DATE , stated , inter alia , that \u201c it would be to everyone 's advantage if as many gypsies as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation \u201d , and thus advised local authorities that \u201c the special need to accommodate gypsies ... should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In addition , MONEY was spent under a scheme by which MONEY grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating gypsy sites .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which came into force on DATE , repealed sections CARDINAL of LAW and the grant scheme referred to above .", "CARDINAL .

In the case of NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson ( DATE ) , PERSON referred to the DATE Act as \u201c Draconic \u201d legislation . He commented that :", "\u201c For DATE the commons of GPE provided lawful stopping places for people whose way of life was or had become nomadic . Enough common land had survived DATE of enclosure to make this way of life still sustainable , but by s.CARDINAL of ORG and ORG DATE local authorities were given the power to close the commons to travellers . This they proceeded to do with great energy , but made no use of the concomitant powers given them by s.CARDINAL of the same Act to open caravan sites to compensate for the closure of the commons . By DATE , therefore ORG legislated to make the s.CARDINAL power a duty , resting in rural areas upon county councils rather than district councils ... For DATE there followed a history of non - compliance with the duties imposed by the Act of DATE , marked by a series of decisions of this court holding local authorities to be in breach of their statutory duty , to apparently little practical effect . The default powers vested in central government to which the court was required to defer , were rarely , if ever used .", "The culmination of the tensions underlying the history of non - compliance was the enactment of ... the Act of DATE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . New guidance on gypsy sites and planning , in the light of LAW , was issued to local authorities by the Government in Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( DATE ) , which cancelled ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see above ) .", "Councils were told that :", "\u201c In order to encourage private site provision , local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development . ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves , to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control . \u201d ( para . CARDINAL )", "However :", "\u201c As with other planning applications , proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land - use factors . Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations , the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural , archaeological , countryside , environmental , and LOC policies ... \u201d ( para . CARDINAL ) .", "It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted , for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty , Sites of Special Scientific Interest . Nor were gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Further guidance issued by the Secretary of ORG dated DATE concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land ( LOC above ) . Paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL required local authorities to adopt \u201c a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which can not be effectively controlled , an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance . Accordingly , authorities should consider tolerating gypsies ' presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites , for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets , a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water .", "CARDINAL . Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government - owned land , it is for the local authority , with the agreement of the land - owning ORG , to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health . It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of ORG that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance .", "CARDINAL . The Secretaries of ORG continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly . They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraphs CARDINAL further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under LAW . These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly - born children , the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte Atkinson , NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE and NORP v. ORG , ex parte GPE , unreported ) , ORG held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated CARDINAL DATE , ORG drew to the attention of all local planning authorities in GPE that Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL required local planning authorities to assess the need for gypsy accommodation in their areas and make suitable locational and/or criteria based policies against which to decide planning applications . The Government was concerned that this guidance had not been taken up . ORG research ( see below ) had showed that PERCENT of local authorities ( CARDINAL ) had no policy at all on gypsy sites and that many in the process of reviewing their plans at the time of the survey did not feel it necessary to include policies on gypsy provision . It was emphasised that it was important to include consideration of gypsy needs at an early stage in drawing up structure and development plans and that detailed policies should be provided . Compliance with this guidance was essential in fulfilling the ORG 's objective that gypsies should seek to provide their own accommodation , applying for planning permission like everyone else . It was necessary , therefore , that adequate gypsy site provision be made in development plans to facilitate this process .", "CARDINAL . The Advisory Council for ORG and Other Travellers ( ACERT ) , which carried out research sponsored by ORG , noted in this report that since DATE private site provision had increased by CARDINAL caravans per year while the pace of public site provision had declined by CARDINAL caravans , disclosing that the pace of private site provision had not increased sufficiently to counterbalance decreases in public site provision . Noting the increase of gypsies in housing and the increased enforcement powers under LAW , it questioned , if these trends continued , the extent to which the ethnic , cultural and linguistic identity of ORG people would be protected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The research looked , inter alia , at CARDINAL refused private site applications , which showed that PERCENT related to land within the countryside and that PERCENT were refused on grounds relating to the amenity value ( e.g. Green Belt , conservation area locations ) . Of the CARDINAL gypsy site applicants interviewed , for most acquiring permission for their own land was an important factor in improving the quality of life , gaining independence and providing security . For many , the education of their children was another important reason for private site application . All save CARDINAL had applied for permission retrospectively .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report stated that the figures for success rates in the CARDINAL planning appeals looked at showed that DATE the success rate had averaged PERCENT but had decreased since . Having regard however to the way in which data was recorded , the actual success rate was probably PERCENT as given as the figures in DATE and DATE by the gypsy groups and ORG respectively . Notwithstanding the objectives of planning policy that local authorities make provision for gypsies , most local authorities did not identify any areas of land as suitable for potential development by gypsies and reached planning decisions on the basis of land - use criteria in the particular case . It was therefore not surprising that most gypsies made retrospective applications and that they had little success in identifying land on which local authority would permit development . Granting of permission for private sites remained haphazard and unpredictable .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG survey on gypsy caravans in GPE disclosed that of CARDINAL caravans counted , CARDINAL were accommodated on local authority pitches , CARDINAL on privately owned sites and CARDINAL on unauthorised sites . Of the latter , CARDINAL gypsy caravans were being tolerated on land owned by non - gypsies ( mainly local authority land ) and CARDINAL gypsy caravans tolerated on land owned by gypsies themselves . On these figures , CARDINAL caravans were therefore on unauthorised and untolerated sites while over PERCENT of caravans were stationed on authorised sites .", "CARDINAL .
