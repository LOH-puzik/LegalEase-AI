FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , Director ORG , and Mr PERSON , Director , both of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the father of Y. , born in DATE . He is a NORP . On DATE he was arrested and detained , suspected of having killed his wife ( ORG 's mother ) on DATE . On DATE an official of ORG provisionally took ORG into public care in virtue of section CARDINAL of LAW ( lastensuojelulaki , barnskyddslag CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Y. was placed in a children 's home . The mother 's CARDINAL - brother and CARDINAL - sister had been heard prior to the decision .", "On DATE the applicant confessed to having killed his wife , referring to his jealousy . He was later found to have been in possession of his full senses at the moment of the crime .", "Officials of ORG ( perusturvalautakunta , grundtrygghetsn\u00e4mnden ) of PERSON started preparing a proposal for a confirmation of the provisional care order . It did not hear the applicant , although it had been informed of his whereabouts .", "On DATE ORG upheld the public care of Y. pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . It noted that the mother was dead and that her father had been detained on suspicion of having murdered her . Other support measures to ensure DATE 's welfare would be insufficient . The public care was expected to be of a long duration . The applicant 's access to NORP was prohibited indefinitely and her whereabouts were not disclosed to the applicant . No reasons were given for the prohibition . The ORG 's decision was notified to the applicant on DATE and a social worker briefly explained the contents thereof in LANGUAGE . As the applicant had not been heard prior to the decision , ORG forwarded it ex officio to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of H\u00e4me for its review .", "At a meeting between a representative of the association Pelastakaa lapset r.y.\u2013 PERSON barnen r.f . ( \u201c Save The Children \u201d ) and the applicant in prison on DATE the latter requested that the authorities consider the possibility of placing Y. in his brother 's family in GPE either for the duration of his sentence or permanently , by adopting her . The brother had allegedly consented to such an arrangement . The social authority 's case notes of DATE included an account of the meeting , as recounted by the representative of ORG . According to the notes , the applicant had been informed at the meeting that ORG 's maternal relatives were opposed to her placement outside GPE and that Save The Children was looking for a foster family for her . When inquiring about Y. 's possibility to visit him in prison , the applicant had been informed that the access prohibition would be reconsidered on his release . It transpires from the case notes that a potential foster family had already been contacted by ORG .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by his current counsel , appealed belatedly to ORG , stating , inter alia , that he had not been properly heard before ORG decision , nor legally notified of its contents .", "In its submissions in reply ORG stated , inter alia , that the care order had taken into account the wishes of Y. 's mother 's relatives , who had wanted to ensure that Y. would continue to receive a NORP education .", "On DATE Y. was placed in a foster family selected by ORG . According to the care plan adopted on DATE , her whereabouts would be concealed from the applicant as long as she remained in public care . At a later stage she could decide for herself whether she wanted to meet him . She would be entitled to meet her maternal half- brother and CARDINAL - sister , but initially only on neutral premises so as to protect her and the foster parents ' privacy and security . The care plan was agreed by regional director ( and social worker ) PERSON , a director and a social worker of ORG as well as the foster parents . The applicant had not been invited to attend .", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE a leading official of ORG ordered that the access prohibition should be in force up to Y. 's twelfth birthday ( i.e. until DATE ) . Having regard to the child 's age and state of development , access prior to that date would not maintain a child - parent relationship . Accordingly , Y. had no right to see the applicant until she had reached that age , when she could decide for herself whether she wished to see him . The official of ORG furthermore considered that , in order to protect ORG and the foster family 's privacy and security , her whereabouts should not be disclosed to the applicant or her other relatives . The applicant appealed to ORG .", "In its decision of DATE in the care order proceedings ORG noted that the applicant had been detained while the emergency order and the ordinary care order had been issued on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively . The court further noted that the emergency care order would have expired after DATE unless replaced by an ordinary care order . Finally , ORG had , of its own motion , referred its decision for review by ORG , since the applicant had not been heard . In those circumstances the ORG had not proceeded wrongly by not hearing the applicant prior to its order of CARDINAL DATE .", "ORG accepted , however , that the contents of the ordinary care order had not been sufficiently explained to the applicant , and examined his belated appeal . It nonetheless rejected it without having held an oral hearing , thus confirming the care order and Y. 's foster care . The court furthermore agreed that the access prohibition issued on DATE had been incorrect in that it had comprised no reasoning or time - limit . However , in view of the new prohibition issued on DATE , the court found no reason to pronounce itself further in regard to the initial prohibition . The applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting an oral hearing .", "On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tt ) of GPE convicted the applicant of manslaughter and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The conviction and sentence were upheld by ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tt ) of GPE on DATE . The applicant served his sentence in GPE until DATE , when he was transferred to the Vilppula Low - Security Prison .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG confirmed the access prohibition issued on DATE , stating , inter alia , that domestic law did not allow a father to care for his child in prison . The applicant appealed , arguing that he had not been properly heard prior to the decision . In addition , he stated that it had been made without knowledge of current domestic law which did allow a father to care for his child in prison .", "ORG explained to ORG , inter alia , that it had considered it unnecessary to hear the applicant , since at the time he had been undergoing an examination of his mental state in a mental hospital .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision and referred the matter back for renewed consideration . The applicant 's stay in a mental hospital at the relevant time had not been a valid reason for not hearing him in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW ( hallintomenettelylaki , lag om f\u00f6rvaltningsf\u00f6rfarande CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The court nonetheless rejected his request that the ORG should be ordered to pay his legal costs .", "In a subsequent written submission to ORG the social welfare worker in the applicant 's prison testified to his exemplary conduct and strong attachment to his daughter . Meetings DATE would therefore not be contrary to her best interests . Supporting such meetings had been the practice in many similar cases involving a male prisoner and a child without a mother . The applicant 's ethnic background should not be allowed to influence the decisions concerning the access question .", "On DATE The Children interviewed the applicant in prison in regard to the access question . The applicant was assisted by an interpreter . According to the report which ORG forwarded to ORG , the applicant had requested to see Y. in prison in the area designated for visits by family members . The applicant had accepted Y. 's public care , her foster parents and the fact that she would be accompanied by them during her visits . The applicant had indicated that he would be able to speak some NORP with her . He had denied certain allegations made by PERSON 's mother 's relatives but did not object to meeting them , if they so wished . At the end of the meeting PERSON had informed the applicant that he would receive copies of the relevant documents through his counsel . In her written cover letter to the ORG dated DATE The Children urged it to maintain the access prohibition until meetings became a natural matter of consideration in the course of ORG 's development .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant had submitted his written views directly to ORG without the assistance of his counsel .", "On DATE ORG upheld the access prohibition issued on DATE . The applicant appealed again , requesting that the prohibition either be quashed or that it be amended so as to end around the time when he was expected to be released on parole , i.e. in DATE .", "In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicant 's request for an oral hearing in the care order proceedings . It found that he had not been heard prior to ORG order of CARDINAL DATE . As ORG had referred its order to ORG for its review and the applicant had been able to appeal against the order and comment on the ORG 's submissions to that court , and in light of the evidence on file , there was no reason to quash ORG or the lower court 's decision due to the error in the hearing of the applicant . In its submissions ORG had maintained that domestic law did not allow a father to care for his child in prison .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and referred the matter back for renewed consideration . It did not object to the access prohibition as such , considering that contacts between ORG and the applicant would obviously endanger Y. 's development . It had therefore also been necessary to conceal Y. 's whereabouts from the applicant . The court considered , however , that sufficient reasons had not been shown to justify that the prohibition should last until Y. would reach the age of twelve . It declined to pronounce itself in the first instance on the appropriate duration of the access prohibition and the secrecy order regarding ORG 's whereabouts . The applicant 's request that the ORG be ordered to pay his legal costs was rejected .", "In an opinion of CARDINAL DATE PERSON , a senior physician specialising in child psychiatry , considered Y. 's best interests to warrant an access prohibition lasting at least until her twelfth birthday . PERSON , who gave his opinion in his capacity as Save The Children 's consulting child psychiatrist , stated in extenso as follows :", "( translation from NORP )", "\u201c I have studied Save The Children 's case file . On that basis , without having met the child or others involved in the matter , but having discussed it with the employee of ORG , I consider that the biological father 's request [ for meetings to take place ] is founded on various misunderstandings . He is of the view that the ORG 's way of proceeding violates both parties ' right to respect for their family life , and that the starting point in the decision - making should have been to re - establish [ that ] family on [ his ] release from prison . This , however , would be contrary to both law and morality . The morality of child welfare is based on the same principle as LAW , i.e. on the intention to ensure that the best interests of the child are respected , as opposed to the interests of the parents when [ the CARDINAL sets of interests ] are conflicting . It is clearly in the best interests of [ Y. ] that she can establish a normal and happy family [ life ] in [ her ] current foster family and that she may grow up to be a healthy adult . Meetings with her biological father are possible only in so far as they are not contrary to [ her ] best interests . When the law speaks of the child 's right to meet his or her parents , this refers precisely to a right belonging to the child , and not to a right of a parent to meet his or her child irrespective of the damage or danger which such meetings produce to the child .", "ORG has proposed to fix at DATE the age when [ Y. ] and the applicant might begin to meet . ORG appears to base itself on the principle that a DATE child must be heard before a decision in a matter concerning him or her is taken . From the point of view of child psychiatry I consider that [ this ] age - limit should not be applied categorically . [ The age - limit ] does not signify that from then onwards the child will decide on his or her own in matters of this kind , but that the decisions are made after hearing the child . This means that the foster parents or ORG responsible for the child may arrive at a decision which is contrary to the opinion of the child , if they consider that this is in the child 's best interests . This is a very sensible approach , since a DATE can not be presumed to make absolutely sensible decisions . Ideally , [ Y. 's ] foster parents , who have the most evident and strongest emotional tie to [ her ] , should make all decisions concerning her , since they are best equipped to understand what [ she ] really wishes to do and what is in her best interests . [ Y. ] should be allowed to make decisions completely on her own only when has reached the age of majority , i.e. at DATE . This is also sensible from a psychological point of view : it is only when [ she ] will have reached DATE that her development will not be jeopardised by non - preferable relationships . I would also like to stress that the worst damage done to children nowadays stems from removing them from families to whom they have become attached and whose psychological members they are , with a view to arbitrarily placing them back for instance with their biological parents or parent , with whom the child has no relationship .", "In my view [ the authorities ] should urgently proceed to having [ Y. ] adopted by the foster parents , if they consent to this . The fact that the child is not legally a member of the family to whom [ she ] belongs emotionally is damaging to the child .", "From the point of view of child psychiatry it is therefore justified that meetings between [ Y. ] and the applicant are not organised until she turns CARDINAL and thereafter only if she clearly expresses a wish to meet him and provided that the adults who love her consider such meetings useful to her . The father should understand that a child is not an object which he can own , but a living human being , who is entitled to live his or her own life according to his or her own emotions . \u201d", "PERSON opinion was not served on the applicant prior to the decision of ORG of PERSON of DATE , whereby the access prohibition was again maintained until DATE . The applicant appealed and requested an oral hearing . He objected , inter alia , to not having been heard in respect of Dr PERSON 's opinion and not knowing what precise material it had been based on . The applicant stated his wish to examine Dr PERSON as witness and stated that he might also call a witness of his own choosing .", "On DATE ORG held an oral hearing at which PERSON was heard as witness . The applicant had not called any further witness .", "In his further submissions of DATE to ORG the applicant stressed that he could not afford calling expert witnesses to counter PERSON views . He therefore adduced copies of documents from a case in which neither ORG nor the experts consulted had even suggested an access prohibition in respect of a child , whose NORP father had killed the mother . That child had not been placed in public care , being cared for by her maternal grandmother .", "In its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . The court now found that the duration of the access prohibition , as maintained by ORG , was justified . The applicant received the decision on DATE . No further appeal lay open .", "In DATE the Police of the Valkeakoski District proposed that the applicant be expelled to GPE on his release on parole , and banned from returning to GPE . The applicant opposed the proposals on the grounds that such a decision would sever his family ties to Y. , in violation of LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( ulkomaalaisvirasto , utl\u00e4nningsverket ) refused the applicant 's request for a further residence permit . On DATE it ordered his expulsion to GPE and banned him from re - entering GPE . The ORG noted that his only family tie to GPE consisted of Y. , whom he had been banned from meeting . Given the specific features of their family relationship , the heinous crime which the applicant had committed , thereby displaying his danger to others , the interference with his right to respect for his family life was justified under LAW . The re - entry ban could be reconsidered if , for instance , he later obtained a right to see LAW Under a NORP treaty this ban extends to the other LOC countries .", "At a meeting between PERSON , the applicant and the foster parents on DATE the applicant was told that various experts had advised against enabling him to meet Y. even once before leaving GPE . Even observing her without her knowledge would have been contrary to her best interests . It transpired from the meeting that the foster parents would continue to forward to NORP the applicant 's letters and gifts as well as to keep him informed of her development .", "In DATE the applicant was released on parole and left GPE . On DATE ORG upheld the expulsion order .", "According to various opinions of DATE issued by the prison governor , prison psychologist and other staff , the applicant 's conduct in prison had been exemplary .", "ORG ( oikeusauputoimisto , r\u00e4ttshj\u00e4lpsbyr\u00e5n ) of PERSON awarded the applicant legal aid both for the purposes of the domestic court proceedings and for bringing his application under the Convention . This award covered counsel 's fees but not the costs incurred .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG shall take a child into care and provide substitute care for him or her if ( a ) the child 's health or development is seriously endangered by lack of care or other conditions at home , or if the child seriously endangers his or her health and development by abuse of intoxicants , by committing an illegal act other than a minor offence , or by any other comparable behaviour , ( b ) the measures of assistance in open care are not appropriate or have proved to be inadequate ; and ( c ) foster care is considered to be in the best interests of the child .

An emergency care order shall expire within DATE of the decision , unless referred for reconsideration under LAW of LAW . An ordinary care order pursuant to section CARDINAL must be issued within DATE , or on special grounds within DATE , of the emergency order . Both ordinary and emergency care orders may be appealed to the administrative courts .", "The child 's custodians , biological parents and de facto carers shall be heard in respect of a proposal to issue or revoke a public care order or to place a child outside his or her original home . They shall further be notified of the decision taken ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , as amended by Act no . GPE ) . The hearing procedure is governed by LAW .

A matter may be decided without a preceding hearing of a party inter alia if such a hearing would be manifestly unnecessary , would jeopardise the purpose of the decision or if the decision can not be postponed . LAW requires that the competent authority duly investigate the matter before it and ensure the equality of the parties .", "If an ordinary care order has been issued pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW without the prior hearing of a party , the social welfare board shall forward it to ORG within DATE , unless the party in question could not be located with reasonable means or the child has no contact with that party , in which case a hearing would not be justified ( section DATE , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "If a party appeals against an order issued under LAW , ORG shall also review it ( section DATE ) .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , a child who is being cared for outside his or her original home shall be ensured those important , continuous and secure human relations which are important for his or her development . The child is entitled to meet his or her parents and other close persons and to keep in touch with them ( subsection CARDINAL ) . ORG shall support and facilitate the child 's contacts with his or her parents and other close persons ( subsection CARDINAL ) .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW ( lastensuojeluasetus , barnskyddsf\u00f6rordning DATE ) , ORG or the director of a children 's home may restrict the right of access of a child in foster care to its parents or other persons close to him or her if ( a ) such access clearly endangers the development or safety of the child ; or if ( b ) such a restriction is necessary for the safety or security of the parents , or the children or staff in the children 's home .
