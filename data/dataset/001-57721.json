Generally I find it unhelpful in making recommendations in DATE to go back further than DATE but to understand the arrest and detention sections of the [ CARDINAL Act ] it is useful to note that LAW of LAW ( GPE ) DATE provided :", "\u2018 Any Officer of the ORG for the preservation of the peace and maintenance of order , may authorise the arrest without warrant and detention for a period of not more than TIME of any person for the purpose of interrogation.\u2019 ( My emphasis ) .", "This general power of arrest for questioning did not disappear entirely when LAW was repealed by GPE .

But nowhere in these acts do the words \u2018 for the purpose of interrogation\u2019 appear . That is left to be inferred . There is widespread criticism of the alleged illegal use of arrest for \u2018 information gathering\u2019 or low grade intelligence and harassment . It might be better if the power of the ORG were expressly spelled out in the LAW linked of course to appropriate controls . That the police have such a power under the ORG was accepted by ORG in ORG ) in NORP v. PERSON ( DATE ) ORG .", "CARDINAL . In contrast to the provisions of the [ CARDINAL Act ] which deal with the trial of terrorist offences and do not require derogation from DATE ( article CARDINAL ) of ORG , those which deal with the powers of arrest appear to contravene the minimum requirements of LAW ) . Consequently GPE entered a notice of derogation under LAW article CARDINAL ) . LAW ) ( article DATE ) requires reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence and arrest for the purpose of bringing the offender before a competent court . LAW [ of LAW ] requires neither , nor is an offence necessary . ... Any action which can be taken to avoid GPE having to rely on the notice of derogation to excuse breaches of the Convention is desirable .", "...", "Suspicion or reasonable suspicion", "CARDINAL . Only a lawyer or a legislator would suspect ( or reasonably suspect ? ) a difference . But there is one because , say the judges , with whom I agree , ORG by using the CARDINAL phrases must have so intended . The test for LAW is a subjective one : did the arrestor suspect ? If his suspicion is an honest genuine suspicion that the person being arrested is a terrorist , a court can not enquire further into the exercise of the power . But where the requirement is reasonable suspicion it is for the court to judge the reasonableness of the suspicion . It is an objective standard . The facts which raise the suspicion may be looked at by the court to see if they are capable of constituting reasonable cause . Reasonable suspicion is itself a lower standard than evidence necessary to prove a prima facie case . Hearsay may justify reasonable suspicion but may be insufficient for a charge .", "CARDINAL . The only danger that I can foresee if the requirement of reasonableness is added to suspicion is that the facts raising the suspicion might have come from a confidential source which could not be disclosed in court in a civil action for wrongful arrest . Against this there is the requirement of reasonable suspicion in LAW ORG which the ORG have used more extensively in DATE and DATE .

No evidence has been given to me to suggest that suspicion as against reasonable suspicion has been a factor in a decision to use LAW in preference to LAW and indeed some senior police officers have told me it would not influence them . I also understand that the police are now trained to treat arrest for terrorist offences as requiring similar suspicion as for all other offences . I therefore conclude that reasonable suspicion should be required when a constable arrests without warrant and this should be included in the new arrest powers which I propose in substitution for LAW ) and in Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "...", "CARDINAL . There is no need to name a specific offence when arresting under LAW or to inform the suspect of the grounds on which he is being arrested as would be required by the common law , which is that \u2018 a citizen is entitled to know on what charge or suspicion of what crime he is ORG . It is sufficient to say that the arrest is under the section on the grounds that he is suspected of being a terrorist . ... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The exercise of the power of arrest in LAW ( CARDINAL ) has been considered by ORG in the case of LOC v. Chief Constable for GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports DATE . In that case ORG held that the proper exercise of the power of arrest in CARDINAL depended upon the state of mind of the arresting officer . It was necessary that the arresting officer suspected the person he was arresting to be a terrorist ; otherwise the arrest was unlawful . He could form that suspicion on the basis of information given to him by his superior officer , but he could not arrest under LAW on the instructions of a superior officer who held the necessary suspicion unless the arresting officer himself held that suspicion . Lord PERSON , with whom the other Law Lords agreed , stated that the suspicion need not be a reasonable suspicion but it had to be honestly held . The requirement of a suspicion in the mind of a constable was a subjective test . That being so , the courts could only enquire as to the bona fides of the existence of the suspicion . The only issues were whether the constable had a suspicion and whether it was honestly held .", "CARDINAL .

Chief Constable , loc . cit . ) .", "CARDINAL .
