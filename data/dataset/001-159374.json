AZERBAIJAN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 - Right to free elections-{general} (Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 - Stand for election)", "JUDGES": "Carlo Ranzoni;Khanlar Hajiyev", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 dates of birth and places of residence are given in the Appendix .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were nominated by the Karabakh Election Bloc as candidates in the parliamentary elections of CARDINAL DATE and applied for registration as candidates in various single - mandate electoral constituencies ( see Appendix ) .", "CARDINAL . As LAW required that each nomination as a candidate for parliamentary elections be supported by a minimum of CARDINAL voters , the applicants on various dates submitted sheets containing the signature of CARDINAL voters collected in support of their candidacy to their respective ORG ( \u201c ConECs \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before a decision by a ConEC on registering an applicant as a candidate , the signature sheets and the other registration documents submitted by the applicants had first to be verified by special working groups ( i\u015f\u00e7i qrupu ) established by the ConECs . None of the applicants were invited to participate in the examination of their sheets of signatures by the PERSON working groups .", "CARDINAL . The GPE on various dates ( see PERSON ) issued decisions to refuse the ORG requests for registration as a candidate , after the PERSON working groups had found that some of the voter signatures were invalid and that the remaining valid signatures had numbered CARDINAL . Signatures were found to be invalid on several grounds in each case , including : ( a ) falsified or repeat signatures ( \u201c signatures made repeatedly by the same individuals who had already signed sheets in the name of other individuals \u201d ) ; ( b ) incorrect personal information on voters ( birth date , identity card number , and so on ) ; ( c ) signatures by persons whose identity cards had expired ; ( d ) signatures belonging to voters registered outside the constituency ; ( e ) uncertified corrections in signature sheets ; ( f ) withdrawal by the signature collector of his or her own signature certifying a list , invalidating the entire list of CARDINAL signatures ; and ( g ) unspecified \u201c other grounds \u201d ; and so on .", "CARDINAL . None of the applicants were invited to the ConEC meetings where decisions to refuse their requests for registration were taken . In each case , despite the requirements of the law , all the relevant working group documents ( expert opinions , TIME of the meeting , records and tables of results of the examination ) , as well as the ConEC decision itself , were only made available to the applicants after the decision to refuse their registration had been taken . In many cases , some of the documents were never made available to the applicants or were only made available to them as late as during the subsequent judicial proceedings in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Each applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) against the PERSON decision . They made some or all of the following complaints :", "( a ) the findings of the ConEC working groups that such large numbers of signatures were invalid had been factually wrong , unsubstantiated , and arbitrary . Some of those findings of fact could easily have been rebutted by simply contacting the voter in question and confirming the authenticity of his or her signature . However , the ConECs had not taken any steps to corroborate their findings with any reliable evidence , such as contacting and questioning a number of voters randomly selected from the group whose signatures were suspected of being false . There were no specialist handwriting experts among the members of the ConEC working groups and therefore their findings on the authenticity of some signatures had been highly subjective and arbitrary ;", "( b ) the ConEC decisions to declare the signatures invalid had been arbitrary and in breach of the substantive and procedural requirements of the law . Relying on various provisions of LAW , the applicants argued that unintentional and rectifiable errors in the signature sheets could not serve as a reason to declare a voter signature invalid . If the errors found could be rectified by making the necessary corrections , LAW required the ConEC to notify the particular candidate of this within twentyfour TIME and to provide him or her with an opportunity to make corrections in the documents before deciding on his or her registration as a candidate . The ConECs had , however , declared large numbers of signatures invalid in the case of each applicant on the basis of easily rectifiable errors , without informing the candidates in advance and giving them an opportunity to make necessary corrections ;", "( c ) the procedure followed by the ConECs had also breached other requirements of LAW . Contrary to the requirements of LAW , the applicants had not been informed in advance of the time and place of the examination of the signature sheets and their presence had not been ensured . Contrary to the requirements of LAW , the applicants had also not been provided with a copy of the minutes of the examination of the validity of the signature sheets CARDINAL prior to the PERSON meeting dealing with their respective requests for registration . Subsequently , none of the applicants had been invited to the ConEC meetings , which had deprived them of the opportunity to argue for their position ;", "( d ) some of the grounds for invalidation were not provided by law and therefore to declare signatures invalid on these grounds had been unlawful . For example , LAW did not allow the invalidation of a signature merely because the voter \u2019s identity document had recently expired ;", "( e ) in some cases , various local public officials and police officers had applied undue pressure on voters or signature collectors to \u201c withdraw \u201d their signatures on the grounds that they had been tricked to sign in the candidate \u2019s favour \u201c by deceptive means \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG arranged for another examination of the signature sheets by members of its own working group . None of the applicants was invited to participate in that examination process . The ORG working group found in each case that large numbers of signatures were invalid and that the remaining valid signatures were below the minimum required by law .", "CARDINAL . NORP In each case , the number of signatures found to be invalid by the ORG working group differed from the number given by the particular ConEC working group , with differences often being significant . Furthermore , in almost every case the grounds for declaring signatures invalid given by the ORG had been different from the grounds given for the same signature sheets by the ConEC . In most cases a certain number of the total signatures were also declared invalid on the grounds that they had \u201c appeared \u201d to have been falsified , that is , \u201c made by the same person in the name of other people \u201d ( \u201c ehtimal ki , eyni \u015f\u0259xs t\u0259r\u0259find\u0259n icra olunmu\u015fdur \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On various dates , the ORG rejected the ORG complaints ( see Appendix ) . None of the applicants were invited to attend the ORG meeting dealing with their complaint . Moreover , in each case , all the relevant ORG documents ( including the working group documents ) were only made available to the applicants after the ORG decision had been taken , while in some cases such documents were never given to them at all , or were given as late as at the stage of judicial appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On various dates , each of the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG against the decisions of the electoral commissions . They reiterated the complaints they had made before the ORG concerning the ConEC decisions and procedures . They also raised some or all of the following complaints concerning the ORG \u2019s decisions and procedures :", "( a ) NORP contrary to the requirements of electoral law , the ORG had failed to notify them of its meetings and ensure their presence during the examination of the signature sheets and their complaints ;", "( b ) NORP contrary to the requirements of electoral law , some or all of the relevant ORG documents had not been made available to them , depriving them of the opportunity to mount an effective challenge to the ORG decisions ;", "( c ) the decisions of the electoral commissions had been based on expert opinions that had contained nothing more than conjecture and speculation ( for example , that the signatures had \u201c appeared \u201d ( \u201c ehtimal ki \u201d ) to have been falsified ) , instead of properly established facts ;", "( d ) in those cases where the applicants had submitted additional documents in support of their complaints , the ORG had ignored those submissions and failed to take them into account .", "CARDINAL . Relying on a number of provisions of domestic law , and directly on LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , the applicants claimed that their right to stand for election had been infringed .", "CARDINAL . On various dates ( see Appendix ) , ORG dismissed appeals by the applicants , finding that their arguments were irrelevant or unsubstantiated and that there were no grounds for quashing the decisions of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged cassation appeals with ORG , reiterating their previous complaints and arguing that ORG had not carried out a fair examination of the cases and had delivered unreasoned judgments .", "CARDINAL . On various dates ( see Appendix ) , ORG dismissed the ORG appeals as unsubstantiated , without examining their arguments in detail , and found no grounds to doubt the findings of the electoral commissions or of ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
