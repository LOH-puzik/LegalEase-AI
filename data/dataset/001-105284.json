The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE / Main .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was serving a prison sentence in Butzbach prison . In DATE the Butzbach prison authorities ordered him to move from his single cell to a cell which he would have to share with CARDINAL other inmates and which did not have a screen or curtain separating the toilet from the rest of the cell .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE the applicant , referring to a decision given by ORG in DATE in a case concerning a different prisoner , informed the head of Butzbach prison that accommodation in such a cell was generally unlawful and that he refused to move . On that same date , the applicant lodged a motion with ORG , which was brought to the attention of that court only after the applicant \u2019s transfer to the multi - occupancy cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison staff ordered the applicant to vacate his single cell and announced that they would use force ( unmittelbarer GPE ) if he refused to do so . Accordingly , the applicant vacated his cell and was taken to the multi - occupancy cell . At the door of that cell , however , he again refused to move into the cell . Subsequently , a scuffle ensued between the applicant and prison staff . According to the applicant \u2019s submissions , he was kicked and beaten by the prison staff , while he had merely passively resisted being placed into the multi - occupancy cell . According to the Government , the applicant kicked the prison staff .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant was forcibly taken to a security cell which had no items which could cause danger ( besonders gesicherter ORG ohne gef\u00e4hrdende Gegenst\u00e4nde ) , where he was strip - searched and undressed . It is not clear from the material submitted by the parties whether the applicant remained naked for the whole period of time he spent in the security cell .", "CARDINAL . The security cell had a size of QUANTITY and was equipped as follows : CARDINAL doors with chain link , CARDINAL cameras , CARDINAL milky glass pane for daylight , CARDINAL mattress with fire - proof sheet , CARDINAL squat toilet , CARDINAL call system , CARDINAL windows above the doors , aluminium ceiling with ventilation slits , tiled floor . The temperature of the cell was controlled to ensure comfort , and the meals were served at the usual times .", "CARDINAL . Following his placement in the security cell , the applicant was examined by the prison physician who diagnosed minor bruising on the applicant \u2019s front and his left shin and bruising and a small hematoma on his left thorax . On CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant was re - examined by the prison physician . According to the physician \u2019s report submitted on DATE , the injuries would heal without complications ; the bruising in the thorax area could , according to medical experience , cause discomfort for a longer period of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was visited by a psychiatrist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prison pastor visited the applicant . In his letter to the police dated DATE the pastor made the following statement :", "\u201c As the security chain was locked , which permitted to open the door only slightly , I could see that the prisoner was naked . I am not sure whether he sustained injuries which exceeded bruises and refer to the medical report . However , the prisoner was in a very agitated state of mind and talked about having been beaten by prison staff . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the prison administration made the following report :", "\u201c Since DATE the prisoner is placed in the specially secured room ... Following his medical examination , it was intended to transfer him DATE to a multi - occupancy cell on station PERSON In the presence of the prison guards DATE and myself the prisoner PERSON declared that he insisted on his right to be attributed a single cell as provided by the case - law of ORG and that he would not leave the specially secured room . If this should be done by force , the prison guards would have to \u201c beat him to death \u201d . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was visited by the prison psychologist PERSON who made the following report on his conversation with the applicant :", "\u201c I visited Mr PERSON on DATE in the segregation cell with the intention of finding a way out of the deadlock situation . However , Mr Hellig proved to be unable to compromise and stubbornly insisted on his request to be transferred to a single cell ... He could hardly imagine to remain in this prison after having been abused in connection with his placement in the segregation cell ... I have the impression that Mr Hellig is so obsessed that he is currently unable to compromise and to discuss a temporary solution . He feels mistreated and deprived of the single cell he previously occupied as a prison worker and station aid . Being a sportsperson and non - smoker , he could not be expected to share a cell with smokers . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant stayed in the security cell until TIME on CARDINAL DATE when he consented to being placed in the prison hospital . Thereafter the applicant instituted the following CARDINAL sets of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to declare that his detention in the isolation cell and the force used by the prison authorities had been unlawful . He submitted that he had been kicked and beaten by prison staff even though he had not given the prison guards any reasons to use violence against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request . The ORG took note of the written statements made by the prison pastor , the head of the prison administration and the prison psychologist ( see \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , above ) . It further pointed out that it had been beyond doubt that accommodation in a multi - occupancy cell with toilets that were not separated by screens or curtains from the rest of the cell would have been unlawful , as ORG had already established in its earlier case - law .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG the fact that the applicant was taken to the isolation cell was not due to his refusal to move into the ORG multi - occupancy cell . It was in particular not a disciplinary measure to punish him for resisting , but he was detained in the isolation cell because his behaviour constituted a specific risk of violence and physical harm to other persons ( section QUANTITY , CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of FAC , see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , which allows for temporary detention in security cells .", "CARDINAL . The court based its findings on the statements of the prison personnel , who had confirmed that the applicant had begun pushing and hitting prison staff and that he had become very aggressive when he was ordered to move to the multiple occupancy cell . According to the official statements made by the prison guards , only the prisoner himself had used violence . In view of the applicant \u2019s violent behaviour it had been necessary for the prison authorities to use force to take the applicant into the security cell in order to prevent him from causing harm to the prison guards .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that \u201c it could not be established for certain \u201d whether there was a serious danger of self - injury or suicide during the time of his detention in the specially secured room .", "CARDINAL . Such detention was proportionate as it had not been possible to release the applicant from the cell before DATE . The applicant had announced that the staff members would have to kill him if they wanted to transfer him forcibly into the multi - occupancy cell . It was thus very likely that he would once again have resisted any such transfer . Therefore the specific risk of violent acts by the applicant persisted until DATE . Furthermore , the prison psychologist had stated that the applicant had not at all been ready to reach a compromise and , in particular , that he had stubbornly insisted on being transferred to a single cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal on points of law . He submitted in particular that , under the relevant guidelines , the duration of detention in a specially secured room should not exceed TIME . It followed that his DATE placement had been disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s appeal inadmissible , reasoning that no decision in the matter was required for the purpose of further developing the law or to secure the consistency of the case - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint . He alleged that he had been kicked and beaten before being brought in the security cell , even though he had offered to consent to his placement in the security cell . He further submitted as follows :", "\u201c In the instant case , I do not complain about the deprivation of liberty as such . However , the constitutional complaint is directed against the exceptionally severe conditions of my temporary detention ( \u201c besonders einschneidende Art und Weise meiner zeitweiligen PERSON ) during the execution of sentence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , relying on its Rules of Procedure , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , without giving further reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal proceedings against the prison staff involved in the applicant \u2019s transfer to the security cell . ORG noted that the applicant \u2019s medical examination on CARDINAL . DATE established that he had sustained bruises . An x - ray taken DATE did not reveal any fractures or other bone injuries . It was thus established that the applicant suffered injuries on the occasion of his transfer into the security cell . It could , however , not be established whether these injuries had been caused by the prison staff , in particular by kicking or beating , or if they had been the unavoidable effect of his forced transfer to the security cell .", "CARDINAL .
