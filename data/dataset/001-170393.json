The applicants are husband and wife . They were both born in DATE and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is a well - known journalist in GPE . At the time in question he was the editor of the DATE newspaper ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newspaper published an editorial written by the first applicant entitled \u201c The strategy of the spider \u201d ( \u201c A estrat\u00e9gia da aranha \u201d ) ; the editorial addressed the election of the President of ORG , which had taken place DATE . The article expressed the first applicant \u2019s opinion of the newly elected President , Judge PERSON , and on what his election meant for the NORP judicial system . The first applicant \u2019s editorial reads as follows :", "\u201c The strategy of the spider", "ORG , the man who will be presiding over ORG , represents the dark side of our judiciary .", "Do you want a symbol , a representative , an exemplar of the wrongs of the NORP judicial system ? That \u2019s easy : simply mention the name of ORG and all the wrongs you can think of regarding corporatism , conservatism , atavism , manipulation , games of shadows and influence immediately DATE to mind .", "The judge DATE because we are talking about a judge DATE is a man as intelligent as he is NORP . For DATE , first in ORG [ PERSON dos GPE ] , then [ as a member of ] ORG of the ORG [ FAC hereinafter \u201c LOC ] , and lastly [ sitting on ] ORG , this person DATE of whom the majority of NORP people have never heard \u2013 has been weaving a web of connections , of back - scratching , of favours and undertakings ( there is an even worse word , but I will avoid it ) which enabled him DATE to stick into his somewhat tousled mane the peacock feather he has been lacking : the presidency of ORG . The position is not worth very much ( who , among the readers , knows that the current president of that court is , formally , the fourth - highest - ranking figure of ORG ? ) . It carries some sinecures , perhaps some perks ... but it has little effective power .", "The problem , however , lies in this question : has , or will have [ effective power ] ? The gentlemen judges , who some time ago engaged in a dispute with [ the judges of ] ORG to determine who occupied the more important place in the hierarchy ( those of ORG won ... but gave to those of ORG the consolation of having at their disposal a high - end car ... ) are n\u2019t even much respected . [ That is ] their own fault , as it is known that they occupy their seats in ORG only for DATE in order to beef up their pensions . The president of that giant college of most reverend judges has had little power ; [ however , ] ... ORG presented himself to the voters DATE that is to say , to his peers , and those whom he helped to promote to a position from which one day they would be able to elect him DATE under the kind of manifesto which makes the hair of the most peaceful citizen stand on end . The man did n\u2019t do this out of the goodness of his own heart : at the same time that he was acting as a trade unionist ( he asked for an increase in his salary and that less work be given to judges ... ) he acted as someone who wanted to overthrow the regime ( by wanting to sit on ORG [ LOC ] ) and added the glittering ( due to the amount of accumulated tallow ) hat of \u201c resister \u201d of reforms in the judicial sector . If it was advisable for a President of ORG to pay greater attention to PERSON and the principle of the separation of powers than to the playbook of the ORG [ ORG ] , ORG did exactly the opposite . He laid out his demands in the grandiose manner of a steelworker in a futuristic \u201c socialist realism \u201d painting , forgetting that he is a judge and the highest representative of the third [ branch of government ] , the judiciary , and claimed a place at the table of the \u201c first [ branch ] \u201d , the executive . It is true that the power of ORG is as innocuous as the plume of being president of ORG , but the claim has in itself CARDINAL perversities . Firstly , it is a sign that ORG cares more about his public prominence than the problems of justice . Secondly , and much more serious , the man is volunteering himself to be the face of a group of judges [ that is ] against the reforming decisions of those holding political power which are currently the subject of a broad consensus between the government party and the main opposition force .", "It is so pathetic as to make one laugh , were we not in GPE and if we did not understand how the strategies of the spiders work . The man , I believe without fear of contradiction , is so intelligent and skilful as to be dangerous . But he already has an opponent : the new Attorney - General of the Republic , P.M. , CARDINAL of the rare people to have had the courage to stand up to him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . There was coverage of the election in DATE and following it in various articles in the national press . CARDINAL of those articles , published in P\u00fablico on DATE , was an interview with a member ( juiz conselheiro ) of ORG , DATE , who had severely criticised the electoral system for the post of President of ORG . The relevant parts of the interview read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Q. : Why do n\u2019t you agree with the current system of electing the President of ORG ( ORG ) ?", "TIME : CARDINAL of the functions of ORG ) is the grading of judges who rise to the post of member of the ORG . How do they get to ORG ? Through a competition , and an assessment of their work by the members of the HCJ . Among those members there is a president of judges who , obviously ... has a certain degree of control over [ those judges ] . It does not cross anyone \u2019s mind that they are n\u2019t people whom he trusts ... and I myself am not questioning those people . What is at stake is the system .", "Q. : Because it creates inequality , is that it ?", "TIME : Just look at what happens . The Vice - President of the HCJ is one of the key figures in the choosing of members of the ORG . That man should never be able to run [ for elections to the ORG ] because those who are going to elect him are those whom he has graded .", "Q. : Are you saying it is a distorted system [ sistema viciado ] ?", "TIME : It is a distorted system ... It is not the people \u2013 they are all serious and honest ; the problem is the system itself .", "Q. : Do you support a change to the rules of [ elections ] to the post of President of the ORG ?", "TIME : Yes ; the way these [ elections ] work raises doubts and questions . It is an election which has the appearance of being distorted . Whether it is , I do n\u2019t know ... But it is clear that if [ a person ] has a key role in the admission of A or B to an [ organisation ] , then when [ that person ] has a vote he is going to vote for the person who admitted him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE several articles on the system of elections to the post of President of ORG were published in the media within the context of elections held within that period . Some of these articles called the system into question . For example , on DATE , PERSON published an article , written by PERSON and entitled \u201c Grading of judges may involve a strategy of power \u201d ( \u201c PERSON ju\u00edzes pode envolver estrat\u00e9gia de poder \u201d ) , for which he had interviewed a judge who had challenged the DATE [ competition ] to ORG and who had made allegations that Judge PERSON had been behind the alleged strategy . In that article , ORG made reference to a document circulating among judges in which it was alleged that \u201c PERSON prepared the grading of judges in order to secure a sufficient number of votes for him to be elected as President of the ORG in the next election . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON brought an action in ORG against the applicants for defamation . He sought non - pecuniary damages amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) . The applicants contested the action against them and argued that the second applicant should not have been a party ( ela era parte ileg\u00edtima ) in that she had neither benefited from the article nor had had previous knowledge of it . In fact , the second applicant had not participated at all in the writing or publication of the first applicant \u2019s article ; the civil proceedings for defamation had been instituted against her on the basis of ORG DATE and DATE of the Portuguese Civil Code .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the first applicant attempted to prove , inter alia , ( i ) that he had based his opinion on the different articles that had been published in the media on the elections to ORG , on information obtained from a source whose identity was confidential , and on conversations he had had with different people from the judiciary ( including judges who had challenged the results of the competition for posts as judge in DATE ) ; ( ii ) that the article concerned an issue of public interest ; and ( iii ) that he had written it in good faith . In this regard , several witnesses , including journalists and people from the judiciary ( comunidade judici\u00e1ria ) , were heard . The relevant statements read as follows :", "( i ) PERSON , chairman of ORG from DATE , with whom the first applicant talked , mentioned that he had had conversations with Judge PERSON \u2019s opponents , who had made references to the methods Judge PERSON used to obtain what he wanted ;", "( ii ) M.J. , a former President of ORG , considered that the first applicant had made a political criticism and that he had not intended to attack the man personally but rather in his capacity as a politician and in terms of his way of engaging in politics and of his career , which had been based on trade unionism ;", "( iii ) PERSON mentioned that he had contacted , regarding the article he had written , different people from the judiciary ( judges who had raised suspicions regarding the competition to ORG , judges from the trade union association of judges , and prosecutors ) about Judge PERSON and the system of elections to ORG ; he also acknowledged that he had not talked with members of the PERSON or with Judge PERSON about the issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found for the plaintiff . It considered that the article in question had damaged the plaintiff \u2019s reputation and that the expressions used by the first applicant had been disproportionate and had clearly exceeded the limits on freedom of expression . It considered that the article had diminished public confidence in Judge PERSON and in ORG , thus damaging his honour and reputation . The first applicant was ordered to pay ORG CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . With regard to the second applicant , ORG held that under LAW she should not have been a party to the proceedings and that the compensation amount due arose from an action only attributable to the first applicant .

With regard to the facts , ORG considered that the facts had been correctly established .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered the applicants jointly to pay Judge PERSON CARDINAL , plus interest , in compensation for non - pecuniary damage . It considered the second applicant to be a legitimate party to the proceedings and , with regard to her , it based its decision on the fact that the applicants were married under the community property system ( regime de comunh\u00e3o de adquiridos ) and she did not have any source of income and that therefore , under LAW , the income earned by the first applicant as a journalist and editor of a newspaper directly benefited both of them .", "CARDINAL .
