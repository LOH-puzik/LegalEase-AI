The museum , in its turn , passed it to OAO \u201c Barnaulskiy Pivovarennyy Zavod \u201d , a joint - stock company producing beer .", "The brewery produced several kinds of beer under the common brand \u201c DATE derivative from the grandfather \u2019s name . His portrait , obtained from the museum , was reproduced on beer bottles . The portrait was also extensively used on external advertising boards . CARDINAL of the boards depicted a beer bottle ( with the grandfather \u2019s portrait on it ) playing saxophone .", "On an unspecified date the applicants brought an action against the brewery in ORG . They asked to remove the grandfather \u2019s name and portrait from the beer advertisements because it interfered with their right to confidentiality of family life . The applicants claimed that they felt uneasy when strangers asked them about their relation to the person depicted on the beer bottles . They also claimed that they anguished at the sight of bottles \u2014 with their name and the portrait of a relative on them \u2014 littered about .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the action having found as follows :", "\u201c ... The label of the \u2018 Vorsinskoye\u2019 beer has not yet been registered as a trademark .

They argued that the lack of registration of the trademark should not have been considered as an obstacle to the application of the Trademark Law . According to the applicants , the Trademark Law provided a regulation of similar situations , and therefore it should have been applied by analogy . The applicants also claimed that the Trademark Law did not specify the notion of \u201c heir \u201d separate from that described in LAW , and that the moment of the commencement of succession had been of little importance since the right infringed \u2014 the feeling of kinship \u2014 was of a non - pecuniary nature . The applicants maintained also that the fact that they had passed a copy of the portrait to the museum in no way implied their consent to see it on beer bottles .", "On DATE , ORG disallowed the appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c ...

[ The applicants ] and [ the brewery ] have a dispute in connection with the right of reproduction of the portrait of PERSON in [ the brewery \u2019s ] trademark . The current legislation does not impose such restrictions .", "The reproduction of the great - grandfather \u2019s portrait in the trademark of OAO \u201c Barnaulskiy Pivovarennyy Zavod \u201d , which was founded by ORG , does not infringe or prejudice [ the applicants\u2019 ] personal non - pecuniary interests .
