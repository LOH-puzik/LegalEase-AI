The applicant , ORG , was a NORP limited liability company , with a registered office in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued the applicant company with an operating permit , which was valid until DATE . The applicant company was required to apply for an extension of the permit if the initial conditions of operation did not change . Its main activity consisted in collecting and recycling scrap iron .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) an application for extension of the operating permit had to be submitted DATE prior to the expiry of the previous permit . As the applicant company \u2019s permit was due to expire on DATE , on DATE it applied for an extension of the existing permit .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company also applied to ORG ( \u201c REA \u201d ) for an environmental permit , which according to the law had to accompany the application for extension of the operating permit .", "CARDINAL . NORP REA registered the applicant company \u2019s application but refused to accept the accompanying documents on the grounds that on DATE a new order providing for the authorisation of activities with a significant impact on the environment had been adopted and the guidelines for implementing the new order had not yet been published .", "CARDINAL . The relevant guidelines were published on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE , ORG informed the applicant company that under the new Order no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , its activity was considered to have a significant impact on the environment and that it should therefore follow the authorisation procedure set out in that order . The applicant company was invited to submit new supporting documents within DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company submitted the requested documents on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A new environmental permit was issued on DATE . On DATE the prefecture issued a new operating permit .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant company continued to carry out its activity .", "CARDINAL . Following an inspection carried out at the applicant company \u2019s headquarters , on DATE ORG ( PERSON ) fined the company ORG ( MONEY ) and ordered the confiscation of ROL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , representing the market value of the scrap iron collected for recycling DATE and DATE . The finance inspectorate based its decision ( proces - verbal de constatare \u015fi sanc\u0163ionare a contraven\u0163iilor ) against the applicant company on LAW ( a ) of Emergency Government Ordinance no . ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged a complaint against the decision of ORG , claiming that the competent authorities were responsible for the delay in issuing the operation permit . In this connection , it argued that the application for an extension of the operating permit had been lodged in good time , namely on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the complaint as unfounded . It noted that the decision of DATE was in accordance with LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It also noted that the applicant company had continued to carry out its activity despite the fact that its operating permit had expired on DATE ; it had therefore infringed LAW in conjunction with LAW ( a ) of Emergency Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The court dismissed the applicant company \u2019s claim that liability for its situation lay with the authorities for failing to issue its environmental and operating permits in time , holding that such a claim would be relevant only within the framework of a tort action and could not be raised as a reason for exonerating a company that had committed an administrative offence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal , upholding the decision of the firstinstance court on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company brought administrative proceedings against ORG , seeking to recover the damages incurred as a result of the late issuing of the environmental permit . It based its action on PERSON no . MONEY . It claimed that because of the amendment to the legislation concerning the procedure for issuing permits , the competent authority had not issued its permit in due time . It pointed out that even after the publication of the guidelines for the application of the new order on DATE , ORG had not acted effectively , as it had not written to the applicant company until DATE . Moreover , ORG had interpreted the applicant company \u2019s application as a request for a new permit instead of for an extension of the existing permits , given that the operation conditions had not changed . That had further delayed the authorisation procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the action as premature , holding that the applicant company had not followed the prior procedure required by law before lodging an action with the court .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company lodged an appeal , claiming that the dismissal of its action as premature had been unjustified given that the defendant agency had already submitted its observations on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant company \u2019s appeal . It quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case to the first - instance court for examination on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s action . It held that the applicant company had not complied with the obligation to lodge an application for a new environmental permit DATE prior to the expiry of the existing permit , as provided for by LAW new order regulating the procedure for obtaining an environmental permit , namely Order no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It noted that the previous order , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , had provided only for the obligation to obtain an environmental permit , without establishing the procedure to be followed in that respect . It concluded that the competent agency had issued the environmental permit within the ninetyday deadline provided for by the new order and could not therefore be held liable for the damages incurred by the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged an appeal on points of law , pointing out that on DATE when it had lodged its application for an extension of the operating permit , the guidelines for implementation of the new order had not yet been published . It also claimed that it had been unable to apply for a new permit DATE prior to the expiry of its existing environmental permit on DATE , as the new order had entered into force on DATE and the relevant guidelines had not been published until DATE . The applicant company also complained that the first - instance court had interpreted LAW no . ORG to mean that the administrative authority had the option of extending the existing permit if the operating conditions had not changed , instead of an obligation to extend the permit . In this connection , the applicant company pointed out that , like the previous order , the new order provided for the ope legis extension of an existing permit for DATE if the company \u2019s operating conditions had not changed . It also pointed out that at the time of lodging its application for a new permit on DATE , the applicable law was Order no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which provided for a time - limit of DATE for the issuance or renewal of an operating permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal on points of law , upholding the firstinstance judgment . It held that the law applicable to the applicant company was Order no . ORG , which had entered in force before the expiry of the applicant company \u2019s environmental permit . It concluded that even assuming that the administrative authorities were liable for non - compliance with the applicable legislation , the applicant company had had no right to continue an illicit activity in the absence of the authorisation required by law . The applicant company should have suspended its activity until it had obtained the necessary permits and should then have brought proceedings seeking to recover any damages \u2013 as long as it could prove the existence and extent of such damages .", "CARDINAL . Following a request lodged by the sole shareholder of the applicant company on DATE , ORG took note of the voluntary dissolution of the company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , before the ORG had communicated the applicant company \u2019s complaints to the respondent Government , the administrator and sole shareholder , PERSON , informed ORG dissolution on DATE and his intention to continue the procedure initiated before the ORG by the applicant company ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P1-1-2"]}
