On an unspecified date ORG , who was a NORP national allegedly involved in procuring prostitution , filed a criminal complaint concerning his abduction and robbery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was heard by the prosecutor . He testified that he had been abducted , severely beaten and robbed by several men who had demanded protection money based on the income of foreign prostitutes working under his supervision . ORG had identified the applicant as CARDINAL of his attackers from a photograph .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG identified the applicant during an identity parade . On DATE the applicant and ORG were confronted . During the confrontation ORG reiterated that he had been severely beaten and robbed by the applicant and his accomplices who had demanded protection money from him . The applicant claimed to be innocent . He stated that he knew ORG because he had seen him several times in front of a bar frequented by prostitutes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was summoned to testify as a witness in the case . The summons sent to his NORP address was returned with the information that ORG was resident in GPE . It appears that subsequently the authorities were unable to locate ORG . The investigation was adjourned in order to obtain evidence from another NORP national ( GPE ) by means of legal assistance from the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having kidnapped and robbed ORG in DATE , while acting in an organised criminal gang led by ORG . He was charged accordingly and detained on remand on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with the written grounds for his statement of charges . The document stated that in light of the evidence gathered during the investigation , particularly the testimonies of ORG ( another victim ) and ORG , there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had participated in the abduction and robbery of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , in DATE , the police were still trying to trace ORG in order to summon him for further questioning . It appears that he had not returned to GPE and that he had changed his place of residence in GPE . An arrest warrant had been issued for him in a different criminal case in which he was a suspect . On DATE ORG decided to summon ORG for questioning . On the same date ORG was arrested and transported for questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel submitted his power of attorney to ORG . On DATE a copy of that document was transmitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG heard ORG . ORG undertook to appear before ORG on DATE to give evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the ORG to hear ORG , pursuant to LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The prosecutor justified his request by the risk that it might not be possible to hear ORG at the trial and submitted that the latter \u2019s testimony would be important for the outcome of the case . ORG had been heard by the prosecutor on several occasions during the investigation . However , his whereabouts were not established until DATE . ORG had not been residing at the address indicated to the authorities in DATE and his current address in GPE remained unknown . The prosecutor \u2019s request also contained a list of suspects and their defence counsel , including the applicant \u2019s counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the prosecutor \u2019s request to hear ORG on DATE and decided to notify the applicant , the other co - accused and their counsel of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s counsel that he and his client could consult the case file of the investigation from DATE and that the date for the final consultation was fixed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that his counsel had not been notified about the hearing scheduled for DATE but that he had learned about it by chance and had appeared at it . The ORG maintained that the applicant \u2019s counsel had been duly informed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG heard ORG . The hearing was video recorded . The applicant \u2019s counsel requested that the hearing be adjourned on the grounds that he had not had the opportunity to consult the case file of the prosecution , at least as regards the part concerning the previous statements of ORG . The prosecutor opposed those requests and submitted that the case file had not been made accessible due to the need to protect the witness . The prosecutor acknowledged that the case file would be made accessible to all authorised persons as from the DATE . The court refused the request for adjournment since it was not competent to decide on the issue of access to the case file of the investigation without the prosecutor \u2019s prior permission . The counsel maintained that hearing the witness without his having consulted the case file would in effect prevent him from defending his client . The court decided to proceed with the hearing of ORG . The applicant , his counsel and some of the other co - accused left the courtroom in protest .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing ORG described the events in which the applicant and his associates had been allegedly involved . He stated that he recognised the applicant as one of the persons who had committed the alleged offences . Subsequently , he replied to questions put by the prosecutor and CARDINAL of the accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution filed a bill of indictment with the ORG . The applicant was charged with having participated in a criminal gang and with having abducted , deprived of liberty and robbed ORG on DATE . Other members of the same criminal gang were charged with extortion , robbery , kidnapping and profiting from prostitution .", "CARDINAL . The trial started in DATE and the court held in total CARDINAL hearings up to CARDINAL DATE . The trial court made several attempts to summon ORG to the hearings with the assistance of the police . It also sought the assistance of the NORP embassy in GPE in tracking down ORG . All efforts failed . At the hearing held on CARDINAL DATE the trial court decided to show the video recording of the hearing of DATE at which ORG had given his testimony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of having participated in an organised criminal group and of having abducted , deprived of liberty and robbed ORG . ORG and other members of the gang were also convicted . The applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine . The court based its judgment to a decisive extent on the testimony of ORG , who had identified the applicant and the other coaccused as the persons who had abducted him .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial court underlined that ORG had been heard at the preparatory stage of the proceedings pursuant to LAW request , having regard to the risk that it might not be possible to hear him at the main hearing . ORG was a NORP national and did not have a permanent abode in GPE . The court had unsuccessfully attempted to summon him to appear at the main hearing , but the police \u2019s efforts to locate him had been in vain . The court noted that the applicant \u2019s counsel had requested permission to consult the case file and to adjourn the hearing of ORG ; however that request was refused in view of the prosecutor \u2019s objection . In this respect the trial court found that the applicant and his counsel had freely forfeited the opportunity to put questions to ORG . In the court \u2019s view , even without knowledge of the case file , they could have put questions to the witness in relation to the content of his testimony .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel lodged an appeal against the judgment . He complained , relying on LAW , that the applicant \u2019s defence rights had been breached in that the trial court and the prosecutor had deprived him of the opportunity to have access to the case file of the prosecution prior to the only hearing of the main witness . He maintained that he could not have put questions to the witness without knowing the content of the file , in particular the ORG previous testimony . In that way he was deprived of a possibility to pinpoint major differences in the statements of ORG given at various stages of the investigation . The applicant \u2019s counsel submitted that the case file had been ready before DATE , as all investigative actions , except for the hearing of ORG , had already been completed . The applicant \u2019s counsel argued that this had made the whole trial unfair and that the prosecutor \u2019s actions had amounted to a deliberate hindering of his procedural rights . Moreover , the authorities had allowed ORG to leave the country by releasing him and returning his passport although he had committed other offences . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s counsel pointed to certain factual inconsistencies in the statements of ORG related , inter alia , to the date of the alleged abduction as well as the applicant \u2019s role in it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It noted that the testimony of ORG was the key evidence for the applicant \u2019s conviction . With regard to the allegations that the applicant \u2019s defence rights had been breached , ORG established that the applicant and his counsel had been duly summoned and had appeared at the hearing of ORG . It reiterated that the decision whether to allow access to the case file at the investigation stage of the proceedings lay with the prosecutor , and that ensuring the confidentiality of the materials at that stage had been important for the outcome of the investigation . It was for this reason that the ORG authorised the applicant \u2019s counsel to examine the case file only at the final stage of the investigation . The fact that the applicant and his counsel were to take part in the hearing of the witness did not make it obligatory for the prosecutor to allow them access to the case file . The prosecutor had noted during the court session on DATE that the accused would be progressively allowed to examine the case file as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further noted that it transpired from TIME of the hearing that the applicant \u2019s counsel had requested the adjournment of the hearing with a view to consulting all the evidence in the case file . However , granting such a request would have resulted in a significant delay . It was therefore reasonable for the prosecutor to have refused leave on account of concerns for ORG \u2019s safety , having regard to the fact that some members of the gang were still at large and that the testimony of that witness was the key evidence in the case . In those circumstances ORG found that the court had not acted in bad faith when it went ahead with the hearing of ORG in accordance with LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that had the applicant \u2019s counsel considered it necessary to consult the statements of ORG made during the investigation prior to the hearing of ORG , and knowing the date fixed for that hearing , he should have filed the relevant request in advance in order to enable the prosecutor to rule on the request . However , the applicant \u2019s counsel failed to do so and thus deprived himself of the possibility to appeal against the prosecutor \u2019s refusal .", "Moreover , had the applicant \u2019s counsel been present at the hearing of ORG , nothing would have prevented him from putting questions to the witness on the basis of the information he had obtained from his client or with respect to the contents of the ORG testimony given at the hearing . ORG concluded that there had been no violation of LAW in the case , and the trial court had correctly found that the counsel and the accused had the right , but not the obligation , to participate in the hearing of a witness carried out under LAW of the ORG . By leaving the courtroom they had waived their right to participate in the hearing of the witness . Further , ORG considered in detail the issue of the alleged lack of consistency in ORG \u2019s statements with regard to the applicant \u2019s role in the abduction ; however , it rejected them as illfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel lodged a cassation appeal with ORG . He raised similar complaints to those set out in his appeal , maintaining that his lack of knowledge of the content of the case file had made the applicant \u2019s defence illusory .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows :", "\u201c If there is a danger that the witness can not be heard at the hearing , a party or the prosecutor or other body conducting proceedings may submit a request to have the witness heard by a court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code concerns access to the file during investigation . It provides :", "\u201c Unless otherwise provided by law , during the preparatory proceedings parties , defence counsel and legal representatives shall be allowed to consult the files and make certified copies and photocopies but only with the permission of the person conducting the preparatory proceedings . With the permission of a prosecutor and in exceptional circumstances access to the files in the preparatory proceedings may be given to another person . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
