On DATE the applicant appealed to the FAC ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) against the order for his detention . On DATE he lodged a pleading supplementing his appeal .

Meanwhile , on DATE , the FAC had considered the applicant 's request for release , in which he had alleged a breach of LAW in that after having been arrested he had not been brought before a judge . The court dismissed the request and held , inter alia , that the fact that the detention had been imposed by the prosecutor , i.e. a party to the proceedings , was not a factor that would justify releasing him .

Between CARDINAL May and DATE he made CARDINAL such applications and appealed against each refusal . The courts reiterated the grounds they had previously given for his continued detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also repeatedly challenged the impartiality of the trial judges and complained about the conduct of the registry clerk who was responsible for the record of the trial . From CARDINAL May to DATE he made CARDINAL applications for the judges to be disqualified from dealing with his case .", "CARDINAL . After the hearing that was held DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the next one was listed for DATE . On DATE , the court heard evidence from the applicant 's wife .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the court made an application under LAW of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) to ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) , asking it to prolong the applicant 's and NORP . PERSON 's detention for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , hearings set for DATE and DATE , had been cancelled ; the former because PERSON , CARDINAL of the applicant 's co - defendants , had failed to appear , the latter because ORG and another co - defendant , E.Cz . had not been present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE a massive flood - wave inundated the LOC - West of GPE , severely affecting ORG . A considerable part of the city was washed away or destroyed .", "CARDINAL .

He complained that on CARDINAL and DATE a flood - wave had inundated the prison building up to the third floor . The light , electricity and sewage systems had been destroyed . There had been no drinking water , food or washing facilities . He and his fellow inmates were , in his words , kept like animals in unventilated , overcrowded and stinking cells . He asserted that an official tolerance for that situation amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent hearings , which were to be held on DATE , did not take place because , on the first date , the defence counsel for PERSON and NORP .

On DATE the court made the second application under LAW to ORG , asking it to prolong the applicant 's and ORG . PERSON 's detention for a further period of DATE . In the reasoning , the court reiterated the grounds previously given for the applicant 's detention . It further referred to the risk that he might induce witnesses to give false testimonies or to obstruct the trial by other unlawful means , and the likelihood of a heavy penalty being imposed on him . In that connection , the court stated that the applicant , when giving evidence , had refused to reveal names of certain clients of his company and stated that he would not do so unless he had considered it to be pertinent . The court next pointed out that the applicant 's detention should continue because there were no special circumstances justifying his release , as defined in LAW . It also stressed that it still needed to obtain voluminous evidence . In its opinion , all those above - mentioned obstacles made it impossible for it to give judgment within the terms referred to in LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the President of ORG , asking that he be brought to the session concerning the prolongation of his detention beyond the statutory time - limit , so that he could present his arguments . He relied on LAW and a number of constitutional provisions , notably those stipulating that self - executing provisions of an international treaty took priority over domestic law . He also complained that ORG had not served a copy of the application of DATE on him and that , in consequence , he could not contest effectively the grounds for the prolongation his detention given by that court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a copy of that application . On DATE he prepared a statement addressed to the President of ORG and once again asked that he be brought from prison to the session concerning the prolongation of his detention . He also complained about the conduct of the presiding judge . He stressed that the judge was not fair in considering that he should be held in custody inasmuch as the trial had to be postponed only because of his released co - defendants ' repeated failure to appear before the court . In that context , the applicant pointed out that the court would have avoided the delays caused by the conduct of those co - defendants if it had severed promptly the charges against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG cancelled a hearing as ORG had not yet examined the application of DATE and had not returned the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a session at which it dealt with that application .

After having heard the Prosecutor 's arguments ( who opposed the motion ) , ORG rejected the applicant 's request .", "Referring to the grounds for the extension of the applicant 's detention beyond the statutory time - limit , ORG held that the circumstances adduced by ORG showed that it was likely that he would induce the witnesses to give false testimonies or otherwise obstruct the trial . It further found that , given the fact that the case was of a particular complexity and that the trial court had to obtain various evidence , the applicant should still be held in custody in order to secure the proper conduct of the trial . Lastly , ORG pointed out that despite the factors that had to date contributed to the prolongation of the trial , ORG should nevertheless accelerate the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The trial was to restart on DATE but it was postponed to CARDINAL DATE because the police had not brought E.Cz . from prison and PERSON 's counsel had not appeared before the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's application for his detention to be lifted and replaced by another preventive measure . The court considered that the applicant should be held in custody because a severe penalty might be imposed on him . It stressed that the applicable sentence ranged from DATE imprisonment . It further considered that the fact that the applicant had refused to reveal the identity of some of his company 's clients showed that , had he been released , he would have induced witnesses to give false testimonies or otherwise obstructed the proper course of the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court cancelled a hearing because the police had not brought the applicant and E.Cz . from prison . On DATE the applicant made an application for release , asking the court to vary the preventive measure imposed on him .
