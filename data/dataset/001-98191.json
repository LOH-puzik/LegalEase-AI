THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Neboj\u0161a Vu\u010dini\u0107;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON of ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s personal circumstances", "The applicant served a sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for offences relating to the importation of drugs , from which he secured early release in DATE . The applicant has a long - term girlfriend who has a child from a previous relationship . He also has an adult son from a previous relationship . Whilst in prison , he kept in contact with these and other family members by telephone .", "As a prisoner , the applicant \u2019s earnings were limited . He earned on average about GBP DATE . Prisoners can only make telephone calls if they have credit on their prison pin account .", "The applicant \u2019s complaint to ORG", "On DATE the applicant submitted a complaint to ORG that the charges for telephone calls made from prisons were not equivalent to those made from payphone boxes in the community .", "On DATE the ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s complaint and recommended that ORG reopen negotiations with ORG ( \u201c BT \u201d , their telephone communications provider ) over the cost of prison telephone calls , \u201c with a view to reducing the tariff so that prisoners are not penalised for making longer calls . \u201d", "In his consideration of the applicant \u2019s complaint , the ORG made the following observations ; Firstly , he noted that the cost of a telephone call from a prison telephone was higher than the cost of a call from a public payphone if the call lasted TIME . In particular , if a prisoner were to make a TIME telephone call it would cost him / her over CARDINAL times more from a prison telephone compared to a public payphone . It was further remarked that ORG had entered into a contract with ORG in DATE for the provision of telephone services to prisoners . The contract was awarded following a tendering process . The invitation to tender had required that prisoners should not be charged above public payphone rates and the contract itself had also stated that prices would be kept to the public payphone level . Moreover , the contract identified that a commission would be paid by ORG on the sale of all telephone credits to prisoners .", "The difference in charges had first arisen in DATE when GPE decided to increase the minimum charge for using a public payphone from MONEY to MONEY . ORG wished to retain a MONEY minimum charge and thus decided to agree to a different regime of call charges to that applied in the community . The deviation between the charging system in prisons and public payphones had since increased owing to more competitive public pricing .", "The change in the contract appeared to have been confirmed in a Change Control Note between ORG and ORG dated DATE . It further appeared that there was no tendering process adopted at this or any other time since the deviation in charging rates . Figures obtained by the ORG \u2019s investigator suggested that prisoners lost significant amounts of money as a result of their not being charged public payphone rates for making telephone calls . In the applicant \u2019s case , he had lost GBP CARDINAL per annum as a consequence of being required to pay more than public payphone rates . This represented over CARDINAL months\u2019 earnings for the applicant .", "The ORG also highlighted that no impact assessment had been undertaken of the effect on prisoners of the decision that charges for prison telephone calls should deviate from those for public payphones . The information obtained in the course of the ORG \u2019s investigation suggested that the average length of a prisoner \u2019s call was TIME , which meant that a significant proportion of the prison population was likely to be disadvantaged .", "Finally , the ORG considered that , given the high levels of literacy problems amongst prisoners , the choice to communicate by letter or telephone was not an equal one . Furthermore , letter writing between family and friends was on the decline in society at large . The immediacy and intimacy of telephone communication could not be substituted by letter writing . In particular , letter writing was time consuming , and whilst prisoners might have the time to write , their family and friends outside might not . The high cost of telephone calls would have an indirect impact on ORG ability to maintain contact with their family and friends .", "CARDINAL . The reaction of ORG to the ORG \u2019s Report", "On DATE , in a letter directed to ORG , ORG ( \u201c Director General \u201d ) stated that the separate pricing structure from that used in payphones was assumed following the introduction of the MONEY minimum charge in DATE and that it ensured that pricing was consistent so that prisoners who made short calls did not effectively subsidise those who made longer calls .", "The Director General further maintained that the majority of calls made by prisoners were short while PERCENT of calls lasted TIME . PERCENT of calls lasted TIME and PERCENT of calls were DATE , which was the point where public payphone calls became cheaper by comparison . Having regard to the foregoing , the Director General saw no reason to change the practices in this area .", "In a letter dated DATE the Director General confirmed its intention not to follow the ORG \u2019s recommendation . It was underlined that the current contract with ORG would expire in DATE and that GPE had been informed that there would be no extension .", "The applicant \u2019s letter before action to the Secretary of ORG", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote a letter before action challenging ORG failure to reduce the excessive cost of telephone calls for prisoners .", "On DATE ORG responded to the applicant \u2019s letter before action . They made the following arguments . The pricing structure for telephone calls made by prisoners was reasonable and proportionate as it prevented prisoners who made short telephone calls from subsidising those making long telephone calls . Any reduction in the cost of calls would require a subsidy from the taxpayer which was unacceptable . Moreover , there was no legal obligation for ORG to provide prisoners with telephone services . It could therefore be argued that ORG access to a telephone was a privilege and not a right . Prisoners traditionally made calls of short duration and historical call data suggested that PERCENT of prisoner calls would be cheaper using the prison call rates . Prisoners still benefited from the MONEY minimum charge and analysis of the historical call data clearly indicated that a significant volume of calls were terminated before the connection was made ( for example due to an answering machine or the unavailability of the person sought ) . Finally , the contract with ORG allowed prisoners to pay for their calls with ORG the whole cost of the telephone network with the potential to make a profit .", "The applicant \u2019s application for permission to apply for judicial review", "On DATE the applicant lodged an application for permission to apply for judicial review of ORG refusal to reopen negotiations with ORG , with regard to reducing the cost of telephone calls for prisoners as recommended by the ORG .", "On DATE PERSON refused the application following a review of the papers . In so doing , he reasoned that even if LAW was engaged , which he doubted , given the other means available to the applicant to maintain family contact ( such as correspondence , visits and short telephone calls ) , and despite their limitations , any interference was not arguably so serious so as to amount to an infringement of the applicant \u2019s LAW . The applicant had contended that his rights under LAW had been violated as it had not been demonstrated that there were legitimate reasons for the charging regime . Though one might agree or disagree with ORG assertion that prisoners were better served by the current charging regime in place , it was an entirely rational justification . The fact that no research had demonstrated that ORG view was true did not mean that there was a lack of justification or that there was an arguable breach of LAW .", "On DATE permission to apply for judicial review was again refused following an oral hearing . PERSON pointed out that the applicant \u2019s claim for a mandatory order was impossible , but he accepted that if a breach of the applicant \u2019s Convention rights had occurred , it would be appropriate for the court to make a declaration to that effect . In refusing the application , GPE J considered that LAW was engaged in a limited sense as prisoners , notwithstanding their incarceration , had a family life . Of course , such family life could not be maintained in the same way as someone at liberty would seek to maintain it but it nevertheless could be maintained by correspondence , family visits and telephone calls . Within that context , telephone calls were of some importance . Consequently , the ability of a prisoner to communicate with his family by telephone was capable of engaging LAW and any interference would \u201c arguably amount to a violation of that right unless it could be shown under LAW to be proportionate and justified . \u201d", "It was \u201c self evident \u201d that this was a \u201c question of fact and degree and that not every restriction upon free use of telephone facilities can constitute an interference with family life such as to engage LAW In GPE view , the facts of the present case were incapable of giving rise to a reasonable argument that the applicant \u2019s LAW had been infringed . The means of communication open to prisoners , which included correspondence , family visits and telephone calls ( albeit on the tariff criticised by the Ombudsman ) demonstrated proper regard for the family life of serving prisoners . The fact that a different tariff would permit prisoners to make telephone calls at a lesser cost than under the current regime was \u201c simply incapable of infringing family rights in the circumstances ... \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal to grant him permission to apply for judicial review", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the refusal to grant him permission to apply for judicial review . PERSON , in delivering judgment , accepted at the outset that under the prison telephone regime applicable to the applicant \u201c ... a TIME call from prison costs \u00a3 MONEY , or CARDINAL times the public box rate \u201d . He further found that DATE was capable of being engaged by an issue relating to telephone calls made by prisoners to their families . He considered that the question before the court was whether the availability of telephone calls in itself engaged LAW , and if so , whether the facts of the case demonstrated an interference sufficiently severe to breach LAW .", "In light of this ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE , it was doubtful whether it was open to the ORG even to question the availability of telephone calls through the application of LAW . Notwithstanding , the circumstances in the present case with regard to the availability of telephone calls were not sufficiently severe to constitute an interference under LAW . As such , ORG had no obligation to justify the charging regime as being proportionate under LAW .", "As to the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , a limited approach had to be taken when considering whether the availability of telephone calls fell within the ambit of LAW . In light of the fact that LAW was not engaged in the circumstances , LAW could not be relied on . In any event , in respect of use of the telephone , prisoners could not claim to be in a relatively comparable position to persons in the wider community .", "ORG Complaint to ORG ( ORG )", "On DATE the ORG submitted a complaint to ORG , with the assistance of ORG ( PRT ) . The complaint stated specifically that the high cost of telephone calls made by prisoners in GPE , GPE and GPE seemed unrelated to the cost of provision of the service and that the service contract itself prevented competition .", "On DATE ORG published its response to the complaint . It found that the cost of telephone calls made by prisoners appeared to be high compared to the measure of costs involved and the cost of telephone calls in private prisons . It also noted that at least until DATE , the average cost of telephone calls from ORG prisons in GPE , GPE and GPE was higher than if the same pattern of telephone calls were made from a GPE public payphone . In particular , the average cost of a telephone call to a landline was MONEY from a prison telephone but MONEY from a GPE public payphone . It was observed that CARDINAL of the QUANTITY privately managed prisons in the GPE operated on a non - BT pinphone system . The average cost of a telephone call from ORG prisons in GPE , GPE and GPE to a landline was MONEY but only MONEY to MONEY from private prisons not using the ORG pin - phone system . Moreover , under the contract with ORG received a PERCENT commission on the revenue generated by telephone calls made by prisoners . BT , on the other hand , received a relatively high rate of return on the revenue generated by these telephone calls which amounted to PERCENT return over the entire contract period until DATE and which was worth MONEY in revenue .", "ORG recommended early renegotiation between ORG and ORG current service contract with a view to reducing the cost of telephone calls made by prisoners . ORG warned that if ORG did not engage in early renegotiation , or if the renegotiation was unsuccessful in reducing the cost of telephone calls , they might reconsider the matter and take further action . This further action could include referring the matter to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Telephone Services", "The prison telephone service ( except in certain private prisons ) is provided under a contract between ORG and ORG . A prisoner will pay MONEY for TIME of any call to a GPE landline and CARDINAL p for each TIME thereafter .", "In public telephone boxes , a minimum charge of MONEY is imposed for any call of TIME , and thereafter MONEY for each period of TIME .", "This means that calls by a prisoner that last for TIME are cheaper than from a public payphone , but longer calls will be more expensive than public telephone calls by amounts significantly increasing as the call increases in length . For instance , a TIME call from prison costs GBP MONEY , or CARDINAL times than from a public payphone .", "Prison Rules", "Rule CARDINAL of the Prison Rules DATE ( SI CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ( \u201c the DATE Rules \u201d ) provides the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . - ( CARDINAL ) Special attention shall be paid to the maintenance of such relationships between a prisoner and his family as are desirable in the best interests of both . ( CARDINAL ) A prisoner shall be encouraged and assisted to establish and maintain such relations with persons and agencies outside prison as may , in the opinion of the governor , best promote the interests of his family and his own social rehabilitation . \u201d", "Rule CARDINAL of the Prison Rules DATE ( as amended by FAC ) ( no.CARDINAL ) Rules DATE ) provides that any interference with a prisoner \u2019s right to communicate is subject to the qualification that such restrictions must not interfere with the prisoner \u2019s Convention rights unless proportionate to the aims prescribed by LAW or for prison security , discipline or good order .", "ORG", "In \u201c A Human Rights Approach to ORG , \u201d ORG , Second Edition , which was produced by ORG in conjunction with ORG in DATE , prison staff are instructed as follows ( see p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Forms of contact other than family visits are also important . Prisoners should be able to send and receive correspondence as freely as possible and where feasible to make and to receive telephone calls . \u201d", "It further states ( see p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c In many prison systems it is now possible for prisoners to make or to receive telephone calls . Logistical arrangements differ from country to country . In some cases the person receiving the call from the prisoner has to agree to meet the cost of the call . This can be a very expensive arrangement since such calls are normally charged at a higher rate than normal calls . In other prison systems prisoners can purchase special telephone cards , which sometimes will only permit calls to be made to approved telephone numbers . Telephone conversations become especially important when the prisoner is being held QUANTITY from home and it is difficult for his or her family to visit . \u201d", "ORG DATE ) CARDINAL of ORG to member states on ORG , adopted by ORG on DATE , recommends the following at paragraph CARDINAL :", "\u201c Contact with the outside world", "CARDINAL Prisoners shall be allowed to communicate as often as possible by letter , telephone or other forms of communication with their families , other persons and representatives of outside organisations and to receive visits from these persons .", "CARDINAL Communication and visits may be subject to restrictions and monitoring necessary for the requirements of continuing criminal investigations , maintenance of good order , safety and security , prevention of criminal offences and protection of victims of crime , but such restrictions , including specific restrictions ordered by a judicial authority , shall nevertheless allow an acceptable minimum level of contact . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
