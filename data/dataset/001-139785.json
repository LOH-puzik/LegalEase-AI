On DATE the applicant , who was a civil servant employed as a customs officer at a border crossing point , was placed in pre - trial detention by a decision of the public prosecutor \u2019s office . Along with CARDINAL other colleagues working at the same customs office , he was suspected of having abused his office contrary to ORG interests , which is an offence under LAW . By a decision of DATE , ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention to DATE , when he was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by a decision of ORG , the applicant was dismissed under LAW ( j ) of LAW , which authorised employers to dismiss an employee who had been placed in pre - trial detention for DATE , irrespective of the grounds for detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against his dismissal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a ruling of DATE on a preliminary question of law , ORG applied to ORG of its own motion for examination of an objection on grounds of constitutionality , namely , whether LAW ( j ) of LAW was compatible with the applicant \u2019s constitutional right to respect for the presumption of innocence . ORG held that LAW ( j ) of LAW infringed the right to be presumed innocent because it allowed consequences to be drawn for the purposes of labour law even before guilt had been established by a final decision and did so entirely independently of the grounds for placing the suspect in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the objection on grounds of unconstitutionality , holding that an employer \u2019s right to dismiss an employee who had been placed in pre - trial detention for DATE was justified by an objective fact , namely , his prolonged absence from work , and not by considerations linked to whether or not he was guilty of an offence that had justified imposing a custodial measure on him .

In the written grounds of appeal lodged with ORG by his lawyer , the applicant agreed with ORG view , considering , for his part , that LAW ( j ) of LOC was contrary to the right to respect for the presumption of innocence , guaranteed by LAW . While not denying that a custodial measure of DATE had been imposed on him , the applicant pointed out that greater respect for the principle of the presumption of innocence would have been achieved by merely suspending his employment contract pending the relevant court \u2019s final decision regarding his guilt , which was a measure available under LAW no .

NORP In a judgment of DATE , ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , suspended . It deducted from that period the time the applicant had spent in pre - trial detention from DATE to DATE .

Having re - examined all the evidence adduced in the case ( statements of witnesses and co - accused , expert technical reports , various documents , and so forth ) , the court found that the applicant could not be acquitted of the charges against him as the prosecution evidence adduced in the case proved his guilt . The court then ordered the trial to be discontinued on all counts , in accordance with LAW , thus bringing into effect the applicable special time bar .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant , who sought an acquittal , ORG delivered a final judgment on DATE upholding the decision of CARDINAL DATE of ORG on the merits .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ( j ) of the Labour Code provided , at the material time , that an employer could dismiss an employee if his detention exceeded DATE .
