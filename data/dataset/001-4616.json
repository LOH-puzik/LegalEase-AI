An agreement was not reached and the CARDINAL co - owners brought proceedings with a view to having the co - ownership dissolved .", "On DATE the Bratislava - vidiek ORG s\u00fad ) dissolved the co - ownership and determined the owners of the individual plots forming the estate . It considered such a solution necessary in order to ensure a peaceful enjoyment of the property by all persons involved and also in order to enable the claimants to accede to the plot attributed to them .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) modified the first instance judgment in that it re - distributed the property with a view to ensuring all owners a direct access to their plots . Since the shares of the former co - owners could not be entirely respected , the persons concerned were granted a compensation .", "On DATE ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) quashed the judgment as the facts had not been established with sufficient certainty . In particular , ORG considered that ORG should have explored in more detail the possibility of dividing the property in accordance with the co - ORG shares .", "The case was sent back to ORG .

Another expert opinion concerning different issues was submitted on DATE .", "At a hearing held on DATE the applicant requested an adjournment of the case as he had not been given an opportunity , despite his CARDINAL requests to this effect , to examine the case - file .

He also complained that the judge was not willing to order a second expert opinion .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request . It considered that a mere objection to the way in which the judge proceeded with the case was not a relevant reason for his exclusion . ORG noted that the applicant had not substantiated his allegation that the judge was biased . It qualified the applicant \u2019s request as an attempt to interfere with the court \u2019s independence in deciding on the case .", "ORG decision was signed by a judge and stated that it was adopted in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .

According to the contract , the claimant family and the applicant \u2019s family had a title to CARDINAL of the property each . For practical reasons , the plot attributed to the members of the claimant family exceeded by QUANTITY their original share and the plot attributed to the members of the applicant \u2019s family exceeded their share by QUANTITY . Both families were therefore ordered to pay a compensation to the other owners who were in agreement . The court further ordered the claimants to pay NORP korunas ( SKK ) CARDINAL to the applicant \u2019s family as a compensation for a fence and other investments which they had made on the land . The amount of the compensation had been determined by an expert .", "The judgment was based on the expert opinion including a geometric plan submitted on DATE .

It found that ORG had proceeded in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and that the reasons for its judgment were relevant and sufficient . ORG noted that the co - ORG shares had been duly registered by ORG in DATE and found nothing to show that the expert opinion of CARDINAL DATE did not conform to the law or was otherwise defective . The failure to order a second expert opinion was not contrary to the applicant \u2019s right to act before the court .", "ORG further established that the damages granted to the applicant \u2019s family had been determined by an expert and that the applicant \u2019s complaint about further damage of SKK CARDINAL,CARDINAL had not been the subject - matter of the proceedings in question . Finally , ORG found that the applicant had consulted the file several times and considered it irrelevant that he could not accede to it prior to the hearing held on DATE .", "The applicant lodged a constitutional petition ( podnet ) in which he alleged a violation of his constitutional right to judicial protection .
