She made the following statements :", "\u201c Ekho Moskvy ( EM ) : ... it has come to our knowledge that an acting judge of ORG has expressed criticism of the existing judicial system and mentioned certain instances of pressure being exerted on the court ...", "PERSON ( OK ) : Indeed . DATE of working in ORG have led me to doubt the existence of independent courts in GPE . Instances of a court being put under pressure to take a certain decision are not that rare , not only in cases of great public interest but also in cases encroaching on the interests of certain individuals of consequence or of particular groups .", "...", "EM : So what about that case in which you were confronted with such bare and ruthless pressure , what was it ?", "OK : Some of you have probably heard about the criminal case concerning the smuggling of furniture which was subsequently sold in the large GPE shopping centres \u2018 LOC Kita\u2019 and \u2018 PERSON . The damage caused by this crime , as the investigation has revealed , amounted to MONEY . Among those who came within the sights of the investigators , led by GPE , were extremely influential and prominent people . This case received great publicity after ORG hastily withdrew the file from the investigation unit of ORG and charged the investigator PERSON [ with abuse of official powers ] .", "EM : So you examined GPE \u2019s case , and not that of the furniture dealers ?", "OK : Yes , [ the case ] against GPE . First ORG examined the case and acquitted him . What is more , the court expressly stated in the judgment that the office of ORG itself sometimes failed to conform to , or was in direct breach of , the law . The reputation of ORG had been publicly challenged .", "EM : And the judgment was quashed , as I remember ?", "OK : Yes , it was . The Panel of ORG reversed the judgment and remitted it to ORG for a fresh examination .", "EM : And you received the case ?", "OK : Yes . The Panel of ORG in its decision indicated the points to be taken account of in the new proceedings .", "EM : So far as I know you were unable to hear the case to the end ... What happened ?", "OK : In the course of the examination the case was withdrawn from me by ORG President , PERSON , without any explanation .", "...", "EM : What happened just before the withdrawal ?", "OK : During the hearing the court was considering the evidence for the prosecution and started to cross - examine the victims . However , the public prosecutor , a representative of ORG , must have reckoned that the GPE testimonies ran contrary to the prosecution \u2019s version of events . He therefore attempted to bring the proceedings to naught . In DATE in the judiciary this was the first time that I was confronted with such behaviour ... he was trying to keep the court within the strict bounds of the questions he thought the court ought to ask the victims ... if the court went beyond these limits he started challenging the court and bombarding it with unreasoned requests .", "...", "EM : ... what are judges supposed to do in such a situation , when a party to the proceedings acts in breach of the law ? Can you seek help , support or at least advice ?", "OK : Yes , the court ... could request ORG to replace the public prosecutor on the grounds of undue conduct in the proceedings . But at that very moment the court president called me to her office .", "EM : How come the court president could intervene in the proceedings ?", "OK : Of course she could not . Criminal procedure in GPE is adversarial ; in accordance with the law the court acts neither for the prosecution nor for the defence ... Here , it was expressly brought home to me that the President of ORG and the agent of ORG had common cause in this case .", "...", "EM : ... do you think this case was exceptional or is this a widespread phenomenon ?", "OK : No , as far as I am aware , this is not the only case where the courts of law are used as an instrument of commercial , political or personal manipulation . This is a dangerous state of affairs because no one can rest assured that his case \u2013 whether civil or criminal or administrative \u2013 will be resolved in accordance with the law , and not just to please someone ... I do realise what kind of statement I have just made . But if all judges keep quiet this country may soon end up in a [ state of ] judicial lawlessness . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL newspapers \u2013 ORG and ORG published interviews with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The interview with ORG , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c ... Over DATE working in the courts of law I have ... dealt with various cases : civil , criminal and administrative . Having examined CARDINAL , if not CARDINAL , of cases ... I have seen a bit of everything , I know the judicial system inside out . I would not have imagined anything like what happened between me and PERSON . In LOC , by the way , the courts are much purer than in GPE . There you can not imagine such brutal manipulation and would not be talking about corruption to such an extent .", "...", "This was not a conflict , but unprecedented pressure on justice . PERSON called me several times , whenever the prosecutor thought that the proceedings were not going the right way ; on the last occasion I was called out of the deliberations room , which is unheard of . Never in my life had I been shouted at like that . I would not have gone if I knew what I was being called for . ...", "It was that conflict which made me consider changing my career , should I succeed in the elections . There is a job for me in the highest legislative body , namely the problems of justice . I doubt that any provincial courts would harbour scandals as outrageous as those in ORG , but this a question of degree , while the problems are more general .", "A judge , although defined by law as the embodiment of judicial power and independent in this capacity , in fact often finds himself in a position of an ordinary clerk , a subordinate of a court president . The mechanism of how a decision is imposed on a judge is not to contact [ the judge ] directly : instead , a prosecutor or an interested person calls the court president , who then tries to talk the judge into a \u2018 right\u2019 decision , first gently , by offering advice or a professional opinion , then pushing him or her more strongly to take the \u2018 correct\u2019 decision , that is , one that is convenient to somebody . A judge , on the other hand , is dependant on the president for the DATE basics , such as accommodation grants , bonuses , and also the distribution of cases between the judges . The president can always find a flaw in the judge \u2019s work if he or she wishes ( as simple as exceeding judicial time - limits , a situation impossible to avoid in practice , given the volume of work ) . On these grounds the president may seek termination of the judge \u2019s office , which is decided upon by the qualification board , usually controlled by the same court bureaucrats . ... in reality a court still more often than not takes the position of the prosecution . The courts then become an instrument of commercial , political or personal manipulation .", "No one can rest assured that his case DATE whether civil or criminal or administrative \u2013 will be resolved in accordance with the law , and not just to please someone .

The law applies quite strictly to ordinary people , but this is not the case when it comes to persons holding important posts . But they break the law too . I would like to participate in making laws that would provide for real independence of the judicial power ...", "ORG : What does the pressure look like in practice ?", "OK : There is a kind of consultation , legal advice , usually in cases of great public interest . Sometimes this has a healthy pretext , such as academic debate . The judge expresses his position , and the deputy president replies . The court president rarely speaks to the judges directly . Through such conventions the court administration tests each judge to see how flexible he is , so that when it comes to [ the allocation of cases ] they know who can be entrusted with a delicate case and whom to avoid .", "...", "Izvestiya : So how exactly was pressure exerted on you ?", "OK : The public prosecutor exerted pressure on me . You put a question to the victim , and he immediately challenges you . In DATE of practice I have not seen anything like it . PERSON was accused of abuse of official powers . He carried out a search without authorisation from a prosecutor . The law allows this in urgent cases , but the investigator must report to the prosecutor within TIME . PERSON reported to the prosecutor [ in time ] , and it was for the court to verify whether there had indeed been any urgency in conducting those searches . Therefore it was necessary to examine the criminal case files against the firms \u2018 Grand\u2019 and \u2018 LOC Kita\u2019 who were dealing in furniture . Through his constant objections , however , the public prosecutor would not allow the court to touch this subject ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the general elections took place .

She demanded that I give an account on the merits of this case while its examination was underway , and that I inform her about the decisions the court was about to take ; she even called me out of the deliberations room for that purpose . [ She ] insisted on removing certain documents from the case file , forced me to forge TIME of the hearing , and also recommended that I ask the lay assessors not to turn up for the hearing . Following my refusal to bow to this unlawful pressure [ she ] removed me from the proceedings and transferred the case to another judge .", "As to the particular circumstances , they were as follows .", "I was appointed to examine the case against GPE , and the court , acting in a bench with CARDINAL lay assessors , I and D , started its examination .", "Having started the trial , the court questioned a number of victims . The public prosecutor who was representing ORG clearly decided that this questioning was not favourable to the prosecution and therefore did everything possible to disrupt the hearing . For no reason he challenged me as a judge , the lay assessors and the whole composition of the court . His motions were made in a manner that was humiliating , offensive and insulting to the court , and were clearly untrue . Soon after the challenge was rejected by the court , ORG President PERSON called me to her office .", "In violation of LAW and section CARDINAL of the Law \u2018 On the Status of a Judge in GPE , ORG President demanded an explanation from me as to why the lay assessors and I were putting CARDINAL or other question to the victims in the trial and why CARDINAL or other motion by the parties was refused or accepted . In my presence ORG President had a telephone conversation with the [ First Deputy Prosecutor General ] , who had issued the indictment against GPE . PERSON informed [ the First Deputy Prosecutor General ] that the judge was being called to account with regard to what was going on in the proceedings .", "Back in my office I told the lay assessors what had happened . By then they were already reduced to despair by the repeated groundless objections and insulting challenges against them on the part of the public prosecutor , and they therefore considered it impossible to continue to take part in the proceedings . CARDINAL of the assessors , PERSON , was seeking medical assistance for a health problem . For these reasons they decided to withdraw from the proceedings and to state frankly in their request that the reason for their withdrawal was the pressure put on them by the agent of ORG .", "At the court \u2019s following meeting the lay assessors announced their withdrawal on the above grounds . Their written requests were given to me to be enclosed in the file , and the court adjourned for deliberations .", "I was again called from the deliberations room by ORG President , PERSON . This time she demanded that I explain what we were doing in the deliberations room and what decisions we were going to take . Her main point was that there should have been no mention in the ORG written requests that the reason for their withdrawal was pressure being exerted on the court . ORG President also insisted on excluding from TIME any mention of the behaviour by the public prosecutor which the assessors had regarded as pressure . In essence , PERSON was pushing me to forge the case file . Moreover , she proposed that I ensure that the assessors did not turn up for the hearing , literally \u2018 ask them not to come to the court any ORG . The aim was obvious \u2013 if the assessors [ did ] not appear the proceedings themselves [ would ] fall apart . It seemed that for some reason [ she ] did not want the case to continue to be examined in this composition . The unlawfulness of ORG President \u2019s actions was obvious .", "I followed none of her instructions . The lay assessors\u2019 requests were included in the file , the court allowed their withdrawal and stated that the reason for it was the pressure being applied by ORG . The hearing TIME reflected everything that happened in the proceedings .", "Once I signed [ the minutes ] PERSON withdrew the case from me and transferred it to another judge without stating reasons .", "I consider that such acts on the part of ORG President , PERSON , are incompatible with the status of a judge and undermine judicial authority , and are thus destructive for justice , for which she must be held liable . This is what I hereby request from ORG of GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

I decided to write you because I participated in GPE \u2019s case as a lay assessor .", "I entirely support everything judge PERSON said in her interview .", "During the trial the [ public prosecutor ] did everything to prevent the court from hearing the case . He was rude and aggressive to the court ; in his interventions and requests he deliberately misrepresented what was going on in the proceedings , and he repeatedly filed objections to the court composition . These motions were made in a humiliating , even obnoxious manner . By doing so he was exerting pressure on the court , to force it to give a judgment that was convenient to him , or , alternatively , to set the court hearing at naught .", "I was appalled by that , but what was my surprise when I learned about the pressure also being exerted on judge GPE by the court President !", "We , the assessors , were there when , during the interval , judge GPE received a phone call from the court President to come and see her . After some time judge GPE came back , she was upset and depressed . To our question she replied that the court President PERSON had accused her that the court was reluctant to examine the case ; that the lay assessors were asking the victims the wrong questions ; and that she had suggested that judge GPE arrange for the lay assessors not to appear at the court proceedings .", "... On TIME ... both PERSON and I decided to withdraw from the proceedings .", "At the start of the hearing on DATE the public prosecutor , before he was called by the court , began with a motion in which he , in essence , again degraded and insulted me by repeating [ a ] comment made by [ the victim ] outside the courtroom about me ... he did not react to the reproof by the judge .", "After that ...

First it was the public prosecutor who put pressure on us at the hearing , and then it turned out that the [ court President ] joined in .", "What a surprise it was when the [ court \u2019s Deputy President ] came into the deliberations room and started trying to persuade me and PERSON not to comment on the public prosecutor \u2019s behaviour in the court decision , but to state in our requests and in the court decision that we withdrew on medical grounds . She said that they would invite me and PERSON to take part in other proceedings .", "PERSON and I refused to change our requests , and after the Deputy President left the court issued the decision [ to allow withdrawal ] which reflected what had happened .", "I have been a lay assessor before , I have taken part in several other proceedings , but this was the first time that I came across such pressure being exerted on the court .", "I request you to look into the above events and to take action against the [ court \u2019s President and her Deputy ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
