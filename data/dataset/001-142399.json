The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a NORP who lived in GPE until DATE . He claims to have lost CARDINAL relatives to NORP attacks DATE , and to have personally suffered CARDINAL missile attacks DATE . According to his allegations before the ORG , he was directly and personally targeted in the most recent attack , in DATE , as the missile that struck near him on DATE immediately followed an anonymous call on his mobile phone asking him to confirm his name , a ruse by the NORP forces to identify his location . That attack left him severely injured and rendered him paraplegic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was taken to GPE by a humanitarian organisation , ORG ( \u0130nsani PERSON , \u201c \u0130HH \u201d ) , along with fortynine other injured civilians from the NORP territories , to have access to better medical care .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) issued the group of NORP with short - term residence permits in view of their continuing medical treatment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married a NORP national , who was also his physiotherapist . Because he was married to a NORP national , he was granted a long - term temporary residence permit valid until QUANTITY DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at TIME , QUANTITY police officers from ORG arrived at the applicant \u2019s house . They informed the applicant and his wife that his presence was required at the police headquarters for an interview and that he would be brought back afterwards . Once he was at the police headquarters , however , he was verbally informed that his temporary residence permit had been cancelled in accordance with orders received from ORG and that he would soon be deported from GPE . Without being given any further information as to the reasons for the deportation order , when it would be carried out and where he would be deported to , the applicant was placed in the ORG Foreigners\u2019 Admission and ORG attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the police record drawn up on DATE at TIME , ORG had decided on DATE to deport the applicant . This decision had been taken at the request of ORG of GPE , which had received intelligence regarding the applicant \u2019s possible involvement in acts of international terrorism . Neither the ORG \u2019s deportation order nor the police record in question was served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Upon learning of the applicant \u2019s detention , on CARDINAL DATE his wife got in touch with a local human rights organisation , PERSON , which in turn contacted the ORG to seek assistance in securing the applicant \u2019s release and halting his deportation . PERSON also informed the ORG of the poor conditions in which the applicant was being detained , including the fact that he had spent TIME sleeping on a table , that he was not able to use the squat toilets at the detention centre , and that his medical treatment had been stopped on account of his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action against ORG before ORG seeking the quashing of the deportation order , and also requested a stay of its execution until the matter had been examined by the administrative court . He maintained before the administrative court that the deportation order was unlawful , in view of his marriage to a NORP citizen and possession of a residence permit valid until DATE . The unlawful deportation order had moreover not been communicated to him at any point , nor had ORG sought his response prior to its delivery . The ORG authorities had similarly not put forward any concrete evidence to demonstrate why his continued presence in GPE was perceived as a threat to national security . The applicant claimed that in the event of his deportation to GPE or elsewhere , his right to life and right to liberty and security would be put at risk , that he would face torture or even death at the hands of NORP forces or their collaborators , and that the unity of his family would be destroyed . Furthermore , his medical treatment would be stopped , causing irreversible harm to his health . The applicant lastly complained that his detention was unlawful , and also maintained that the conditions of his detention at the NORP Foreigners\u2019 Admission and ORG were highly degrading , in view of the lack of basic infrastructure to accommodate people with disabilities in his situation . As he was not able to use the squat toilet available at the place of detention , he had to be taken to a hotel nearby by police officers each time he had to relieve himself . It appears that his wife was occasionally able to accompany them to the hotel . His medical treatment was also stopped during his detention there , which was likely to result in the worsening of his condition .", "CARDINAL . In a decision delivered on DATE , ORG asked ORG for a copy of its deportation order of DATE , as well as all the information and documents which formed the basis of that decision . Moreover , noting the irreversible nature of the harm that might be caused in the event of the applicant \u2019s deportation , it ordered a stay of its execution until a further decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer applied for release from the ORG Foreigners\u2019 Admission and ORG on the basis of ORG decision granting a stay of execution .", "CARDINAL . Following a decision of ORG on DATE , the applicant was released from the ORG Foreigners\u2019 Admission and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG submitted its replies to ORG in relation to the applicant \u2019s request for the quashing of the deportation order . It stated that the decision to deport had been taken on the basis of a ORG report dated DATE . The report indicated that within the context of ongoing investigations in connection with international terrorism the applicant had been identified as having had contact with some telephone numbers registered in GPE on issues such as \u201c procurement of arms , new recruits to the group , and measures to be taken to ensure the confidentiality of activities \u201d . His presence in GPE was therefore perceived as a risk to national security within the meaning of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Law no . DATE ) and section CARDINAL of the Act on the Residence and Travel of Foreigners in GPE ( Law no . CARDINAL ) . It also submitted a number of supporting documents as an annex . These documents were not made available to the applicant , nor were they later submitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that there were no elements warranting the suspension of the applicant \u2019s deportation . It thus reversed its previous decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of ORG lifting the stay of execution of his deportation . He submitted that ORG had not put forward any tangible evidence in support of its allegation that he posed a threat to national security such as to necessitate his deportation from GPE . If ORG went through with its decision , his physical integrity would be irreparably damaged on account of the termination of the medical treatment he was undergoing in GPE . Furthermore , his deportation would disrupt the family life he had since established in GPE , and would deprive him of the vital assistance and care undertaken by his wife . In addition , if deported he would most certainly be subjected to torture by NORP forces and his life would be put at risk . Lastly , the applicant drew the administrative court \u2019s attention to his pending application to the ORG for refugee status , and also complained of the conditions in which he had been detained DATE at the ORG Foreigners\u2019 Admission and ORG , which had lacked basic amenities to accommodate people with disabilities , such as a non - squat toilet and a lift .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision of DATE , which had effectively lifted the stay of execution of his deportation , without providing any reasons .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant had applied to the ORG for refugee status . On CARDINAL DATE he was interviewed by the GPE office of the ORG as part of the refugee status determination process .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer was informed by the ORG authorities that , pursuant to the latest decision of ORG , the applicant was requested to leave GPE within DATE , and that if he refused to comply with that request he would be deported forcibly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed asylum in GPE . He stated that he had been forced to leave GPE because of the persecution he had faced there . Following an NORP attack on his house in GPE , which had left him severely injured , he had come to GPE to seek medical treatment . This treatment was still ongoing , and in the meantime he had married a NORP citizen . He claimed that although he had never been involved in any acts of violence , he was wanted by GPE as a terrorist . Returning to his country would entail a great risk to his life , if not from NORP attacks then because of the termination of his treatment . He would also face torture if captured by the NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer also sent a letter to ORG of ORG , reiterating the grounds of appeal against the applicant \u2019s deportation . The lawyer emphasised in the letter that the ORG \u2019s deportation order had not been served on the applicant , and that the administrative proceedings for the annulment of the deportation order were still pending before ORG , which had not yet delivered a judgment on the merits . She referred in this regard to ORG , adopted by the Government of GPE on DATE , which held that the execution of deportation decisions was to be suspended once administrative proceedings seeking to overturn them had been instituted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative asked the ORG , under LAW of its Rules of Court , to adopt an interim measure to halt the applicant \u2019s imminent deportation from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the ORG to which the case was allocated decided , in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG , to indicate to the Government of GPE , under LAW , that the applicant should not be deported to GPE or GPE until the delivery of a decision by the ORG in his regard .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the interim measure applied by the ORG , on DATE ORG of ORG ordered that the applicant be granted a DATE temporary residence permit , renewable until further notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the deportation decision of DATE , as the applicant \u2019s deportation had become unfeasible in view of the interim measure applied by the ORG , which was binding on the NORP authorities . ORG appealed against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG , and on DATE it refused the ORG \u2019s rectification request .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , following a number of interviews , on CARDINAL DATE ORG of the Ministry granted the applicant a temporary residence permit for DATE , apparently renewable , in view of his status as an asylum seeker .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed the NORP authorities that he wanted to withdraw his asylum claim , for reasons unknown to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the General Security Directorate of the Ministry decided to grant the applicant a long - term residence permit , valid for DATE , on the basis of evidence that he had established a genuine family life in GPE . The decision also indicated that this permit would be extended in due course if further inquiries in respect of his marriage demonstrated that he was continuing to maintain a family life in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant withdrew his application to the ORG for refugee status in order to avoid being resettled to a safe third country as a result of the refugee status determination process , which might have entailed separation from his wife ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
