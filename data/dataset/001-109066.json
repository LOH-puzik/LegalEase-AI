According to the applicant the conditions of detention in Prison no . CARDINAL and Prison no . CARDINAL were very poor and amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment . In respect of Prison no . CARDINAL , the applicant submitted that the cells were overcrowded and humid and there was no ventilation . He also complained about the quality and quantity of the food . As to Prison no . CARDINAL , he submitted that it was located on territory controlled by the NORP separatist authorities but was itself under the control of the NORP constitutional authorities . The separatist authorities had cut off the power and water supplies and disconnected the prison from the sewage network . As a result the inmates had electrical power for TIME per day and the water was limited to QUANTITY per day , plus another QUANTITY once a week for showers and washing clothes .", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the Report of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) concerning a visit to GPE DATE read as follows ( unofficial translation ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Penitentiary establishment No . CARDINAL in PERSON had been the subject of CARDINAL visits by the ORG since DATE , following the decision of the municipal authorities of PERSON to deprive the establishment of running water and electricity supply ( and , as of DATE , to disconnect it from the city \u2019s sewage disposal system ) . The seriousness of the situation confronting the establishment led the ORG to state in the report on its visit in DATE that , unless the above - mentioned problems were resolved , prisoners should be relocated elsewhere . In their response to that report , the GPE authorities indicated that they considered the situation at Penitentiary establishment No . CARDINAL in PERSON to be under control and saw no reasons for the relocation of prisoners to other establishments .", "CARDINAL . When re - visited by the ORG \u2019s delegation on DATE , the establishment was holding CARDINAL prisoners ( compared with CARDINAL on DATE ) . The delegation was informed that CARDINAL inmates had been released since DATE , and approximately the same number of new prisoners had been admitted . The great majority of the prisoners currently held at the establishment originated from the NORP region or nearby locations . The delegation gained the impression that all prisoners who had been admitted in DATE had themselves asked for a transfer to PERSON , in particular because of wishing to be closer to their families . An examination of the documentation confirmed that newly admitted prisoners had been expressly informed of the conditions prevailing at the establishment ( i.e. absence of running water , electricity and sewage disposal ) and had confirmed with their signature their wish to be transferred there . Further , it appeared that the few inmates who had requested transfer to other establishments had received satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . As regards material conditions , in terms of living space per prisoner ( CARDINAL m\u00b2 ) , state of repair and decoration , the dormitories in which inmates were accommodated offered conditions superior to those witnessed at any other penitentiary establishment seen by the ORG in GPE . Further , prisoners stated that the food they received was better than that provided elsewhere . Moreover , no problems were reported as regards the heating .", "However , in the absence of any progress in the stand - off between the municipal authorities of PERSON and the NORP authorities , electricity continued to be produced by generators and was available TIME a day in the evenings , enabling inmates inter alia to watch TV . Further , water was delivered regularly by a lorrycistern and was distributed into reservoirs supplying the kitchen and the bathroom ; inmates could take a shower once a week . As for toilets , cesspools had been installed in the basements of the unused buildings .", "CARDINAL . Prisoners could circulate freely around the establishment \u2019s extensive LOC and engage in outdoor sports . However , there was a shortage of organised activities . Some CARDINAL prisoners were employed in the establishment \u2019s general services ( kitchen , cleaning , repairs , etc . ) . Further , the establishment \u2019s director spoke of plans to set up a carpentry workshop ; however , it was unclear when these plans would materialise .", "CARDINAL . The delegation was informed that relations with the municipal authorities of ORG had become less tense in DATE . As a result , staff travelling across the border between GPE and the NORP region were reportedly able to come to work on a regular basis .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , it is clear that the NORP authorities have continued to take steps to alleviate , as far as possible , the difficult situation facing Penitentiary establishment No . CARDINAL in PERSON and to ensure that the health and welfare of prisoners are protected . Further , there are signs of a more pragmatic approach on the part of both parties concerned by the stand - off . This is encouraging ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
