ORG held that the applicant \u2019s arguments had no impact on the legal classification of her actions and that they were refuted by the evidence as a whole . The judgment further stated in that regard :", "\u201c ... the court considers that by committing deliberate acts in a group which showed disrespect for the burial place of the Unknown Soldier and for the public tradition of honouring the memory of soldiers who perished defending or liberating GPE and the lands of GPE from the fascist hordes , and by subsequently presenting those actions as a protest , [ the applicant ] has tried to escape social condemnation of her conduct and criminal liability for the offence . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It stated that desecration of a tomb could have different expressions , indicating an insulting attitude , mockery or disrespect towards a tomb or the person buried therein , regardless of the stated motives . As regards the applicant \u2019s argument on her right to freedom of expression , the court noted that that right was not unlimited and that the restriction in the applicant \u2019s case was in accordance with the law and pursued a legitimate aim .
