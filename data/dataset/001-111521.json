The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had served as a judge of ORG of GPE since DATE , first when the country formed part of GPE and then after it became independent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant retired on age grounds and was granted , under section CARDINAL of the LAW DATE on ORG of GPE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , a pension of CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) . ) , corresponding to her final salary .", "CARDINAL . The original version of section CARDINAL of LAW , in force at the time of the applicant \u2019s retirement , stated that , upon retirement , a ORG judge was entitled to a life - long pension in an amount equal to his or her final salary and adjustable in line with changes in the salary scales of serving ORG judges .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW was later amended on several occasions . Thus , by an amendment of DATE , its second clause concerning the adjustment requirement ( \u201c the adjustment clause \u201d ) was removed .", "CARDINAL . By an amendment of DATE , the adjustment clause was reintroduced to LAW in a slightly altered form , extending the adjustment benefit to cover , in addition to retired ORG judges , those who agreed to relinquish office DATE and DATE , providing they had served for DATE ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , as of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , by an amendment of DATE , which entered into force on DATE , section CARDINAL was rephrased as follows :", "\u201c A ORG judge who has retired either on reaching pension age or on expiry of his or her term of office shall be entitled to ORG compensation in the amount of GEL CARDINAL [ ORG CARDINAL ] \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , which was amended at the same time , stated that ORG judges who had relinquished office DATE and DATE would receive ORG compensation in an amount equal to their final salary for the remainder of the term which they would have normally served if they had remained in office ; after expiry of that term the compensation paid to judges who had resigned would be recalculated in accordance with the latest version of section DATE .", "CARDINAL . Unlike previous amendments to that provision , DATE version of section CARDINAL was given retroactive effect by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , inserted in LAW on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , dissatisfied with the procedure for payment of her pension , brought an action against the ORG seeking compensation for pecuniary damage , challenging , in particular , the lawfulness of the application of the amendment of DATE to LAW . Relying on the original version of section CARDINAL of the LAW , she requested that her pension be adjusted in line with the Supreme Court judges\u2019 pay rise which had occurred after her retirement , and that she be compensated for the resulting arrears . ORG ( \u201c the Fund \u201d ) was a respondent in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Krtsanisi - Mtatsminda District Court in GPE allowed her claim in part , reasoning , inter alia , that the amendment of DATE could not be given retroactive force under LAW in so far as , by removing the adjustment clause , it worsened the applicant \u2019s situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned the lower court \u2019s decision , stating that there were no signs of a worsening of the applicant \u2019s pre - existing situation .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE following a cassation appeal , adopted by a majority vote , a CARDINAL judge bench of ORG ( \u201c the majority \u201d ) quashed the appeal decision of CARDINAL DATE and allowed the applicant \u2019s claim in full .", "CARDINAL . At the outset , the majority noted that , in so far as the ORG had paid the applicant , by error , her DATE pension in an amount corresponding to the latest salary of a serving ORG judge ( GEL DATE EUR CARDINAL ) , the applicant \u2019s claim should be limited in time up to and including DATE .", "CARDINAL . The majority then stated that the amendment of DATE could not have retroactive force because it did not contain any indication to that effect as required by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of GPE ( see CARDINAL below ) . In the absence of such an explicit indication , it could not legitimately be inferred that the legislature had intended to deprive judges who had already retired of their \u201c adjustment right \u201d ex post facto ; the respondent administrative authority \u2019s decision to do so had therefore been arbitrary .", "CARDINAL . NORP The majority also stated that , in so far as section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE on ORG Entitlements ruled out the possibility of a reduction in a ORG judge \u2019s salary , it was logical to assume that the adjustment clause was , in principle , meant to protect the right to an increase in pension .", "CARDINAL . NORP The majority further ruled that , when deciding on a dispute , the courts must apply the statute in force at the time material to the critical event , even if the legal consequences of that event only emerged later under a different statutory regime . To hold otherwise , in the opinion of the cassation court , \u201c would undermine legal certainty ... and ... allow the legislature \u2019s arbitrariness to replace a stable legal order . \u201d Despite the fact that the applicant \u2019s pension rights were obviously of a continuous nature , those rights had arisen , in the opinion of ORG , as a result of the material fact of the applicant \u2019s retirement in DATE , when she had been granted a pension for life under the original version of section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , the majority concluded that the impugned amendment of DATE should apply only to those judges who had voluntarily relinquished office or retired on reaching pensionable age or on expiry of their term of office , and had thus acquired their pension rights after its entry into force . In no way could that amendment be understood to replace the original section CARDINAL of LAW and to apply to retired judges who had already obtained their pension rights .", "CARDINAL . The majority also noted that the original version of section CARDINAL of LAW set a very high standard of retirement benefit for ORG judges . It stated in this regard that \u201c the creation of generous pension benefits is not only a question of providing social protection for any particular retired judge , it also aims to maintain the independence and impartiality of the judiciary in general , by providing serving judges with the expectation of obtaining the same benefits upon their future retirement ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . One of the members of ORG , Judge PERSON , expressed a dissenting opinion . He reasoned , in so far as relevant , that the removal of the adjustment clause from the original version of section CARDINAL of LAW could not be said to have necessarily caused the applicant \u2019s situation to deteriorate , as the pension might equally have been reduced and not just increased . Contrary to the majority \u2019s opinion , he stated that section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE on ORG Entitlements had nothing to do with the protection of NORP retirement pensions . As to the question whether a ORG judge \u2019s pension could be reduced , Judge PERSON replied in the affirmative , arguing that such a mechanism existed under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW on ORG . In his opinion , the amendment of DATE could be held applicable to the applicant \u2019s situation because it did not affect her right to receive the pension as such , but simply redefined its amount .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON also stated that \u201c neither the amendment of DATE nor the amendment of DATE , which fixed the pension for judges who had already retired at GEL CARDINAL , breached ... the principle of legal certainty \u201d . He concluded that the applicant \u2019s pension should be adjusted in line with ORG pay rise DATE , when the adjustment clause had been reintroduced into section CARDINAL of LAW , and DATE , when the ex post facto amendment of DATE had entered into force .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of DATE ordered the ORG to compensate the applicant for all the arrears accumulated as a result of the failure to adjust her pension in line with ORG pay rises up to and including DATE , as required by the original version of section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG discharged the judgment debt of DATE in the applicant \u2019s favour in due time .", "CARDINAL . With effect from DATE , the ORG , relying on the amendment of DATE to LAW , fixed the applicant \u2019s pension at GEL MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , on DATE the applicant brought another action for damages against the Fund , challenging the lawfulness of the application of the amendment of DATE to her situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tbilisi City Court dismissed the applicant \u2019s action as manifestly ill - founded . Its reasons mostly corresponded to those given by Judge PERSON in his dissenting opinion on the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The first - instance court added that the impugned amendment of DATE , unlike the previous amendments to section CARDINAL of LAW , contained a clear indication of its retroactive effect and was , consequently , compatible with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of DATE , which was dismissed by ORG on DATE . Referring to paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of LOC GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX ) , the appellate court stated that LAW No . CARDINAL did not guarantee the right to receive a pension of a particular amount . In reply to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the first - instance court had disregarded the findings of ORG judgment of DATE , ORG stated that the scope of that judgment had been limited to resolving her pension dispute arising out of the amendment of DATE ; the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had never addressed the issue of payment of her pension on the basis of the amendment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the appellate judgment of DATE . Amongst other arguments , the applicant affirmed , referring to the case of GPE and PERSON and PERSON and Others v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL to CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) , that legislative interference retroactively affecting a civil right was incompatible with the Convention . In support of the admissibility of her cassation appeal , the applicant , comparing ORG judgment of DATE with ORG judgment of DATE , pointed out that the CARDINAL decisions had resolved an analogous situation differently , and argued that an examination of her cassation appeal on the merits was indispensable for the consistent development of the domestic case - law on the subject .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bench of ORG , composed of Judge PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and CARDINAL other judges who had not participated in the examination of the applicant \u2019s first pension dispute , declared the cassation appeal of CARDINAL DATE inadmissible . The decision was delivered without an oral hearing , under the written procedure . Without specifically addressing any of the applicant \u2019s cassation arguments , the cassation court stated that none of the conditions of admissibility envisaged by the relevant provision of ORG had been met .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then requested the setting - aside of the decision of CARDINAL October CARDINAL on the basis of LAW ( a ) of LAW . She complained that Judge PERSON should not have participated in the examination of her cassation appeal of CARDINAL DATE , in so far as he had already expressed his opinion on the same issue ; that constituted a ground for his exemption or withdrawal under LAW ( d ) and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant \u2019s request to have the impugned decision set aside . The fact that Judge PERSON had expressed a dissenting opinion on the judgment of CARDINAL DATE could not , in the cassation court \u2019s view , be accepted as evidence of bias , actual or implied , against the applicant .", "CARDINAL .
