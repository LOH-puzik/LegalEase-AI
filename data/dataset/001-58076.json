She moved her CARDINAL caravans on to this plot .", "CARDINAL . ORG Her land is now part of a group of CARDINAL adjacent sites which are occupied by NORP . CARDINAL plot has received permanent planning permission for the residential use of CARDINAL caravans . The site occupied by the applicant 's sister enjoyed temporary permission until DATE .

The applicant 's caravans were screened from the road because of these authorised and unauthorised developments . However , the inspector wrote that :", "\" ... whether seen or not , the development subject of these notices [ i.e. the applicant 's caravan site ] extends development further from the road than that permitted . It thus intrudes into the open countryside , contrary to the aim of LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] to protect the countryside from all but essential development . \" The inspector also found that the access road to the site was too narrow for CARDINAL vehicles to pass , and thus that the use of the site for caravans would not be in the interests of road safety . She considered the applicant 's special status as a Gypsy and observed that in DATE there were over sixty Gypsy families on unauthorised sites in the district of GPE . She continued : \" It is therefore clear in my mind that a need exists for more authorised spaces . ... Nevertheless , I consider it important to keep concentrations of sites for gypsies small , because in this way they are more readily accepted by the local community . ... [ T]he concentration of gypsy sites in GPE has reached the desirable maximum and I do not consider that the overall need for sites should , in this case , outweigh the planning objections . \"", "She concluded by recommending that the appeal be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Secretary of ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . The reasons given included the following :", "\" The decisive issue in regard to the planning merits of your appeals is considered to be whether the undisputed need for additional gypsies ' caravan site provision , in the administrative areas of ORG , and of ORG , is so pressing that it should be permitted to override the objections on planning policy and highway safety grounds to the retention of the use of the appeal site as a residential caravan site for gypsies . On this approach , the view is taken that the objections to the continued use of the appeal site as a residential gypsy caravan site are so strong , on planning policy and highway safety grounds , that a grant of planning permission could not be justified , either on a temporary or personal basis . In reaching this conclusion , full consideration has been given to policy advice in the ORG 's Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL , giving guidance to ORG on the need to provide adequate accommodation in the form of caravan sites , for gypsies residing in or resorting to their area . However , on the available evidence , the view is taken , in agreement with the officer 's appraisal , that the concentration of gypsy caravan sites around the PERSON area has reached the desirable maximum , and the overall need for additional sites should not outweigh the planning and highway objections arising from the continued use of this particular site . \"", "The applicant did not appeal to ORG because she was advised by counsel that no grounds arose in her case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

It was noted that a small number of NORP still remained on unauthorised sites but that , in light of the provision made for sites which was greater than in any other district , it was considered \" not expedient for adequate accommodation to be provided for NORP residing in or resorting to GPE district \" . The order designating the district of GPE came into force on DATE , but no longer applies because of the provisions of ORG see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant again applied for permission to station her caravans on her site , in the light of a change in the law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG She was refused on DATE on the grounds that ( CARDINAL ) local planning policy dictated that development in open countryside should be restricted and no evidence to justify a departure from this policy had been advanced , and ( CARDINAL ) adequate provision for NORP had been made along FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant ( together with others occupying the neighbouring sites ) appealed against this decision to the Secretary of ORG . A report was prepared by an inspector in DATE . The inspector considered , first , whether the continued use of the land as a Gypsy caravan site would detract from the rural nature of the area , and , secondly , if so , whether there were any special circumstances sufficient to outweigh this objection . She found that the road safety objection , which had been CARDINAL of the grounds of refusal in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , no longer applied . With regard to the first question , the inspector found that the applicant had a mobile home , CARDINAL touring caravans and CARDINAL sheds on her site . These were hidden from the road by the caravans on the sites in front and by an agricultural engineering business , the same depth as the applicant 's site to the east . They were visible from other vantage points but could be adequately screened by planting hedges . However , she concluded that :", "\" ... the continued use of the rear plots considerably extends the depth of development south of the road . This intensification of use in itself inevitably detracts from the rural appearance and generally open character of the area , contrary to the objectives of national and local countryside policy . I must therefore conclude that the continued occupation of the land as gypsy caravan sites is harmful to the character and appearance of the countryside . \"", "ORG", "\" a relevant consideration that there is available alternative accommodation close by , which would enable the appellants to stay in the PERSON area and their children to continue at the local schools \" .", "On the other hand ,", "\" little weight [ could ] be given to the private sites at ORG .

She concluded that there had been no material changes since the last appeal was heard and the present appeal should therefore be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG Accepting the inspector 's conclusions and recommendations , the Secretary of ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE . The applicant has filed an appeal to ORG , which is now pending . ORG", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE ORG opened an official Gypsy caravan site in FAC , QUANTITY away from the applicant 's land . The site consists of CARDINAL pitches , each comprising a fenced , partially grassed area with hard standing for caravans and its own brick building containing a kitchen , shower and toilet .

ORG An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority , which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan , unless material considerations indicate otherwise ( section CARDINALA of LAW ) . The local development plan in GPE restricts development in the countryside to that essential to the efficient operation of particular rural uses , such as horticulture , agriculture and forestry .", "CARDINAL . ORG The DATE Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of ORG in the event of a refusal of permission ( section CARDINAL ) . With immaterial exceptions , the Secretary of ORG must , if either the appellant or the authority so desire , give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of ORG . It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence ( see the PERSON the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) .

ORG Again there is a further right of appeal \" on a point of law \" to ORG against a decision of the Secretary of ORG under section CARDINAL ( section CARDINAL ) . Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review . It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG ) . ORG will also grant a remedy if the inspector 's decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact ; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors ; or made for an improper purpose , in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument . However , the court of review can not substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision - making authority . ORG", "CARDINAL . ORG Part II of LAW DATE ( \" the CARDINAL Act \" ) was intended to combat the problems caused by the reduction in the number of lawful stopping places available to NORP as a result of planning and other legislation and social changes in the post - war years .

Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act provided that it should be the duty of local authorities : \" to exercise their powers ... so far as may be necessary to provide adequate accommodation for gipsies residing in or resorting to their area \" . The Secretary of ORG could direct local authorities to provide caravan sites where it appeared to him to be necessary ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG Where the Secretary of ORG was satisfied either that a local authority had made adequate provision for the accommodation of GPE , or that it was not necessary or expedient to make such provision , he could \" designate \" that district or county ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) . The effect of designation was to make it an offence for any Gypsy to station a caravan within the designated area with the intention of living in it for any period of time on the highway , on any other unoccupied land or on any occupied land without the consent of the occupier ( section CARDINAL ) . In addition , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act gave to local authorities within designated areas power to apply to a magistrates ' court for an order authorising them to remove caravans parked in contravention of section CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .

Among other advice , it encouraged local authorities to enable self - help by NORP through the adoption of a \" sympathetic and flexible approach to [ NORP ' ] applications for planning permission and site licences \" . Making express reference to cases where NORP had bought a plot of land and stationed caravans on it only to find that planning permission was not forthcoming , it recommended that in such cases enforcement action not be taken until alternative sites were available in the area .", "CARDINAL . ORG Circular CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which was issued on DATE , stated , inter alia , that \" it would be to everyone 's advantage if as many gypsies as possible were enabled to find their own accommodation \" , and thus advised local authorities that \" the special need to accommodate gypsies ... should be taken into account as a material consideration in reaching planning decisions \" . In addition , MONEY was spent under a scheme by which MONEY grants were made available to local authorities to cover the costs of creating Gypsy sites .", "CARDINAL .
