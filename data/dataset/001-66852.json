DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE a new concept called \u201c tax asset stripping cases \u201d ( selskabst\u00f8mmersager ) came into existence in GPE . It covered a criminal activity by which the persons involved committed aggravating debtor fraud by buying up and selling numerous inactive solvent private limited companies within a short period , and for the sake of their own profit , \u201c stripping \u201d the companies for assets , including deposits earmarked for payment of corporation tax . Often the persons involved systematically acquired the inactive , solvent companies for the ORG own fund . The persons involved were usually intricately interconnected and collaborated about their economic criminal activities , which concerned very large amounts . According to surveys made by the customs and tax authorities , CARDINAL companies with a total tax debt exceeding MONEY ( ORG ) were stripped in the period from DATE until DATE . Following a number of legislative amendments , the trade in inactive , solvent companies largely ceased completely in DATE .", "On DATE the tax authorities reported to the police that allegedly the applicant , who worked as an accountant , and a number of other named persons had committed tax asset stripping .", "Unknown to the applicant , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE a ORG granted warrants to the police to search inter alia his LOC .", "On the latter date the applicant was charged with tax asset stripping and the police carried out a search at his LOC , and at CARDINAL other localities , which led the attention to CARDINAL inactive solvent private limited companies .", "It appeared that the largest group of companies were part of a corporate group owned by companies registered in LOC . Consequently , on DATE the authorities of the island were contacted in order to obtain information on the ownership of the group . The request was an informal letter as GPE has not signed ORG DATE . In DATE the authorities of LOC provided the material which showed that a large part of the funds of some of the groups was transferred to NORP banks .", "In DATE the applicant and CARDINAL other persons lodged objections with Her Majesty \u2019s Attorney General of GPE , claiming that the letter of request had been executed without authority . The case was brought before ORG of PERSON on GPE , but was dismissed by a decision of DATE .", "In the meantime , on DATE the police requested a court order for an international letter of request to GPE . By a ORG order of DATE , upheld on appeal by ORG of Eastern Denmark ( PERSON ) on DATE , the NORP authorities were requested to grant assistance to procure evidence for the police investigation . In DATE the NORP authorities requested more detailed information . This was submitted by ORG in GPE in DATE . By letter of DATE ORG in GPE ( ORG was notified of a decision from the NORP authorities according to which the letter of request could be substantially accommodated . Due to objections , the international letter of request was tried by CARDINAL judicial instances in GPE . Subsequently , on request of the NORP examining magistrate a supplement to the international letter of request was submitted in relation to some of the bank accounts concerned . Beforehand , since on DATE counsel for the applicant had objected to the supplement , it was approved by ORG in GPE on DATE and on appeal by ORG on DATE . During DATE numerous persons were interviewed in GPE by the NORP authorities . The NORP police , the prosecutor and counsel for some of the persons charged in the case were present during some of the interviews . In DATE the NORP authorities sent the investigation material obtained in the case to ORG in GPE , which forwarded it to the police in DATE .", "In the meantime , investigations had been pursued in GPE , GPE and GPE . CARDINAL court orders were issued , including TIME discovery orders against NORP banks . A large number of the said court orders were tried by appeal instances . Furthermore , material was procured from company sellers , ORG ( Told- og PERSON ) and ORG ( Erhvervs- of GPE ) .", "During the investigation , the police was assisted inter alia by a firm of accountants in order to untangle intricate corporate structures and ownership structures of companies and to enlighten tax technicalities as regards numerous financial and liquid transactions .", "On DATE LAW issued an indictment against the applicant and CARDINAL co - accused , CARDINAL of whom died before the trial commenced . The indictment contained CARDINAL counts of tax assets stripping CARDINAL private limited companies , of which the applicant was indicted of CARDINAL counts involving CARDINAL private limited companies . The indictment was submitted to ORG ( PERSON ) to which , by a final ORG order of CARDINAL DATE , the case had been transferred from ORG in GPE on the latter \u2019s request of DATE after having been addressed by the police as to scheduling of court hearings in the case .", "In DATE several procedural matters were determined by ORG that the prosecution was allowed to use the material received from the NORP authorities as evidence in the case , and that an accountant who had assisted the prosecutor was not disqualified from the case . The former issue was appealed against to ORG , which upheld the decision on DATE , and leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "On DATE a hearing was held in order to plan the course of the proceedings . It appears from the court records that ORG expected to have LOC available in DATE as it was necessary to lease LOC to accommodate the court sitting with lay judges and deputies , CARDINAL co - accused , counsel with deputies , and an archive room with space for CARDINAL sets of exhibits expected to take up CARDINAL ORG binders per set . Counsel requested that the trial be scheduled with CARDINAL DATE court DATE in consideration of those accused , who were living abroad .", "On DATE ORG scheduled the case for trial DATE and DATE starting on DATE and ending in DATE .", "Accordingly , in the period DATE , when the trial commenced , and DATE , when the case was set down for judgment , CARDINAL court hearings were held . The applicant , the CARDINAL coaccused , and a very large number of witnesses gave evidence . In addition , statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were presented including outlines of corporate structures and money transactions . Each set of exhibits for the case took up CARDINAL ORG binders and the court records ran to approximately CARDINAL pages .", "By judgment of DATE , which ran to CARDINAL pages , ORG convicted the applicant of tax assets stripping as to an amount evaded for tax purposes calculated at DKK MONEY ( equal to MONEY CARDINAL ) and attempted tax assets stripping as to DKK MONEY ( equal to MONEY CARDINAL ) . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and an amount of DKK CARDINAL was seized . In addition for an indefinite period , he was deprived of his right to establish or to become manager and/or member of a director \u2019s board in a private limited company , or in a company or an association which would require public approval , and of his right to practise as an accountant . The CARDINAL co - accused were convicted by the same judgment .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint that the length of the proceedings had exceeded a reasonable time , finding among other things :", "\u201c In count I , count II A and count IV a large number of companies have been traded . The structure included foreign companies with impenetrable ownership structures , and money transactions have mainly taken place in GPE . These circumstances are a good reason for a lengthy investigation . Thus , the right to a trial within a reasonable time ... has not been violated . \u201d", "By notice of appeal of DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG of Eastern GPE . The co - accused also appealed against the judgment , and by notice of appeal of DATE the prosecution cross - appealed .", "During pre - trial reviews held on CARDINAL and DATE the High ORG stated that the trial could start in DATE , however since several counsel were prevented by other trials until DATE , the trial was set to commence on DATE .", "From that date and until DATE , CARDINAL court hearings were held .", "During a hearing on DATE the applicant stated that he did not have the mental energy required to be present . Also , he wished that CARDINAL of his CARDINAL counsel be released . ORG stated that the medical certificate that had been submitted by the applicant was inadequate , and it thus requested that the applicant submitted a more detailed CARDINAL . The following day ORG assigned another attorney as co - counsel for the applicant . Hearings scheduled for CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , and CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE were cancelled due to pleaded illness on the applicant \u2019s behalf , and his counsel requested an adjournment of the case for DATE . The issue of the applicant \u2019s illness was discussed , and a medical certificate was submitted to ORG ( Retsl\u00e6ger\u00e5det ) for an assessment . On the basis of the latter \u2019s opinion , on DATE , ORG found that the applicant had no lawful cause for being absent from the trial . Since then the applicant appeared before ORG .", "Court hearings scheduled for CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and CARDINAL and DATE had to be cancelled in that in the period from CARDINAL DATE until DATE a claim by CARDINAL of the coaccused , joined by the applicant , had to be determined , namely as to whether the presiding judge in the High ORG should vacate his seat on the bench due to disqualification . The question was answered in the negative by ORG on DATE , and leave to appeal against this decision to ORG was refused by the Leave to Appeal Board ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) on DATE .", "During the following court hearing on DATE counsel for the same co - accused claimed an adjournment of the trial due to his client \u2019s illness . Thus , hearings scheduled for CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE had to be cancelled . The court hearings ended in DATE . Before ORG the applicant , the CARDINAL co - accused , and CARDINAL witnesses were heard . Also , statements during ORG trial from CARDINAL witnesses were read out . In addition , statements of accounts and a considerable amount of other documentary evidence were presented , including outlines of corporate structures and money transactions . Each set of exhibits for the case took up CARDINAL ORG binders and the court records ran to CARDINAL pages . By judgment of DATE , which ran to CARDINAL pages , ORG upheld ORG judgment .", "Also , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint that the length of the proceeding had exceeded a reasonable time . It stated inter alia :", "\u201c Counsel have claimed , as [ they did ] before ORG , that LAW has been violated due to the extension of the trial \u2019s duration .", "The prosecution has contested that there has been a violation of LAW .", "As a starting point , a length of proceedings in a criminal trial , which DATE - from charges and searches in DATE presumably entails a breach of the requirement of a trial within a reasonable time as set out in LAW . Thus , it is incumbent on the authorities to prove that the duration was reasonable , and that the case proceeded with duly expedition without the existence of any \u201c dead periods \u201d . In this assessment , the nature of the case and its importance , its complexity , and the conduct of the accused and that of the authorities must be taken into account .", "A chronological account of the proceedings has been submitted before the High ORG . ...", "The case has necessitated investigation of entangled constructions of companies and group of companies with associations abroad . Furthermore , it has required an extremely comprehensive accountant work to go through the complex financial circumstances of the case and untangle the money transactions for each company . Thus and necessarily , it had to take some time to work up the investigation material and consider the matter of indictment in the case . The NORP authorities have had no influence on the proceedings in GPE as to the international letter of request , or on the process on LOC . The High Court finds that the general investigation ; the consideration of the case ; the work on accounting matters ; and the determination of procedural questions ; all have moved forward in parallel , thus avoiding any dead periods during the investigation , during the periods of scheduling of the trial or during the proceedings before ORG and ORG .", "Accordingly , making an overall assessment , the High Court finds that the length of the proceedings does not entail a breach of the accused \u2019s rights under LAW . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant requested that the Leave to ORG grant him leave to appeal against the ORG judgment to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) . The case is at present pending before the Leave to Appeal Board ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
