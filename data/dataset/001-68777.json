It was later alleged that on DATE , as he was being transferred to ORG , a fight broke out during which he \u201c headbutted \u201d one of the prison officers .

By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors asked the governor to reconsider . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the prison service responded explaining that in considering requests for representation governors did not need to be sure beyond reasonable doubt that representation was not needed before rejecting a request but were required to take account of the CARDINAL criteria set out in the \u201c GPE principles \u201d ( NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG ex parte Tarrant [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The adjudication hearing resumed on DATE .

Counsel advised on DATE that the applicant had no realistic prospects of success given the ORG and PERSON case ( ORG and PERSON ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL ) . As to whether the governor \u2019s exercise of discretion was unreasonable , the \u201c GPE criteria \u201d , the \u201c relatively minor nature of the offence \u201d and the capacity of the applicant , meant that the prospects of passing the \u201c high hurdle of irrationality \u201d on judicial review were remote .", "CARDINAL .

However , he explained that that was untrue and that he believed his cell had been deliberately set on fire by other prisoners who thought that he was an informant . He had not explained this to the prison officers at the time as he was in the presence of other prisoners and he feared reprisals . He consistently maintained throughout the hearing that he had not started the fire . He cross - examined various witnesses called by the governor . The hearing continued the following day when he formally applied for legal representation for the remainder of the hearing , on the grounds that there were a large number of witnesses to be called , that the charge was a serious one and that it was difficult to be his own representative given the issue about his false admission . The governor refused his request taking the view that the offence was not sufficiently serious to warrant legal representation and that the applicant had demonstrated that he was capable of presenting his own defence . The hearing was adjourned until DATE to enable a particular prison officer to be called .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was due for early release from custody pursuant to the provisions of MONEY DATE . On TIME he fell down a flight of stairs and was injured .

Further written representations were also made : due to the nature of the injuries and the medication received , it was unreasonable for the applicant to represent himself and the charge should be dismissed and that the solicitor should be informed should the proceedings continue so that he could make further representations . These written representations were not seen by the governor until after the adjudication hearing . The applicant returned to prison after his treatment and was certified by the prison doctor as fit for adjudication . The adjudication recommenced DATE ( DATE ) and the applicant was accompanied at the hearing by a medical officer .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors asked the controller to re - consider his refusal of legal representation : since the applicant had instructed them that it was self - defence , his guilty plea was not satisfactory .

It was considered a simple case in which the applicant had sworn an affidavit setting out his account of the incident including a passage which claimed self - defence and the adjudicator would have to decide whether he believed the applicant or LAW case - law opened to ORG ( ORG and Fell v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , PERSON v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions PERSON , and PERSON the GPE judgment of DATE , ORG ) did not establish an inflexible rule that legal representation should be accorded in every case or even a looser rule that it should be generally accorded .

A request was therefore made for an ex gratia payment to compensate the applicant for the CARDINAL days\u2019 detention resulting from the adjudication .
