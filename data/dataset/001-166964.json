THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention)", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Armen Harutyunyan;Kristina Pardalos;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Robert Spano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is detained in FAC , ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sentenced by ORG to custody for life for causing grievous bodily harm . The minimum period ( \u201c tariff \u201d ) was set at DATE , DATE , less time spent on remand . The tariff expired on DATE and he became eligible for parole .", "CARDINAL . ORG subsequently examined his case in order to review whether his detention remained necessary for the protection of the public . On DATE it decided not to direct his release but recommended that he be transferred to open conditions . That recommendation was rejected by the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A second recommendation to the same effect was made , following the applicant \u2019s second ORG review on DATE and rejected by the Secretary of ORG on DATE . At the conclusion of its statement of reasons for rejecting the ORG \u2019s recommendation , ORG ( \u201c NOMS \u201d ) wrote :", "\u201c The Secretary of ORG has therefore decided that you should remain in closed conditions and your next review will conclude in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The accompanying letter stated :", "\u201c It has been decided that your case will next be referred to ORG for a provisional hearing to take place in DATE .", "...", "You will be notified by ORG nearer the time about the exact date of that hearing .", "At your next review ORG will consider your suitability for release by way of a paper panel . This consideration will take place DATE prior to your provisional hearing [ in DATE ] . If you are not content with the paper panel \u2019s decision you may request that the case proceeds to the arranged oral hearing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The case was referred to ORG on DATE . On DATE the applicant and ORG were sent relevant reports as required by the applicable rules . On DATE ORG gave case - management directions requiring additional reports . On DATE ORG received the further reports requested . The hearing took place on DATE . On DATE ORG directed the applicant \u2019s release . He was released from prison DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , in DATE , the applicant commenced judicial review proceedings against the Secretary of ORG and ORG seeking damages for the delay in holding the hearing . He relied on LAW . He was granted permission to bring proceedings on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the claim was dismissed by ORG . Leave to appeal was granted by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG handed down its judgment . After carefully reviewing the facts and the individual periods of delay encountered , it concluded that there had been a delay of DATE , from DATE to DATE , in the holding of ORG hearing which was unjustified and for which the Secretary of ORG was responsible . This delay had prevented the applicant from having the lawfulness of his continued detention decided in accordance with LAW . On the question of damages , the court was satisfied that the applicant had shown , on a balance of probabilities , that he would have been released had the review taken place in DATE . Damages on the basis of a loss of liberty were therefore appropriate .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE on the amount of damages to be awarded , the court considered a number of just satisfaction awards in cases before this ORG in which breaches of LAW had been found . It distinguished between cases where the delay had merely led to feelings of frustration and those where it had been established that , but for the delay in the holding of the hearing , the applicant would have been released earlier . It awarded the sum of MONEY ( \u201c GBP \u201d ) by way of compensation for the loss of CARDINAL months\u2019 conditional liberty .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought leave to appeal to ORG on the ground that the award was inadequate . ORG sought leave to appeal on the ground that the award was excessive . Leave was granted to both parties , and the applicant was in addition given permission to argue that his detention after DATE constituted false imprisonment at common law or a violation of LAW . In respect of his latter argument , he relied on this ORG \u2019s findings in PERSON , PERSON and PERSON v. the GPE , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG unanimously rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and allowed the appeal of ORG , reducing the damages award to GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . As regards the alleged violation of LAW , Lord PERSON , giving the leading opinion , observed that LAW provided a procedural entitlement designed to ensure that persons were not detained in violation of their rights under LAW . However , he added , a violation of LAW did not necessarily result in a violation of LAW . He considered this ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , cited above , not to be directly relevant to the applicant \u2019s case since that judgment concerned lack of access to rehabilitation courses and the just satisfaction awards made were for the feelings of distress and frustration resulting from continued detention without access to courses , and not for loss of liberty . Lord PERSON noted that the delay in the applicant \u2019s case appeared to have been the result of errors by administrative staff , \u201c of a kind which occur from time to time in any system which is vulnerable to human error \u201d . While it was extremely unfortunate that the errors had occurred and had resulted in the prolongation of the applicant \u2019s detention , they were not of such a character , and the delay was not of such a degree , as to warrant the conclusion that there had been a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On the matter of damages for the violation of LAW , Lord PERSON reviewed relevant case - law of this Court where a violation of LAW , DATE had been found , focusing in particular on cases concerning a delay in holding a hearing intended to address the question whether a convicted prisoner should be released . He considered that no clear guidance could be derived from the cases since none concerned awards for loss of liberty resulting from a violation of the speedy decision guarantee in LAW . While , he said , an appellate court would not interfere with an award of damages simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the case at first instance , in the applicant \u2019s appeal the court was being invited to give guidance as to the appropriate level of awards in cases of this character . For that purpose , the court had undertaken a fuller analysis of the case - law of this ORG than ORG . Lord PERSON concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... In the light of that analysis , and applying the general approach which I have described ... , it appears to me that an award in the region of \u00a3 MONEY would adequately compensate PERSON for his delayed release , bearing in mind the conditional and precarious nature of the liberty foregone . That amount falls well short of the award of \u00a3 MONEY made by ORG . In the circumstances , it is in my view appropriate for this court to allow the ORG \u2019s appeal and to reduce the award accordingly . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
