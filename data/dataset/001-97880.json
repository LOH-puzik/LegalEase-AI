The first applicant 's daughter , who is the second applicant , was born on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant took the second applicant to see their general practitioner because he and his wife were concerned about what appeared to be bruising on her legs . A clotting test was carried out but it showed no abnormality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant took the second applicant back to the general practitioner because her swimming teacher had expressed concern about the marks on her legs . The first applicant asked for a referral to hospital and an appointment was made for CARDINAL DATE with PERSON , a consultant paediatrician .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant hurt herself in the genital area while riding her bike . She complained to her mother of hurting between her legs . Her mother did not examine her and she did not tell the first applicant of the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant took the second applicant to the appointment with Dr PERSON said that the bruising did not appear to be a skin disease and admitted the second applicant to hospital for further examination . The first applicant had to go to work but before leaving the hospital he told Dr PERSON that his wife would arrive soon and there should be no further examination or tests until she came and gave any necessary consent .", "CARDINAL . When the first applicant 's wife arrived TIME , she found that a sample of the second applicant 's blood had been taken for testing , photographs had been taken of her legs and the local authority had been notified . A social worker informed her that Dr PERSON thought the second applicant had been abused . The first applicant 's wife then gave consent for a further examination . Dr PERSON and a police surgeon examined the second applicant 's legs and genitalia . The second applicant was given no explanation for the examinations and she was not questioned about the allegations of abuse . Following the examination , Dr PERSON informed the first applicant 's wife that the second applicant had been sexually abused and that it had probably been going on for DATE on account of the bruising . The social worker interviewed the second applicant generally , but asked no direct questions about sexual abuse . No record was made of the interview . During the interview the social workers told the first applicant 's wife to ask the first applicant and their eldest son to move out of the family home until further investigations had taken place . At this point she recalled that the second applicant had \u201c hurt between her legs \u201d while on her bicycle . She informed the social worker , who said that she would pass the information on to the doctor .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , when the first applicant and his wife attempted to visit the second applicant on the ward , a nurse told them that there were orders that the first applicant should not be allowed to see her . This exchange was witnessed by other people on the ward . News was passed through the community and reached acquaintances in GPE . The following day , hospital staff were correctly informed that there could be no restrictions on visitors . The first applicant was thereafter permitted to visit the second applicant in hospital , although all visits were supervised on account of the suspicion that she had been sexually abused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant 's wife informed PERSON that the second applicant had \u201c hurt between her legs \u201d on her bicycle .

On DATE social workers visited the applicants ' home . The applicant 's wife asked for a second opinion on the cause of the bruising but the social workers told her that they saw no point in obtaining a second opinion . They did not , however , insist that the first applicant should leave the family home ; instead it was arranged that the first applicant 's wife should sleep in the room with her daughters .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant 's wife noticed that the second applicant had marks on her hands . An appointment was made for the second applicant to see a dermatologist .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the dermatologist reported that the marks on the second applicant 's legs were caused by vasculitis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was diagnosed with PERSON 's disease , a rare condition of the capillaries which is manifested by the eruption of purple patches on the skin . She was discharged from hospital . PERSON wrote a letter to the first applicant and his wife which stated that there was insufficient evidence to say that the second applicant had been sexually abused and that the first applicant should no longer be considered to be implicated in the sexual or physical abuse of his daughter .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant and his wife were unhappy with what had happened and made a formal complaint to ORG . ORG set up ORG with CARDINAL Assessors who were consultant paediatricians experienced in child abuse cases . The Panel report concluded that Dr PERSON had been right to admit the second applicant to hospital but found that she had acted too quickly in carrying out examinations . The report further noted that examinations and photographs should not have been taken while no parent was present ; that while Dr PERSON was not to blame for misdiagnosing the bruises , she should have monitored them and obtained a dermatologist 's opinion as a matter of urgency ; that the first applicant should have been properly consulted and interviewed ; and that Dr PERSON had attached far too much importance to the bruising , neglecting other relevant information available from the first applicant , his wife and the family doctor . Finally , the report noted that Dr PERSON had , without convincing explanation , failed to write to the first applicant with an explanation and an apology .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought proceedings in negligence against the local authority and hospital trust claiming compensation for personal injury and financial loss .

On DATE ORG granted the second applicant 's appeal and allowed her claim to proceed against the local authority as well as the hospital . ORG , however , withdrew the second applicant 's legal aid certificate on the basis that it was no longer reasonable for her to receive legal aid because the likely costs were disproportionate to the value of the claim . On DATE the second applicant 's appeal against the withdrawal was dismissed by an independent ORG , which agreed that the costs of pursuing the claim considerably outweighed any likely award of damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant 's appeal together with the appeals of the other appellants . The first applicant and the other appellants were granted leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment in DATE ( see ORG v ORG and Ors [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) . The question before ORG in ORG was whether the parent of a minor child falsely and negligently said to have abused or harmed the child could recover common law damages for negligence against a doctor or social worker who , discharging professional functions , made the false and negligent statement , if the suffering of psychiatric injury by the parent was a foreseeable result of making it and such injury had in fact been suffered by the parent . ORG concluded ( Lord PERSON of NORP dissenting ) that there were cogent reasons of public policy for holding that no common law duty of care should be owed to the parents and it would not be just or reasonable to impose such a duty .", "CARDINAL .
