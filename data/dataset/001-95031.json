The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is the brother of PERSON , who lived in an apartment above Mr F.", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr F. applied for an injunction to restrain PERSON from hanging out clothes to dry over the courtyard of his apartment , thereby allegedly interfering with his property rights . Mr F. relied on the provisions of LAW in this connection .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL occasion following a hearing on the injunction , and after PERSON and her lawyer , PERSON , had already left the courtroom , the presiding magistrate changed the date of a future hearing , which had already been fixed . As a consequence , PERSON was not aware of the new date and was not present at the hearing . In her absence , on DATE the presiding magistrate issued the injunction in favour of Mr F.", "CARDINAL . According to NORP law as it stood at the time , PERSON had to institute proceedings in respect of the property claim preserved by the warrant within DATE of the issuing of the injunction ; otherwise the injunction would cease to have effect . Accordingly , on DATE , Mr F. lodged a writ of summons to start proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the relevant court trying the merits of Mr F. \u2019s civil action found against PERSON and issued a permanent injunction against her . On DATE , as no appeal had been lodged , the case became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary jurisdiction , claiming that the injunction had been issued in her absence and without giving her the opportunity to testify ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld her claim . It held that the audi alteram partem principle was applicable to the procedure for issuing an injunction . Referring to LAW , which stated that an injunction should not be issued unless the court was satisfied that it was necessary in order to preserve any right of the person seeking it ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG held that the relevant test was a matter for the court \u2019s discretion . However , if the court found it necessary to hear the parties , they should be duly heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice . In the present case the court held that , through no fault of her own , PERSON had been denied her right to be heard and therefore the said warrant was null and void .", "CARDINAL . Mr F. appealed against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . In the first - instance proceedings Mr F. had been assisted by PERSON , while at the appeal stage he had appointed the latter \u2019s son , PERSON was presided over by the Chief Justice , who sat with CARDINAL other judges . The Chief Justice was PERSON brother and PERSON uncle .", "CARDINAL . At the appeal hearing of CARDINAL DATE , the Chief Justice , after asking some questions , alleged that the conduct of PERSON was unethical , as he had impugned , without justification , the conduct of Mr F \u2019s lawyer . When it was noted that in the first - instance proceedings Mr F. had been represented by the Chief Justice \u2019s brother , the Chief Justice threatened to refer the case to \u201c the competent authorities \u201d . Furthermore , he dictated a note to this effect , which read as follows :", "\u201c The court is asking PERSON , who himself is declaring that the date of the hearing at first instance had been changed when he and his client had already left the courtroom , why he insisted that the said change of date occurred consequent to a request by a lawyer . PERSON reply is : \u2018 I deduce so , as there were CARDINAL lawyers present : PERSON and myself.\u2019", "... PERSON lawyer asserts facts and has no problem hypothesising about the behaviour of another lawyer and the judge , after he and his client had walked out of the courtroom . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON said a few words in his own defence , but no oral submissions regarding the merits of the appeal were heard . The Chief Justice suspended the hearing and went to his chambers . TIME the lawyers of both parties were called into the Chief ORG \u2019s chambers . Explanations were heard and no further action appears to have been taken .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found against PERSON and reversed the judgment of ORG . It held that principles of natural justice were not mandatory and could not be invoked in preliminary proceedings that were essentially conditional and of a temporary nature . Moreover , ORG did not agree with the issue of fact mentioned in the first - instance judgment , in respect of the change in date leading to PERSON absence at the hearing . In this respect the judgment repeated in part the note which had been dictated during the hearing DATE \u201c PERSON lawyer asserts facts and has no problem hypothesising about the behaviour of another lawyer and the judge , after he and his client had walked out of the courtroom \u201d . ORG further ordered the removal from the records of the case of a report which supported PERSON claim , which had been drawn up by the judicial assistant appointed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . Relying on LAW , she alleged that the President of ORG ( the Chief Justice ) lacked objective impartiality and that this had been manifest in the incident of CARDINAL DATE . Observing that ORG had denied facts which had already been proved , she further submitted that her right to a fair trial had been violated .", "CARDINAL . PERSON died on DATE , before her constitutional claim could be determined . On DATE the applicant intervened in the proceedings before ORG in his capacity as brother of the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed PERSON claim as frivolous and vexatious . Although it noted that the plaintiff had failed to request the Chief Justice to withdraw from the case before the pronouncement of the final judgment , it rejected the ORG \u2019s plea of non - exhaustion of ordinary remedies and decided to exercise its constitutional jurisdiction . As to the merits , it made a thorough analysis of the notions and rights emanating from LAW , including equality of arms , but placed particular emphasis on the requirement of impartiality of ORG . However , it was unable to find any link between the incident of CARDINAL DATE and the content of the judgment of DATE . As confirmed by PERSON himself , the incident had been defused ; however , this could not have given PERSON or her lawyer any expectation that ORG would rule in her favour . Furthermore , ORG was composed of CARDINAL other judges , who had not been involved in the incident , and there had been no doubt that the judgment , which appeared to be well - reasoned , had been delivered by the bench as a whole .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG declared the appeal inadmissible . It reiterated that in accordance with LAW , no appeal lay against a decision dismissing an application as frivolous and vexatious .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Tenements at a lower level are subject in regard to tenements at a higher level to receive such waters and materials as flow or fall naturally therefrom without the agency of man .", "( CARDINAL ) It shall not be lawful for the owner of the lower tenement to do anything which may prevent such flow or fall .", "( CARDINAL ) Nor shall it be lawful for the owner of the higher tenement to do anything whereby the easement of the lower tenement is rendered more burdensome . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of Title VI , ORG of ORG , regarding warrants of prohibitory injunction , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The object of a warrant of prohibitory injunction is to restrain a person from doing anything whatsoever which might be prejudicial to the person suing out the warrant .", "( CARDINAL ) The court shall not issue any such warrant unless it is satisfied that such warrant is necessary in order to preserve any right of the person suing out the warrant , and that prima facie such person appears to possess such right . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under NORP law , as it stood at the time of the present case , a judge could be challenged or could abstain from hearing a case if one of the parties was represented by the former \u2019s son or daughter , spouse or ascendant . Nothing prevented a judge from sitting in a case if the representative in issue was his or her brother or nephew . The pertinent Articles of LAW , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c The judges may not be challenged , nor may they abstain from sitting in any cause brought before the court in which they are appointed to sit , except for any of the reasons hereinafter mentioned . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A judge may be challenged or abstain from sitting in a cause \u2013", "...", "( e ) if he , or his spouse , is directly or indirectly interested in the event of the suit ;", "( f ) if the advocate or legal procurator pleading before a judge is the son or daughter , spouse or ascendant of the said judge ; ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On the basis of the material available to the ORG in respect of the legislation of a relevant number of member ORG , it appears that there is widespread consensus on the applicability of Article CARDINAL safeguards to interim measures , including injunction proceedings . This conclusion is inferred from constitutional texts , codes of civil procedure and domestic case - law . In the majority of GPE ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) legislation suggests that LAW ( particularly the impartiality requirement ) apply to interim and injunction proceedings either because the legislation makes no distinction as to the stage or type of proceedings to which the safeguards apply ( such as the Constitutions of GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , or because specific provisions governing interim measures reflect in some way the main safeguards embedded in DATE as , for example , legislation which specifies that provisions governing proceedings on the merits apply mutatis mutandis to injunction proceedings ( such as GPE ) , or will do so , unless otherwise stipulated ( such as GPE ) . The NORP courts have explicitly dealt with the issue ( see the judgments of ORG in the cases of ORG and ORG in ORG , of DATE ) and held that LAW was in principle applicable to interim proceedings ( r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW guarantees the right to a fair trial . Unlike LAW , the provision of the LAW does not confine this right to disputes relating to \u201c civil rights and obligations \u201d or to \u201c any criminal charge \u201d and does not refer to the \u201c determination \u201d of such . In PERSON v. ORG ( ECJ , Case C CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) ORG ( \u201c the ECJ \u201d ) held that provisional measures given ex parte without hearing the defendant could not be recognised according to its case - law . This implies that such safeguards should apply also outside the context of final decisions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
