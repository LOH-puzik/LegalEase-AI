BULGARIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 10;Violation of Art. 13+8 et 10;Remainder inadmissible;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , who is a sociologist by training , was employed as an expert by ORG at ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He was a close friend of ORG , a prosecutor at ORG , who had become widely known for his public accusations against ORG , PERSON , and for his assertions that ORG and his entourage were harassing him and exerting improper pressure on him , and who committed suicide on DATE , leaving a note which said that the Chief Prosecutor should resign .", "CARDINAL . Following this event , the applicant was considering resigning from his position . For this purpose , he had prepared CARDINAL draft resignation letters , which he kept in a drawer of his office desk . However , he eventually decided that he would not resign .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter to the DATE newspaper ORG , the DATE newspaper ORG , and ORG . In that letter he made a number of allegations against ORG , PERSON N.F. He averred that the latter had groundlessly discontinued criminal proceedings against high - ranking persons from the executive branch , and had exploited ORG for the purpose of reprisals against political opponents of the ruling party and his own opponents . The applicant also claimed that ORG had created a fearful and morbid working atmosphere in ORG by acting rudely and insultingly towards his subordinates , even , as rumour had it , occasionally physically assaulting them . He further claimed that , according to certain rumours , ORG had heavily beaten his former wife and a female judge . According to the same rumours , ORG was mentally ill and suffered from paranoia , for which he had undergone treatment in a psychiatric hospital . According to the applicant , all these rumours had to be verified by ORG . The applicant also alleged that ORG had deliberately tried to wreck ORG by harassing members of its staff . The applicant further averred that ORG and his entourage , who had repeatedly uttered threats against the late Mr N.D. , were responsible for the latter 's death . According to the applicant , that event had to be investigated with a view to determining whether ORG had incited ORG suicide , which was a criminal offence . Finally , the applicant submitted that he had intended to resign because of the bad atmosphere in ORG , but had eventually decided that the more proper thing to do was to continue performing his work and opposing the nuisance generated by ORG from within .", "CARDINAL . The letter was published in DATE issue of ORG under the heading \u201c [ ORG ] finished [ GPE ] off \u201d and the subheading \u201c Fear and evil reign in the ORG \u201d . The CARDINAL DATE issue in fact came out during TIME of CARDINAL May , in accordance with the practice of ORG 's publishers .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE GPE , a prosecutor from ORG , ordered the police officer who was on duty at the entrance of ORG building in GPE to let him enter in order to seal off the applicant 's office . TIME he came back and handed the police officer a written order to not allow the applicant into the building on CARDINAL and DATE , stating that the latter had been dismissed .", "CARDINAL . At TIME CARDINAL DATE the applicant tried to enter ORG building in order to go to his office , but was stopped by the police officer at the entrance .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicant went to ORG building , accompanied by an editor from ORG and other journalists . He tried to enter his office , but could not , as the door was locked and his key did not fit in , the lock having apparently been changed . He then went to the office of a prosecutor from ORG , where he was informed that his resignation letter ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been brought to the attention of ORG and that the latter had accepted it .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on CARDINAL DATE the applicant was handed an order for the termination of his employment on the basis of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , signed by ORG and effective immediately . The applicant objected that he had never in fact tendered his resignation and that the termination was therefore contrary to that provision .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant requested ORG to inquire into the events ( in particular , an alleged search of his office ) and , if justified , to open criminal proceedings for abuse of office against the officials who had committed the alleged acts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a commission consisting of the head of the administrative department of ORG , the head of ORG administration and ORG secretary inspected the applicant 's office . It drew up a very detailed inventory of the items that it found in his desk drawers and filing cabinets , which included medicines , compact discs with personal material , notes , notebooks , diplomas , personal photographs , books and personal documents , including medical ones . On DATE the same commission inspected the contents of the hard disk of the applicant 's computer and drew up an inventory of its findings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his brother went to the applicant 's office to collect his personal belongings . They found that all the cabinets and the applicant 's desk had been sealed , that the cabinets and the desk drawers had been rummaged in , and that the draft resignation letters which the applicant had prepared ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were missing , as were his letter of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and his office computer .", "CARDINAL . In an order of DATE the ORG , to which the applicant 's complaint of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been referred , refused to open criminal proceedings . It reasoned that in refusing to allow the applicant to enter ORG building on CARDINAL DATE the police officers at the entrance had acted lawfully .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing , inter alia , that the order was incomplete , because his complaint had included allegations of official misconduct by prosecutors of ORG , who , according to the relevant rules of criminal procedure , could be investigated only by a specially appointed prosecutor from the same office . His complaint should therefore also have been brought to the attention of ORG . In an order of DATE ORG upheld the refusal of ORG to open criminal proceedings against the police officers . However , it agreed that the remainder of the applicant 's complaint fell within the competence of ORG and referred it to it .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE a prosecutor from ORG refused to open criminal proceedings . He briefly reasoned that in his complaint the applicant had not named particular persons and had not identified the specific provisions of LAW that had allegedly been breached by them . Having studied the file , the prosecutor had not found any evidence of a publicly prosecutable offence relating to the refusal to allow the applicant access to his workplace or relating to his resignation letter .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had brought a civil action against ORG . He alleged that the termination of his contract had been unlawful and sought reinstatement and compensation for loss of salary . He averred , inter alia , that the climate in ORG had deteriorated as a result of the actions of ORG . After the death of ORG he had decided to resign and had prepared a draft resignation letter , but had eventually decided not to and instead to make public his observations about the atmosphere in ORG . In consequence , he had written a letter to ORG and ORG . Later , access to his office had been impeded and his employment had been terminated on the basis of a resignation which he had never in fact tendered .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG declared the termination of the applicant 's employment unlawful , ordered that he be reinstated in his position , and awarded him CARDINAL NORP levs , plus interest , for loss of salary for DATE following the termination of his employment , in line with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the facts part of its judgment it described in detail the events set out in paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above . After analysing in detail the evidence , the court found that there was no indication that at any point in time the applicant had in fact tendered his resignation . On the contrary , it was evident from the facts that his draft resignation letter had been taken from his office by a person having access to it during the period from DATE and had been submitted by that person to ORG . This made the termination of the applicant 's employment by ostensible mutual agreement unlawful , as LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) required proof of both parties ' actual intention to terminate the employment .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor 's Office appealed to ORG , arguing that the applicant had in fact tendered his resignation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE the ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment . It likewise described in detail the events set out in DATE , DATE , DATE and QUANTITY above , and held , like the court below , that the available evidence did not indicate that the applicant had in fact tendered his resignation . Therefore , in the court 's view , the termination of the applicant 's employment had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor 's Office appealed on points of law to ORG . It argued that the lower court had erroneously assessed the evidence and established the facts .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a final judgment of DATE ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment . It fully agreed with its finding that , on the basis of the available evidence , there was no indication that the applicant had in fact tendered his resignation . Therefore , one of the key requirements of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had not been complied with , which made the termination of the applicant 's employment unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not reinstated in his former position , as in DATE ORG at ORG had been abolished . However , during the pendency of the proceedings , again in DATE , a similar body was established at ORG and on DATE the applicant was appointed there , apparently independently of the court order for his reinstatement . He has been working there to DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Judicial Power Act of DATE ( \u201e \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u201c ) provides that ORG is unified and centralised , that each prosecutor is subordinate to the relevant senior prosecutor , and that all prosecutors are subordinate to ORG ( the last - mentioned aspect is also provided by LAW ) . ORG may issue directives and give instructions relating to ORG activities ( sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Judicial Power Act of DATE ) . ORG oversees the work of all prosecutors , and the prosecutors of the appellate and regional prosecutor 's offices oversee the work of their subordinate prosecutors ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ) . Higher prosecutors may perform any acts which are within the competence of their subordinate prosecutors . They may also stay or revoke their decisions in the cases provided for by law ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ) . The higher prosecutors ' written orders are binding on their subordinate prosecutors ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE ORG was an agency attached to ORG ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE , as in force at the relevant time ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE provides that an employment contract may be terminated by the parties without notice by mutual agreement expressed in writing .", "CARDINAL .
