ICELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and at the time of lodging the application was serving a prison sentence in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , Mr ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant and his wife , PERSON , ran a private day - care centre at their home in the suburbs of PERSON . On DATE , DATE , at TIME , a DATE boy , PERSON , was brought by his mother to the applicant and his wife . During TIME the boy had been restless , awake and crying . Usually the boy had a nap twice during DATE but DATE he refused to sleep before lunch - time and had no appetite . TIME the applicant left the centre for a meeting . His pregnant wife was close to giving birth to their child and went to see a doctor at TIME At TIME she returned home and she sat down in the play - room ; the applicant took PERSON to put him to sleep in a pram , placed in the garage . An audio detection device ( baby - sitter ) was set in motion in the garage . TIME the applicant came back into the apartment .", "According to the applicant , nothing unusual happened when he put the baby to sleep . He just placed the boy in the pram and the boy immediately fell asleep . The applicant stayed with him for TIME . His wife stated that she did not see or hear anything unusual while attending to the children who were not sleeping . TIME , the applicant tried to wake up the baby , but he was unconscious . His wife took the baby and put him on a changing blanket . She removed the baby \u2019s napkin since it was soiled . The applicant telephoned an emergency service and TIME emergency personnel arrived . PERSON was taken urgently to hospital . In the morning of Friday CARDINAL DATE , the baby died .", "After the formal autopsy was completed on DATE , the couple was arrested . The relevant report , drawn up by a forensic pathologist , PERSON , concluded that PERSON had died of the so - called Shaken Baby Syndrome . It was found , firstly , that the injuries that appeared to have caused the child \u2019s death must have been caused TIME before death . Secondly , the baby had lost consciousness immediately after the fatal injuries had occurred . Since the child had been playing in the play room when the applicant \u2019s wife arrived , the incident must have occurred when the applicant put the baby to sleep .", "Subsequently , the applicant was charged under LAW with having shaken the baby in such a fierce or other manner as to cause his death . He and PERSON were also charged with offences related to the manner of running of their day - care centre , in that they had undertaken to provide care for many more children ( CARDINAL ) than they were allowed ( CARDINAL ) . This part of the case will not be described further below .", "Prior to the trial hearing before ORG , ORG obtained ORG ( \u201c the SMLB \u201d ) comments on the forensic expert report , which confirmed the conclusions contained in the report .", "Extensive evidence was submitted to ORG , including voluminous police investigation files , police reports , forensic pathology documents , and photocopies from medical publications as listed in an attachment to the autopsy report . Statements were received from the applicant and K , and CARDINAL witnesses were heard , which included all the witnesses called by the defence . Expert witnesses PERSON , GPE and O.T. , all summoned at the prosecution \u2019s request , also gave oral testimonies and answered questions .", "According to the applicant , neither the forensic specialist , nor the doctors who had attended to the boy , nor the SMLB in its initial statement mentioned the differences in international medical opinion regarding the Shaken Baby Syndrome .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG , relying on the evidence given by the prosecutor \u2019s expert witnesses and the conclusions of the SMLB , convicted the applicant of the charges and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment for having shaken S. to death . He was also sentenced to pay ISK CARDINAL in fines and was ordered to pay compensation to S. \u2019s parents .", "Subsequently the applicant , represented by a new lawyer ( who is also representing him in his application to ORG ) , appealed against his conviction and sentence to ORG . In this context , the defence sent a translation of PERSON \u2019s medical forensic report to a number of foreign medical and forensic experts for comment , CARDINAL of whom produced statements which , according to the applicant , indicated that he was not guilty . The cause of PERSON \u2019s death was fraught with doubt , it not being established that it was ORG rather than any other cause that was involved .", "By a letter of DATE to ORG , ORG stated that he considered it imperative , before a final judgment be passed on the merits of the case , to contact the SMLB again in order to obtain an answer to the question whether the medical statements of CARDINAL of the foreign experts submitted by counsel for the applicant , to the extent that they concerned the alleged cause of death of the baby boy in question , had the effect of changing in any respect the SMLB \u2019s conclusions submitted to ORG . The Prosecutor general listed CARDINAL questions that in his view should be addressed to the SMLB . He further stated :", "", "\u201c The Prosecutor General furthermore respectfully asks ORG to send an enquiry to the forensic pathologist [ GPE ] , asking her whether the writings of the CARDINAL above writers and their suggestions and comments relating to the child [ S. ] \u2019s assumed cause of death , have the effect of changing in any respect the inferences she draws in the autopsy report on the child \u2019s cause of death , cf . pages CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the abstract , all with a view to the points made under items CARDINAL - CARDINAL above .", "If granting this request is not deemed possible , the prosecution requests an opportunity to obtain [ T.S. ] \u2019s testimony as a witness before ORG on the autopsy of the child [ S.]and the assumed cause of his death . \u201d", "On DATE ORG forwarded the Prosecutor General \u2019s letter of DATE to counsel for the applicant , giving him an opportunity to comment within DATE .", "On DATE counsel for the defence replied requesting that CARDINAL questions formulated in his letter be put to the SMLB . His letter then went on as follows :", "\u201c On the occasion of the Prosecutor General \u2019s letter to ORG concerning questions to be put to the SMLB , it must be noted that according to LAW no member of ORG may pass an opinion on a matter on which he has previously taken a stand , personally or in office . The conclusions of the opinions referred to by ORG in his letter largely refute the opinion of the SMLB \u2019s Forensic Section of DATE . By asking for the ORG \u2019s observations on the opinions of the foreign experts , ORG is in reality being asked to comment on its own conclusions . A question mark can be placed on how reasonable such an arrangement is . The defence considers at least obvious that all the SMLB \u2019s members who on DATE took part in handling the entry from ORG meeting of DATE lack competency for approving an opinion prepared in response to questions posed by ORG , the defence , and , as the case may be , the ORG .", "At the end of his letter , the Prosecutor General requests that [ T.S. ] will be asked whether the conclusions of the autopsy report should be changed on account of the opinions of the foreign experts . If it is not deemed possible to request her written replies , the ORG is asked to call for her oral statement . If ORG decides to call for [ GPE ] \u2019s oral statement , the defence must demand that equality in this respect will be respected , and that the defence will be permitted to obtain the statement of some of the foreign experts who have expressed an opinion of the prosecution \u2019s autopsy report . \u201d", "On DATE ORG decided , in the light of the fact that the opinions and conclusions of the forensic expert TS were given decisive importance in the ORG assessment and that the foreign medial statements had been submitted in particular to challenge those conclusions , to order the SMLB to give a reasoned opinion on CARDINAL specific questions .", "On DATE , without awaiting a decision by ORG , ORG addressed CARDINAL questions to forensic pathologist TS , which in substance were the same as the first CARDINAL questions addressed by ORG to the SMLB . She replied to the questions on DATE , concluding that the foreign expert statements did not alter the inference she had drawn in her earlier autopsy report", "On DATE the SMLB replied to each of the questions and , composed of the same members as in the first round , maintained its previous conclusions . It was accompanied by an assessment by CARDINAL ophthalmologists , ORG and ORG , of DATE .", "On DATE counsel for the defence submitted additional observations regarding the phenomenon of \u201c Shaken - Baby Syndrome \u201d and disputing ORG arguments .", "In the proceedings before ORG , the defence maintained that the cause of S \u2019s death could not be determined with any certainty as this was wide open to doubt , and that no medical proof had been obtained of a \u201c Shaken Baby Syndrome \u201d rather than some other cause of death . In this context the applicant chiefly referred to the statements of the foreign experts . This had consisted , firstly , of the opinions of CARDINAL foreign specialists to whom the defendant \u2019s counsel had sent written material relating to S. \u2019s autopsy and state of health , and additional opinions of CARDINAL of them after further replies were obtained from forensic pathologist PERSON to the questions posed by ORG . Secondly , the opinions of CARDINAL additional experts , who had been delivered the same written material for examination , were submitted .", "After holding an oral hearing at which ORG and counsel for the defence spoke twice , ORG , by a judgment of DATE , upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction by ORG but reduced the sentence to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . In its judgment ORG relied on the assessment made by the SMLB and rejected the written foreign expert statements as guesses and speculation .", "In its judgment ORG pointed out that the applicant had failed to avail himself of the opportunity under LAW of criminal Procedure to ask it to appoint experts to provide an opinion with a view to refuting the medical inferences provided by domestic medical doctors and experts in the case . The defendant \u2019s collection of evidence had had the effect that ORG had found it appropriate to seek opinions from the SMLB in addition to those already obtained on the initiative of ORG , which was possible under section CARDINAL of ORG , No . CARDINAL ( \u201c the SMLB Act \u201d ) . In a reasoned opinion the SMLB had rejected the theory that LOC \u2019s death could have been due to infant scurvy or \u201c PERSON \u2019s Disease \u201d , allergic encephalitis , an ophthalmic disease , a bleeding disorder or chronic brain haemorrhage , vaccination , the mother \u2019s epilepsy or her use of the drug Tegretol , or to a digestive disorder resulting in endotoxinemia , acute scurvy and haemorrhage . The SMLB had stated in response to a specific question that all possible examinations had been conducted in order to preclude causes of death other than the CARDINAL stated in the autopsy report . ORG had asked forensic pathologist PERSON substantially identical questions on account of the writings of the foreign experts , and her replies and those of ORG were in full harmony .", "The relevant provisions of LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provide :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c CARDINAL . The judge may , as requested by a party or of his own accord , appoint an expert or experts to provide an opinion in a criminal case .", "CARDINAL .

ORG cases shall generally be argued orally . The ORG may however decide that a case shall be argued in writing , if particular reasons commend this . ORG may also decide to receive a case for adjudication without separate argumentation if this is requested unanimously by the parties , or if a judgment is appealed against solely with respect to the determination of sanctions .", "...", "CARDINAL . ORG may , to the extent that the ORG finds it necessary , decide to take oral evidence , provided that it deems , in the light of the facts , that such [ ... ] evidence may influence the outcome of the case . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . ORG can not review the findings of a district court relating to the evidential value of evidence presented orally , except if the witness in question , or the defendant , has provided a statement to ORG .", "CARDINAL . If ORG deems possible that the district court \u2019s findings concerning the evidential value of oral evidence presented in court may be erroneous to the extent of affecting the outcome of the case , and the witness or the defendant , as applicable , has not provided an oral statement to ORG , ORG may invalidate the district court \u2019s judgment and procedure to the extent necessary for making possible the submission of oral evidence there and a renewed conclusion . \u201d", "In relation to the statutory provisions quoted above , the ORG drew the ORG \u2019s attention to CARDINAL judgments by ORG , respectively of DATE and DATE , both of which concerned civil proceedings .", "In the latter judgment , ORG reasoning included the following observations :", "\u201c According to the respondent \u2019s exposition to ORG , he considers that the requested expert opinion may be of importance to his defence . In the light of the extensive consequences which the conclusions of the autopsy report may have for the outcome of this case , the respondent can not be barred from seeking additional expert opinions , and this procedural recourse is adequately provided for in DATE , the first paragraph , and in DATE , the third paragraph , of Act No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , cf . LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The respondent \u2019s request for a further expert opinion is therefore to be granted . The district court judge will be ordered to appoint in court CARDINAL experts to provide replies to the questions stated in the respondent \u2019s above request . \u201d", "In the former judgment , ORG stated :", "\u201c According to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , No . CARDINAL , the ORG \u2019s role includes providing the courts with opinions on medical matters if this is required for a judicial decision . In this respect the SMLB \u2019s role is analogous to the function exercised by an expert providing evidence in accordance with the generally applicable rules of LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , cf . , in part , LAW . To the extent that statute law does not provide for any different arrangement , there is no reason not to apply those general rules to persons providing opinions under the auspices of the SMLB . According to LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , an expert providing evidence shall , at the request of a party , appear in court and give a statement explaining his opinion and matters relating thereto . As regards the provision of such statements , the rules on witnesses in LAW of the same Act shall apply in so far as appropriate . Act No . CARDINAL contains no provisions to the effect that the members of ORG are exempted from such duty to appear in court . \u201d", "ORG , No .
