ORG Mr PERSON and his wife , PERSON , n\u00e9e PERSON , chose to give their daughter , born on DATE , the forenames \" PERSON , PERSON , PERSON \" . After consulting ORG at PERSON , the registrar of births , deaths and marriages for ORG , to whom the child 's birth had been declared , refused to register the first of these names on the ground that it did not appear in any calendar of saints DATE .

It held as follows :", "\" ORG objected to the application on the grounds that whereas ' PERSON ' and ' PERSON ' are , when taken separately , acceptable first forenames under NORP law , that is not the case with ' PERSON . The applicants submit that ' PERSON is composed of CARDINAL forenames recognised by NORP law , which when linked by the preposition ' de ' form the name of the heroine of LOC PERSON , a work which is world - famous . However , although a forename may be composed of CARDINAL names already in use , it can not , as in the present case , consist of a combination of CARDINAL names linked by a preposition since it would cease to be a mere reuse of a traditional boy 's or girl 's name and become an image invented at the whim of individuals , for all that they might possess as lively an imagination as LOC . In any event , this was not the intention of the legislature when it regulated the choice of forenames . Consequently , the main claim in the application must be dismissed but there is no reason not to grant the claim made in the alternative relating to the forename ' PERSON . For these reasons , ... Dismisses the applicants ' application for an order that the forename ' PERSON be added as the first forename of the child born on DATE and already called PERSON . Declares , on the other hand , that the forename ' PERSON is acceptable under NORP law and orders that it be added as the first forename of the above - mentioned child .

This is the case with the forename ' PERSON , notwithstanding that it was the name of the heroine of a famous literary work . On the other hand , there is no reason not to allow the claim made in the alternative that the forename should consist of the CARDINAL forenames ' PERSON ' and ' PERSON ' juxtaposed .", "( ... ) \"", "CARDINAL .

It is true that these provisions are of practical value in that they provide registrars of births , deaths and marriages with a bulwark against innovations which appear to them to be such as might later harm children 's interests and which would therefore be unacceptable . In practice , registrars of births , deaths and marriages , who have to take the immediate decision whether a forename is acceptable , can hardly be expected to compile a list of the exact resources of the calendars and of ancient history in order to determine whether a given forename is included in this heritage or not . In practice they are required to use common sense when exercising their discretion , so as to ensure that the law is applied with a measure of realism and liberality , in other words in such a way that the changes in social mores which have hallowed certain usages are not ignored and that surviving local characteristics and even family traditions which can be shown to exist are respected . Registrars must not lose sight of the fact that it is for parents to choose forenames and that , to the fullest extent possible , any wishes they may have expressed should be taken into account . ...", "( b ) In addition to the forenames normally allowed within the strict limits of LAW , the following may therefore possibly be accepted , having regard to the foregoing considerations and , where applicable , subject to appropriate evidence being produced :", "CARDINAL . certain forenames of mythological origin ( such as ORG , etc . ) ;", "CARDINAL . certain forenames peculiar to local languages of the national territory ( NORP , GPE , NORP , etc . ) ;", "CARDINAL . certain foreign forenames ( such as PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , etc . ) ;", "CARDINAL . certain forenames which correspond to words that have a specific meaning ( such as ORG , PERSON , etc . ) or even old surnames ( such as GPE , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , etc . ) ;", "CARDINAL . compound forenames , provided that they do not include CARDINAL simple names ( such as PERSON or PERSON - GPE but not , for example , PERSON , which would be a combination of CARDINAL forenames ) .", "( c ) Exceptionally , registrars of births , deaths and marriages may also accept , but with some caution :", "CARDINAL . certain diminutives ( such as ' ORG PERSON , ' PERSON ' for PERSON , or even ' Line ' , which is derived from feminine forenames containing that ending ) ;", "CARDINAL . certain shortened forms of double names ( such as ' PERSON ' for PERSON , ' PERSON ' or ' PERSON ' for PERSON , ' PERSON ' for PERSON , ' PERSON ' for PERSON , etc . ) ;", "CARDINAL . certain variations in spelling ( for example PERSON or PERSON , PERSON or PERSON , Ghislaine or PERSON , PERSON or ORG , etc . ) .", "( d ) Ultimately , it would appear that registrars of births , deaths and marriages should only refuse to enter names chosen by parents which have not been demonstrably established as forenames in GPE by sufficiently widespread use . Thus , in particular , registrars should systematically refuse to enter forenames which are purely whimsical or names which , by reason of their nature , meaning or form can not normally constitute forenames ( surnames , names of objects , animals or qualities , words used as stage names or forenames or as pseudonyms , names that are onomatopoeic or recall political events ) .", "( ... ) \"", "In a judgment of DATE ORG stated that \" parents can in particular choose as forenames , subject to the general reservation that , in the child 's interest , they are not found to be ridiculous , names in use in the various calendars ; and while no official list of permitted forenames exists , there is no ground for requiring that the calendar relied on emanate from an official authority \" ( ORG , DATE , PERSON DATE , p.
