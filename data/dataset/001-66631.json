Subsequently , proceedings to enforce the applicant \u2019s obligation were conducted .", "On DATE the applicant requested the Gf\u00f6hl municipality to issue a demolition order for his ORG garage .

As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint about the duration of the proceedings it noted that the proceedings concerning the issuing of the building permit and the proceedings concerning his request for a demolition order were to be regarded separately . The latter proceedings had not yet lasted unreasonably long .", "As to the applicant \u2019s request for a demolition order , the court noted that the report of the inspection of DATE had been duly served on the applicant who had commented thereon . Consequently , the fact that he had not been summoned to participate in the inspection did not constitute a procedural defect . Furthermore , the authority \u2019s finding that the garage \u2019s outer wall was fire - resistant was based on a conclusive expert opinion . Consequently , ORG confirmed ORG view that the garage complied with the building permit . ORG decision was served on DATE .", "In connection with the above proceedings , the applicant conducted CARDINAL sets of proceedings under LAW .", "On DATE the applicant filed an action with ORG , claiming that the NORP municipality had acted unlawfully in that it had failed to summon him to the inspection of DATE and requesting lawyer \u2019s costs incurred for the appeal against the ensuing decision .
