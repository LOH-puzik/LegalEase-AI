Under that Code , the absolute maximum duration of detention , including both in the pre - trial phase of proceedings ( prior to the filing of the bill of indictment ) and during the trial ( after the bill of indictment was lodged ) , was DATE ( LAW ) .

The new Code set new time - limits for the maximum duration of detention as a whole ( LAW ) , and also for detention during the trial ( LAW ) . However , criminal trials where the bill of indictment had been filed prior to DATE and proceedings concerning detention in such trials were to continue to be governed by DATE ORG ( LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . ORG observed that in the applicant \u2019s case the bill of indictment had been filed on DATE and that , consequently , the DATE ORG applied . It held that the offence of which the applicant had been accused fell within the category of \u201c extremely serious crimes \u201d .

Detention in the pre - trial phase of the proceedings and during the trial , taken separately , can last up to CARDINAL of the above periods ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . As regards detention during the trial , the period is to be counted from the moment when the bill of indictment is filed ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . If the detainee faces charges for more offences , the CARDINAL carrying the most severe potential penalty should be used as the basis for determining the maximum permissible duration of the detention ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL) .", "The temporal application of DATE ORG is regulated by the provisions of Articles CARDINAL et seq . As a general rule , proceedings where the bill of indictment was filed prior to the entry into force of the DATE ORG should continue under DATE ORG ( LAW and CARDINAL ) . This includes proceedings in which the duration of and grounds for detention are examined ( LAW ) .", "The provisions on the temporal application of the newly introduced DATE ORG initially gave rise to different interpretations by the benches of ORG . The criminal law section ( kol\u00e9gium ) of ORG therefore adopted a standpoint indicating how LAW and LAW ORG should be interpreted ( case no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , standpoint adopted on DATE and subsequently published in the Collection of standpoints of ORG and decisions of courts , no .

LAW ORG clearly indicated that that had not been the intention of the legislature . That situation did not amount to unequal treatment as the persons concerned had been remanded in detention under a different legal regime , namely that governed by DATE ORG .", "However , both categories of detained persons \u2013 those whose detention was governed by DATE ORG and those detained under the DATE CCP \u2013 should receive equal treatment as regards the duration of their detention during trial after the entry into force of the DATE ORG . In practical terms , the detention during trial of persons falling within the former category in the period after DATE should not last longer than CARDINAL , CARDINAL or DATE , depending on the nature of the offence in issue , as specified in LAW ORG . In that respect those persons were treated equally to the other category of detainees . For example , the detention during trial of persons who had been remanded and indicted , prior to DATE , for offences which the DATE LAW qualified as extremely serious crimes could not exceed DATE as from DATE . Detention of such persons after DATE was therefore not permissible ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
