Until DATE the applicants lived and worked as farmers in the villages of Ku\u015fkonar and ORG , which were located close to each other in a mountainous area within the administrative jurisdiction of the province of \u015e\u0131rnak , in south - east GPE .", "CARDINAL . The events which took place on DATE are disputed by the parties . Thus , the parties\u2019 submissions will be set out separately . The facts as presented by the applicants are set out in Section B below ( paragraphs CARDINAL ) . The Government \u2019s submissions concerning the facts are summarised in Section C below ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The documentary evidence submitted by the parties is summarised in Section D ( paragraphs DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG activity in the area where the applicants\u2019 villages were located was at its peak and frequent armed clashes were taking place between ORG members and the NORP security forces . A number of the surrounding villages whose residents had refused to become village guards were evacuated by the security forces who suspected that those villagers had been providing logistical support to the ORG . Villages whose residents had become village guards , on the other hand , were being subjected to armed attacks by members of the ORG . The applicants and other residents of their CARDINAL villages had refused to become village guards and the security forces believed that the ORG was being assisted by them .", "CARDINAL . The military considered that , so long as the villages in the area continued to exist , their fight against the ORG would not be successful , and carried out a big military operation in order to evacuate the villages forcibly . During the operation almost all the villages in the area were either bombed or set on fire by the soldiers and their residents were forced to flee . The circumstances surrounding the destruction of CARDINAL such village in that particular region were examined by ORG in its judgment in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ) . According to a report prepared by ORG , CARDINAL villages had been evacuated in east and south - east GPE DATE andCARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of CARDINAL DATE most male residents of the applicants\u2019 CARDINAL villages were working in the fields outside the villages . As the weather was sunny , most of the children were playing outside . The women and the elderly were either in their homes or sitting on the terraces outside their houses . When they first heard aircraft flying nearby at TIME they did not get scared because military planes and helicopters often flew in the area for reconnaissance and bombing missions against the ORG on the mountains . Such missions had never caused any damage to the villagers or to their villages . Furthermore , there were no ORG members in the village at the time .", "CARDINAL . DATE , however , military planes and a helicopter circled the applicants\u2019 CARDINAL villages and then started to bomb them . The bombs dropped from the planes were very large ; some villagers described them \u201c as big as a table \u201d . Subsequently , machine gun fire was opened from the helicopter . Some of the people were hit directly and some were trapped under the rubble of the houses that were destroyed in the bombing . Those who survived tried to take cover . The men working in the nearby fields ran to the village and tried to rescue people from underneath the rubble .", "CARDINAL . As a result , CARDINAL people in LOC and CARDINAL people in GPE village lost their lives . Most of those who were killed were children , women or elderly . CARDINAL of the dead , including CARDINAL babies and a number of older children , were the applicants\u2019 close relatives . In addition , a total of CARDINAL people , including some of the applicants , were injured . Most of the houses and livestock belonging to the applicants were also destroyed in the bombing . The names of those killed and their relationship to the applicants , as well as the names of the applicants who were injured , are set out below ( see paragraphs CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The bombing from the aircraft continued in the surrounding areas . Although the local gendarmerie and local prosecutors became aware of the bombing , they did not go to the applicants\u2019 villages to establish the identities of the deceased and to carry out post - mortem examinations . No national authority offered the villagers any help . Villagers from the nearby GPE village went to the applicants\u2019 villages and helped the surviving villagers to take their injured relatives to hospitals in their tractors .", "CARDINAL . The surviving residents of NORP village put the remains of their deceased relatives in plastic bags and buried them in a mass grave without any religious ceremony .", "CARDINAL . As the village of LOC was located close to a main road , the villagers there were able to take the bodies of their relatives to the nearby GPE village and bury them in the cemetery there .", "CARDINAL . After having buried their dead , all surviving villagers quickly abandoned their villages and what was left of their houses and belongings , and moved to different parts of the country . Some of them stayed behind but settled in the nearby GPE village . The applicants\u2019 CARDINAL villages are still uninhabited .", "CARDINAL . When the bombing was widely reported in the national and international media and was condemned by human rights organisations , members of the military exerted pressure on the villagers and warned them not to make official complaints to the judicial authorities . Journalists were prevented from entering the hospitals where the injured were being treated , and from speaking to the villagers . Although it would have been impossible for ORG of another ORG to carry out the bombing , and despite the fact that the ORG could obviously not have any fighter jets in its armoury , the then Prime Minister of GPE PERSON declared that \u201c the military aircraft which bombed the villages did not belong to the State \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , gendarmes questioned the villagers who had resettled in GPE village . Some of the villagers were so traumatised as a result of the bombings and scared in the presence of the gendarmes that they did not tell the gendarmes that their villages had been bombed by military aircraft , but merely referred to the bombing as the \u201c incident \u201d . Some told the gendarmes that \u201c bombs had fallen on [ their ] village but that [ they ] did not want to make any complaints \u201d . The headman of GPE , PERSON , however , informed the PERSON prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE that military aircraft had bombed the villages .", "CARDINAL . Despite the fact that the prosecutors were informed about the incident , and the widespread coverage of the bombings in the media , no investigating authority ever visited the villages or opened any investigations .", "CARDINAL . Even after they appointed a lawyer in DATE and that lawyer made a number of representations on their behalf , no effective investigatory steps were taken by the national authorities . The investigation file was being repeatedly transferred between prosecutors without any active steps being taken .", "CARDINAL . In their observations the Government summarised a number of the steps taken by the national authorities ( which are also summarised below ) , and submitted that the applicants\u2019 villages had been under pressure from ORG members and had subsequently been attacked by the ORG because the villagers had refused to help them . There was no evidence to show any State involvement in the incident and the applicants had made their allegations under the influence of their legal representative .", "CARDINAL .

According to a report prepared by CARDINAL gendarmes on DATE , it had not been possible for the gendarmes to go to LOC village to investigate the \u201c explosion \u201d which had killed CARDINAL and injured CARDINAL persons , because the village had been too far and there had been insufficient gendarmes and vehicles at their disposal .", "CARDINAL .

He thus forwarded the case files to the military prosecutor \u2019s office at the CARDINALnd ORG in ORG .", "CARDINAL .

After having received the response from DATE ORG in GPE , the military prosecutor concluded on DATE that there was no evidence to support the ORG allegations that their villages had been bombed by military aircraft .

In support of his decision the military prosecutor also referred to the statements taken from some of the applicants by the PERSON prosecutor , in which those applicants had stated that they did not know what type of aircraft had bombed their villages ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The military prosecutor also rejected the ORG requests for copies of all the documents from his investigation file to be handed over to their lawyer .

The applicants also argued that the military prosecutor , by referring to some of the applicants\u2019 inability to identify the aircraft as belonging to the NORP military ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and QUANTITY above ) , had unjustly implied that the bombing could have been carried out by foreign aircraft . The applicants also noted that the military prosecutor \u2019s implications had been shared by the then Prime Minister of GPE , PERSON . The applicants questioned the logic behind those implications , and argued that explanations were needed as to how a number of aircraft belonging to another State would be able to penetrate NORP airspace , bomb villages , and then leave NORP airspace undetected .", "CARDINAL . Another military prosecutor , who forwarded to the military court his opinion on the objection lodged by the applicants , noted that the villages had never been visited by any civilian investigating authority to verify the ORG allegations or to search for evidence .

The PERSON prosecutor sent a letter to the prosecutor \u2019s office in GPE on DATE , and stated that the allegations of the villagers concerning an aerial bombardment of their villages showed that the incident , \u201c even if it was caused by another ORG or by illegal organisations \u201d , was not an ordinary incident . In the opinion of the PERSON prosecutor the ORG prosecutor had jurisdiction to continue the investigation , and he sent him the case files .", "CARDINAL .
