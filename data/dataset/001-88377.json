When the police officers gave chase , the applicant had thrown stones at them and had kicked and punched them , injuring CARDINAL of them in the process . Consequently , the officers had taken the applicant to the police station .", "CARDINAL .

Considering that the applicant \u2019s \u201c refusal to wipe away the writing on the wall and his attacks on the police officers \u201d amounted to a \u201c provocation \u201d , within the meaning of LAW , the trial court reduced the prison sentences by DATE and sentenced each officer to DATE and CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment .

Since , under NORP law , ill - treatment could only be classified as torture if it was inflicted with the aim of extracting information from the victim ( the offence defined in Article CARDINAL of LAW ) , the trial court had no choice but to apply LAW in the present case .
