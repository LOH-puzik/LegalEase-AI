On DATE ORG decided to recognise the applicant \u2019s ownership right in respect of the building and to leave the plot of land under his use . ORG found that the building in question had no registered owners and the applicant had openly and in good faith had it in his possession and used it without interruption for DATE , which entitled him to become its owner under LAW .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was lodged within the prescribed CARDINAL-day time - limit , so this judgment became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a certificate was issued by the local branch of ORG on the basis of this judgment , confirming the applicant \u2019s ownership in respect of the building . The certificate further stated that , by virtue of LAW ( ORG ) , the applicant enjoyed a right of lease in respect of the plot of land for a period of DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant regularly paid property tax on both the building and the plot of land in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE \u0430 topographic examination of the land was carried out by a representative of \u201c ORG founded by , and acting on behalf of , ORG . The relevant diagram mentioned the applicant as the owner of the land in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a third person addressed a letter to ORG , stating that she had bought a plot of land at an auction held on DATE . When she later applied to the local branch of ORG to have her ownership right registered , she was informed that the plot of land in question overlapped with the neighbouring plot of land . She requested that the auction be cancelled in its part concerning the overlapping part of the plot , the money paid for that part be returned and a new sale contract be concluded in respect of the remaining part of her plot .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged that the neighbouring plot of land was the applicant \u2019s and that following this letter there was an exchange of correspondence between ORG and the local branch of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local branch of ORG addressed a letter to ORG stating , in reply to an inquiry by the Mayor dated DATE , that the registration of the applicant \u2019s ownership and lease rights had been performed on DATE on the basis of the judgment of ORG of GPE of DATE . This letter was received by ORG on DATE and attached to it was a copy of the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General lodged an appeal against the judgment of DATE seeking to quash it and to dismiss the applicant \u2019s acquisitive prescription claim , arguing that ORG had erred in its interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the substantive law . The land had belonged to the ORG and hence had not been ownerless at the material time , so ORG should not have applied the acquisitive prescription rules to the case . As a result , the judgment had damaged the ORG \u2019s pecuniary interests . The Deputy Prosecutor General further argued that ORG had been obliged to involve , as parties to the proceedings , the local branch of ORG , as well as ORG as the authority vested with management of land . By failing to do so , and adopting a judgment affecting their rights in their absence , ORG had also violated the procedural law . The Deputy Prosecutor General requested ORG to restore the expired time - limit for appeal , arguing that ORG had not been aware of the judgment of DATE and therefore had been deprived of the possibility of lodging an appeal , while ORG had been informed about that judgment by the Mayor \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Yerevan ORG also lodged an appeal against the judgment of DATE , raising similar substantive and procedural arguments . As regards the procedural issues , it claimed that ORG had violated the relevant provisions by examining the case through special proceedings and not involving it as a party , despite the fact that ORG was the authority vested with management of public land in GPE and therefore the judgment affected its rights . ORG further claimed that it had become aware of the contested judgment by a letter from the local branch of ORG dated DATE , which had been received by ORG on DATE . It finally added that the letter of ORG of GPE of DATE had been accompanied by a copy of another judgment of ORG , dated DATE , which was unrelated to the present case .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant lodged a reply to the appeals . He argued , inter alia , that on DATE he had paid the cadastral value of the plot of land and bought it through direct sale . Furthermore , the fact that ORG had been aware of his becoming the new owner of the plot of land was confirmed by the compulsory payments he had to make for that property . Thus , on the one hand , by virtue of LAW ORG , the GPE Mayor \u2019s office had alienated the plot of land to him , received a sum of money and since then had continued to levy property tax and , on the other hand , it now claimed to be unaware of that transaction . Moreover , ORG had been notified of his becoming the new owner of the plot of land by virtue of the PERSON on LAW in Respect of Property . Hence , ORG had been aware of the registration of his property rights on the basis of the court judgment of DATE and of the direct sale of the plot of land , and had not \u2013 as it claimed DATE become aware of that judgment from a letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided , with reference to LAW ORG ) , to admit the appeals , stating :", "\u201c ORG and ORG have missed the timelimit for appeal prescribed by law and they submitted motions seeking to find this to be valid , arguing that ORG found out about the judgment [ of DATE ] from a copy of the judgment attached to the letter of ORG of GPE of DATE , while ORG from the letter of ORG of DATE .", "...", "The court finds that the motions of ORG and ORG are substantiated and must be granted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to grant the appeals , to quash the judgment of DATE and to dismiss the applicant \u2019s acquisitive prescription claim . ORG found , in particular , that ORG had applied Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , which were not applicable to the case , and failed to apply LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG , thereby reaching incorrect findings . The building in question was an unauthorised construction built on a plot of land belonging to the ORG . Hence , only the ORG could have acquired ownership rights in respect of that building .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to return the appeal as inadmissible for lack of merit .", "CARDINAL . Following these decisions , the authorities instituted proceedings against the applicant seeking annulment of registration of his ownership rights in respect of the building and the plot of land , which was granted by the courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
