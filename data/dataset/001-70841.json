{"ITEMID": "001-70841", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF BADER AND KANBOR v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 2;Violation of Art. 3", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE respectively and are currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . They arrived in GPE on DATE and applied to ORG ( Migrationsverket ) for asylum on DATE . The first applicant submitted that he was of NORP origin , NORP , and had lived with his family and worked in GPE ( GPE ) since DATE . He claimed that in DATE he and CARDINAL of his brothers had been arrested by the NORP security police and imprisoned in GPE ( GPE ) for DATE because the police wanted information about another brother who had absconded while performing military service in DATE . He further alleged that he had been tortured and ill - treated in prison and had only been released after being hospitalised as a result of the ill - treatment . After his release , he returned to GPE to stay with his family . DATE he was arrested CARDINAL times by the security police , questioned about his brother 's whereabouts and beaten . However , on each occasion , he was released after DATE . In DATE the applicants moved to GPE , where they remained until they left GPE in DATE .", "The applicants stated that they had left GPE legally , flying from GPE to GPE and then on to GPE . They had travelled using their own passports but had destroyed them upon their arrival in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the family 's application for asylum and their request for residence permits and ordered their deportation to GPE . It noted , firstly , that the general situation of NORP in GPE was not such as to satisfy the requirements for asylum since , inter alia , NORP who were NORP nationals had the same rights as all other citizens . Moreover , the majority of the population in GPE were NORP . ORG then found that the applicants had not shown that they risked persecution if they were sent back to GPE . It observed that , except for the first occasion in DATE , the first applicant had been released shortly after each interrogation by the security police . Moreover , as the interrogations had concerned his brother and not himself , ORG considered that he was not personally in need of protection . In this connection , it noted that the first applicant had not been able to explain why his brother had left the army or why the security police was so interested in him . ORG also observed that the applicants had left GPE legally .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , relying on the same grounds as they had before ORG and adding that NORP were being persecuted and discriminated against in GPE . They also claimed that they had paid CARDINAL United States dollars for false passports which they had subsequently discarded . Furthermore , the second applicant had been admitted to an emergency psychiatric clinic for DATE in DATE owing to panic attacks .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the same grounds as ORG , stating that the new reasons advanced by the applicants did not alter the position . The deportation order was also upheld .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently lodged a new application with ORG which was rejected on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Further , during DATE , ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON convicted the first applicant of threatening behaviour against his DATE daughter and a neighbour . It gave him a suspended sentence and made an order for his deportation from GPE . However , he appealed to ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and PERSON , which on DATE upheld the conviction and the suspended sentence but quashed the deportation order as it did not consider that the offence in itself merited deportation .", "CARDINAL . On account of ORG decision on deportation , the police authorities had begun preparations to enforce it . In that connection , the NORP embassy in GPE ascertained that the applicants had left GPE legally on DATE using their own passports but had in fact travelled via GPE , not GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the family lodged a new application for asylum to ORG and requested a stay of execution of the deportation order . They referred to a judgment that had been delivered on DATE by ORG in GPE which stated that the first applicant had been convicted , in absentia , of complicity in a murder and sentenced to death pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted a stay of execution of the deportation order against the applicants until further notice and requested them to submit an original of the judgment and other relevant documents in support of their application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted to ORG a certified copy of the judgment in which it was stated that the first applicant and his brother had , on several occasions , threatened their brother - in - law because they considered that he had ill - treated their sister and paid too small a dowry , thereby dishonouring their family . In DATE the first applicant 's brother had shot the brother - in - law , after planning the murder with the first applicant , who had provided the weapon . The NORP court , which noted that the CARDINAL brothers had absconded , found them guilty of the charges and sentenced them to death . They were also ordered to pay QUANTITY to the victim 's family and were deprived of their civil rights and all their assets were frozen . The first applicant was also charged with unlawfully possessing a military firearm , a charge which the NORP court had instructed the military prosecutor to proceed with . Lastly , the court went on to state : \u201c [ T]his judgment has been delivered in the accused 's absence . [ It ] can be reopened . \u201d It would appear that the judgment has gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also submitted some further documents concerning the proceedings in GPE , including a summons dated DATE requiring the first applicant to present himself before the court within DATE , failing which he would forfeit his civil rights and the control of his assets . The first applicant claimed that he had not been involved in the murder as he had been in GPE at the material time . He also explained that he had , in fact , spent DATE in custody in DATE on suspicion of complicity in the murder and had been released on bail on DATE . He insisted that he had not mentioned this before because it concerned the family 's honour and his sister 's humiliation . The applicant was represented by a lawyer in GPE whose contact details had been provided to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the NORP embassy in GPE to verify whether the judgment was authentic and , if so , whether it was possible to appeal or to have the case reopened . They further enquired if a reprieve was possible and whether death sentences were normally carried out in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the NORP embassy in GPE informed ORG that a local lawyer ( f\u00f6rtroendeadvokat ) they had engaged had confirmed that the judgment was authentic . He had also carried out research into the NORP criminal law on sentences for murder and manslaughter , the results of which were attached to the embassy 's letter .", "CARDINAL . NORP The embassy provided the following information in their letter to ORG . According to the local lawyer it was probable ( sannolikt ) that the case would be retried in court once the accused were located and it would then be very likely ( troligt ) that new witnesses would be called and the entire case reheard . Further , the fact that a case was \u201c honour related \u201d was usually considered a mitigating factor leading to a lighter sentence . The embassy said that the lawyer had also stated that it was not unusual for the NORP courts to impose the maximum sentence possible when an accused failed to appear for trial after being summoned to do so . It added that , according to their sources , it appeared that the accused had to be present in person in order to obtain a retrial . In this respect , the NORP judicial system was marked by considerable ( betydande ) arbitrariness and the death sentence was carried out for serious crimes such as murder . However , every execution had to be approved by the President . The embassy had no reliable information about how frequently death sentences were enforced as they were normally carried out without any public scrutiny or accountability . However , the local lawyer had claimed that it was very rare for the death sentence to be imposed at all by the NORP courts DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the information provided by the embassy , the applicants initially noted that the first applicant was wanted in GPE under the judgment . They then observed that the local lawyer had only given his own opinion on the matter and on what he considered was likely to happen . However , there were no guarantees that the case would be reopened or that the outcome would be different . They also stated that it would now be very difficult for the first applicant to find any witnesses to testify on his behalf and that , since the murdered man 's family was very wealthy , they would be able to bribe the prosecutor and witnesses and , for that matter , the judge . The first applicant alleged that the murdered man had not been his brother - in - law , contrary to what had been stated in the NORP judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but that the man 's family had relied on forged documents before the NORP court , stating that the first applicant 's sister had been married to him . Thus , the murder was considered to be of the most serious kind . Furthermore , the fact that the first applicant was of NORP origin would also expose him to discrimination by the court and possibly to a harsher sentence . The applicants argued that , in view of the fact that the NORP legal system was arbitrary and corrupt , they had a well - founded fear that the first applicant would be executed if he were returned to GPE and that the family would thereby be destroyed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to one , rejected the applicants ' request for asylum . The majority considered , on the basis of the local lawyer 's research , that it had been established that , if the first applicant returned to GPE , the case against him would be reopened and he would receive a full retrial , at the end of which , if convicted , he would be given a sentence other than death , as the case was \u201c honour related \u201d . Under those circumstances , the majority found that the applicants did not have a well - founded fear and were thus not in need of protection .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting member of ORG considered that , having regard to all the facts of the case , the applicants did have a well - founded fear that the first applicant would be executed if returned to GPE and the family should therefore be granted residence permits in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the ORG 's indication under LAW , ORG granted a stay of execution of the deportation order until further notice . The stay is still in force .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are to be found in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , CARDINAL ) . An alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section QUANTITY ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who is unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail him- or herself of protection in that country . This applies irrespective of whether or not persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country , if the authorities can not be relied on to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because he or she has a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .", "CARDINAL . In addition , when it comes to enforcing a decision to refuse entry to or to deport an alien , regard must be had to the risk of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on bars to enforcement ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds ( sk\u00e4lig anledning ) for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , a person convicted of intentionally killing another person will be sentenced to capital punishment .", "CARDINAL . In its Concluding Observations on the third periodic report by GPE under LAW ( ORG , dated DATE ) , ORG expressed its concern about the nature and number of offences which carried the death penalty in GPE . It was further \u201c deeply concerned at the de facto reinstitution of death sentences and executions in DATE \u201d and noted that GPE had submitted insufficient information relating to the numbers of persons whose death sentences had been commuted , and the number of persons awaiting execution .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG Reports DATE : GPE ) , the NORP authorities had , on DATE , announced that CARDINAL people had been executed in DATE and CARDINAL in DATE . Moreover , on DATE , it was reported that CARDINAL persons had been executed in GPE , but no further details had been made public ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
