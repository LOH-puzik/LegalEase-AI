The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE ( Messrs. PERSON and PERSON ) and B\u0159eclav ( Mr GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicants were employed by ORG on the border with GPE . On DATE , pursuant to Article CARDINALe of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) an undercover police agent infiltrated the team of customs officers . As a result of her observations over DATE , the customs officers were suspected of corruption , namely taking bribes from truck drivers in exchange for granting priority or trouble - free customs clearance . The undercover agent left ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During DATE and DATE testimony was taken in the presence of a judge from CARDINAL truck drivers from different countries in accordance with the provisions of LAW ORG , that is to say this step was taken as an urgent or non - repeatable measure ( neodkladn\u00fd nebo neopakovateln\u00fd \u00fakon ) . The records show that the NORP testimonies were similar . According to the applicants , interviews with CARDINAL of the drivers were of decisive significance . CARDINAL of them were of NORP nationality and one of them was a NORP citizen . The applicants , being not yet charged , were not present at these interviews .", "CARDINAL . Witness I.P.D. testified that it was common practice for the customs officers to ask drivers for documents and to check whether there was some money enclosed . If not , the drivers had to wait for TIME to be cleared . He admitted that he had paid bribes on CARDINAL or CARDINAL occasions but he could not remember individual customs officers .", "Witness PERSON testified that he had always had to pay MONEY ( ORG ) in order to avoid inconvenience during customs clearance .

On DATE the applicants were charged , together with CARDINAL other individuals , with abuse of the authority of public official and accepting bribes . In DATE they were officially indicted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( okresn\u00ed soud ) heard the police agent as an anonymous witness ( utajen\u00fd sv\u011bdek ) under the provisions of LAW and LAW ORG . She gave her testimony outside the courtroom using an audio streaming device . She did not recount any specific case of the acceptance of a bribe , stating only that her reports and the information therein were fully reliable . The third applicant was present at the hearing . He was represented by a defence counsel . The other CARDINAL applicants were absent and were represented by a substitute defence counsel . CARDINAL applicant put a question to the anonymous witness .", "In the course of the trial , the applicants argued that the agent would have been unable to see any other customs officers from her work - station , that none of the alleged acts had been filmed by the cameras installed at their workplace , and that the ORG numbered rubber stamps could have been used by other people .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicants and other accused persons guilty as charged . They were sentenced to DATE imprisonment suspended for CARDINAL years\u2019 probation and were fined . The court established the factual background to the body of evidence . The agent \u2019s written report constituted directly incriminating evidence . The court further relied on customs documents stamped using the personal rubber stamps of specific customs officers , comparing these with the testimony of the truck drivers , the records of service rotations and the database linking the applicants to the times at which the interviewed truck drivers obtained their customs clearance . ORG stated :", "\u201c As regards the defendant PERSON , he is incriminated by the relevant documentary evidence referring to counts CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the indictment and counts CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the indictment , from which it is apparent that he used a rubber stamp with the number CARDINAL and that his personal number was DATE , these numbers appearing on the relevant documents . When it comes to counts CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the indictment , he is also incriminated by the witness statements of the NORP driver [ NORP ] and the NORP driver [ GPE ] who , according to their records , passed the border crossing point at the time in question , and their papers and travel documents bear the respective numbers of the defendant PERSON . The above fully corresponds to the report from the defendant \u2019s employer regarding the placement of the defendant , i.e. where \u2012 that is to say at which work - station \u2012 he was positioned at the time concerned . As to counts CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the indictment , the defendant PERSON is also incriminated by a police officer of GPE who saw the defendant accepting a bribe and recorded this fact in the corresponding document , produced in evidence , which also corresponds with the testimony of the undercover agent given before the court .", "As regards the defendant PERSON , he is incriminated by the documentary evidence produced as regards counts CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the indictment , specifically the control sheets showing his personal number DATE and rubber stamp number CARDINAL . He is also incriminated by the testimony of the NORP driver [ GPE ] and by a report from his former employer stating the defendant \u2019s whereabouts at the time concerned . As to count CARDINAL of the indictment , the defendant PERSON is also incriminated by the undercover police agent of GPE who saw the defendant accepting a bribe .", "As regards the defendant PERSON , he is incriminated on counts CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the indictment by the documentary evidence produced , especially by control sheets which were stamped with his personal number and also by other use made of his personal number , as is apparent in the corresponding computer records . He is also incriminated by the witness statement of [ GPE ] , who submitted details of his border crossing to the authorities and notes of bribes given at a specific time and place . As to count CARDINAL of the indictment in relation to the defendant PERSON , the witness stated that on DATE he gave a bribe at a particular time and \u2012 by checking the driver and the documentation relating to his border crossing \u2012 it was established who had cleared him and who had stamped his documents , from which it is clearly apparent that it was the defendant PERSON who carried out the administrative measures concerned and hence received the bribe . As to count CARDINAL of the indictment , PERSON is also mentioned in the anonymous agent \u2019s report . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG explained that the truck drivers\u2019 statements were read out at the hearing pursuant to LAW b ) of the ORG . The drivers had been interviewed in the presence of a judge during the pre - trial stage of the proceedings , because it had been deemed necessary to take the step of obtaining their testimonies as an urgent or non - repeatable measure since they were foreign nationals and it would have been almost impossible for the court to reach them at a later stage . The undercover police agent was heard as an anonymous witness pursuant to LAW ORG because of her potential future activities .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the judgment . They firstly argued that the truck drivers could have been questioned under the corresponding international treaties \u2012 namely ORG and bilateral treaties on mutual judicial assistance with GPE ( treaty of DATE ) and GPE ( treaty of DATE ) \u2012 and that they could have been granted immunity in exchange for testifying . They also contested the legal grounds and the necessity for the non - disclosure of the identity of the undercover police agent . According to them , she did not risk bodily harm or any other danger of interference with her fundamental rights as required by LAW ORG . The argument about her future activities was not sufficient justification . Moreover , the delays between the questions asked at trial and her replies implied that she had had with her some notes or someone whom she had consulted about her answers before replying .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( krajsk\u00fd soud ) rejected the ORG appeal as unsubstantiated , arguing as follows :", "\u201c ( ... ) the hearing of an undercover police agent as a witness is in practice exceptional , occurring only in the particular circumstances of a specific case and in the interests of proper clarification and vindication of particularly serious criminal actions and the conviction of the perpetrators thereof . In such circumstances , and when such an agent is heard as a witness , LAW , LAW , and LAW ORG would be applicable . In the instant case , the provisions of the ORG regulating the agent \u2019s testimony were not violated and the allegations of some of the defendants that the agent had been heard as an anonymous witness in order to allow her to consult her notes or another person are unsubstantiated . The first - instance court had no doubts about the agent \u2019s reliability as a witness . She reliably described how she had obtained the information about the criminal activity of the accused and how she had evaluated , recorded and processed it ( ... )", "Under LAW of the ORG , a non - repeatable measure is a measure which can not be repeated before the trial court . Questioning a witness who is a foreign national or stateless person without a permanent residence permit in GPE can be considered to be this kind of measure . None of the witnesses had a link to GPE of the kind which could have justified the conclusion that they would remain in the country or appear if summoned . The witnesses merely pass through the territory in the course of their work as truck drivers . The interviews with these witnesses were conducted in accordance with the provisions of LAW . The allegations of the defendants that the witnesses did not even know the content of the records they had signed , and that they had been forced to testify and promised immunity if they stated particular facts , are not substantiated by the case file , and no other facts corroborating these allegations have been ascertained . It is apparent from the file that the truck drivers were questioned in the presence of an interpreter and in the presence of judges of ORG ( ... ) . Under LAW ORG , a judge who performs the urgent or nonrepeatable measure of examining a witness or in an identity parade also bears responsibility for the legality thereof . \"", "CARDINAL . The applicants filed a constitutional appeal alleging a violation of LAW and CARDINAL d ) of the LAW and complaining about the depositions of the truck drivers and the anonymous witness .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the constitutional appeal as manifestly ill - founded . It stated that the complaints raised at the previous instances had been properly addressed and that the courts had provided sufficient justification to show that the evidence had been obtained in accordance with the provisions of the ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
