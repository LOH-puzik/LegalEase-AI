They were represented before the ORG by Dr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Dr PERSON , Attorney General .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Background", "The first applicant married PERSON , a NORP citizen , on DATE according to the rites of ORG and in conformity with NORP law .", "In DATE she went to GPE . She converted to ORG by means of a declaration . As a result of this declaration the first marriage was deemed to be null and void and consequently she was given permission by a NORP court to marry under the law of GPE .", "On DATE she married the second applicant , according to the rites of ORG . The applicants settled in GPE where they established their matrimonial domicile and lived there , lawfully married , for DATE .", "In DATE the first applicant went to ORG in GPE and filled in an application requesting registration of her wish to revert to her maiden name , in accordance with LAW . She did not inform ORG that she had divorced PERSON or that she had obtained an annulment of that marriage . On DATE the applicant \u2019s request was granted .", "In DATE the applicants returned to GPE to take care of the first applicant \u2019s father . The first applicant made several attempts to register her new marriage under LAW ( see Relevant domestic law ) in accordance with the principle of lex loci contractus . This registration would have allowed the second applicant to reside in GPE without the need for a visa . It would have granted him the status of an exempt person under LAW on the basis that he lived with and was married to a NORP national .", "The first applicant based her requests on a document dated DATE and DATE , issued by ORG . According to this document , her previous marriage had been declared null and void upon her conversion to ORG and her marriage to a NORP man .", "However , the Director of ORG refused to register the marriage . The first applicant had failed to prove that she had legally released herself from the obligations of her first marriage by providing a court decision demonstrating that it had been annulled or that she had divorced and that her second marriage had not been polygamous , and therefore contrary to NORP public policy . Moreover , she had failed in the alternative to prove that she was domiciled in GPE since she had retained her NORP citizenship and had indeed returned to GPE after DATE .", "She was informed that it was necessary for her to prove that , before contracting her second marriage , she had been released from her previous marriage in accordance with the provisions of NORP law regarding capacity to marry ( see section CARDINAL ( b ) of LAW ) . She was therefore advised to produce the exequatur of a NORP court ordering the Director of ORG to register the alleged annulment or divorce obtained , thus allowing him to register her second marriage .", "In the meantime the first applicant \u2019s father passed away in DATE . However , the applicants remained in GPE to take care of the first applicant \u2019s mother . Meanwhile , the second applicant \u2019s visa was renewed on a concessionary basis .", "On DATE the applicants instituted proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction . Invoking Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , they claimed that the refusal to register their marriage amounted to a breach of their rights and that NORP marriage law discriminated against ORG . They argued that marriages celebrated anywhere according to the rites of ORG were easily recognised , but not marriages contracted under other religions . Similarly , any annulment of a marriage by ORG ( including the dispensation of the Holy Pontiff and the \u201c LOC \u201d ) was endorsed for NORP under NORP law .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claims for non - exhaustion of ordinary remedies as the first applicant had not brought an action before ORG in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW to prove that her first marriage was null and void . However , the court considered the complaints manifestly ill - founded since she had failed to prove her domicile , which was necessary for CARDINAL of LAW to apply . She was a citizen of GPE and NORP law did not recognise divorce on religious grounds . Indeed , under LAW of LAW , a decision declaring a NORP marriage null and void was not automatically registered . In particular , one of the prerequisites was the participation of the spouses during the proceedings . However , in the present case PERSON was totally unaware of any proceedings . Moreover , it was for the national legislation to lay down rules regarding the validity of marriages in pursuance of the ORG \u2019s public policy , and , therefore , no violation of LAW arise in the present case . Lastly , the court noted that the applicants had failed to prove that they had suffered discrimination vis a vis someone in an analogous situation on one of the grounds mentioned in LAW .", "The applicants appealed . By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the appeal in part . While revoking the part of the judgment dismissing the merits , it reaffirmed that the applicants had failed to make use of the ordinary remedy provided by law , namely instituting proceedings before ORG in its ordinary jurisdiction , which could have ordered the registration of the marriage if the requisite criteria had been fulfilled .", "On DATE PERSON , the applicant \u2019s first husband , passed away . On the basis that there were no longer any impediments to the first applicant \u2019s remarriage the applicants attempted to obtain a marriage licence in GPE in order to remarry there . To proceed with such a licence they allegedly were requested to provide proof of a divorce in respect of their marriage contracted in GPE .", "In accordance with LAW , LAW of LAW , any marriage of a citizen of GPE drawn up or registered in a foreign country by a competent authority in that country , may , at the request of any interested person and upon the Director of ORG being satisfied of the authenticity of such act , be registered in LOC .", "In this respect , LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The Director shall not receive any act which is not written in clear and legible characters , or which contains abbreviations , or which may appear to him to be otherwise defective or irregular .", "( CARDINAL ) In any such case , the act shall be presented by the Director to CARDINAL of the Visitors of notarial acts , who , after hearing , if necessary , the person who had made the act , shall determine the manner in which , according to law , the act is to be drawn up .", "( CARDINAL ) The Director may not refuse to receive any act which is countersigned by CARDINAL of the said Visitors . \u201d", "LAW \u201c LAW \u201d ) , LAW of LAW , applies to all marriages whether contracted in a civil or religious form .
