Refah \u2019s representatives further rejected ORG argument that the party was a \u201c centre \u201d of activities which undermined the secular nature of the Republic . They submitted that PERSON was not caught by the criteria laid down in the PERSON on the regulation of political parties for determining whether a political party constituted a \u201c centre of activities contrary to LAW .

NORP The ORG representatives alleged that in accusing PERSON of supporting the use of force to achieve political ends and of infringing the principle of secularism the prosecuting authorities had merely cited extracts from his speeches which they had distorted and taken out of context .

On DATE ORG filed his observations on the merits of the case with ORG . He submitted that according to the LAW and the case - law of the NORP courts on constitutional law issues nothing obliged GPE to tolerate the existence of political parties that sought the destruction of democracy and the rule of law . He contended that ORG , by describing itself as an army engaged in a jihad and by openly declaring its intention to replace the Republic \u2019s statute law by sharia , had demonstrated that its objectives were incompatible with the requirements of a democratic society . PERSON \u2019s aim to establish a plurality of legal systems ( in which each group would be governed by a legal system in conformity with its members\u2019 religious beliefs ) constituted the first stage in the process designed to substitute a theocratic regime for the Republic .", "CARDINAL . In their observations on the merits of the case ORG representatives again argued that the dissolution of their party could not be grounded on any of the restrictions permitted by the second paragraph of LAW . They went on to say that LAW was not applicable in the case , as Refah had nothing in common with political parties which sought to instal a totalitarian regime . Furthermore , the plurality of legal systems which it proposed was actually intended to promote the freedom to enter into contracts and the freedom to choose which court should have jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , referring to LAW , ruled that the second paragraph of LAW on the regulation of political parties was unconstitutional and declared it null and void .

In its judgment ORG first dismissed the preliminary objections raised by GPE . In that connection it held that the parliamentary immunity of the MPs whose remarks had been mentioned in ORG submissions of CARDINAL DATE had nothing to do with consideration of an application for the dissolution of a political party and temporary forfeiture by its members of certain political rights , but was a question of the criminal responsibility of the MPs concerned , which was not a matter of constitutional law .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the merits , ORG held that while polutical parties were the main protagonists of democratic politics their activities were not exempt from certain restrictions . In particular , activities by them incompatible with the rule of law could not be tolerated . ORG referred to the provisions of the LAW which imposed respect for secularism on the various organs of political power . It also cited the numerous provisions of domestic legislation requiring political parties to apply the principle of secularism in a number of fields of political and social life . ORG observed that secularism was CARDINAL of the indispensable conditions of democracy . In GPE the principle of secularism was safeguarded by the LAW , on account of the country \u2019s historical experience and the specific features of ORG . The democratic regime was incompatible with the rules of sharia . The principle of secularism prevented the ORG from manifesting a preference for a particular religion or belief and constituted the foundation of freedom of conscience and equality between citizens before the law . Intervention by the ORG to preserve the secular nature of the political regime had to be considered necessary in a NORP society .", "CARDINAL .

That finding was supported by various rulings of ORG and ORG and by the case - law of ORG on applications nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL concerning the wearing of headscarves at universities .", "- The plurality of legal systems proposed by ORG was nothing to do with the freedom to enter into contracts as PERSON claimed , but was an attempt to establish a distinction between citizens on the ground of their religion and beliefs and was aimed at the installation of a theocratic regime . On DATE Mr Erbakan had made the following speech to ORG :", "\u201c ... \u2018 you shall live in a manner compatible with your beliefs\u2019 . We want despotism to be abolished . There must be several legal systems . The citizen must be able to choose for himself which legal system is most appropriate for him , within a framework of general principles . Moreover , that has always been the case throughout our history . In our history there have been various religious movements . Everyone lived according to the legal rules of his own organisation , and so everyone lived in peace . Why , then , should I be obliged to live according to another \u2019s rules ? ... The right to choose one \u2019s own legal system is an integral part of the freedom of religion . \u201d", "In addition , Mr Erbakan had spoken as follows on DATE at a FAC party conference :", "\u201c ... We shall guarantee all human rights . We shall guarantee to everyone the right to live as he sees fit and to choose the legal system he prefers . We shall free the administration from centralism . The ORG which you have installed is a repressive ORG , not a ORG at the people \u2019s service . You do not allow the freedom to choose one \u2019s code of law . When we are in power a NORP will be able to get married before the mufti , if he wishes , and a NORP will be able to marry in church , if he prefers . \u201d", "- The plurality of legal systems advocated by Mr Erbakan in his speeches had its origin in the practice introduced in DATE of ORG by the \u201c GPE \u201d , which had given the NORP and polytheist communities the right to live according to their own legal systems , not according to NORP law . On the basis of ORG some NORP thinkers and politicians had proposed a model of peaceful co - existence under which each religious group would be free to choose its own legal system . Since the foundation of the PERSON party in DATE ( dissolved by LAW DATE ) Mr Erbakan had been seeking to replace the single legal system with a plurality of legal systems and thus destroy legislative and judicial unity , which were preconditions for secularism and the consciousness of nationhood .", "- In addition , Mr Erbakan had made a speech on DATE to the FAC group in parliament in which he had advocated setting up a theocratic regime , if necessary through force :", "\u201c The second important point is this : PERSON will come to power and a just [ social ] order ( adil d\u00fczen ) will be established . The question we must ask ourselves is whether this change will be violent or peaceful ; whether it will entail bloodshed .

The CARDINAL [ citizens ] must make up their minds on that point . \u201d", "- The reception given by ORG at the Prime Minister \u2019s residence to the leaders of the various religious movements , who had attended in vestments denoting their religious allegiance , clearly evidenced PERSON \u2019s chairman \u2019s support for these religious groups vis - \u00e0 - vis public opinion .", "- In a public speech in DATE PERSON , MP for the province of PERSON , had issued a clear call to wage a holy war ( jihad ) and had argued for the introduction of NORP law , making the following declaration :", "\u201c We shall certainly call to account those who turn their backs on the precepts of the Koran and those who deprive Allah \u2019s messenger of his jurisdiction in their country . \u201d", "In another public speech , also in DATE , PERSON had said :", "\u201c In the hereafter you will be summoned with the leaders you have chosen in this life . ...

None of that is part of the chapter on jihad but of that on the amel - i PERSON ( peacetime activities ) . Jihad is the name given to the quest for power for the advent of justice , for the propagation of justice and for glorification of ORG \u2019s Word . Allah did not see that task as an abstract political concept ; he made it a requirement for warriors ( cahudi ) . What does that mean ? That jihad must be waged by an army ! The commander is identified ... The condition to be met before prayer ( namaz ) is the islamisation of power . Allah says that , before mosques , it is the path of power which must be NORP ... It is not erecting vaulted ceilings in the places of prayer which will lead you to LOC . For Allah does not ask whether you have built up vaulted ceilings in this country . He will not ask that . He will ask you if you have reached a sufficient level ... DATE , if NORP have CARDINAL books , they must give thirty to the Koranic schools , to train our children , girls and boys , and the CARDINAL remaining books must be given to the political establishments which open the road to power . Allah asked all his prophets to fight for power . You can not name a single member of a religious movement who does not fight for power . I tell you , if I had as many heads as I have hairs on my head , even if each of those heads were to be torn from my shoulders for following the way of the Koran , I would not abandon my cause ... The question Allah will ask you is this : \u2018 Why , in the time of the blasphemous regime , did you not work for the construction of an NORP ORG and his friends want to bring ORG to this country in the form of a political party . The prosecutor understood that clearly . If we could understand that as he did , the problem would be solved . Even PERSON the NORP has realised that in this country the symbol of NORP is PERSON . He who incites the NORP community ( cemaat ) to take up arms before political power is in NORP hands is a fool , or a traitor doing the bidding of others . For none of the prophets authorised war before the capture of State power . ... NORP are intelligent . They do not reveal how they intend to beat their enemy . The general staff gives orders and the soldiers obey . If the general staff reveals its plan , it is up to the commanders of the NORP community to make a new plan .
