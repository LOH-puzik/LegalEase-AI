THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;No separate issue under Art. 14 +P1-1 or P1-1;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Giovanni Bonello;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristaq Traja;Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s birth certificate , she is male . She served in the army for DATE from DATE and then worked as a police officer . Aged CARDINAL , she gave up attempting to live as a man , and had gender reassignment surgery DATE . She has presented as a woman since DATE , is identified as a woman on her ORG card and paid contributions to the ORG scheme at the female rate ( until DATE , when the difference in rates was abolished ) . In DATE she became self - employed and started paying into a private pension fund .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the applicant applied to the local government benefits office for State pension payments . She wished these to commence on DATE , her CARDINALth birthday . Her application was refused by a decision of ORG issued on DATE . He stated that she had applied \u201c too early \u201d , and was only entitled to a State pension from DATE , the retirement age applicable to men .", "CARDINAL . Her appeal against this decision was heard by ORG on DATE , which dismissed it on the basis of established case - law . At this time she claimed that she was no longer able to work due to a spinal collapse fracture of osteoporotic origin .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted her appeal to the ORG Commissioner . Leave to appeal was granted but , by a decision of DATE , her appeal was dismissed following an oral hearing . The Commissioner felt compelled to follow previous decisions and also held that the ORG had not entered into an agreement to treat the applicant as a woman .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the judgments of DATE given by ORG in PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VI ) and PERSON GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL ) , in which the ORG found that the Government \u2019s continuing failure to take effective steps to effect the legal recognition of the change of gender of post - operative transsexuals was in breach of LAW , the applicant wrote to ORG on DATE asking for her case to be reopened . The Commissioner notified her on DATE that leave to appeal to ORG had been granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to award the applicant a State pension in light of the judgment in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In ORG , the applicant sought , inter alia , a declaration that she was entitled to her full retirement pension from her CARDINALth birthday , and damages for breach of LAW DATE , in force from DATE . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant reached DATE and her pension payments began .", "CARDINAL . By agreement , her case was adjourned to await ORG judgment in PERSON v. PERSON . In that case the claimant , a transsexual , sought a declaration of validity in respect of a marriage contracted following gender reassignment surgery . By a decision of DATE , their Lordships , whilst finding the ORG \u2019s continuing failure to legislate to be a breach of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , deemed the formulation of legal norms to remedy that breach best left to ORG ( [ DATE ] ORG ) . Further , ORG disapproved of attempts to seek recognition even in the clearest cases on the basis that ( a ) eventually a line would have to be drawn and ( b ) such demarcation required detailed consideration by the legislature of the likely social consequences . Following this decision , the applicant was advised by her legal representative that the prospects of persuading ORG to depart from the PERSON judgment , and thus of obtaining an effective remedy , were nil . If proceedings were continued , she would further risk punitive costs orders . Accordingly , the applicant consented to a court order dismissing her appeal with no order as to costs . The Government further refused to make any ex gratia payment of a sum representing her lost ORG pension .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was issued with ORG following her application under LAW which had come into force on DATE ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . A transsexual continues to be recorded for social security , ORG and employment purposes as being of the sex recorded at birth .", "CARDINAL . The ORG registers every NORP citizen for ORG ( NI ) purposes on the basis of the information in their birth certificate . Non - NORP citizens who wish to register for NI in GPE may use their passport or identification card as evidence of identity if a birth certificate is unavailable .", "CARDINAL . The ORG allocates every person registered for NI with a unique ORG number . The NI number has a standard format consisting of CARDINAL letters followed by CARDINAL pairs of numbers and a further letter . It contains no indication in itself of the holder \u2019s sex or of any other personal information . The NI number is used to identify each person with an NI account ( there are at present CARDINAL individual NI accounts ) . The ORG is thereby able to record details of all NI contributions paid into the account during the ORG account - holder \u2019s life and to monitor each person \u2019s liabilities , contributions and entitlement to benefits accurately . New numbers may in exceptional cases be issued to persons , for example , under the witness protection scheme or to protect the identity of child offenders .", "CARDINAL . NI contributions are made by way of deduction from an employee \u2019s pay by the employer and then by payment to ORG ( for onward transmission to the ORG ) . At present employers will make such deductions for a female employee until she reaches the pensionable age of CARDINAL and for a male employee until he reaches the pensionable age of DATE . The ORG operates a policy for male - to - female transsexuals whereby they may enter into an undertaking with the ORG to pay direct to the ORG any NI contributions due after the transsexual has reached DATE which have ceased to be deducted by the employer in the belief that the employee is female . In the case of female - to - male transsexuals , any deductions which are made by an employer after DATE may be reclaimed directly from the ORG by the employee .", "CARDINAL . In some cases employers will require proof that an apparent female employee has reached , or is about to reach , DATE and so entitled not to have the ORG deductions made . Such proof may be provided in the form of ORG ( form ORG or ORG ) . The ORG may issue such a certificate to a male - to - female transsexual where such a person enters into an undertaking to pay any NI contributions direct to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Documents received to date do not explain why ORG payments at the lower female rate were accepted from the applicant DATE .", "CARDINAL . A male - to - female transsexual was , prior to DATE , only entitled to a State pension at the retirement age of CARDINAL applied to men and not DATE which is applicable to women . In those circumstances , a full pension was payable only if she had made contributions for DATE as opposed to DATE required of women .", "CARDINAL . A person \u2019s sex for the purposes of pensionable age was prior to CARDINAL DATE determined according to biological sex at birth . This approach was approved by ORG Commissioner ( a judicial officer , who specialises in social security law ) in a number of cases .", "CARDINAL . In the R(P ) CARDINAL case , a male - to - female transsexual claimed entitlement to a pension at DATE . The Commissioner dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and stated at paragraph CARDINAL of his decision :", "\u201c ( a ) In my view , the word \u2018 woman\u2019 in section CARDINAL of the [ DATE ORG and Benefits ] Act means a person who is biologically a woman . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL contain many references to a woman in terms which indicate that a person is denoted who is capable of forming a valid marriage with a husband . That can only be a person who is biologically a woman .", "( b ) I doubt whether the distinction between a person who is biologically , and one who is socially , female has ever been present in the minds of the legislators when enacting relevant statutes . However that may be , it is certain that ORG has never conferred on any person the right or privilege of changing the basis of his ORG rights from those appropriate to a man to those appropriate to a woman . In my judgment , such a fundamental right or privilege would have to be expressly granted .", "...", "( d ) I fully appreciate the unfortunate predicament of the claimant , but the merits are not all on her side . She lived as a man from birth until DATE , and , during the part of that period when she was adult , her insurance rights were those appropriate to a man . These rights are in some respects more extensive than those appropriate to a woman . Accordingly , an element of unfairness to the general public might have to be tolerated so as to allow the payment of a pension to her at the pensionable age of a woman . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE this decision was followed by a Commissioner determining the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . By DATE , when the ORG gave judgment in PERSON , the Government had instituted plans to eradicate the difference between men and women concerning the age of entitlement to ORG pensions . Section CARDINAL of the Pensions Act DATE provides for the ORG pensionable age to increase progressively , beginning in DATE and reaching complete equalisation of the pensionable age at CARDINAL by DATE .", "CARDINAL . Up to DATE , the Government had received CARDINAL applications from transsexual people seeking to have their birth certificate changed . An ORG on Transsexual People was reconvened and reported to Ministers . On DATE the Government announced draft legislation and a commitment to legislate as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . In its PERSON judgment published on DATE ( see above ) , ORG did not expressly deal with the issue of pension entitlements , but took cognisance of the ORG \u2019s concession that domestic legislation failing to recognise the acquired gender of transsexual people infringed ORG CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government confirmed in response to a parliamentary question that proposed legislation would include rights to claim a State pension from the date of legal recognition of the new gender .", "CARDINAL . LAW has been adopted by ORG since the introduction of this application . It received the Royal Assent on DATE . Under the LAW , individuals who satisfy certain criteria are able to apply to a ORG for ORG . From the date of the grant of such a certificate , which is prospective in effect , an individual is afforded legal recognition in their acquired gender . In particular , social security benefits and the ORG retirement pension are paid according to the acquired gender .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , the ORG to ORG has been in operation and receiving applications . The ORG itself came into legal existence on DATE , from which date certificates could be issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW DATE came into force , permitting the provisions of the Convention to be relied on in domestic proceedings in GPE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
