As to the merits , relying on PERSON v. GPE ( no .

The applicant submitted evidence including a full copy of the transcript of his ORG communications and a copy of the information notice ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application and confirmed that his dismissal had been lawful . The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c The procedure for conducting a disciplinary investigation is expressly regulated by the provisions of LAW .", "In the instant case it has been shown , through the written documents included in the file , that the employer conducted the disciplinary investigation in respect of the applicant by twice summoning him in writing to explain himself [ and ] specifying the subject , date , time and place of the interview , and that the applicant had the opportunity to submit arguments in his defence regarding his alleged acts , as is clear from the CARDINAL explanatory notices included in the file ( see copies on sheets CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "The court takes the view that the monitoring of the internet conversations in which the employee took part using the ORG Messenger software on the company \u2019s computer during working hours \u2013 regardless of whether or not the employer \u2019s actions were illegal in terms of criminal law \u2013 can not undermine the validity of the disciplinary proceedings in the instant case .", "The fact that the provisions containing the requirement to interview the suspect ( \u00eenvinuitul ) in a case of alleged misconduct and to examine the arguments submitted in that person \u2019s defence prior to the decision on a sanction are couched in imperative terms highlights the legislature \u2019s intention to make respect for the rights of the defence a prerequisite for the validity of the decision on the sanction .", "In the present case , since the employee maintained during the disciplinary investigation that he had not used PERSON for personal purposes but in order to advise customers on the products being sold by his employer , the court takes the view that an inspection of the content of the [ applicant \u2019s ] conversations was the only way in which the employer could ascertain the validity of his arguments .", "The employer \u2019s right to monitor ( monitoriza ) employees in the workplace , [ particularly ] as regards their use of company computers , forms part of the broader right , governed by the provisions of LAW d ) of LAW , to supervise how employees perform their professional tasks .", "Given that it has been shown that the employees\u2019 attention had been drawn to the fact that , shortly before the applicant \u2019s disciplinary sanction , another employee had been dismissed for using the internet , the telephone and the photocopier for personal purposes , and that the employees had been warned that their activities were being monitored ( see notice no .

The applicant appealed to ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) .

He further argued that neither the internal regulations nor the information notice had contained any indication that the employer could monitor employees\u2019 communications .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal in a judgment of DATE , the relevant parts of which read :", "\u201c The first - instance court has rightly concluded that the internet is a tool made available to employees by the employer for professional use , and that the employer is entitled to set rules for the use of this tool , by laying down prohibitions and provisions which employees must observe when using the internet in the workplace ; it is clear that personal use may be refused , and the employees in the present case were duly informed of this in a notice issued on DATE in accordance with the provisions of the internal regulations , in which they were instructed to observe TIME , to be present at the workplace [ during TIME and ] to make effective use of working time .", "In conclusion , an employer who has made an investment is entitled , in exercising the rights enshrined in LAW , to monitor internet use in the workplace , and an employee who breaches the employer \u2019s rules on personal internet use is committing a disciplinary offence that may give rise to a sanction , including the most serious one .", "There is undoubtedly a conflict between the employer \u2019s right to engage in monitoring and the employees\u2019 right to protection of their privacy . This conflict has been settled at ORG level through the adoption of Directive no . CARDINAL , which has laid down a number of principles governing the monitoring of internet and email use in the workplace , including the following in particular .", "- Principle of necessity : monitoring must be necessary to achieve a certain aim .", "- Principle of purpose specification : data must be collected for specified , explicit and legitimate purposes .", "- Principle of transparency : the employer must provide employees with full information about monitoring operations .", "- Principle of legitimacy : data - processing operations may only take place for a legitimate purpose .", "- Principle of proportionality : personal data being monitored must be relevant and adequate in relation to the specified purpose .", "- Principle of security : the employer is required to take all possible security measures to ensure that the data collected are not accessible to third parties .", "In view of the fact that the employer has the right and the duty to ensure the smooth running of the company and , to that end , [ is entitled ] to supervise how its employees perform their professional tasks , and the fact [ that it ] enjoys disciplinary powers which it may legitimately use and which [ authorised it in the present case ] to monitor and transcribe the communications on PERSON which the employee denied having exchanged for personal purposes , after he and his colleagues had been warned that company resources should not be used for such purposes , it can not be maintained that this legitimate aim could have been achieved by any other means than by breaching the secrecy of his correspondence , or that a fair balance was not struck between the need to protect [ the employee \u2019s ] privacy and the employer \u2019s right to supervise the operation of its business .", "...", "Accordingly , having regard to the considerations set out above , the court finds that the decision of the first - instance court is lawful and well - founded and that the appeal is unfounded ; it must therefore be dismissed , in accordance with the provisions of LAW Civ[il ] Pr[ocedure ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant had lodged a criminal complaint against the statutory representatives of S. , alleging a breach of the secrecy of correspondence . On CARDINAL DATE the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism ( ORG ) of the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG and ORG ruled that there was no case to answer , on the grounds that the company was the owner of the computer system and the internet connection and could therefore monitor its employees\u2019 internet activity and use the information stored on the server , and in view of the prohibition on personal use of the IT systems , as a result of which the monitoring had been foreseeable .
