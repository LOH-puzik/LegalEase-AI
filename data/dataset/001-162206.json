CARDINAL . Moreover , the goal set by the association complied with the provisions of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of that GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG lodged an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) against the interlocutory judgment of DATE .

However , a political party could not be registered under the provisions of Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the appeal on points of law by ORG and rejected the organisation \u2019s request for registration .

Also , according to LAW , CARDINAL of the association \u2019s objectives was to increase expertise in the development of sustainable public policies in GPE . The court considered that the concepts used by the organisation had been very general and had run the risk of being understood as belonging to the field of activities of political parties . The association \u2019s objectives could likewise have been interpreted as belonging to the realm of activity of a political party , although Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL expressly prohibited the use of the ordinance for the registration of political parties ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
