There are CARDINAL legal regimes applicable to psychiatric detention .", "CARDINAL . First of all , the competent civil court can order compulsory confinement of a mental health patient in a psychiatric hospital if it is satisfied on the evidence of a psychiatrist that this is necessary in order to protect the patient concerned and/or the public from serious harm ( see sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , PERSON ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW of ORG ; PERSON o za\u0161titi osoba sa du\u0161evnim smetnjama ; published in ORG ( \u201c OG FBH \u201d ) no . CARDINAL of DATE ; amendments published in OG FBH no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ; \u201c LAW \u201d ) . The patient concerned must be summoned by the court , where this is possible , and must be examined in person by a psychiatrist ( see sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and GPE of LAW ) . Proceedings must be concluded within DATE and a court decision must be issued within DATE ( see sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Non - Contentious Proceedings Act of the Federation of Bosnia and DATE ; PERSON o vanparni\u010dnom postupku ; published in OG FBH no . CARDINAL of DATE ; amendments published in OG FBH nos . CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) . A court decision ordering civil psychiatric detention must always indicate the duration of such detention ; that period can not be longer than DATE , but is renewable ( see sections CARDINAL of LAW ) . The patient concerned , among other authorised persons and bodies , has the right to appeal within DATE ( see section DATE of LAW ) . The competent second - instance court must give a decision within DATE ( ibid . ) . A civil psychiatric detainee has the right to seek judicial review of his or her detention at any time ( see section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the competent criminal court can impose a hospital order ( obavezno psihijatrijsko lije\u010denje i \u010duvanje u zdravstvenoj ustanovi ) on an offender who at the time of committing a criminal offence was suffering from a mental disorder affecting his or her mental responsibility , if it is satisfied on the evidence of a psychiatrist that this is necessary in order to prevent the offender from committing another criminal offence . However , there is an important difference in this regard between the old and new criminal legislation ( the latter entered into force on DATE ) . While a hospital order can still be imposed on those who have been found guilty although suffering from diminished responsibility , it can no longer be imposed against those who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity ( see LAW DATE ; NORP zakon PERSON i ORG ; published in OG FBH no . CARDINAL of DATE ; amendments published in OG FBH nos . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , as from DATE an offender who has been acquitted on the grounds of insanity can be placed in psychiatric detention only by the competent civil court if this is considered necessary for the protection of the offender and/or the public from serious harm ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Any such acquittal is therefore reported to the competent social work centre which must initiate the appropriate procedure ( see LAW ; PERSON o krivi\u010dnom postupku PERSON i ORG ; published in OG FBH no . CARDINAL of DATE ; amendments published in OG FBH nos . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant authorities had until DATE to verify the status of all those who had been acquitted on the grounds of insanity pursuant to the old criminal legislation , to terminate the application of any hospital orders which were still pending and to initiate the procedure in which the competent civil court would decide whether to prolong the detention of any such mental health patient ( see Article CARDINAL of LAW DATE and the instructions of ORG no .
