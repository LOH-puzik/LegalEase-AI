{"ITEMID": "001-23599", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "LUNDKVIST v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is represented before the Court by Mr J. S\u00f6dergren , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by PERSON of ORG , as Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In TIME of DATE , the so - called \u201c DATE TIME \u201d , a row broke out between the applicant and his wife in the couple \u2019s home . Later , on DATE , at TIME , a fire ravaged the home , a wooden house owned by the applicant , which burned down to the foundation walls .", "The applicant was subsequently charged under LAW , LAW , with ill - treating his wife , and LAW , LAW with arson for setting his house on fire .", "In DATE ORG convicted the applicant on the first count and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . On the second count , it acquitted him , finding that , notwithstanding the existence of strong arguments supporting the prosecution \u2019s case , it had not been shown beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was guilty of the offence .", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment . As regards the arson charge , it observed :", "\u201c As found by ORG , there are strong reasons for believing that [ the applicant ] started the fire in his villa . However , there is nothing in the investigation that directly links him to this act . Nor does the investigation exclude the possibility that the fire was caused by an accident or had been started by another person . Since it can not therefore be regarded as established beyond reasonable doubt that [ the applicant ] started the fire , the charge must be rejected . \u201d", "Subsequently , the applicant instituted civil proceedings against his insurance company , ORG , requesting a declaratory judgment to the effect that the latter was obliged under the insurance contract to pay him compensation for the damage caused by the fire to his house and personal belongings .", "ORG , sitting with a different bench from the one in the criminal case , held an oral hearing during which evidence was heard from the applicant , the witnesses who had given evidence during the criminal trial and a number of new witnesses . The written evidence adduced by the parties was to a large extent the same as had been submitted in the criminal proceedings .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG found for the insurance company and against the applicant . The judgment contained an introductory section entitled \u201c Background \u201d , in which ORG quoted ORG above - cited conclusion , and a summary of the parties\u2019 submissions ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . This was followed by ORG reasoning ( \u201c Domsk\u00e4l \u201d ) , which gave an itemised description of the written and oral evidence , reiterated the contents of some of the new oral evidence , and set out ORG assessment . It first reiterated the standards of proof applicable to cases of insurance compensation , noting that it was not disputed here that an insured event had occurred , but only whether the matter fell within the exception clause in H CARDINAL of the insurance policy , cf . section CARDINAL of LAW ( konsumentf\u00f6rs\u00e4kringslagen ) , which it was for the insurance company to prove . In this connection the ORG emphasised that a factor that was significant for distinguishing the assessment of evidence in the civil case from that of the criminal case was the applicant \u2019s silence .", "ORG then examined , at quite some length , the evidence , including that from experts , as to the possible natural causes of the fire , notably the house \u2019s electrical installations and heating system , in particular a combined wood - and - oil burner and the chimney . It concluded that such causes could be excluded and that there were therefore weighty reasons for considering that the cause must lie somewhere else . It went on :", "\u201c As already stated , [ the applicant ] for his part has not been able to contribute with any explanation as to the origin of the fire . He had good opportunities to start the fire . According to the investigation , shortly before the fire , he went in and out of the house several times .", "ORG considers that no person other than [ the applicant ] can be suspected of having started the fire . The information provided by [ his wife ] to the police during the first interview makes the suspicion against him particularly strong . During the police interview she had stated inter alia that [ the applicant ] threatened to burn the house down if she and her son were to move . The evidence obtained at the police interviews must be given particular evidential value . Subsequently she has provided new and different information in a curious manner . Her new statement does not seem credible . She has strong personal reasons for trying to save the family \u2019s financial situation . The new information could be explained , or at least seen , in the light of the fact that , as she admits , she talked with [ the applicant ] about the circumstances relating to the origin of the fire before ORG hearing . Even during the hearing in the previous case PERSON gave barely credible explanations for departing from the information that she had spontaneously provided during the first police interview and has not convincingly presented her new version , inter alia that she should have been inside the house immediately before the fire and seen smoke in the house , amongst other things . She has been further examined on these points and has stated that she did \u2018 not know how she should reply\u2019 .", "What first and foremost indicated that [ the applicant ] started the fire is that , in connection with a row with his wife , he expressed a threat to burn the house down , plus the fact that his state of mind was clearly such that , in a fit of desperation , he could very well be believed to have started the fire by using the inflammable liquids that were in the house . His disposition for taking dramatic steps is confirmed by the suicidal thoughts that he expressed immediately after the fire . The assumption that [ the applicant ] himself started the fire with the help of inflammable liquids is supported by the development of the fire as witnessed by several eye witnesses and , with the exception of PERSON , by the evidence heard from technical experts on fire incidents . CARDINAL of the apparent factors which likewise suggests that [ the applicant ] started the fire is that , as pointed out by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , immediately before the fire [ the applicant ] carried his son from his room in the house out to the lorry and the fact that [ the applicant ] was in the house , in the cellar , at the precise moments that the smoke became apparent . Furthermore , it should be taken into consideration that [ the applicant ] himself , voluntarily , raised the question of arson with Mr Mats Eriksson [ police officer ] when the police intervened against him after the fire .", "ORG finds that the circumstances adduced in support of the submission that [ the applicant ] intentionally started the fire outweigh other possible causes of the fire to such a high degree that insurance compensation should not be paid . The appeal shall therefore be rejected . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG . That court , too , sat in a different composition from that in the criminal case . The applicant relied mainly on the same evidence as before ORG . ORG heard evidence from the applicant at his own request and from several expert witnesses and heard tape recordings of a number of witness statements taken by ORG , including those of the applicant \u2019s wife and mother , at their request .", "In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment .", "Like ORG , ORG first considered the various possible technical causes of the fire and endorsed ORG findings that such causes had to be excluded .", "\u201c [ The applicant ] \u2019s behaviour during the DATE TIME and the disquiet and anxiety that he aroused in PERSON and his mother indicate that he was mentally highly imbalanced . The information that PERSON finally provided in order to protect him appears , as ORG held , not to be credible . Furthermore regard should be had to the fact that the statements initially made by [ the applicant ] about the fire during the police interviews \u2013 the first time , when he had not yet been informed that he was under suspicion of having committed an offence \u2013 are not supported by the remainder of the investigation . Thereafter he has not been able to contribute any explanation . ORG draws the same conclusion as ORG from the fact that after the initial police interview [ the applicant ] has given hardly any information about the event . Against this background and having regard to the case as a whole , there is no possibility of considering that the fire was started by any person other than [ the applicant ] .", "In view of these considerations the insurance company must be considered to have shown \u2013 in accordance with the standard of proof applicable to civil cases of this kind DATE that [ the applicant ] started the fire . His request for a declaratory judgement shall therefore be rejected and ORG judgment shall stand . \u201d", "The applicant sought leave to appeal against ORG judgment . On DATE ORG refused leave .", "LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ( brottsbalken ) provides :", "\u201c If a person starts a fire , which entails a danger to another person \u2019s life or health or extensive damage to another person \u2019s property , he or she shall be convicted of incendiarism and be sentenced to imprisonment of DATE .", "Where the offence is less serious , the person shall be sentenced to imprisonment of DATE . \u201d", "LAW , section CARDINAL , first sub - paragraph of LAW reads :", "\u201c Unless otherwise specifically provided , an act shall be considered a criminal offence only if it has been committed with intent . \u201d", "\u201c If you have caused the insured event by intent you shall not receive any compensation for your part . The same applies if another person acted with your consent or if the person has significant financial interests in common with you ( for example your spouse ) and there are no particular reasons to the contrary .", "This is also the case - except where it concerns a third party insurance - if the insured event has been caused by gross negligence and there are no particular reasons to the contrary . \u201d", "It is not claimed that the above - cited policy clause conflicted with the relevant provisions of LAW , section CARDINAL of which provides that no insurance cover will be provided in favour of an insured person who has intentionally caused the insured event and that the cover may on certain conditions be reduced if an insured event has been caused by gross negligence or negligence which is not insignificant .", "Different standards of proof apply to criminal and civil cases . In a criminal case the burden of proof is entirely on the prosecutor , who must establish beyond any reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed the act in question and that he did so with the necessary intent or negligence . In a civil case , the burden of proof is normally on the plaintiff . The standard of proof in a civil case differs according to the type of case and the circumstances that have to be proved , but is less strict than in a criminal case .", "According to examples of ORG case law submitted by the Government ( see , e.g. , ORG DATE p. CARDINAL , NJA DATE p. CARDINAL , NJA DATE p. CARDINAL , NJA DATE p. CARDINAL and ORG DATE p. CARDINAL ) , in cases concerning insurance compensation to consumers it is for the policyholder to show that , having regard to the circumstances as a whole , it is more likely than not that an insured event has occurred . The policyholder \u2019s burden of proof is viewed as somewhat more lenient than the ordinary civil burden of proof . If the insurance company responds that no compensation shall be granted because the policyholder has intentionally caused the insured event , the burden shifts onto the company , which has to prove this in accordance with the ordinary civil standard ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
