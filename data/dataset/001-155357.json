The court held that the prosecutor \u2019s office had failed to observe the lawful requirements for investigating the case , had established the facts of the case superficially , and had breached procedural rules which affected the very existence of the criminal investigation and the lawfulness of the referral of the case to the court . It noted that the investigation had been carried out mainly by the police , and not by the prosecutor as required by the applicable rules of criminal procedure ; the prosecutor \u2019s office had failed to produce all the relevant evidence in the case concerning the existence of the offences and of the GPE guilt , and had not clarified the contradictions in the available evidence , in particular between the expert opinions produced in respect of the case .

The applicant appealed against the order before ORG . He argued that the prosecutor \u2019s office \u2019s order was unlawful , because the criminal investigation against the applicant had been carried out by the same prosecutor who had previously confirmed the applicant \u2019s indictment .

It held that the criminal investigation against the applicant had been carried out by the same prosecutor who had previously confirmed the applicant \u2019s indictment . In addition , by declining to examine the remaining arguments raised by the applicant , it had instructed the prosecutor \u2019s office to assess if the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the merits of the case was founded . Lastly , it instructed the prosecutor \u2019s office to clearly determine the extent of the applicant \u2019s involvement in committing the impugned offences and also whether he had been indicted for the same unlawful acts of which he had been informed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment , without providing any arguments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as ill - founded , and upheld the judgment of the first - instance court . The court noted that the applicant had submitted the grounds for his appeal on points of law after the debates on the merits of the case had been closed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the criminal investigation initiated against the applicant . It held on the basis of the documentary , testimonial and expert evidence available in the file produced both during the previous investigation and during the trials that , although the applicant was guilty of the impugned offences , the criminal proceedings initiated against him were time - barred . In addition , it described the applicant \u2019s involvement in committing the unlawful acts and noted that after its reopening the criminal investigation against the applicant had been carried out by a different prosecutor from the one who had confirmed his indictment . Furthermore , the applicant had been indicted for the same unlawful acts of which he had been informed . In this connection , the prosecutor \u2019s office noted that some of the offences had been examined by the prosecutor \u2019s order of DATE . Also , following some amendments to the relevant legislation , the domestic legal practice had changed : the offences of intellectual forgery and use of forged documents had been absorbed by the offence of forgery of privately signed documents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision before the GPE ORG by relying on Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) of LAW . He argued that the domestic court should quash the prosecutor \u2019s decision , retain the case for examination , and acquit him . In addition , he contended that the prosecutor \u2019s order had been unlawful because it concerned acts with which the criminal investigation was not concerned , and was in any case not supported by the evidence available to the file . Also , without providing any grounds the investigating authorities had ceased to accuse him of intellectual forgery or use of forged documents . Furthermore , ORG did not follow the mandatory instructions received from the court . There was no evidence in the file that he had been an accomplice to an offence . Lastly , he had disagreed with being charged with forgery of privately signed documents ; he had argued that the parties had not been allowed to submit observations in respect of the requalification carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his chosen legal representative informed ORG that he did not have other requests in respect of the judicial investigation of the case . They further argued , among other things , that although in DATE the GPE ORG had ordered the prosecutor \u2019s office to reopen the criminal proceedings against him and had given the investigating authorities several instructions , none of those instructions had been followed . In particular , no evidence was adduced , and they were not called to take part in the production of evidence . Also , the investigating authorities did not clarify any of the issues identified by the court . Consequently , they requested that on the basis of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) the court should quash the prosecutor \u2019s order and , given that the production of other evidence was not necessary , acquit the applicant in respect of the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the prosecutor \u2019s decision , relying on the available evidence . It held that the investigating authorities had not ceased to accuse him of intellectual forgery or use of forged documents , but had requalified those offences as forgery of privately signed documents . Also , ORG had observed the mandatory instructions received from the court . In particular , the criminal investigation had been carried out by a different prosecutor from the one who had indicted the applicant , the prosecutor had explained in detail how the applicant had helped and contributed to the commission of the offences , and had verified that the acts for which the criminal investigation had been opened were identical to those indicated by the prosecutor \u2019s order . Furthermore , the prosecutor \u2019s order had clearly described in detail , by relying on evidence , why the applicant had been an accomplice to an offence . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s own statements amounted to an acknowledgment that he had forged privately signed documents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the judgment on points of law . He argued that the domestic court should quash the prosecutor \u2019s decision , retain the case for examination , and on the basis of the same evidence available in the file acquit him of fraud and forgery of privately signed documents . He further contended that the evidence in the file and the examination carried out by the prosecutor \u2019s office did not prove that he had committed the offences . Also , the parties had not been allowed to submit observations following the requalification of CARDINAL of the offences he had been charged with to forgery of privately signed documents .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law and acknowledged the lawfulness of the prosecutor \u2019s order of CARDINAL DATE and of the firstinstance court \u2019s judgment . It so held on the basis of the available documentary , testimonial and expert evidence produced both during the criminal investigation and before the domestic courts that the applicant had committed the offences of complicity in fraud and forgery of privately signed documents . In addition , the prosecutor \u2019s office had examined the applicant \u2019s guilt on the merits , and had established that the acts had existed and therefore the criminal proceedings against the applicant could not have been discontinued on the ground that no unlawful act had been committed . Therefore , the prosecutor \u2019s office had correctly held that the criminal proceedings initiated against him had been time - barred .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed the ORG that the criminal proceedings initiated against him had destroyed his reputation , and that a virulent press campaign had been initiated against him and his company at the time of his arrest . The applicant submitted CARDINAL articles published in local and national newspapers DATE describing the events which led to the charges being brought against him and a chronological narration of the criminal proceedings initiated against him ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
