POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was not legally represented in the proceedings before the ORG . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG ( Prokurator Wojew\u00f3dzki ) charged the applicant with drug smuggling and detained him on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offence in question , the serious nature of that offence and the risk that he might obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s wife was charged with a similar offence and detained on remand .", "The applicant , in his written observations , submitted that , upon their detention , the authorities had ordered them to surrender their passports . The Government have not contested that fact .", "Subsequently , on several occasions , the applicant asked the prosecutor to release him on bail , but all his applications were to no avail .", "On DATE , on an application by ORG , ORG ( PERSON ) prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention on remand until DATE . The court held that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the serious offence with which he had been charged . It considered that the need to confront suspects with each other , to obtain evidence from abroad and expert evidence justified the prolongation of his detention in order to ensure the proper course of the investigation . ORG ( FAC ) upheld this decision and the reasons therefor on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel asked the prosecutor to order that the applicant be examined by a cardiologist and a psychiatrist . According to a medical report , which was submitted to the prosecutor on CARDINAL October CARDINAL , the applicant \u2019s health was not an obstacle to holding him in detention .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s wife was released from detention on health grounds .", "On DATE , on a subsequent application by ORG , the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , repeating the reasons already invoked in the decision of CARDINAL DATE . ORG upheld that decision on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel informed the prosecutor that his client \u2019s health was very bad and that , in particular , he had lost consciousness during one of their meetings in prison . It was , he added , not a single instance of fainting as the applicant had already several times had similar attacks . He asked the prosecutor to release the applicant immediately .", "The prosecution first asked the prison authorities to provide them with an updated report on the applicant \u2019s health . According to that report , which was received on DATE , the applicant had only once informed prison doctors of having lost consciousness . Doctors did not consider that the applicant \u2019s condition militated against keeping him in custody .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant had filed an application for release on bail with ORG and offered a security in the form of his movable and immovable property . The application was dismissed by ORG on DATE and , on appeal , by ORG ( Prokurator Apelacyjny ) on DATE . In those decisions the prosecutors referred to the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings and considered that the applicant \u2019s detention should continue until DATE the investigation , especially as the applicant had not confessed .", "On DATE ORG laid further charges against the applicant .", "On DATE the prosecution lodged a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was indicted on a charge of having smuggled not QUANTITY of heroine . The bill of indictment comprised CARDINAL charges against CARDINAL co - accused .", "In DATE the applicant made CARDINAL applications for release on health grounds . He complained about frequent headaches and states of unconsciousness , insomnia and heart - burning sensation . He also referred to his difficult family situation and , in particular , to the bad health of his wife , who was suffering from depressive neurosis and chronic gastritis . He produced the relevant medical certificates .", "On DATE ORG refused to release him . It considered that there was a sufficient likelihood that the applicant had committed the offence with which he had been charged . It also held that his detention should continue in view of the need to ensure the proper conduct of the trial . The court did not find that the situation of the applicant \u2019s family was so serious as to justify his release on the grounds specified in LAW .", "On DATE the applicant filed a subsequent request for release . Later , in DATE , he made several fresh , similar applications . He stressed that he had already spent DATE in detention . He referred to his own and his wife \u2019s bad health , maintaining that she urgently needed help and support from him . He produced several medical and other certificates relating to her health and family situation .", "In DATE , ORG ordered that further evidence concerning the applicant \u2019s and his wife \u2019s health and their family situation be obtained .", "On DATE , the applicant produced further documents .", "On DATE the court rejected all the applications . It held that there was a sufficient appearance of likelihood that he had committed the offence in question . It further considered that that offence represented a serious danger to society and that , accordingly , there was a need to ensure the proper course of the trial . Referring to the applicant \u2019s health , the court observed that the applicant was suffering only from neurosis , which was not in itself an obstacle to his continued detention . As regards his family situation , the court pointed out that other members of their family could provide his wife with the necessary care and assistance .", "ORG upheld that decision on DATE . It found that the charge against the applicant was sufficiently confirmed by evidence heard before the trial court . It also considered that the character of the offence , the complicated process of obtaining evidence and the stage of the proceedings indicated that holding the applicant in custody was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the trial .", "In the meantime , on DATE , ORG had rejected the applicant \u2019s other applications for release , which he had filed on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . This decision was then upheld on appeal on CARDINAL DATE . The courts relied on CARDINAL principal reasons , namely , on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the serious offence and the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings . As regards the applicant \u2019s health and his family situation , the courts found that there were no grounds for releasing him under LAW .", "On DATE the trial began . The court heard evidence from defendants . Further hearings were held on DATE and CARDINAL and DATE . The applicant repeatedly \u2013 but with no success DATE asked for release .", "On DATE the applicant asked ORG to release him on bail . The court refused on DATE . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . It held that the charge against the applicant had a sufficient basis in evidence that had so far been heard before the trial court . It considered that the applicant \u2019s offence represented a serious danger to society and that the nature of the offence , as well as the modus operandi , justified the fears that the applicant would obstruct the process of obtaining evidence . As regards the applicant \u2019s family situation , the court observed that his wife was under the proper care in a psychiatric hospital and that her condition was not a reason to apply LAW of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant again asked for release on bail . He submitted that the health of his wife had markedly deteriorated and that she was in hospital . On DATE ORG rejected the application in view of the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the serious offence with which he had been charged and the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . The court found that the bad health of the applicant \u2019s wife was not a circumstance that could militate against his continued detention because she was being given care and treatment in hospital .", "On DATE and CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE ORG held further hearings .", "In the interim , on DATE , the applicant had filed another application for release . He repeated his previous arguments and produced further documents describing the bad health and difficult personal situation of his wife . He stressed that the total length of his detention was very considerable .", "ORG rejected the application on DATE . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG quashed the detention order and released him under the condition that he report DATE to the police station at his place of residence and surrender his passport to the court . In addition , the court imposed further restrictions on the applicant \u2019s movement and ordered , inter alia , that he be prohibited from leaving the territory of GPE . ORG did not share the applicant \u2019s opinion that he should be released in view of his family situation and held that detention was by itself a measure that inevitably entailed serious consequences for an individual \u2019s family life . It considered , however , that the length of the applicant \u2019s detention , which had at the time exceeded DATE , militated in favour of his release . The court stressed that that element , given the fact that the trial had reached an advanced stage , that evidence had been secured and that there was no danger that the applicant might obstruct the process of obtaining evidence , justified the opinion that the application of a less severe preventive measure would adequately secure the further course of the trial .", "The trial came to an end on DATE . Beforehand , ORG dropped the charge of drug smuggling against the applicant and asked the court to find him guilty of drug trafficking . ORG convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY . The applicant did not appeal against his conviction .", "In their observations , the Government submitted that , on CARDINAL DATE the ORG had obtained information from ORG of ORG , according to which the NORP authorities had issued an order to search for the applicant by a \u201c wanted \u201d notice in connection with the suspicion of his having been involved in money laundering and with their intended request for his extradition to GPE .", "The applicant submitted that throughout his trial he had been unaware of that fact and that he had learnt of it \u2013 and of the fact that he had already been sentenced in absentia by the NORP courts DATE on DATE , when he had been arrested by the NORP authorities . He produced the relevant warrant of arrest .", "In that connection , the applicant added that the NORP courts had refused to extradite him to GPE because the NORP courts had not ensured him a fair trial in absentia . To begin with , he had not been informed of the charges . Nor had he been heard , summoned to stand trial or notified of the judgment . He produced the relevant decision given by ORG on DATE . The court considered that his extradition to GPE was inadmissible because \u201c in the trial preceding his conviction a minimum of his defence rights had not been respected \u201d .", "At the material time the rules governing detention on remand were contained in LAW of the Law of DATE \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure ( Kodeks post\u0119powania karnego ) ( \u201c the DATE Code \u201d ) \u2013 entitled \u201c Preventive measures \u201d ( NORP zapobiegawcze ) . The DATE Code is no longer in force .
