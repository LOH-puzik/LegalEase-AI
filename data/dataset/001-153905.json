It appears from a letter of DATE signed by the head of ORG of the ORG that following the transfer of the arrest warrant to the NORP authorities the police contacted the applicant , who was in GPE , sometime in DATE .

It appears from the extracts from the logbook of the ORG \u2019s temporary detention facility submitted to ORG that the applicant arrived at the detention facility at TIME on DATE following a decision of a ORG judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG , relying on the NORP court \u2019s detention order of CARDINAL DATE , ordered the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody in respect of the applicant for DATE . At the hearing the applicant was represented by a ORG - appointed lawyer . The judge relied on the provisions of LAW ( \u201c the CCrP \u201d ) of GPE relating to detention with a view to extradition when she ordered the applicant \u2019s detention . The judge justified this measure as follows :", "\u201c Taking into account the fact that PERSON oglu committed a less serious criminal offence and , if released , would obstruct the objective functioning of the investigation by absconding from it , I consider it necessary to confirm the decision of DATE of ORG of Preobrazhensky District , GPE , to apply the preventive measure of remand in custody in respect of him for DATE .", "In fact , according to LAW , upon receipt of a request for extradition of a person and a copy of a detention order in respect of him from the competent authority of a foreign ORG , the prosecuting authority of GPE to which the request is addressed may , if necessary , take measures in compliance with the provisions of this LAW to have the person arrested and detained before a decision on extradition is taken . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following a series of complaints to the various domestic authorities , on DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer was provided with a copy of the record of the applicant \u2019s arrest and ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed against ORG decision of DATE , claiming that his arrest and detention had been unlawful . In particular , he submitted that he had been unlawfully arrested on DATE and that there were no criminal proceedings pending against him in GPE . He further argued that as he was an NORP national he could not be extradited to a foreign ORG , which followed from LAW and LAW . He also submitted that his arrest and detention had not been carried out in accordance with domestic and international law , since no official request accompanied by the relevant documents for his detention and extradition was ever submitted by the NORP authorities . The applicant \u2019s lawyer also submitted a request for restoration of the time - limits for lodging an appeal . In this connection , the lawyer stated that although at TIME the applicant \u2019s family had appointed him as a lawyer for the applicant \u2019s defence , he had not been informed of ORG hearing , which was held at TIME on DATE . He further noted that he had been provided with a copy of the detention order only on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG granted the request for restoration of the time - limits for lodging an appeal and forwarded the applicant \u2019s appeal to the appellate court for examination .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the NORP ORG granted the prosecutor \u2019s request for the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE , relying on LAW CCrP concerning the extension of detention periods pending criminal proceedings . In its decision , the court noted that as the applicant was an NORP national he could not be extradited to a foreign ORG , and for this reason ORG had requested ORG to transfer the applicant \u2019s criminal case to the NORP authorities . The court thus justified the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention period by the fact that more time was needed for the submission of relevant documents relating to the applicant \u2019s case from ORG to the NORP authorities . The relevant part of the decision reads as follows :", "\u201c As the extradition of PERSON to GPE is impossible because he is a citizen of GPE , a request was sent to ORG for the criminal case to be transferred to ORG for the criminal inquiry to be continued in GPE .", "Taking into account the fact that more time is needed for the transfer of the criminal case relating to the accused PERSON from ORG to ORG , but that the detention period of PERSON oglu ends on DATE , I consider the request justified in order to ensure the criminal prosecution of PERSON in the future and to prevent him from absconding from the court proceedings .", "Taking into account the above - mentioned matters and relying on ORG CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , I decide that the detention period of PERSON oglu born on ... and in ... must be extended for DATE , until DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision , claiming that the extension of his detention was unlawful . He noted in particular that although the court had relied on LAW CCrP concerning the extension of detention periods pending criminal proceedings when it ordered the extension of his detention , there were no criminal proceedings pending against him in GPE , and therefore his detention could not be extended on this basis . He also submitted that the court had failed to justify the extension of his detention , and that his continued detention was in breach of the relevant international conventions . The applicant further reiterated the complaint concerning his unlawful detention from DATE in the ORG , noting that the main reason for his detention was his complaint concerning misappropriation of his property by ORG and others . In this connection he disputed the content of the official record of his arrest , stating that his family could not possibly have known about his arrest at TIME on DATE and concluded a contract with his lawyer for his defence , if he had been arrested at TIME on DATE as indicated in the official record .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The appellate court made no mention of the applicant \u2019s particular complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG , asking the court to replace his remand in custody with the preventive measure of house arrest . He claimed , in particular , that his detention had not been justified and that there was no reason for his continued detention . In support of his request , the applicant pointed out that he had a permanent place of residence and that there was no risk of his absconding from or obstructing the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE , relying on LAW CCrP concerning the extension of detention periods pending criminal proceedings . As to the justification for the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention , the court relied on an almost identical wording as that of the court \u2019s decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision , reiterating his previous complaints . He noted in this regard that the domestic courts had ignored his complaint concerning his unlawful detention in the temporary detention facility of the ORG from DATE . He further stated that although the NORP authorities had never submitted any extradition request or a request for institution of criminal proceedings against him in GPE , he had been detained in breach of the domestic and international law . In particular , he referred to Article CARDINAL of the ORG , which provides that a person arrested with a view to extradition must be released if no official request for his extradition is received by the NORP prosecuting authority within TIME of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance court \u2019s decision . The appellate court made no mention of the applicant \u2019s specific complaints .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again extended the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE . The court \u2019s decision was almost identical in its wording to the decisions of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision . He reiterated that the domestic courts had ignored his complaint concerning his unlawful detention in the temporary detention facility of the ORG from CARDINAL to DATE . He further stated that it was not legitimate for the domestic courts to order the extension of his detention on the ground that more time was needed for the transfer of relevant documents from the NORP authorities to their NORP counterparts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s appeal and ordered his release . The appellate court quashed ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , holding that the first - instance court had erred in extending the applicant \u2019s continued detention .
