THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , a GPE and NORP citizen born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE , is represented before the ORG by PERSON of ORG , solicitors practising in GPE .", "The applicant is the wife of PERSON who , on DATE , was ambushed in his bread van by loyalist paramilitaries and hit by CARDINAL bullets which killed him . At the time of his death members of the NORP clergy and members of the PERSON criticised the ORG stating that PERSON had been subject to police harassment which may have operated to target him for loyalist paramilitaries .", "Shortly afterwards , PERSON , when arrested following his attack on mourners in GPE cemetery , admitted carrying out the murder of PERSON . PERSON , aged DATE at the time , had also been arrested and charged with aiding and abetting the murder and with various counts of possession of firearms .", "On DATE , PERSON pleaded not guilty to the murder of PERSON . At the conclusion of the trial , he was found guilty by the judge on DATE and detained at the pleasure of the Secretary of ORG .", "On DATE , ORG pleaded not guilty to the murder of PERSON . On DATE , he was found guilty by the judge and sentenced to life imprisonment .", "In DATE , PERSON published a book in which he claimed , inter alia , that neither he nor Deary were involved in the murder of PERSON . He stated that he had been involved in a conspiracy to kill PERSON , who was suspected of running guns for the IRA in his bread van , and had been shown intelligence files by members of the security forces . However he took the view that the security of the operation had been compromised after being told that the security forces knew about the plan and would let his team in and out safely and therefore pulled out of the plan . PERSON was killed DATE . PERSON maintained that he admitted the murder because he was aware that PERSON , who had been arrested and charged , had not been involved and he believed that his admissions would either result in the charges being dropped or the acquittal of PERSON , while he faced life imprisonment in any event . He stated that PERSON , who had merely been in possession of a stolen radio given to him by the CARDINAL men who had stolen the car used in the attack on PERSON , had happened to know about an old IRA weapons hide . PERSON also claimed that he had made false admissions to another murder , that of PERSON , in order to shield the group that had been involved .", "Following the publication of the book , the applicant 's solicitors wrote to the Secretary of ORG for GPE , the Chief Constable of ORG ( \u201c PSNI \u201d ) and ORG and asked what steps were being taken by these public authorities in light of PERSON 's allegations . The applicant states that her representatives requested copies of the transcript of the trial and the bills of indictment from the Lord Chief Justice who has yet to determine the application .", "On DATE the Chief Constable directed a ORG of the ORG , with no connection with the original investigation , to examine the book and any other relevant material that existed in relation to the death of PERSON . As appeared in an affidavit sworn on DATE , steps were also taken to have a senior detective from outside GPE examine the collected material and carry out such further enquiries and examine such further materials as he felt appropriate . The officer was to report to the Chief Constable on the findings and make recommendations as to any issues requiring re - examination . The family were to be briefed on any findings or recommendations .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , the solicitors lodged proceedings against the Secretary of ORG complaining of a failure to hold an LAW investigation into the death of PERSON . Following the decision of ORG in ORG v. Secretary of ORG for GPE on DATE holding that a complaint could not be brought alleging a procedural violation of LAW where the death occurred before DATE , counsel advised the applicant that there was no possibility to continue the judicial review application , which was accordingly withdrawn on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant 's solicitors wrote to ORG ( ORG ) , with whom they had been directed to correspond about this matter , and sought disclosure , inter alia , of copies of the interviews conducted with PERSON and PERSON in which they admitted involvement in the murder , copies of the forensic evidence and scene of crime photographs and any additional information available concerning the murder and the role of the security forces in the murder .", "On DATE , the ORG informed the solicitors that the ORG had arranged for a senior detective from outside GPE to examine and review the allegations made by PERSON , that he would advise the Chief Constable what if any further action should be taken and that the family would be informed of the outcome of this review . As a result , the ORG could not accede to the current request for disclosure of documentation . This officer was later identified as Mr PERSON , previously of ORG . By letter dated DATE , the applicant was informed that PERSON would be available for a meeting in DATE . A meeting took place . A communication from PERSON to the solicitors indicated that he was aware of their concerns about access to material and stressed that at this stage all he had been asked to do was to provide an independent and impartial assessment of PERSON allegations that he had colluded with the ORG / military prior to the GPE murders and of his allegations that he did not take part in the murders of PERSON and PERSON .", "The applicant 's solicitors repeated their request for disclosure of materials , disputing that it would hinder the ongoing investigation . They also requested a copy of the report prepared by an inspector of the ORG . No response had been received to these requests ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
