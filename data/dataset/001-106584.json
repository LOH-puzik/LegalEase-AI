On admission the patient was noisy , agitated and very angry with her partner : she did not deny having punched him , but argued that she had done so in self - defence . As [ the applicant \u2019s ] behaviour was threatening and uncontrollable , involuntary emergency psychiatric treatment was applied in respect of her from DATE , as she posed a danger to herself and to those around her . Previously , [ the applicant ] had received inpatient treatment [ at a psychiatric hospital ] in ORG and [ had also been treated ] in DATE in GPE .

Therefore , the criminal proceedings were terminated and the applicant was subjected to coercive psychiatric treatment under LAW ( Karistusseadustik ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a written procedure , ORG dismissed the appeal by the applicant against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , reiterating her earlier complaints . In addition , relying on LAW , she complained that she had received ORG decision DATE after it had been adopted and that it had taken DATE for ORG to decide on her appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .

As regards the DATE delay that had elapsed before ORG had heard the applicant , ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In response to the claim in the [ present ] appeal concerning a violation of the second sentence of LAW of LAW the ORG \u201d ] , the [ ORG ] notes the following . In the event of the admission of a person to a closed institution pursuant to the procedure for the application of interim measures , the person himself or herself , and those close to him or her , have to be heard ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) . The second sentence of LAW of the ORG allows for an exception from this rule to be made if the hearing may cause significant damage to the health of the person or if the person is clearly not able to express his or her will . According to the first sentence of LAW of the ORG , due to the potential danger resulting from a delay ( the meaning of the provision indicates that reference is made to danger to the person \u2019s own life or other ORG lives , health or safety ) , interim measures may be applied before hearing the person himself or herself and the other persons , and before appointing a representative for him or her . According to the second sentence of LAW of the ORG , such [ hearing and appointment ] must be performed promptly thereafter . The [ ORG ] considers that the main purpose of LAW ( CARDINAL ) and the second sentence of \u00a7 MONEY ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG is the need to prevent an unfounded admission of a person to a closed institution or the opportunity to decide on the termination of the admission pursuant to LAW ORG .", "In the present case , ORG heard the person concerned DATE after the decision to apply interim measures had been taken . The [ ORG ] finds that in the present case ORG has not given reasons for the DATE delay . Although the second sentence of LAW of the ORG obliges the court to promptly perform certain acts ( hear the person himself or herself and the other persons named in the law , and appoint him or her a representative ) , the meaning of the law is that the person concerned has to be heard in the first place . Since the person concerned , as a rule , will have been admitted to the closed institution by that time , his or her whereabouts will be known to the court . If there were any objective circumstances preventing the court from hearing the person concerned herself , or if there were any circumstances mentioned in the second sentence of LAW of the ORG ( hearing the person concerned would cause significant damage to his or her health , or he or she is clearly not able to express his or her will ) , pertinent reasons should have been set out in the decision . However , the aforementioned violation of the norms of procedure is not so important that it would result in quashing the ruling .
