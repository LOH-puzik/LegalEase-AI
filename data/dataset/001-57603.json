ORG During TIME DATE , Miss Y was woken up by a certain Mr. B , the son - in - law of the directress ; he lived with his wife on the LOC of the institution although he was not employed there . Mr. PERSON forced the girl to follow him to his room , to undress and to have sexual intercourse with him .", "This incident , which occurred on DATE after Miss Y \u2019s sixteenth birthday , had traumatic consequences for her , causing her major mental disturbance .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , Mr. PERSON went to the local police station to file a complaint and to ask for criminal proceedings to be instituted .", "The police officer said that since Mr. PERSON considered his daughter unable to sign the complaint because of her mental condition , he could do so himself . The statement lodged by Mr. PERSON read as follows : \" In my capacity as father I denounce the offences committed by Mr. B on the person of my daughter . I am doing this because she can not do so herself , since , although DATE , she is mentally and intellectually still a child . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The police officer drew up a report and it was signed by Mr. PERSON ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . The officer subsequently informed the public prosecutor \u2019s office that in the light of the father \u2019s statement and of his own observations concerning the girl \u2019s mental condition , she did not seem to him capable of filing a complaint herself . According to the headmaster of the school she was attending and another teacher there , she was unable to express her wishes concerning the institution of proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

In ORG view , the father \u2019s complaint ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) could not be regarded as a substitute for the complaint which the girl , being over DATE , should have lodged herself , although the police had regarded her as incapable of doing so ; since in the instant case no one was legally empowered to file a complaint , there was on this point a gap in the law , but it could not be filled by means of a broad interpretation to the detriment of Mr. PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG By virtue of LAW , there was no possibility of appealing on a point of law to ORG ( PERSON ) against this decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG As regards sexual offences , LAW makes a distinction between rape ( LAW ) and indecent assault ( LAW ) , recourse to physical violence also being a constituent element of the latter offence .", "CARDINAL .
