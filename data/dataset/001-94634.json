NORP In DATE a certain PERSON converted an attic above the applicant 's flat into a flat and , without the required permit , moved in .

NORP In DATE the applicant instituted administrative proceedings . She sought a demolition order in relation to the unauthorised flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the mayor of ORG gave a decision ordering the compulsory demolition \u201c of the constituent elements of the flat \u201d and imposing on the co - owners of the building an obligation to restore the attic to its former condition ( przywr\u00f3cenie stanu poprzedniego ) .", "CARDINAL .

The obligations arising from the final judgment of ORG were not performed by the co - owners .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the administrative enforcement authority , namely the ORG ( Powiatowy Inspektor Nadzoru Budowlanego ) , sent a reminder to the co - owners to perform their obligations imposed by the final and enforceable decision of the ORG .

It appears that the applicant 's lawyer 's complaint remained ineffective .", "CARDINAL .

The court found that the decisions of the administrative authorities at first and second instance dismissing the applicant 's complaint about the excessive length of the enforcement proceedings had been given in accordance with the relevant provisions . It further found that the administrative authorities had conducted the proceedings \u201c without undue delay \u201d and that the enforcement could not be performed because PERSON still lived in the flat in question and had refused to leave it . Therefore , the persons responsible for enforcement of the final decision had to institute civil proceedings for termination of the lease agreement with PERSON and the proceedings were still pending , which constituted an objective obstacle to enforcement .", "CARDINAL .
