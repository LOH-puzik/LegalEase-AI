NORP The applicants\u2019 appeal against the decision of CARDINAL DATE and the accompanying request for a provisional measure were rejected on DATE by the provisional measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE , who upheld the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision and reasoning .

NORP The applicants\u2019 further appeal to ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG was rejected on DATE . The ORG found that the appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling ( kan niet tot vernietiging PERSON aangevallen uitspraak leiden ) . Having regard to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , no further reasoning was called for as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring a determination in the interest of legal unity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense .

CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ( extracts ) ) .", "CARDINAL . In their reply of DATE , the Government indicated that , following the LOC judgment and where a case concerned a transfer of a family with minor children to GPE , the GPE authorities would only transfer such a family after guarantees had been obtained from the NORP authorities that the family would remain together and that information was available about the specific facility where the family was to be accommodated , in order to guarantee that the conditions there were suited to the age of the children . For this reason , the actual transfer to GPE was announced DATE beforehand in order to give the NORP authorities the opportunity to provide information on the specific facility where the family was to be accommodated , to guarantee that the conditions in this facility were suitable and to guarantee that the family would not be split up . If these guarantees were not received within the time - limit for transfers as laid down in the Dublin Regulation , the persons involved would be channelled into the GPE asylum procedure . However , as long as a Rule CARDINAL indication was in place , the Government was not in a position to commence the preparations for the applicants\u2019 transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 comments in reply were submitted on DATE .

By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the Government submitted a copy of a circular letter dated DATE and sent by ORG of the NORP ORG ( GPE dell GPE ) to the GPE Units of the other member GPE of ORG , in which ORG set out the new policy of the NORP authorities on transfers to GPE of families with small children . In its relevant part , ORG letter reads as follows :", "\u201c A new policy was considered necessary in view of the fact that reception facilities , specifically reserved for such families , frequently remained unavailed of as a result of families having left for an unknown destination prior to transfer , or having obtained a court order barring their transfer . In order to safeguard appropriate facilities where families may stay together , the NORP authorities earmarked a total of CARDINAL places , distributed over CARDINAL projects under ORG ( ORG ) . The authorities confirmed that this number will be extended should the need arise . As may be inferred from the letter of DATE , this comprehensive guarantee is intended to avoid the need for guarantees in specific cases .", "ORG will continue to inform its NORP counterpart at an early stage of an intended transfer of a family with minor children . On DATE , the NORP , NORP and NORP migration liaison officers to GPE issued a report on ORG in general , including on the requirements the accommodations must fulfil , and on CARDINAL projects they had visited on the invitation of ORG . It is understood that DATE also ORG ( ORG ) will report on the matter .", "The Government is of the opinion that the new NORP policy will adequately safeguard that families with minor children are kept together in accommodations appropriate to their needs . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants informed the ORG that they had been notified on DATE that they should report to the police for the purpose of their placement in GPE detention ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) for the purpose of their transfer to GPE .

The Government submitted their replies on DATE . They informed the ORG that the ORG removal had been scheduled for DATE , that the NORP authorities had been informed that the transfer concerned a single mother with CARDINAL adult and CARDINAL minor daughter . They further submitted a copy of the standard form \u2013 prescribed under LAW ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL of ORG and of ORG establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the member ORG responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the member GPE by a third - country national or a stateless person \u2013 in which the NORP authorities had been notified on DATE of the applicants\u2019 transfer to GPE . Under the heading \u201c State of health of the person(s ) to be transferred \u201d the following is stated :", "\u201c Please note that this concerns a mother with CARDINAL daughters , of which one is a minor ( LOC ) .

NORP The applicants\u2019 comments on the Government \u2019s submissions of CARDINAL and DATE were submitted on DATE . They considered that the new policy set out in the circular letter sent by the NORP authorities on DATE only contained guarantees of a general nature and that it was likely that the CARDINAL places referred to in that letter would be far from enough . They submitted that no individual guarantees had been obtained and that it had not been guaranteed that the first applicant would be provided with adequate mental health care .
