{"ITEMID": "001-67643", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "WARD v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE .", "The applicant is a traveller who , since DATE , has lived with his family in a caravan on ORG . This site was established as an official local authority site in DATE under the duty to provide gypsy sites contained in GPE DATE . The site is now leased by ORG of GPE and ORG and managed by ORG and GPE . It is located beneath CARDINAL flyovers that make up part of the motorway bridge known as the ORG leading from FAC in GPE . A railway line also passes nearby . Plots CARDINAL and CARDINAL were directly under the flyover , the carriageways to the east and west were separated from the site by a concrete barrier and vehicles passed within QUANTITY of residential caravans .", "Virtually since the opening of the site , the applicant has been campaigning for its relocation because of the pollution and noise , coming from the adjacent highways .", "In DATE CARDINAL independent ORG inspected the site and concluded :", "\" The present conditions are unsatisfactory , and are prejudicial to health within the meaning of s. CARDINAL of LAW DATE .", "Environmental issues , such as rat infestations , lead levels in dust and noise levels , smells and nuisance from adjoining LOC are largely beyond the control of the managing authority . In our opinion the site is not suitable for residential occupation . The original decision to locate the site in such a position fails any commonsense assessment of the suitability of the environment . \"", "They noted that while a number of items could be remedied by works , for example , site drainage , other problems , such as , nitrous oxide poisoning and noise levels resulted from the site 's location and could not be remedied .", "Following the coming into force of LAW DATE , the applicant instructed his solicitors to obtain an updated environmental report from the CARDINAL officers who produced the DATE report . This was finalised in DATE and confirmed the earlier conclusion that it was not a suitable location for a gypsy site . The CARDINAL experts noted that lead levels had dropped since DATE due to a ban on leaded petrol and this was no longer a ground of concern . It found the residents at the site were being exposed to nitrogen dioxide levels above the air quality objective of QUANTITY ( a mean concentration in DATE of CARDINAL and in DATE of CARDINAL ) . The report noted that air pollution in GPE was unlikely to cause any serious health effects in the population as a whole but that young children , the elderly or those suffering from respiratory problems might be more sensitive to air pollution . No formal measurement of noise levels was made but it was noted that road traffic noise was intrusive and almost continuous during both their visits . Given the location between major roads and adjacent to a railway they recommended formal monitoring of noise levels be undertaken .", "The applicant presented the report to ORG and renewed requests for relocation of the site , invoking arguments under LAW .", "By letter of DATE , ORG responded to the applicant 's complaints stating that the alleged treatment failed to satisfy the degree of severity for a breach of LAW and that no claim arose under LAW as it would be akin to interpreting the provision as requiring a right to be given a home . It denied that it was under any duty to provide a new site .", "The Royal Borough obtained that year Government approval of a major grant for PERCENT of the total expenditure for refurbishment of the site then estimated at GBP CARDINAL .", "The applicant commenced judicial review proceedings in DATE .", "On DATE , the High Court judge refused the application on the ground of delay .", "Following a hearing on DATE , ORG dismissed his appeal . Lord Justice PERSON noted the delay in bringing the proceedings :", "\u201c In this case it seems to me that the important issue is the delay in bringing the proceedings . From DATE the rights under LAW DATE were established . Mr Ward was being advised by his present solicitors ... In DATE he was also being advised by [ counsel ] who appeared before us . There was no doubt as to the nature of his rights . The only excuse put forward for the delay until DATE was the time taken to get this report . However the report itself , although detailed , is reiterating matters which [ the applicant ] had been asserting for DATE . The council has had its own reports in DATE which showed as a matter of principle that there were major problems with the site .", "It seems to me that during this time the council was , to [ the applicant 's ] knowledge presumably , putting forward major proposals for refurbishment with the support of the majority of the residents . It was crucial that , if there was some legal error in the way the council approached it , it should be established as soon as possible . In my view the judge was right to refuse permission on the ground of delay . I see no arguable basis for appeal . \u201d", "Concerning the substantive issues , he held :", "\u201c .. The problem in this case is that it is accepted that , as a result of changes in the law since LAW , the council is under no duty to provide [ the applicant ] with a site here or anywhere else . In those circumstances , it seems difficult to see that he can argue for a right to be relocated to another and better site . If the argument is right , it is difficult to see what distinction there would be between [ the applicant ] and any other inhabitant of a caravan or a house who is concerned about pollution levels in his home .", "In my view , there is nothing in NORP law or , more particularly the cases we have been shown , which provides any support for such a claim . Under LANGUAGE law , [ the applicant ] has potential remedies under LAW which do not seem to have been activated . As I understand from the evidence , the council is taking active measures to improve the site .", "The more general problems about which [ the applicant ] complains are the pollution levels , nitrogen dioxide and noise . Those are problems which , unhappily , are shared by a number of urban sites . The council 's ORG has acknowledged the problems but considers they do not cause unacceptable conditions ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
