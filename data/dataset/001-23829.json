FRANCE [Extracts]", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in LOC . He is a philosopher and a writer as well as a former politician . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON , of ORG .", "The applicant explained that he had written many books and essays on , among other things , history , philosophy and NORP issues , but also on religion and the dialogue of civilisations . Having been a politician , a NORP humanist and then a NORP humanist , he subsequently converted to ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant published a book entitled The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics , which was distributed through non - commercial outlets by GPE vieille taupe publishers and subsequently republished at the applicant 's own expense in DATE and DATE by PERSON . DATE CARDINAL criminal complaints , together with applications to join the proceedings as civil parties , were lodged against the applicant for denying crimes against humanity , publishing racially defamatory statements and inciting to racial or religious hatred or violence . The complaints concerned various passages from both editions of the book and were lodged by associations of former Resistance members , deportees and human rights organisations . The investigating judge 's office started CARDINAL judicial investigations in respect of the CARDINAL complaints . Other associations subsequently sought leave to join the proceedings as civil parties . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor also opened a judicial investigation in respect of the applicant on a charge of denying crimes against humanity .", "In CARDINAL orders made by the investigating judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance on DATE , the applicant was committed to stand trial before that court for CARDINAL offences . CARDINAL separate sets of proceedings were thus referred to the trial courts . The proceedings concerned CARDINAL different editions of and different passages from the applicant 's book . At each stage of the different proceedings the courts gave judgment on DATE during the same hearing and each party addressed them once in respect of all CARDINAL cases . The courts were composed of the same judges , who examined the CARDINAL cases at each stage but gave CARDINAL different decisions .", "...", "On DATE a criminal complaint and application to join the proceedings as a civil party was lodged by ORG and Interned Members of the Resistance and the National Federation of Deported and Interned Members of the Resistance for denial of crimes against humanity . The complaint was lodged not only against the applicant , but also against Mr PERSON , the editorial director of GPE vieille taupe , for publishing the applicant 's book in DATE , LAW ( pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) of which were the subject of the complaint .", "Basing his decision on sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL paragraph , CARDINAL bis , DATE and CARDINAL et seq . of the Freedom of the Press Act of DATE , CARDINAL of the investigating judges at the GPE tribunal de grande instance made an order on DATE committing the applicant and Mr PERSON for trial before that court on the charges of denying , and aiding and abetting the denial of a crime against humanity respectively .", "On DATE the court acquitted the defendants on the charges and dismissed the civil parties ' claims . Noting that \u201c section CARDINAL bis [ of the LAW DATE ] refers ... expressly to the means of publication set out in section CARDINAL \u201d and that \u201c publication is therefore CARDINAL of the constituent elements of the offence \u201d , the court held that \u201c publication must have been proved and be imputable to the defendant \u201d . The court found that the prosecution had failed to adduce sufficient proof that the DATE edition had been published within the meaning of section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE . As publication had not been established , the offence had not been made out and the court did not examine the merits of the prosecution .", "The applicant had asked the court to refer a preliminary question to ORG on the compatibility of section CARDINAL bis of the Act of DATE with ORG , particularly LAW . Pointing out that the LAW was directly applicable in GPE , the court declared the applicant 's proposed preliminary question inadmissible .", "The public prosecutor and CARDINAL civil - party associations appealed against the judgment of the GPE tribunal de grande instance .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG set aside the lower court 's judgment and sentenced the applicant to a suspended term of DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( FRF ) . It awarded the civil parties damages of MONEY . Mr PERSON was given a suspended term of DATE imprisonment and fined ORG CARDINAL . The court also ordered publication in ORG of the announcement of Mr PERSON 's conviction for publishing the applicant 's book .", "Basing its decision on section CARDINAL bis of the Act of DATE and the reference text to which it refers , namely LAW , which defines crimes against humanity , the court held that the constituent elements of the offence of denying crimes against humanity had been made out .", "It found , firstly , that the publication element had been made out because the book had been made available to the public on payment of a subscription .", "It then examined the question raised by the applicant of the compatibility of section CARDINAL bis of the LAW of DATE with LAW . It confirmed that it was compatible with that provision , as follows :", "\u201c LAW has to be interpreted in the light of the provisions of LAW , according to which none of its provisions may be interpreted as implying any right to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of the rights and freedoms set forth in the LAW .", "Firstly , section CARDINAL bis falls within ' the measures necessary in a democratic ORG ' for the protection of the rights of others , provided for in LAW , as it concerns the protection of the rights of the NORP ' victims in terms of ensuring and safeguarding the respect due to their memory . Moreover , a witness , PERSON , referred to ' the offensiveness of denying the survivors the true reasons for their suffering and the dead the true reasons for their death ' .", "Secondly , section CARDINAL bis of the Act of DATE is aimed at preventing or punishing the public denial of facts that have been the subject of a final ruling by ORG and relate to events that are totally incompatible with the values of ORG LAW .", "With regard to the submission based on PERSON and GPE , the court notes that ORG has twice ruled on the question of the application of Article CARDINAL to crimes against humanity :", "\u00a7 CARDINAL : NORP ' ... [ the case ] does not belong to the category of clearly established historical facts \u2013 such as the Holocaust \u2013 whose negation or revision would be removed from the protection of LAW . '", "\u00a7 CARDINAL : NORP ' There is no doubt that , like any other remark directed against the Convention 's underlying values , the justification of a pro - NORP policy could not be allowed to enjoy the protection afforded by LAW . '", "This submission can not therefore succeed . \u201d", "Expressing itself as follows , the court found that the constituent elements of the offence of denying crimes against humanity had been made out :", "\u201c Having regard to the evidence produced in the case and to the submissions before the court , it appears that PERSON intention , in his book , is to deny that a ' final solution ' , in the sense of people 's extermination , of the NORP question was organised . He also denies the method used , which was to send those unable or no longer able to work to their death in the gas chambers and incinerate their bodies .", "PERSON demonstration is structured around CARDINAL themes : questioning the conditions in which the facts have been studied and questioning the facts themselves . \u201d", "With regard to his questioning of the conditions in which the facts have been studied , the court noted the following points :", "\u201c ( i ) Trivialisation of the facts : In respect of an event that has been regarded as exceptional \u2013 that of the destruction of human beings by reason of their membership of a race \u2013 PERSON makes a number of comparisons with the aim of trivialising the crime , firstly by comparing it to acts for which he blames the allies and , secondly , by drawing parallels with other historical events .", "After reiterating a number of PERSON 's comments on the fate that should have been reserved to NORP in the First World War ... and that in the event of a Second World War ' the result ... would be ... the annihilation of the NORP race in LOC ... ' ( page CARDINAL ) , PERSON states , on page CARDINAL : ' Neither PERSON , nor PERSON , nor PERSON was among the war criminals in the dock . Nor were any of the perpetrators of the very worst incitements to commit crime ... the incitement to commit a \u201c genocide \u201d , in the true sense of the word this time , made in DATE in the book by the NORP , PERSON ... ' ; then in a footnote and on page CARDINAL : ' ... neither the NORP - American leaders responsible for the GPE bombing ... nor PERSON , the perpetrator of the atomic apocalypse of GPE and GPE ... was among the accused at the GPE trials ... '", "Regarding the numbers involved ( on page CARDINAL ) : ' Hitlerian domination is thus incorrectly described in certain propaganda as a \u201c pogrom \u201d of which the NORP were allegedly the principal , if not the only , victims . It was a human catastrophe which , unfortunately , is not without precedent since PERSON dealt with whites in the same way as NORP colonialists had dealt with \u201c coloureds \u201d for DATE . '", "( ii ) Pejoration of the facts : In his book PERSON indicates the need for a debate : ( page CARDINAL ) ' As long as there is no academic and public debate between specialists of equal calibre on the report by the engineer PERSON , and the GPE report ... doubt and even scepticism will remain . ' This process , which he presents as one of historical exactitude , is in fact coupled with another process , which , by the terms used , consists in portraying the question of the systematic and massive extermination of NORP as a sham . Thus the words ' gas chambers ' , ' genocides ' and ' holocausts ' are put in quotation marks and presented as an ' unexpected alibi ' ... , ' a myth dressed up as history and the political mileage gained from it ' , ' the myth of CARDINAL exterminated NORP that has become a dogma justifying and lending sanctity ( as indicated by the very word Holocaust ) to every act of violence ' ( page CARDINAL ) .", "Although the word ' myth ' can mean a symbolic representation , it appears from the context here that it is used to mean an untruth .", "The author uses the same reasoning on the subject of the gas chambers , referring to the ' spectre of the gas chambers ' ( page CARDINAL ) , and the crematoriums : ' there are crematoriums in all the big cities , in GPE ( at the PERSON - Lachaise ) , in GPE , and in all the major capitals and these incinerations evidently do not signify an intention to exterminate people ' ( page CARDINAL ) . That comparison removes any association with their use in the NORP camps .", "His approach is backed up by derisory comments regarding a number of terms used to refer to the events in question . Films on the subject are described as ' PERSON business ' or ' fictional picture strips ' . The ORG has heard the parties ' submissions regarding the origin of that term but , whatever it may be , the term has indeed been used in the instant case to describe the events in question as a fiction .", "( iii ) Discrediting the relevant institutions and witness evidence : PERSON refers to ORG in terms which systematically call into question its legitimacy and undermine its actions . Hence the heading , on page CARDINAL : ' The Myth of the Nuremberg Trials ' ; on page CARDINAL : ' It is not an international tribunal since it is composed only of victors and , consequently , the only crimes to be judged are those committed by the vanquished ' ; and on page CARDINAL : ' the victors disguised in judges ' gowns . ' With regard to the FAC trial , which concerned the same subjects , a parallel is drawn on page CARDINAL with ' witch hunts ' ...", "As regards the photos from ORG , which PERSON produced before the ORG again , ' they also rule out the possibility that such extermination could have occurred at the same time in any \u201c secret \u201d part of the \u201c camp \u201d ' ( page CARDINAL ) .", "In this context , the report by the engineer PERSON , which denies the existence of the gas chambers , is presented as one of the only reports which ' would , if seriously and publicly debated , put an end to the controversy ' .", "( iv ) Disputing the meaning of words such as overall solution , final solution ... : The defendant interprets these words every time as a solution to which recourse will be had only after the war ( pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Besides that , he considers that the only correct interpretation of these words is a geographical CARDINAL : a deportation to GPE or to the east of the NORP continent . \u201d", "On the denial of crimes against humanity the court made the following findings :", "\u201c PERSON denies the nature of the final solution and disputes the number of NORP victims and the cause of their deaths .", "\u2013 Regarding the nature of the final solution : In PERSON view , ' ... no one has ever been able to produce proof that , for the NORP , the \u201c final solution \u201d of the NORP problem meant extermination ' ( page CARDINAL ) .", "He infers , however , from a number of quotations from various texts that this solution was in fact their exile :", "Regarding a letter from PERSON to ORG : ' \u201c The only final solution \u201d thus consisted in ridding LOC of its NORP by deporting them in ever larger numbers until the war ( presuming we win it ) allows them all to be put in a ghetto outside LOC ( as first suggested in the GPE plan ) ' ( page CARDINAL ) .", "Regarding a document referred to as LAW , which gives an account of a meeting of NORP dignitaries : ' There is no question of gas chambers or of extermination in this document , but only of transferring NORP to LOC ( page CARDINAL ) .", "Regarding a document written by PERSON : ' ... he defined , DATE , ... what he had already described as his \u201c ultimate goal \u201d , \u201c deportation of the NORP \u201d . That was his \u201c ultimate goal \u201d until his death , as was the fight against \u201c Bolshevism \u201d , which ultimately got the better of him ' ( page CARDINAL ) .", "The defendant suggests that the very idea of the NORP ' destruction is implausible because it would have been inefficient : ' He [ PERSON ] is driven to mobilising extra troops by withdrawing the factory workforce , and was allegedly so fatally obsessed with his war effort that he took to exterminating prisoners and NORP , rather than employing them , albeit in inhuman conditions , on his work sites . ' After PERSON referred to the ' crazy and fanciful ' nature of that comment , PERSON writes , ' What is even stranger is that people as shrewd as PERSON or PERSON had such fixed ideas that they failed to reconsider their surrealist theories ' ( pages CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) ...", "\u2013 Regarding the number of victims and the cause of their deaths : In numerous passages Mr PERSON disputes at the same time the number of NORP deaths , the cause of their deaths and the use of gas chambers to kill them .", "Regarding the number of deaths , on page CARDINAL : ' .... we will endeavour to examine one of the untruths which still , after CARDINAL a century , gains the most ground across the world DATE and not only in LOC : the myth of the CARDINAL NORP that has become a dogma . '", "The title of a chapter on page CARDINAL : ' The myth of the Holocaust . '", "In PERSON view , the deaths were caused by the deportations : ' That was when they suffered the most , not only in the way that all civilians suffer in times of war ... but also forced labour ... to serve the NORP war effort ... Lastly , epidemics , such as typhus , seriously ravaged the concentration camp population , who were malnourished and reduced to a state of exhaustion ... Is it therefore necessary to resort to other methods to explain the terrible incidence of death among the victims of this treatment ... ' ( page CARDINAL ) .", "The manner in which the author denies the existence of the gas chambers has already been indicated . The following are examples of more specific denials .", "On page lCARDINAL : ' \u201c Gas chambers \u201d therefore had to be added to the crematoriums to establish the dogma of extermination by fire . '", "On page CARDINAL ( passage not included as such in the charge , but referred to here on account of the context ) : ' When it was proved , despite a considerable number of \u201c eyewitnesses \u201d to the existence of \u201c gas chambers \u201d , that they had never existed in GPE , it became necessary , in similarly arbitrary manner , to continue to affirm as undeniable identical evidence of their existence in the eastern camps . '", "Lastly , the court held :", "During the hearings , PERSON was invited to address the ORG on all the issues which have just been examined . This was done in the light of his previous statements both before the investigating judge and the trial courts , which were read out to the court in full .", "He maintained the content and import of those statements , which themselves confirmed the passages in respect of which he had been prosecuted . He indicated , among other things , that his purpose was to combat the risks posed by NORP .", "Before the ORG the defendant reiterated , among other things , that there was no proof that the final solution meant the extermination of the NORP , ... denied the existence of gas chambers in FAC , confirmed that he disputed the figure of CARDINAL dead . ...", "It can be established from all the foregoing evidence that Mr PERSON has committed the offence of denying crimes against humanity . \u201d", "The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment . In his submission , prosecuting him on the charge of denying crimes against humanity within the meaning of section CARDINAL bis of the Act of DATE did not fall within the exceptions authorised by LAW since his book was a politically polemical work that was devoid of any racist purpose and did not set out to deny the existence of NORP crimes .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal on the following grounds :", "\u201c In declaring the defendant guilty , on the grounds reproduced in the appeal , of the offence of denying crimes against humanity on account of several passages from his book The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics , ORG , which did not exceed the limits of the case as referred to it , justified its decision .", "Having regard to the terms employed in the passages complained of and also to extrinsic elements contained in other parts of the book , the judges properly evaluated the significance and impact of the comments in question .", "LAW , which guarantees the principle of the freedom of expression , provides in its second paragraph for certain restrictions or penalties , as are prescribed by law , which constitute necessary measures in a democratic society for the prevention of disorder and the protection of the rights of others . That is the purpose of section CARDINAL bis of the Act of DATE .", "Lastly , denial of the existence of crimes against humanity falls within the provisions of section CARDINAL bis of the Act of DATE , even where presented indirectly or in terms expressing doubts or by insinuation . The offence is also made out where , on the pretext of attempting to ascertain an alleged historical truth , the aim is to deny the crimes against humanity committed by the NORP against the NORP community ; that was the case here .", "The submission must therefore fail . \u201d", "On DATE ORG from GPE lodged a criminal complaint , together with an application for leave to join the proceedings as a civil party , against Samiszdat PERSON publishers and the applicant for the offence of denying crimes against humanity . The complaint concerned the entire second edition of the applicant 's book .", "After being committed for trial before the GPE tribunal de grande instance in an order of DATE , the applicant was then convicted .", "On DATE the court found the applicant guilty of denying crimes against humanity and sentenced him to a fine of ORG CARDINAL . It awarded the civil parties MONEY in damages and compensation of ORG CARDINAL . After examining the relevant passages , the court noted :", "\u201c It thus appears that , far from confining himself to political or ideological criticism of NORP and the actions of ORG DATE criticism that is perfectly legal under the legislation governing freedom of expression DATE or even giving an objective account of revisionist arguments and merely calling , as he claims , for a ' public and academic debate ' on the historical event constituted by the gas chambers , PERSON has subscribed to those theories and engaged in a virulent and systematic denial of the existence of the crimes against humanity committed against the NORP community , as adjudged by ORG .", "The offence under LAW bis has therefore been made out . \u201d", "The applicant , the public prosecutor and CARDINAL civil - party associations appealed against the judgment of the GPE tribunal de grande instance .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the lower court 's judgment and added a suspended term of DATE imprisonment . The court based its decision on reasoning analogous to that in the judgment delivered on DATE in the first set of proceedings .", "As in the first set of proceedings , the applicant appealed to ORG against that judgment .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal for reasons identical to those of the judgment delivered on the same date in the first set of proceedings .", "Following an investigation opened at the request of the public prosecutor at the GPE tribunal de grande instance , the applicant was committed for trial before that court in an order of DATE .", "On DATE , after examining the passages in respect of which the applicant was being prosecuted , the court found him guilty of the offence of denying crimes against humanity and sentenced him to a fine of FRF CARDINAL . It awarded the civil parties MONEY in damages and FRF CARDINAL in compensation . The court also ordered publication of the operative provisions of its judgment in ORG of GPE .", "The applicant , the public prosecutor and CARDINAL civil - party associations appealed against that judgment .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the aforementioned judgment and added a suspended term of DATE imprisonment .

In an order of DATE the applicant was committed for trial before the GPE tribunal de grande instance .", "On DATE the court , basing its decision on sections CARDINAL , DATE , first paragraph , and DATE , second paragraph , of the LAW of DATE after examining the passages in question , found the applicant guilty of the offence of publicly defaming a group of persons ( the NORP community ) and sentenced him to a fine of ORG CARDINAL . It awarded the civil parties MONEY in damages and compensation in the amounts of FRF CARDINAL , FRF CARDINAL and ORG .", "The applicant , the public prosecutor and CARDINAL civil - party associations appealed against the judgment of the GPE tribunal de grande instance .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the aforementioned judgment , adding a suspended term of DATE imprisonment and ordering the payment of ORG to PERSON for the legal costs it had incurred .", "In its judgment the court found as follows :", "\u201c Contrary to his [ the applicant 's ] allegations , the charge of defaming the NORP community is not based on the criticism of the policies pursued by ORG \u2013 only rarely mentioned as such , moreover , in the book in question \u2013 but the substance of the book as constituted by the passages that form the basis of the prosecution 's case . The explicit and avowed aim of the book is the description of what the author calls the ' founding myths ' of that policy , those myths being presented as deliberate distortions of history ( ' myth of the CARDINAL ' ) or mystifications for political ends ... by the NORP ( ' the NORP - Zionist lobbies in GPE and GPE ) who were ' the major beneficiaries ' , in order to legalise all their external and internal acts of violence by placing themselves above the law and endangering world unity and peace . \u201d", "The court found that the passages referred to , whether taken alone or as part of the whole book , \u201c seriously harm[ed ] the NORP community as a whole , as the lower courts [ had ] properly decided \u201d .
