The second article suggested that Judge PERSON had applied for her resignation fearing an inquiry into her deeds .", "Judge PERSON sued the applicant for defamation . She submitted that the applicant \u2019s assertions about her having unlawfully obtained a better housing were of a libellous nature . She considered defamatory the following extract from the first article :", "\u201c The PERSON on the Status of Judges in GPE is applied selectively in LOC and its application is related not only to the high status of judges , but also to their office ... thus it may be understood that the equality of all [ citizens ] before law and courts ends where we talk about judges themselves . Hence the rule is \u2018 the law is like a rudder , it goes where you bend it\u2019 . \u201d", "Judge PERSON also regarded the following passages from the second article as defamatory :", "\u201c ... on having received a new flat , [ Judge PERSON ] should have surrendered the one she had occupied in the past . However , the \u2018 surrendering\u2019 only happened through privatisation [ of the old flat ] and its subsequent sale . In this way Judge PERSON dramatically \u2018 improved her living DATE now she has got a new flat of a bigger surface and money for the old one . \u201d", "\u201c Judge PERSON was forced to retire because of other circumstances ... A visit of a high - ranking official from ORG of GPE who came to investigate the complaints of Judge PERSON . [ concerning the termination of his powers ] has helped PERSON , the chairperson of the judges\u2019 qualification panel for LOC , to make a decision on her retirement . \u201d", "On DATE ORG ( GPE \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0439 PERSON \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 ) sent a letter to the President of ORG , of which the applicant was a member , requesting that the applicant \u2019s bar membership be annulled . The letter referred to the applicant as an unethical lawyer who had published articles of \u201c clearly libellous nature \u201d and who attempted to exercise \u201c illicit and immoral \u201d influence on Judge PERSON to have her action withdrawn . The letter contained the following passage :", "\u201c Realising the well - founded character of the action lodged and attempting to avoid a public declaration on the unlawfulness of his acts by a court decision , [ the applicant ] resorts to impermissible means , which violate the generally recognised moral standards , seeking to have [ Judge PERSON ] withdraw her claim in the court . \u201d", "On DATE the Presiding Committee of the Volgograd Bar passed a decision to annul the applicant \u2019s membership because of \u201c unethical performance of his duties \u201d .

The court also held that the headline of the first article \u201c Legitimised Judge \u201d was also damaging to Judge PERSON \u2019s reputation :", "\u201c The court considers that a mass reader knows from the press , television , literature and essays , as well as from one \u2019s personal experience , that the term \u2018 legitimised ORG [ \u0432\u043e\u0440 \u0432 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435 ] refers to a person with a long criminal record who enjoys respect and authority in the criminal milieu . The headline \u2018 ORG Judge\u2019 stylistically clearly alludes to the term \u2018 legitimised ORG and semantically it is implied here that the \u2018 ORG is a criminal . On this ground the court holds that the headline of the article damages honour , dignity and professional reputation of Judge PERSON because the [ applicant ] failed to produce any evidence of a breach of any laws by the plaintiff . \u201d", "The court held the applicant liable for MONEY ( \u201c RUR \u201d , approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant lodged a statement of appeal in which he contested the reasons of the judgment of DATE .
