Having compared the evidence given by the victims and the witnesses they had asked to be called , it noted differences which undermined the credibility of their version of the facts . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Wojew\u00f3dzki ) dismissed an appeal by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was prosecuted under LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) for an offence committed on DATE . On DATE the ORG asked for the applicant to be examined by CARDINAL psychiatrists in order to determine whether , at the material time , she had been in full possession of her mental faculties . The court grounded this request on the fact that the applicant was under treatment as an outpatient of the neurology centre and the fact that she had also been required to undergo a psychiatric examination in connection with another case . The examination was arranged for DATE . The applicant was duly informed of the appointment but did not attend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the consultation was put back to CARDINAL DATE , but did not take place on DATE because the applicant announced that she was seriously ill .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the PERSON district prosecutor decided to order the applicant to undergo a psychiatric examination at the FAC Targ hospital with a view to establishing whether she was suffering from a mental illness , whether at the material time she had been in full possession of her mental faculties and whether the fact that she was still at liberty posed a threat to public order . On DATE the applicant complained about the prosecutor 's decision .
