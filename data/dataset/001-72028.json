SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr U. Carlzon , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant was apprehended by the police on suspicion , inter alia , of aggravated drunken driving and driving without a driving licence .", "The applicant obtained a driving licence on DATE .", "Subsequently , on DATE , ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) of V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland informed the applicant that the ORG was considering whether to withdraw his driving licence until further notice in accordance with ORG ( k\u00f6rkortslagen CARDINAL ) on the ground of his suspected aggravated drunken driving ( grovt rattfylleri ) and unlawful driving ( olovlig k\u00f6rning ) on DATE . In that connection the ORG pointed out that , in the absence of a legally enforceable judgment or a summary punishment order or similar , the ORG could not take a definite decision on the matter .", "On DATE the ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tt ) convicted the applicant , notably under sections PERSON ) and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW ( trafikbrottslagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) of aggravated drunken driving , with an alcohol level of QUANTITY in his breath , and of driving without holding a driving licence .", "The ORG based the conviction on the applicant \u2019s own account according to which , in so far as he could recall , he had , from TIME on DATE , consumed QUANTITY of strong beer , CARDINAL gin and tonic and CARDINAL strong liquor ; on a report analysing the results of the breathalyser test carried out on TIME CARDINAL DATE ; on the records of his statement to the police on TIME , and on witness evidence . ORG did not find credible the applicant \u2019s statement made during the trial hearing that , because of his state of drunkenness , he could not recall having driven the car in question .", "As to sentencing , ORG observed that aggravated drunken driving was normally punishable by imprisonment . However , in view of the applicant \u2019s age , his personal circumstances and his agreeing to carry out community service , ORG found that a departure from normal practice was warranted , and imposed a suspended sentence together with CARDINAL ORG community service ( \u201c GPE dom med samh\u00e4lltj\u00e4nst femtio ( CARDINAL ) timmar \u201d ) . ORG added that should it instead have imposed a prison sentence , it would have sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment .", "No appeal was made against the above judgment , which became legally enforceable .", "On DATE ORG issued a further notification replacing the previous CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , informing the applicant that , in the light of the ORG judgment of DATE , which had acquired legal force , it intended to take a definite decision on the withdrawal of his driving licence ; the ORG gave the applicant until DATE to submit his comments .", "On DATE the ORG withdrew the applicant \u2019s driving licence . It took note of his submissions that he had used his driving licence blamelessly since it had been issued to him on DATE , and that he needed the driving licence in order to transport his sailing boat over long distances in order to take part in top - level regattas . However , referring to his conviction for aggravated drunken and unlawful driving on DATE by a judgment ( of DATE ) which had become legally enforceable , ORG stressed that the applicant had violated a rule which was essential for road safety . This transgression could not be viewed as minor . Having regard to the offence committed by the applicant , ORG found that withdrawal of the applicant \u2019s licence for DATE would not be possible and ordered that his licence be withdrawn for DATE .", "The applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision before ORG . He reiterated that , since DATE , he had used his driving licence without committing any further offence and that , in the circumstances , the withdrawal constituted double jeopardy , in breach of LAW , LAW and LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW .", "On DATE ORG refused a request by the applicant to stay execution of the withdrawal order . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE it dismissed his appeal , relying on the applicant \u2019s conviction of DATE and the relevant provisions in LAW . ORG considered a number of decisions from the Convention institutions\u2019 caselaw and concluded that no clear precedent existed that could invalidate the NORP system on the withdrawal of driving licences . Bearing in mind the damaging consequences a finding of incompatibility would have for road safety , ORG found no reasons for setting aside the ORG \u2019s decision to withdraw the applicant \u2019s driving licence .", "On DATE ORG , on an appeal by the applicant , upheld ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against the above judgment , which ORG dismissed on DATE . Its judgment contained the following reasons :", "\u201c [ The applicant \u2019s ] driving licence and driving licence permit have been withdrawn in accordance with LAW , sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of the Driving Licence Act ( DATE : CARDINAL ) on the grounds that he has been convicted of an aggravated offence of drunken driving and of unlawful driving by a legally binding judgment of the district court . The period of suspension has been set at DATE .", "The main issue in this case is whether the withdrawal of [ the applicant \u2019s ] driving licence is in conflict with the principle established under LAW No . CARDINAL to LAW ( \u201c LAW ) , according to which no one shall be liable to be tried or punished twice for the same offence ( ne bis in idem ) . [ The applicant \u2019s ] opinion in the matter is that the fact that his driving licence was withdrawn after the decision to convict him of a traffic offence means that he has been punished twice for the same matter .", "The European Convention - with the additions made , inter alia , in LAW DATE has been incorporated into NORP law by means of ORG .", "...", "The intended scope of LAW is unclear , as is the principle expressed therein . The wording of the article therefore provides no clear guidance as to whether the NORP system of driving licencerelated measures [ k\u00f6rkortsingripande ] might come into conflict with the LAW . Neither are there many legal precedents in this area .", "As to the various requirements set out in the LAW , it stipulates , first of all , that no one may be \u2018 PERSON more than once for an offence . The question here is whether the said withdrawal of the appellant \u2019s driving licence represents a punishment within the meaning of the Convention .", "Under NORP law , driving licencerelated measures have traditionally been implemented for trafficsafety reasons , that is , they have been regarded as a precautionary measure on the part of society aimed at drivers who jeopardise traffic safety . Hence , measures of this kind have not been regarded as a form of punishment . It is , however , difficult to argue that a decision to withdraw a driving licence because the licence - holder has committed an offence is purely a traffic - safety measure . As a rule , the period of suspension is calculated on a standardised basis in proportion to the seriousness of the offence \u2013 in the same way as the penalty . Hence , it is not based on an individual assessment of the likelihood of a repeat of conduct that might jeopardise traffic safety . This means that the decision to withdraw a driving licence \u2013 like the punishment for the traffic offence \u2013 is aimed at least in part at persuading the holder to respect existing traffic regulations . Over time , the distinction between precautionary measures and punishment has become increasingly unclear in cases of this kind ( see for example ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL p. CARDINAL , Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , Government PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . and ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "...", "Under LAW , section CARDINAL of the Driving Licence Act , a driving licence is withdrawn if any of CARDINAL criteria are met . CARDINAL of these criteria apply not to cases in which the licenceholder has committed an offence but to situations in which the holder is to be barred from holding a driving licence on grounds of unreliability as regards sobriety , illness , injury or similar circumstances . It should be made clear that the withdrawal of a driving licence in these cases is not to be considered as a punishment , and that cases of this kind are of no further interest in the present context . However , criteria DATE and CARDINAL are of interest , since they refer to cases where it is normally presupposed that the licence - holder has committed an offence . According to some of these criteria ( CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ) \u2013 except in the case of petty violations \u2013 a driving licence may be withdrawn simply on the grounds that the holder has committed one of the offences set out therein . This applies in the case of gross negligence when driving and drunken driving ( criterion CARDINAL ) , in cases where the driver leaves the scene of an accident ( criterion CARDINAL ) and in the event of a violation of a rule that is essential from the point of view of traffic safety ( criterion CARDINAL ) . In other cases ( criteria CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , certain other conditions must be met in addition to an offence having been committed . According to criterion CARDINAL , the driving licence is withdrawn if the licenceholder , through repeated offences , has shown a considerable lack of willingness or ability to comply with the regulations that apply in the interests of traffic or traffic safety for drivers of motor vehicles . According to criterion CARDINAL , the driving licence is withdrawn if it can be assumed DATE in the light of another offence which the holder has committed \u2013 that he or she will fail to respect traffic regulations or show consideration , judgement or responsibility on the road , or if he or she , on account of other personal circumstances , can not be considered suitable to be a driver of a vehicle requiring a driving licence .", "Under criteria CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE , therefore , a driving licence is withdrawn , in principle , as the direct result of an offence . As regards criteria CARDINAL ( repeated offences ) and CARDINAL ( other offences ) , however , it is not the criminal act alone , but the act taken in combination with other factors \u2013 willingness and ability to comply with existing regulations , to show respect for traffic regulations , judgement and responsibility on the road , or suitability with regard to personal circumstances \u2013 which constitutes the grounds for revoking the licence . In the light of the PERSON v. GPE case ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL ) , for example , the withdrawal of a driving licence under criteria CARDINAL , CARDINAL or DATE can be said to be closer in character to a punishment than withdrawal under criteria CARDINAL or CARDINAL . At the same time , the basic rationale for withdrawal is that a driving licence should be withdrawn if the holder is deemed unsuitable to hold a licence . Hence , the fact that the legislator has singled out certain offences as constituting grounds for withdrawal in their own right , while further criteria must be fulfilled in the case of other offences , does not mean that the act of revoking a driving licence should be characterised in different ways in different cases . A withdrawal under criteria CARDINAL or CARDINAL does not refer to a single offence but to several different offences or other circumstances . However , the same can also apply to withdrawals under criteria CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Of greater importance is the fact that the withdrawal is not an automatic consequence of the offence in question in any of these cases . Under LAW , section DATE and with the exception of certain drunkdriving offences \u2013 the licenceholder should be issued instead with a warning , if there are specific reasons to assume that a warning can be regarded as sufficient . Under LAW , LAW , subsection CARDINAL , if exceptional circumstances exist which warrant departing from the LAW , withdrawal can be avoided or the suspension period reduced if this can be done without jeopardising road safety . If the driving licence is not withdrawn , a warning may be issued instead .", "The regulation therefore means that , when examining a case of driving licencerelated measures under criteria CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE , other circumstances besides the actual offence need to be taken into account . This applies with regard both to the question of whether any action should be taken and DATE where applicable \u2013 to the question of the scope of such action , e .g . the suspension period . This suggests that , in assessing whether the withdrawal of a driving licence as a consequence of an offence is to be regarded as a punishment or a safety measure , no distinction should be made between the different cases dealt with here ( criteria DATE and CARDINAL ) on the basis of the grounds for withdrawal .", "Comparison of the NORP system of driving licence - related measures described above and the system that was assessed in the PERSON case reveals a clear difference , in that action under the NORP system is , in principle , not an automatic consequence of a conviction by the criminal court . However , the NORP system is also based largely on standard calculations , and driving licencerelated measures are consequently to a very great extent directly related to the degree of seriousness of the violation . The fact that a driving licencerelated measure , according to NORP legislation , is not an automatic consequence of a conviction by the criminal court can not therefore be said to distinguish the NORP system from the one assessed in the PERSON case in any decisive way . In assessing whether the driving licencerelated measure is to be regarded as a punishment , account should also be taken of the fact that , under the NORP system \u2013 as with the NORP system \u2013 the action taken may , to a certain degree , be considered to have a punitive and deterrent purpose .", "Before determining whether the withdrawal of a driving licence is to be regarded as a punishment , the LOC v. GPE judgment ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) should also be examined . In the LOC case , the ORG found that the temporary withdrawal of the applicant \u2019s driving licence for DATE on account of a suspected offence of drunken driving did not concern a criminal charge . Temporary withdrawals can also be effected under NORP driving - licence legislation . In fact , the legislation stipulates that the withdrawal of a driving licence in connection with an offence is to take place as soon as possible after the offence , and on the basis of a provisional decision . According to LAW , section CARDINAL of the Driving LAW , a driving licence should be confiscated by the police or a prosecutor , inter alia , if there is good reason to suppose that the driving licence will be withdrawn under LAW , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) . According to LAW , section CARDINAL of the Driving Licence Act , a driving licence is to be withdrawn until further notice pending a final decision on withdrawal , if there is good reason to believe that the driving licence will ultimately be withdrawn on any of the grounds set forth in LAW , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) .", "In the present case , ORG is not called upon to determine to what extent a provisional decision regarding a driving licencerelated measure represents a punishment or a safety measure . However , the fact that cases could arise under the NORP system which should be dealt with in the same way as the LOC case in the above - mentioned respect should not affect the assessment of how to characterise the final withdrawal of a driving licence .", "In view of this , ORG finds that the withdrawal of a driving licence in the cases referred to under criteria DATE and CARDINAL should be regarded as a punishment within the meaning of LAW .", "As is clear from the above , the fact that someone is punished again for an offence does not constitute sufficient grounds for the application of LAW . Other conditions must also be met ; for instance , the penalty must have been imposed ( or the case have been conducted ) in the context of \u2018 criminal proceedings\u2019 and the person in question must already have been \u2018 finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that ORG .", "First , as regards the term \u2018 criminal proceedings\u2019 ( NORP \u2018 p\u00e9nalement\u2019 ) , it would seem most logical at first sight to consider as criminal proceedings any proceedings which could lead to a sanction constituting a punishment .", "However , it is questionable whether such a far - reaching interpretation of LAW is intended . To begin with , it appears strange \u2013 if the above - mentioned interpretation were intended \u2013 to have included the term \u2018 criminal proceedings\u2019 at all in the provision ; its inclusion suggests that a limitation of its scope was intended ( see PERSON , PERSON ( ORG ) , no.CARDINAL/CARDINAL , p . CARDINAL ) . It should be recalled at this point that the court , in proceedings concerning driving licencerelated measures implemented for a traffic offence , makes no fresh examination of the offence . In other words , these are not criminal proceedings in the sense that the actual offence is examined . This suggests that the term \u2018 criminal proceedings\u2019 should be reserved for proceedings of the latter kind , that is , proceedings in which the offence is examined .", "Of interest in this context is the Explanatory Report to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL of which states :", "\u2018 LAW , since it only applies to trial and conviction of a person in criminal proceedings , does not prevent him from being made subject , for the same act , to action of a different character ( for example , disciplinary action in the case of an official ) as well as to criminal proceedings.\u2019", "It is therefore clear that disciplinary action , for instance against government officials , can fall outside the scope of LAW . However , the report does not provide any clear guidance on the question of how to distinguish between \u2018 criminal proceedings\u2019 and proceedings occasioned by an offence and which involve a sanction , but which nevertheless fall outside the scope of LAW . It should be stressed that the fact that disciplinary action is mentioned does not necessarily conflict with the view that legal proceedings are to be seen as criminal proceedings as soon as the sanction constitutes a punishment since , according to the caselaw of ORG , depending on the circumstances , disciplinary action can fall outside what is to be considered as a punishment for the purposes of Article CARDINAL . At the same time , it should be noted that the report does not present any obstacles to an interpretation to the effect that the NORP procedure concerning driving licence related measures falls outside the scope of LAW as an \u2018 action of a different character\u2019 .", "As to the condition that the person in question must already have been \u2018 finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that ORG the following should be emphasised . ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL compared with paragraph CARDINAL ) makes it clear that this means first and foremost that there must be a legally binding judgment on the matter . Looking at the wording of the LAW , however , it would seem logical to conclude that \u2013 in cases where the legislation in a country prescribes that an offence gives rise to sanctions under CARDINAL separate procedures \u2013 the person in question is finally convicted in accordance with national legislation only when both procedures have been completed .", "Hence , in this respect too , the provisions leave room for different interpretations ( see also ORG judgment of DATE in case no . B CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "As regards ORG position on these issues , the abovementioned PERSON case , inter alia , is of some interest . First , it should be pointed out that the action brought by PERSON was based on the fact that the system of automatic deduction of points DATE which did not allow him as a licence - holder to appeal to a court of law \u2013 had deprived him of his right of access to a court of law under LAW . As mentioned , the ORG found that the case did concern a criminal charge \u2013 and also a punishment DATE and that LAW was applicable . It is of particular interest in this context that the ORG found that the conditions laid down by LAW had been met by the judicial review which preceded the conviction by the court and that the ORG could not be considered to require a further examination by a court regarding the deduction of points . There was no statement to the effect that the NORP system \u2013 with its partly separate systems for ordinary penalties and driving licencerelated measures \u2013 might be incompatible with LAW . Also of interest is ORG decision on admissibility of CARDINAL DATE in GPE v. GPE ( application no . CARDINAL ) . The applicant ( R .T. ) had , in connection with a drunkdriving offence , first had his driving licence withdrawn by an administrative authority and then been sentenced to prison and a fine by another authority . After PERSON lodged an appeal against the decision to withdraw his licence , the decision was confirmed by an administrative court . The ORG found that there had been no repetition of criminal proceedings in breach of LAW , and stressed , inter alia , that the various sanctions DATE imprisonment , a fine and withdrawal of the applicant \u2019s driving licence \u2013 were envisaged by the national legislation .", "The withdrawal of a driving licence for a criminal offence should be regarded as a punishment within the meaning of LAW [ of LAW ] . Neither the wording of the provision nor the Explanatory Report gives any clear answer to the question whether NORP proceedings relating to the withdrawal of a driving licence are covered by the expression \u2018 criminal PERSON . Nor does it give a clear indication as to whether the holder of the driving licence should be regarded as having already been \u2018 finally ... convicted\u2019 of the traffic offence by virtue of a legally enforceable judgment by an ordinary court . In ORG view , the wording of both expressions suggests that both questions ought to be answered in the negative .", "In interpreting this LAW , one might also have regard to its purpose . It could be argued that an important safeguard for a person who is finally acquitted or convicted is that he or she should feel secure , in the sense that he or she should not be charged or punished again for the same offence . The NORP system implies that a person who is charged with a traffic offence is aware DATE or ought to be aware DATE from the outset that an enforceable judgment convicting him or her would normally be followed by measures with regard to his or her driving licence . The fact that the measure is taken in separate proceedings should not mean that considerations of security and legal safeguards are set aside . In other words , the NORP system does not appear to conflict with the purpose of LAW .", "A strong argument for considering that the NORP system of withdrawal of a person \u2019s driving licence for a traffic offence does not conflict with LAW may be found in the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON v. GPE and the above - mentioned admissibility decision in GPE v. GPE . ORG reasoning and conclusion in these cases \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that PERSON did not directly concern the application of LAW can only be interpreted to mean that the committing of a criminal offence can lead to different sanctions imposed by separate authorities and courts , if so provided by statute .", "Against this background , ORG concludes that Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL does not constitute an obstacle to applying the provisions of the Driving Licence Act .", "Like the lower courts , ORG finds that LAW , LAW on which [ the applicant ] also relies \u2013 is not applicable to drivinglicence cases . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
