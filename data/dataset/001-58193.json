In connection with an operation monitoring drug trafficking , CARDINAL plain - clothes officers of ORG ( PSP ) from the NORP police station approached an individual , FAC , on a number of occasions . He was suspected of petty drug trafficking in order to pay for drugs \u2013 mainly hashish DATE for his own consumption . They hoped that through GPE they would be able to identify his supplier and offered to buy QUANTITY of hashish from him . Unaware that they were police officers , ORG agreed to find a supplier . However , despite being pressed by the CARDINAL officers , he was unable to locate one .", "CARDINAL . Shortly before TIME on DATE the CARDINAL officers went to ORG home saying that they were DATE interested in buying heroin . PERSON mentioned the name of PERSON as being someone who might be able to find some ; however , he did not know the latter \u2019s address and had to obtain it from F.O. All CARDINAL then went to the applicant \u2019s home in the purported LOC car . The applicant came outside at ORG request and got into the car where the CARDINAL officers , accompanied by PERSON , were waiting .

Mr PERSON agreed to procure the heroin and , accompanied by PERSON , went in his own car to the home of another person , ORG The latter obtained CARDINAL sachets of heroin , one weighing QUANTITY grams and the other QUANTITY each , from someone else and , on his return , handed them over to the applicant in exchange for a payment , which , though the precise figure is not known , exceeded PTE CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then took the drugs to ORG home ; PERSON had in the meantime returned there and the CARDINAL police officers were waiting outside . The deal was to take place in the house .

The applicant was brought before an investigating judge at ORG DATE and was detained pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he applied for release . He argued that his detention was unlawful as it infringed Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention . In his submission , he had been detained as a result of the immoral and unlawful conduct of the QUANTITY police officers , since he had committed the offence solely and exclusively at their behest . They had acted as \u201c agents provocateurs \u201d , particularly as they had not been carrying out an anti - drug - trafficking operation pursuant to a court order .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It imposed a fine on ORG equivalent to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . The court considered that the use of an \u201c undercover \u201d agent or even an \u201c agent provocateur \u201d did not appear to be prohibited under domestic legislation , provided that the sacrifice of the accused \u2019s individual freedom was justified by the values that were being upheld . As the applicant had initially been approached by F.O. the conduct of the ORG officers had not been \u201c decisive \u201d in the commission of the offence . The court explained that it had reached its verdict on the basis of the statements of the witness , F.O. , the co - defendant , GPE , the applicant himself and , \u201c mainly \u201d , of the QUANTITY police officers .", "CARDINAL .

It was , however , only natural that that should have been the course adopted . The police officers knew that PERSON was a drug user and sought to unmask the person responsible for supplying him with drugs . No hashish being available , they tried to obtain heroin and met PERSON , who agreed to their false proposals because he aimed to make a profit out of the deal , thereby exploiting one of the major scourges of our time ...", "The PSP officers\u2019 perseverance was thus rewarded since they arrested the applicant in possession of what was already a considerable quantity of the drug .", "Moreover , as officers in the Public Security Police based at the NORP police station , the policemen ... were acting as criminal investigators ( LAW ) under the powers vested in them by statute enabling them , without referring to higher authority , to obtain information about offences , identify offenders and take any steps that were necessary and urgent to preserve evidence ( LAW ) .", "...", "Police officers ... act in criminal proceedings as officers of the court , but that does not prevent them taking , in special statutorily defined circumstances , procedural steps in the exercise of their own undelegated powers .", "As the public prosecutor said in his submissions , the ORG officers acted within the law and their conduct did not render the evidence obtained inadmissible .", "In these circumstances , PERSON appeal is wholly unfounded .", "In the light of these considerations ORG dismisses the appeal and upholds all the provisions of the judgment appealed against . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
