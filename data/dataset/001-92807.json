They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The applicants are spouses . In DATE they bought from the ORG municipality a ORG - owned apartment , which had been managed by the company C.", "On DATE the applicants bought from the municipality an attic room in the same building for CARDINAL old NORP levs ( \u201c BGL \u201d ) .", "Apparently , following the legal reforms of DATE ( see below , Relevant background facts , domestic law and practice ) , the company C. considered that it had become the owner of the attic room and on an unspecified date it granted the tenancy of the room to PERSON and PERSON", "In DATE the applicants brought a rei vindicatio action against PERSON and PERSON claiming the possession of the room .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the claim . On DATE ORG upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It found , inter alia , that the sale contract of DATE was null and void ab initio as it had not been signed by the mayor , as required by law , but by another official of the municipality . The applicants , thus , had not shown that they were the owners of the attic room .", "In the meanwhile , on DATE the company ORG sold the attic room to PERSON and PERSON", "On DATE the applicants brought an action against C. seeking back the price they had paid for the attic room in DATE , updated in accordance with the inflation indexes .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the claim finding that the DATE sale contract had been found to be null and void in proceedings , which had not involved the company C. ; it was not therefore bound by this founding of nullity .", "Upon appeal by the applicants , on DATE ORG reversed the judgment and held that the applicants were in principle entitled to recovery of the sum . It awarded them the amount they had paid for the attic in DATE , the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL . However , as a result of inflation and the depreciation of the NORP currency after DATE , the sum amounted to approximately LAW .", "In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim . It found that the action had been time - barred as the DATE time limit for seeking the recovery of what had been paid under a void contract started running from DATE of payment , which in this case had been in DATE .", "By section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , everyone who has paid a sum of money on a non - existent ground is entitled to seek its recovery . In a binding interpretative decision of DATE ORG ( now ORG ) held that the time - limit to bring such an action started running from the moment of payment ( ORG No . CARDINAL of the Plenary of ORG of CARDINAL DATE , case No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "In accordance with the NORP courts\u2019 established practice revalorisation of claims to reflect inflation and currency depreciation is not possible .", "Until DATE , all commercial assets were the property of the ORG and were only allocated to ORG enterprises for \u201c use and management \u201d . After the beginning of democratisation and economic change and the ensuing transformation of these enterprises into ORG - owned limited liability or joint stock companies , the transformed companies acquired ownership of real estate or other assets they had used and managed ( see , for more detail , the ORG \u2019s description of this transformation in the case of ORG and Others v.
