On DATE ORG of ORG held that the ORG was a \u201c community foundation \u201d whose charter had been definitively established in DATE . They also recalled that such foundations were only entitled to enter into transactions prescribed in their founding charter . Accordingly , ORG held that the foundation in question could not acquire property bequeathed to it by will given that the founding charter did not specify such a right .", "Consequently , shortly before her death in DATE , ORG sold her CARDINAL shops in GPE to the first CARDINAL applicants PERSON , PERSON and GPE . K , who are members of the ORG and donated the proceeds of this transaction to the ORG .", "On DATE , the ORG instituted civil proceedings against the applicants in ORG . The ORG declared to be sole beneficiary of ORG estate under LAW of LAW , which provides that the estate of a deceased person shall pass to the ORG if the person dies intestate and has no relatives .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 request for rectification of this decision .", "On DATE ORG applied the decision of DATE and decided to adjourn the case for the ORG to prove that it was entitled to pursue it .", "Later , the ORG submitted to the court a certificate of inheritance issued by ORG dated DATE to the effect that the ORG was the true beneficiary of the estate as ORG sister had predeceased her and that PERSON had no other living relatives . Accordingly , ORG decided to examine the merits of the case . After examining the expert report , the court stated that although there was a difference between the real value of the estate and the amount stated in the sales contract , this was not in itself sufficient to conclude that the applicants had acted under false pretences . Consequently , on DATE , the court dismissed the case on the ground that the ORG had failed to provide sufficient evidence in support of its claims .", "On DATE ORG quashed this judgment . Referring to the will signed on DATE and the expert report , which stated that there was a significant difference between the real value of the estates and the amount paid to ORG , ORG found that the first instance court had sufficient evidence before it to give a decision .", "On DATE the ORG request for rectification of this decision was rejected by ORG .", "", "On DATE ORG applied the decision of ORG . The court found that the sales contract had been signed under false pretences and accordingly annulled it . Consequently it decided that the shops in issue be included in ORG estate .
