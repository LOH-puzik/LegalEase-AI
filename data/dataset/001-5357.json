SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Wilhelmina Thomassen", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in FAC . He is represented before the ORG by Mr Jan S\u00f6dergren , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the sole shareholder of a NORP limited liability company , ORG . The company is licensed to trade in certain specified military equipment . By Government decision of CARDINAL DATE , the company was granted a licence , valid until DATE , to trade in , inter alia , salvage vehicles and amphibious crafts .", "It appears that the company bought some military equipment , including armoured vehicles , in GPE which were not covered by the above licence . Subsequently , after that purchase , the company requested that the licence be extended to cover , inter alia , armoured vehicles .", "On DATE the company 's request for an extended licence was rejected by ORG ( ORG f\u00f6r strategiska produkter ; hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The ORG stated that licences are given on a very restrictive basis and that it did not find any reason to extend the company 's existing licence . On DATE the ORG rejected , with the same reasons , a renewed application from the company . No appeal lay against the ORG 's decisions .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "LAW , LAW , sub - section CARDINAL of ORG ( regerings - formen ) provides that restrictions may be introduced in the right to trade or practise a profession only in order to protect significant public interests and never solely in order to further the financial interests of particular persons or firms .", "The DATE LAW ( lagen om krigsmateriel ; hereinafter \u201c DATE LAW ) regulates activities which involve , inter alia , the manufacture , supply and export of military equipment . Thus , the LAW covers weapons , ammunition and other equipment designed for military use , which constitute military equipment according to regulations issued by the ORG . Such regulations are found in an annex to the DATE Military Equipment Ordinance ( f\u00f6rordningen om krigsmateriel ) .", "According to the DATE Act , there is a general prohibition against the manufacture , supply and export of military equipment ( Sections CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) . A special permit or licence is required if an exception to the general rule is to be made . DATE , the ORG decided , directly , in all matters concerning , inter alia , the supply of military equipment . Matters of routine character were determined by the responsible minister . As from DATE , the ORG is the NORP authority that examines applications for permits under LAW . However , in cases where the ORG deems a matter under LAW to be of principle significance or otherwise of special importance , the matter shall be referred to the Government for consideration ( LAW ) .", "Permits under LAW to manufacture , supply and export military equipment may be granted only if supported by security or defence policy reasons and provided that such permits are not in conflict with NORP foreign policy ( LAW ) . In the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to LAW ( cf . Government PERSON No . CARDINAL ) , directives were given on how to apply this rule . The ORG 's earlier decisions in similar matters would serve as guidance in the examination of other , future cases and thus be taken into account by the ORG in its application of the LAW . According to the principles thus emanating from the ORG 's earlier practice , a permit should be granted only if this was necessary for a supply of military equipment and the need for know - how in this area . A further requirement was that the granting of a permit must not be contrary to NORP foreign policy goals and to the principles on which that policy is based .", "A permit granted under LAW may , as a main rule , be cancelled at any point in time if the permit holder has disregarded a regulation contained in the LAW , or a regulation , requirement or provision issued LAW or if there are other special reasons for such a cancellation ( LAW ) .", "An appeal against a decision by the ORG to cancel a permit in accordance with LAW of the DATE LAW or to determine a fee under its LAW may be brought before the administrative courts . An appeal may not be lodged against any other decision by the ORG under LAW ) .", "If the ORG has referred a matter to the Government for consideration in accordance with LAW , an application for judicial review may be lodged with ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) in accordance with LAW ( lagen om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut ) . This is , however , only the case if the Government have decided to cancel a permit to manufacture or to supply military equipment in accordance with LAW .", "The issue of appeal was discussed in connection with the establishment of the ORG ( cf . Government PERSON No . DATE ) . Considerations pertaining to national defence , security and foreign policy were the only considerations that were deemed relevant and which were to be decisive for the outcome of a permit matter under LAW . Private interests , such as an applicant company 's interest in disposing of its products on the military equipment market , were to be afforded no relevance . The fact that the authority determining a permit matter should not include such interests in its assessment also motivated that it should not be possible to pursue such interests on appeal or in an application for judicial review . The situation was , however , deemed to be different when the cancellation of a permit was at stake . The starting - point here was that the permit holder was entitled to keep the permit . Considerations pertaining to the legal rights of the individual or the individual company in question were deemed to be of more relevance in this context . It was , however , also stressed that the courts could not be expected to make assessments that were of a pronounced political nature ( ibid . , pp .
