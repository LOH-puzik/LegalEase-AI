De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in GPE in DATE . He arrived in GPE during the DATE - CARDINAL war and joined the foreign mujahedin . The mujahedin phenomenon is explained by ORG for the former GPE in the PERSON and PERSON judgment , IT-CARDINAL - CARDINAL-T , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - DATE , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Witnesses for both the Prosecution and Defence agreed that the foreign mujahedin began to arrive in PERSON and PERSON during DATE , particularly in DATE .", "CARDINAL . At that time , the borders of GPE ) were controlled by the organs of PERSON or ORG authorities , which made it very difficult for the RBiH legal authorities , more specifically the ORG ( ORG ) , to control the entry and movements of foreigners in the RBiH. Foreign mujahedin reached GPE via GPE and via GPE where the HVO had established power . They frequently arrived as members of humanitarian organisations and did not register with the RBiH authorities .", "CARDINAL . Most of the foreign mujahedin came from the countries of GPE , LOC and LOC , i.e. GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . Some also came from NORP countries , but how many is not known .", "CARDINAL . Foreign mujahedin were easily recognisable by their traditional clothing and dark complexion . They had long beards and wore turbans or hats . Some wore camouflage uniforms or parts of camouflage uniforms , while others wore long white robes . There were also those with scarves around their head and neck . Most of them did not know the NORP language and spoke only LANGUAGE . The foreign mujahedin carried automatic rifles and rocket launchers . Some had sabres or long knives . Some witnesses recognised the insignia the foreign mujahedin wore on their shoulders .", "CARDINAL . According to the evidence characterising the position of the foreign mujahedin , the term \u2018 PERSON refers to NORP fighting a jihad , or holy war . The foreign mujahedin went to GPE in order to help their NORP brothers defend themselves against the NORP aggressor and intended to leave the country once peace had been re - established . According to these same sources , the foreign mujahedin also wanted to spread their beliefs , which they felt were the most faithful expression of NORP texts .", "CARDINAL . Most foreign mujahedin in LOC seem to have arrived as members of humanitarian organisations . Defence witnesses agreed that during the first phase they were involved in humanitarian activities . They provided quite significant aid to the local NORP population , particularly food , and organised classes in religious instruction .", "CARDINAL . Starting in DATE when conflicts broke out in LOC , foreign mujahedin became fighters . They furnished the local population with weapons and uniforms and provided military training . As explained below , the foreign mujahedin took part systematically in combat side by side with the ABiH.", "CARDINAL . Given their humanitarian involvement , the foreign mujahedin initially enjoyed a degree of trust and had the support of the local population . Young men , even minors , joined them . ABiH soldiers deserted their own units to join the ranks of the foreign mujahedin , especially in order to benefit from their material support . Some of the mujahedin married girls from the region . Over time , however , the foreign mujahedin tried to promote their view of fundamental ORG . They ordered the NORP women to cover their heads , condemned the consumption of alcohol and insisted that the local NORP practice their religion . The foreign mujahedin burst into caf\u00e9s and restaurants that served alcohol and if they saw a woman or young girl dressed in what they considered inappropriate fashion , they voiced their strong opposition . As a result of this rigid attitude , relations between the foreigners and the local population deteriorated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Although he had never been given citizenship or a residence permit in GPE , on DATE the applicant obtained a national identity card on the basis of a forged decision of CARDINAL DATE granting citizenship to a certain PERSON ( that national identity card was revoked in DATE ) . In DATE the applicant married a citizen of GPE . They have CARDINAL children , born in DATE and DATE . It would appear that the applicant never returned to GPE after the DATE - CARDINAL war .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during a random check , ORG of ORG found that the applicant was an illegal immigrant in GPE and placed him in ORG for deportation purposes . On DATE he lodged an application for judicial review through his counsel , but the application was ultimately rejected as out of time . The initial detention period was extended on a DATE basis . Each of the extension orders was then upheld by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and some of them by ORG . Appeals concerning the remaining extension orders are still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG established that the applicant was a threat to national security , ordered his deportation and prohibited his re - entry for DATE . It relied on secret intelligence reports . On DATE ORG upheld the decision . On DATE ORG , having assessed the secret evidence , also upheld the deportation order . An appeal is pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed asylum . He maintained that NORP citizens who had joined the foreign mujahedin during the war in GPE and GPE were treated in GPE as suspected terrorists and were subjected to ill - treatment . He added that NORP authorities had visited his family and had enquired about him shortly after the opening of his deportation proceedings . The applicant could not explain , however , how those authorities had learned about his activities in GPE . The applicant submitted a statement by PERSON , a NORP human - rights activist , asserting that a certain ORG had been sentenced by a NORP military tribunal to CARDINAL GPE imprisonment for having fought in the war in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG interviewed the applicant with the help of an interpreter since the applicant did not speak any of the official languages of GPE . It also had regard to reports of ORG , ORG on GPE , which mentioned many cases of ill - treatment meted out to suspected terrorists . The practices reported included hanging from the ceiling , threats of rape , administration of electric shocks , immersion of the head in water , beatings and cigarette burns . Allegations of ill - treatment were reportedly not investigated by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the asylum claim . It held that it had not been shown that the applicant would indeed be treated in GPE as a suspected terrorist and that he therefore did not face a real risk of being subjected to ill - treatment . The statement concerning the situation of Mr PERSON was not admitted to the file because the applicant had failed to provide a translation into an official language of GPE . On DATE ORG upheld that decision . An appeal is pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for interim measures with ORG asking that his deportation be stayed pending ORG decision on the merits of the case .", "CARDINAL . Removal directions for DATE at TIME , issued on DATE , were served on the applicant on DATE at TIME The applicant immediately applied for interim measures with the ORG and the President of the Fourth Section of the ORG granted an interim measure DATE at TIME ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

The same provision defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection as an alien who does not qualify as a refugee but in respect of whom substantial grounds have been shown for believing that he or she would face a real risk of the death penalty or execution , torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country of origin or in the country of habitual residence , or there is a serious , individual threat to a civilian \u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict , and who is unable , or , owing to fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country .", "The principle of non - refoulement is incorporated in LAW , which reads as follows :", "\u201c An alien shall not be returned or expelled in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion , regardless of whether or not the person concerned has been granted international protection . The prohibition of return or expulsion ( non - refoulement ) shall also apply to persons in respect of whom there is a reasonable suspicion for believing that they would be in danger of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . An alien may not be returned or expelled to a country where he or she is not protected from being sent to such a territory either . \u201d", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Act , an alien whose claim for international protection has been refused will nevertheless be granted leave to remain on humanitarian grounds , if his or her removal would breach the principle of non - refoulement . However , the alien concerned must be placed in detention if it has been established that he or she constitutes a threat to public order or national security .", "CARDINAL . An appeal against a deportation order suspends deportation ( section CARDINAL of that Act ) . A claim for international protection and an application for judicial review against a refusal of such a claim equally suspend deportation ( sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of that Act ) . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of that Act , once an alien has become expellable , removal directions are issued within DATE . An appeal against removal directions does not suspend deportation .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of that LAW , an alien must be detained if it has been established that he or she constitutes a threat to public order or national security . Sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of that Act provide that an initial detention order is valid for DATE , but it may be extended any number of times for DATE at a time .

It entered into force on the latter date .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW CARDINALA to that Agreement , all foreign forces , including individual advisors , freedom fighters , trainers , volunteers , and personnel from neighbouring and other GPE , irrespective of whether they were legally and militarily subordinated to any of the local forces , had to be withdrawn from GPE by DATE .", "CARDINAL . As to the situation in GPE before the recent change of regime , see PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG has recently looked at the situation in GPE after the change of regime ( document no.CARDINAL of DATE ) . The pertinent part of the explanatory memorandum reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . For DATE after the revolution of DATE , the political situation in GPE remained very unstable . The first provisional government , formed by the former Prime Minister PERSON on DATE with the participation of representatives of the \u2018 legal\u2019 opposition parties ( the few political formations that existed under the former regime ) and independents , succeeded in making a number of decisions tending towards democratisation . But that government soon found itself under pressure from the demonstrators , who demanded the resignation of ministers who had served under PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , the political forces close to the former regime , from PERSON ORG ) and the security services , tried to stir up trouble in the country in order to shift the transition process towards a new authoritarianism under the guise of \u2018 PERSON political liberalisation .", "CARDINAL . Faced with these attempts , the elements in favour of democratic change , particularly the unions and the active members of civil society , continued to exert pressure on the provisional government through demonstrations . They also began to form a ORG , which demanded the calling of a constituent assembly and the dissolution of all institutions inherited from the PERSON era , namely ORG , the ORG and the political police .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , the CARDINAL ORG passed a law allowing the Interim President , PERSON , to govern by legislative decree . ORG was then suspended and dissolved . Moreover , on DATE the Interim President issued a legislative decree declaring an amnesty for all political prisoners .", "CARDINAL . Among the main decisions of LOC should be noted the banning of the old ruling party , the ORG , as well as the establishment of a commission to reform texts and institutions which was supposed to prepare the democratic transformation of the country .", "CARDINAL . Mention should also be made of the dissolution of ORG ( which it would be more accurate to call the ministry of propaganda and censorship ) and a degree of liberalisation of the media . Reform of the press still remains to be carried out , however . Indeed , we have been informed that non - governmental organisations ( NGOs ) encounter problems if they want to obtain radio frequencies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the second government presided over by former Prime Minister PERSON was forced to resign as a result of pressure from the protesters . The new transition government , headed by Mr PERSON , had no members who had been close to the PERSON regime and positioned itself as a cabinet of technocrats whose objective was to guarantee calm and stability during the transition period .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Interim President set CARDINAL DATE as the date for elections to ORG by direct universal suffrage according to a new electoral code . A specific body called ORG NORP Transition was set up to prepare the elections to ORG . Mr PERSON , former ORG , Political and ORG , who had resigned from ORG in DATE and was an opponent of the PERSON regime , was appointed president of the new body .", "CARDINAL . ORG , which is composed of CARDINAL members , many of whom are representatives of the political world and civil society , as well as professional lawyers , prepared and submitted to the government in DATE draft laws on the organisation of the elections and on the electoral commission .", "CARDINAL . In addition , CARDINAL other independent commissions of inquiry were set up in order to shed light on corruption , the misappropriation of funds by the former regime and abuses committed by the security forces during the events of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister for the ORG announced the dissolution of ORG and the political police .", "CARDINAL . There now seems to be relative , if fragile , political and institutional stability in GPE , enabling the provisional authorities to be fairly optimistic about the possibility of preparing the elections . The authorities have , however , let it be known that they may be postponed if all the conditions for a ballot that complies with democratic standards are not met .", "CARDINAL . The fragile nature of the stability was demonstrated by the events of CARDINAL May , which were provoked by statements by the former NORP Minister of the ORG , PERSON , who announced a \u2018 military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\u2019 was being prepared in the event of the NORP winning the elections . The government condemned these statements , calling them an attack on public order . The demonstrations that followed this incident turned into a riot , with young NORP demanding the resignation of the transitional government and \u2018 a new revolution\u2019 . The police had to use teargas and then weapons in order to quell the riot . Several shops and houses were looted . On DATE , the authorities introduced a curfew in GPE . CARDINAL people were arrested . The curfew was lifted on DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in conclusion of his visit to GPE undertaken on invitation of the Government , PERSON , the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other forms of cruel , inhuman , degrading treatment or punishment , delivered the following statement :", "\u201c ...", "The interim Government has undertaken a series of positive steps , including , considering reforming the ORG security apparatus and dismantling the so - called political police , initiating security sector reforms , reviewing the national legislation in line with international standards , including inter alia removing legal obstacles to reopening the cases of homicide and torture of the past , dismissing a number of high- and mid - ranking officials from ORG and ORG . I am also heartened by the discussions about the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms to address the legacy of past abuses . Encouragingly , the ORG has established CARDINAL advisory commissions .", "...", "I was told by officials that the practice of torture and ill - treatment has decreased following respective instructions issued by the officials of the security services . This I realised is true as far as the notorious and endemic practice of torture committed during the PERSON regime is concerned . However , I have heard credible testimonies regarding beatings of detainees upon arrest or within TIME of pre - trial detention ( garde a vue ) as well as during interrogation . Such episodes reflect the fact that old habits of police agents are not easily eradicated . Whether they are isolated or more frequent , beatings inflicted as a form of punishment or intimidation reflects complete disrespect for the presumption of innocence and the dignity of persons suspected of crimes . For that reason , every single act of torture is intolerable and elicits the obligation of the ORG under international law to investigate , prosecute and punish it . I heard testimonies according to which the safeguards during arrest and detention , such as rules governing warrant , compulsory medical examination upon arrest and transfer , notification to the family , access to a lawyer , interrogation in the presence of witnesses , as well as the right against self - incrimination were not respected in practice . Sadly , some of those testimonies were about events that have taken place after the January CARDINAL Revolution .", "For example , I learned that in DATE the police reacted heavy - handedly to a demonstration by scores of youths . Riot police clashed with protesters and representatives of the media . I heard allegations of arbitrary arrest , and beating , of a group of young people that included CARDINAL minors . Together with CARDINAL adults , they were arbitrarily detained and taken to a detention centre without any access to a lawyer or notification to their families despite clear provisions in the NORP law regarding juvenile criminal law and procedure they were set free at TIME in one of the most dangerous areas in GPE . During TIME of detention they were forced to kneel and remain in uncomfortable positions . I welcome the initiative of ORG to issue a statement apologising to \u2018 journalists and citizens involuntarily ORG and to open an inquiry into these incidents . This goes on to suggest that riot police and law - enforcement bodies engage in ill - treatment and excessive use of force to hold situations under control .", "Given the lack of effective safeguards during arrest , persons deprived of their liberty are extremely vulnerable to torture and ill - treatment , moreover , given the legacy of abusive treatment by law - enforcement agents in the past , the lack of sufficiently speedy investigations into allegations of torture and ill - treatment , as well as the use of prosecutions affecting public officials , it can not be said that the culture of impunity no longer prevails , even though the current authorities have undoubtedly and sincerely pledged to respect the law . I have received several allegations of being kicked , beaten and burned with cigarettes . Many of these cases were supported by forensic medical evidence .", "I learned from ORG that from DATE to DATE , there were CARDINAL criminal convictions against law - enforcement and prison officials for acts of torture and ill - treatment out of CARDINAL prosecutions initiated . According to NORP law , anyone who claims to have been subjected to torture can file a complaint either with officers of LAW or the Prosecutor . These mechanisms are inadequate as the complaint is essentially addressed to the same body that is alleged to have perpetrated the ill - treatment . Moreover , under NORP legislation , judges are not obliged to exclude any evidence or statements obtained under torture , despite the fact that , as a party to the CAT , GPE is internationally obliged to exclude such evidence . This inevitably creates an environment conducive to impunity .", "Admissibility of confessions is left to the discretion and appraisal of the judge in accordance with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . I welcome the initiative of ORG to amend the definition of torture contained in LAW in order to bring it in full conformity with the definition of LAW CAT and to provide for penalties reflecting the severity of the offense . I also support an initiative to amend the laws to ensure that no statement obtained through torture shall be admitted as evidence in judicial proceedings against the defendant , except in a case presenting torture and to show that the statement was made .", "It is my understanding that several agents of security forces attached in the past to the Presidency and to ORG have not been removed even though they are thought to be at the heart of the serious violations of human rights that took place in the past .", "The conditions of prisons and detention centres visited vary from being adequate to unsatisfactory as far as hygienic conditions , availability of medical assistance , access to telephone , and the length of family visits are concerned . Medical centres although available , do not seem to be always and adequately equipped . Dental and psychiatric assistance do not presently exist in the detention centres visited .", "As far as the investigation launched into the past allegations of torture and recent abuses are concerned , I welcome the establishment of the fact - finding Commission , while recognising that its function is complementary to judiciary and should be clarified . I heard an explanation about the thorough and comprehensive way in which it has approached its mandate . However , I have learned that the number of prosecutions and initial judicial inquiries related to torture and disproportionate use of force remain low , despite the fact that the ORG \u2019s work does not substitute the role of prosecutors and judges . The slow pace of investigation and general lack of clear signals that these cases are seriously considered provokes frustration and anger among victims and general public . It is encouraging to learn that preliminary monetary compensation has been offered to victims and their families of DATE and DATE events . It remains unclear how the amount of compensation was defined as adequate and whether any measures are undertaken to provide the victims and their families with rehabilitation services .", "I welcome the initiative of the interim Government to release political prisoners and prisoners of conscience ; and to grant conditional release on a case by case basis to those convicted for security related offenses . Many , if not most , of these were convicted in unfair trials , so amnesties and pardons are a partial remedy to the violations they have suffered .", "I would like to welcome the commitment expressed by all levels of the Government regarding the abhorrence of torture and its determination to eradicate it ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the conclusion of his official follow - up visit to GPE , the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and counter - terrorism , PERSON , gave the following statement :", "\u201c ...", "Since my last visit to GPE in DATE , the world has witnessed how the negation of human rights by oppressive regimes , including under the pretext of countering terrorism , can bring together a critical mass of people from very different walks of life to pursue their aspirations for a free and NORP society and a Government that respects human rights . GPE has become a symbol of this lesson .", "My mandate focuses on the protection of human rights while countering terrorism . In this context I have seen initial steps that indicate a break with GPE \u2019s past . I was pleased to hear that many of my interlocutors confirm that the abusive anti - terrorism law of DATE has not been used since the events of DATE , including against the NORP people that demanded change . However , in FAC I learned that individual judges sometimes still order persons detained under the DATE law . This now mostly dormant law did not do what it was supposed to do . It did not provide more security to the NORP people , but was used as a tool of oppression against any form of political or other dissent . ORG has acknowledged this by adopting an amnesty law covering those who were convicted or held under this law . In order to provide the NORP people with the security they deserve , I offer the assistance of my mandate to replace the DATE law with a proper legislative framework which regulates GPE \u2019s anti - terrorism efforts in line with international conventions and protocols on countering terrorism , while fully respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms . The global threat of terrorism is real and can only be responded to through properly targeted and lawful measures , instead of using the notion of terrorism to suppress dissent .", "In my previous report I expressed grave concern about the activities of various entities of the security apparatus , and the secrecy and impunity in which they operated . My report singled out the Directorate for State Security as a crucial entity that was responsible for activities of torture and arbitrary and even secret detention . I commend therefore the abolishment of this entity by ORG . However , in my previous report I also highlighted the lack of publicly available information on several security organs of ORG . This secrecy was an important element that contributed to the shield of impunity under which these actors could operate . All security ORG functions and powers must be regulated by publicly available laws . Such transparency avoids not only the creation of myths about what these agencies do , but also ensures accountability of these agencies if they commit illegal acts . In this context I have noted statements that the \u2018 political police\u2019 in GPE has been abolished . Such a \u2018 police\u2019 did not exist in the law , but it was used as term by the public , and now also by officials , to describe those elements in the security organs related to ORG that were responsible for cracking down on political and human rights activists and other dissent .", "Changes in the way GPE \u2019s security organs operate should not be limited to slogans , but should result in concrete measures . The first steps have been taken to establish accountability for those who attacked the demonstrators in DATE . I welcome this positive development , but want to stress that in order to look truly forward towards a new GPE , it has to come to terms with dark remnants of its past . During my first visit in DATE the existence of secret facilities in the LOC of ORG was flatly denied . This time officials at ORG agreed to show me the former secret detention facilities . However , some officials still denied the use of Ministry offices as interrogation and torture rooms . I learned that until now CARDINAL security officials have been arrested , QUANTITY persons in the highest ranks prosecuted , and CARDINAL officials forced to retire , or went into retirement voluntarily . GPE should continue to investigate ex officio allegations of torture and illegal detention , often committed under the pretext of the fight against terrorism . Investigating , prosecuting and trying those responsible for the crimes in question can also help rebuilding trust between the population and the security forces in the country .", "While I commend GPE \u2019s decision to ratify LAW , LAW , and LAW of ORG , I must emphasise that these promises turn into real rights only when implemented by depositing the international instrument of accession . Further , I call for rapid measures to strengthen the independence of the judiciary which as of DATE has not lived up to its task to secure compliance with the law , including human rights . I was also disappointed to learn that the most important safeguard against abuse in police custody , effective access to a lawyer of one \u2019s own choice from the moment of arrest , including presence in every interrogation , is not yet in place .", "These are the preliminary findings of my follow - up mission .
