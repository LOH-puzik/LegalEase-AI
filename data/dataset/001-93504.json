The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE on GPE island .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was an employee of a company , ORG , in GPE . Sometime in DATE another employee of the same company , GPE , moved into a flat in Split , PERSON , owned by the company ORG and measuring QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the company ORG as the owner of the flat instituted administrative proceedings seeking ORG eviction on the ground that PERSON had broken into the flat and moved in without any legal basis . The relevant part of the eviction request reads :", "\u201c PERSON moved into the flat without any authorisation , without a contract on the use of the flat or any other valid basis for entering the flat , by breaking the door ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . A decision ordering the eviction of GPE was issued on DATE by GPE , ORG , Construction , Property and Housing ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The parties were , however , not able to submit a copy of this decision because the case file had been lost . It was referred to in the submissions filed by ORG with the ORG Attorney \u2019s ORG on DATE . The relevant part of these submissions reads :", "\u201c PERSON moved into the flat without any authorisation , without a contract on the use of the flat or any other valid basis for entering the flat , by breaking the door ...", "In view of the above [ ORG ] instituted administrative proceedings with ORG , and that ORG ordered the eviction of GPE from the flat in question in its decision of DATE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the company ORG allocated to ORG flat in Split , in the same apartment building , measuring QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . The decision of CARDINAL DATE was annulled as illegal on DATE by ORG . It found that ORG had a house where he lived with his family . The relevant part of this decision reads :", "\u201c According to the statement of participant PERSON and a report of the on - site visit carried out by ORG respondent this court has established that the participant , together with his family , lives in a QUANTITY family house located in LOC . According to PERSON , the ground floor comprises CARDINAL rooms , a kitchen , bathroom and toilet , measuring in QUANTITY while the first floor , measuring QUANTITY , comprises CARDINAL more rooms and an additional space . It is undisputed that the first floor is in the exclusive ownership of GPE , while the ground floor , again according to GPE , is in his co - ownership in CARDINAL together with his mother in CARDINAL , his brother in CARDINAL and the children of his late brother in CARDINAL . The whole building is in sole and undisturbed possession of GPE , his spouse , CARDINAL son and ORG mother , while his other son rents a flat in PERSON . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

A note on the allocation decision stated that it became final on DATE . The flat was publicly owned and the said company had the right to dispose of it . The applicant and his family could not , however , move into the flat because PERSON occupied it ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sought enforcement of the decision of DATE , namely that the eviction of ORG be carried out ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG issued an enforcement order against ORG the basis of its decision of DATE , after which the administrative authorities unsuccessfully attempted on CARDINAL occasions to enforce the eviction order DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG enacted ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo ) , which regulated the sale of publicly - owned flats previously let under protected tenancies , giving the right to holders of such tenancies of publicly - owned flats to purchase them from the provider of the flat under favourable conditions . All publicly - owned flats became the property of the municipalities in which they were situated .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant brought a civil action in ORG for ORG eviction . The applicant argued that ORG had no title to occupy the flat , while the applicant had been granted a specially protected tenancy of the flat . On DATE the applicant \u2019s claim was allowed and the court ordered GPE to vacate the flat within DATE of the date when the decision became final . The relevant part reads :", "\u201c The decision granting the flat to the plaintiff was adopted on DATE and it is therefore clear that it could not have become final on DATE , as is noted on it . ... It is obviously a mistake . However , the fact is that that decision had meanwhile become final because if not , the plaintiff , as a tenant - a holder of a specially protected tenancy - would not have been issued with a decision fixing the amount of the rent for the flat ...", "The defendant is using the flat in question without any right to do so . The results of the proceedings show that the flat in question has never been allocated for his use ... Therefore , he has no legal basis to live in the flat in question ... \u201d", "However , the judgment was quashed and the case remitted to ORG for a new trial . On DATE that court found that it had no jurisdiction in the matter because the applicant had never moved into the flat . This decision was upheld by ORG ( PERSON ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW the applicant as the buyer and GPE as the seller concluded a contract for the sale of the said flat on DATE . A copy of the contract was submitted for approval by ORG .

After the applicant had become the owner of the flat in DATE , he became entitled to participate in the administrative proceedings concerning the eviction of GPE ( see LAW above ) . On DATE the applicant asked for the eviction order to be carried out . The eviction was scheduled for DATE but was not carried out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Split State Attorney \u2019s ORG brought a civil action against the applicant and GPE in ORG , seeking annulment of the contract of sale in question . They argued that the applicant had never obtained a protected tenancy of the flat because he had never moved into it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the enforcement proceedings and annulled the enforcement order of DATE ( see LAW above ) , finding that pursuant to ORG decision of DATE by which certain provisions of LAW were revoked , it no longer had jurisdiction in the matter .", "CARDINAL . As regards the civil action brought by the Split State Attorney \u2019s Office ( see \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) , ORG held in favour of the latter and in its judgment of DATE annulled the contract of sale between the applicant and GPE ( see LAW above ) . It held that the conditions for acquiring protected tenancy were that there should exist a final and enforceable decision on granting such a tenancy and that the holder of the protected tenancy had moved into the flat concerned . It found that the stamped certificate stating that the decision of DATE , granting the applicant protected tenancy on the flat at issue , had become final , was obviously erroneous since it bore the date CARDINAL DATE . It was impossible for a decision of DATE to become final DATE before it was issued . It concluded as follows :", "\u201c ... this court considers that the first defendant has never moved into the flat in question and therefore according to the relevant legal provisions has never acquired the status of a holder of a specially protected tenancy . He could not therefore have purchased the flat in question under the provisions of ORG . For that reason this court has not addressed the preliminary question whether the decision on granting the specially protected tenancy had become final , because the criterion for acquiring a specially protected tenancy , namely that the first defendant has moved into the flat , has not been satisfied and thus the first defendant has not acquired the status of a holder of a specially protected tenancy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .

CARDINAL \u2013 CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) to purchase the flat .

NORP In his subsequent constitutional complaint the applicant argued that the decision of DATE had in fact become final on DATE and that he had been prevented from entering the flat because PERSON had already occupied it illegally in DATE . He also relied on ORG practice that a specially protected tenancy could not be lost where the holder of such a tenancy had failed to enter the flat because it had already been illegally occupied by a third person . It was dismissed by ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) on DATE as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . In the civil proceedings brought by ORG in DATE ( see \u00a7 DATE above ) , on DATE ORG declared the decision of DATE ( granting the specially protected tenancy to the applicant ) null and void on the ground that it had not been adopted according to the procedure prescribed for granting a specially protected tenancy .
