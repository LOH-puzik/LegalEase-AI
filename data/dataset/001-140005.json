He alleges that the following day he was taken from hospital by agents of GPE and unlawfully detained for DATE . During that time he was tortured by a Lieutenant Colonel PERSON . In particular , he alleges he was beaten with a cane on his palms , feet , arms and legs ; slapped and punched in the face ; suspended for prolonged periods by his arms ; shackled at his ankles ; subjected to sleep deprivation ; and given mind - altering drugs .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON returned to GPE where a medical examination found he had injuries consistent with his account and where he was diagnosed with severe post - traumatic stress disorder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Jones commenced proceedings in ORG against \u201c ORG GPE \u201d and Lieutenant Colonel PERSON , claiming damages , inter alia , for torture . In the particulars of claim he referred to Lieutenant Colonel PERSON as a servant or agent of GPE . Service was effected on GPE via its then solicitors , but the solicitors made it clear that they had no authority to accept service of the claim on Lieutenant Colonel PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE applied to have the claim struck out on the grounds that it , and its servants and agents , were entitled to immunity and that the LANGUAGE courts had no jurisdiction . Mr PERSON applied for permission to serve the claim on Lieutenant Colonel PERSON by an alternative method . In his judgment of DATE , a Master of the High Court held that GPE was entitled to immunity under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He also held that Lieutenant Colonel PERSON was similarly entitled to immunity under that LAW and refused permission to allow service by an alternative method . Mr PERSON appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON were arrested in GPE in DATE ; PERSON was arrested there in DATE . All CARDINAL applicants alleged that , while in custody , they were subjected to sustained and systematic torture , including beatings QUANTITY , arms , legs and head , and sleep deprivation . PERSON alleged he was anally raped . The applicants were released and returned to GPE on DATE . Each obtained medical reports which concluded that their injuries were consistent with their accounts .", "CARDINAL . The applicants decided to commence proceedings in ORG against the CARDINAL individuals they considered to be responsible : CARDINAL policemen , the deputy governor of the prison where they were held , and the Minister of the Interior who was alleged to have sanctioned the torture . They therefore applied for permission to serve their claim on the CARDINAL individuals out of the jurisdiction . On DATE this was refused by the same Master who had heard Mr PERSON \u2019s claim , on the basis of his previous ruling in respect of PERSON . However , the Master acknowledged that he had enjoyed the benefit of fuller argument than on the applications relating to Mr PERSON \u2019s claim , and said :", "\u201c [ H]ad the matter come before me as a free - standing application , without my having decided the PERSON case ... , I might have been tempted to give permission to serve out of the jurisdiction on the basis that it seems to me that , having heard the arguments , that there is a case to be answered by these defendants as to whether there is jurisdiction in these courts over them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG with the leave of the Master .", "CARDINAL . NORP The CARDINAL cases were joined and on DATE ORG published its judgment . It unanimously dismissed PERSON appeal from the decision of the Master to refuse permission to serve GPE outside the jurisdiction . However , it allowed the appeals in respect of the refusal of permission in each case to serve the individual defendants .", "CARDINAL . As regards the immunity of GPE , Lord Justice PERSON , with whom Lord PERSON and Lord Justice PERSON agreed , refused to depart from this ORG \u2019s ruling in PERSON the GPE [ ORG ] , no . ORG , ECHR DATE . He further found that LAW of LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the Convention against Torture \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which obliges a Contracting State to ensure that a victim of an act of torture obtains redress , could not be interpreted as imposing an obligation on a State to provide redress for acts of torture when those acts were committed by another State in that other ORG .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the immunity of the individual defendants , PERSON considered the case - law of the domestic courts and courts of other jurisdictions , which recognised ORG immunity ratione materiae in respect of acts of agents of the ORG . However , he noted that none of these cases was concerned with conduct which was to be regarded as outside the scope of any proper exercise of sovereign authority or with international crime , let alone with systematic torture . He did not accept that the definition of torture in LAW as an act \u201c by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was fatal to the applicants\u2019 claims :", "\u201c DATE . ... It seems doubtful that the phrase \u2018 acting in an official GPE qualifies the reference to \u2018 a public official\u2019 . The types of purpose for which any pain or suffering must be inflicted ... would appear to represent a sufficient limitation in the case of a public official . Be that as it may , the requirement that the pain or suffering be inflicted by a public official does no more in my view than identify the author and the public context in which the author must be acting . It does not lend to the acts of torture themselves any official or governmental character or nature , or mean that it can in any way be regarded as an official function to inflict , or that an official can be regarded as representing the state in inflicting , such pain or suffering . Still less does it suggest that the official inflicting such pain or suffering can be afforded the cloak of state immunity ... The whole tenor of LAW is to underline the individual responsibility of state officials for acts of torture ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mance LJ did not consider it significant that Lieutenant Colonel PERSON had been described in PERSON claim as the \u201c servant or agent \u201d of GPE . Nor did he accept that general differences between criminal and civil law justified a distinction in the application of immunity in the CARDINAL contexts . He noted that ORG in PERSON ( No . CARDINAL ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) had considered that there would be no immunity from criminal prosecution in respect of an individual officer who had committed torture abroad in an official context . It was not easy to see why civil proceedings against an alleged torturer could be said to involve a greater interference in the internal affairs of a foreign ORG than criminal proceedings against the same person . It was also incongruous that if an alleged torturer was within the jurisdiction of the forum ORG , he would be prosecuted pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and no immunity could be claimed , but the victim of the alleged torture would be unable to pursue any civil claim . Furthermore , there was no basis for assuming that , in civil proceedings , a ORG could be made liable to indemnify or otherwise support one of its officials proved to have committed systematic torture .", "CARDINAL . Mance LJ considered that whether any claim in the NORP courts against individuals could proceed was better determined not by reference to immunity , but by reference to whether it was appropriate for the LANGUAGE courts to exercise jurisdiction . A number of factors were relevant to the assessment of this question , including the sensitivity of the issues involved and the general power of the LANGUAGE courts to decline jurisdiction on the ground that GPE was an inappropriate forum for the litigation .", "CARDINAL . In considering the impact of LAW found important distinctions between a ORG \u2019s claim to immunity ratione personae , in issue in AlAdsani ( cited above ) , and a ORG \u2019s claim to immunity ratione materiae in respect of its officials , in issue in the present cases . Firstly , he considered it impossible to identify any settled international principle affording the ORG the right to claim immunity in respect of claims directed against an official , rather than against the ORG , its Head of ORG or diplomats . He was of the view that the legislation and case - law of GPE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) militated strongly against any such settled principle and supported a contrary view . In so far as counsel for the Government purported to refer to evidence of settled practice , PERSON noted that the case - law to which he had referred related either to the immunity of the ORG itself or to the immunity of individual officials for alleged misconduct that bore no relationship in nature or gravity to the international crime of systematic torture . He considered the dicta in the separate opinion of Judges PERSON , PERSON and PERSON to the judgment of ORG in the \u201c FAC \u201d case ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) to provide further confirmation that there was no settled international practice in this area .", "CARDINAL . Mance LJ explained that where , under LAW , a ORG had created a domestic remedy for torture in the ORG where that torture was committed , other national courts could be expected to refuse to exercise jurisdiction . However , where there was no adequate remedy in the ORG where the systematic torture occurred , it might be regarded as disproportionate to maintain a blanket refusal of recourse to the civil courts of another jurisdiction . He acknowledged that the courts of CARDINAL ORG were not to adjudicate lightly upon the internal affairs of another ORG , but considered that there were many circumstances , particularly in the context of human rights , where national courts did have to consider and form a view on the position in , or conduct of , foreign GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mance LJ concluded that giving blanket effect to a foreign ORG \u2019s claim to ORG immunity ratione materiae in respect of a ORG official alleged to have committed acts of systematic torture could deprive the right of access to a court under LAW real meaning in a case where the victim of torture had no prospect of recourse in the ORG whose officials had committed the torture . He therefore allowed the ORG appeals in respect of the individual defendants and remitted them for further argument , concluding :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ I]t seems to me that any absolute view of immunity must at the very least yield in the face of assertions of systematic torture to a more nuanced or proportionate approach . As it is , having regard to the [ ORG ] , it is sufficient to decide this appeal that , whether issues of state immunity are or are not treated as theoretically separate from issues of jurisdiction in LANGUAGE law , the permissibility , appropriateness and proportionality of exercising jurisdiction ought to be determined at one and the same time . Such a conclusion reflects the importance attaching in DATE \u2019s world and in current international thinking and jurisprudence to the recognition and effective enforcement of individual human rights . It fits harmoniously with the position already achieved in relation to criminal proceedings . It caters for our obligation under article CARDINAL of the [ Convention ] not to deny access to our courts , in circumstances where it would otherwise be appropriate to exercise jurisdiction applying domestic jurisdictional principles , unless to do so would be in pursuit of a legitimate aim and proportionate . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his concurring judgment , Lord PERSON agreed with the conclusions of PERSON as regards both the claim against GPE and the claims against the individual officials . In particular , he considered that the judgment in PERSON ( No . CARDINAL ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) had shown that torture could no longer fall within the scope of the official duties of a ORG official . It therefore followed that if civil proceedings were brought against individuals for acts of torture in circumstances where the ORG was immune from suit , there could be no suggestion that the ORG would be vicariously liable : it was the personal responsibility of the individuals , not that of the ORG , which was in issue .", "CARDINAL . On the approach of this ORG , he commented :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Had the Grand Chamber been considering a claim for state immunity in relation to claims brought against individuals , I do not believe that there would have been a majority in favour of the view that this represented a legitimate limitation on the right to access to a court under Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Had the ORG shared the conclusions that we have reached on this appeal , it would have held that there was no recognised rule of public international law that conferred such immunity . Had it concluded that there was such a rule , I consider that it would have been likely to have held that it would not be proportionate to apply the rule so as to preclude civil remedies sought against individuals . \u201d", "CARDINAL . GPE appealed to ORG against the decision of ORG in respect of the individual defendants and Mr PERSON appealed against the decision of ORG in respect of his claim against GPE itself . On DATE , ORG unanimously allowed GPE appeal and dismissed the appeal by Mr Jones .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON considered that there was a \u201c wealth of authority \u201d in GPE and elsewhere to show that a ORG was entitled to claim immunity for its servants or agents and that the ORG \u2019s right to immunity could not be circumvented by suing them instead . In some borderline cases there could be doubt whether the conduct of an individual , although a servant or agent , had a sufficient connection with a ORG to entitle it to claim immunity for his conduct . However , in his view , these were not borderline cases . Lieutenant Colonel PERSON was sued as a servant or agent of GPE and there was no suggestion that his conduct was not in discharge or purported discharge of his duties . The CARDINAL defendants in the second case were public officials and the alleged conduct took place in public premises during a process of interrogation .", "CARDINAL . Further , referring to ORG ( ILC ) ORG on ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , Lord PERSON said that \u201c international law does not require , as a condition of a ORG \u2019s entitlement to claim immunity for the conduct of its servant or agent , that the latter should have been acting in accordance with his instructions or authority \u201d . The fact that conduct was unlawful or objectionable was not , of itself , a ground for refusing immunity .", "CARDINAL . In order to succeed in their ORG claim , Lord PERSON explained that the applicants had to establish CARDINAL propositions . Firstly , they had to show that LAW was engaged by the grant of immunity ; Lord PERSON was prepared to assume , based on this ORG \u2019s judgment in AlAdsani , cited above , that it was . Secondly , they had to show that the grant of immunity denied them access to a court ; Lord PERSON was satisfied that it plainly would . Thirdly , the applicants had to show that the restriction was not directed to a legitimate objective and was disproportionate .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON disagreed with the applicants\u2019 submission that torture could not be a governmental or official act since , under LAW , torture had to be inflicted by or with the connivance of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Although the applicants referred to a substantial body of authority showing that the courts of GPE would not recognise acts performed by individual officials as being carried out in an official capacity for the purposes of immunity if those acts were contrary to a jus cogens prohibition , Lord PERSON found it unnecessary to examine those authorities since they were only important to the extent that they expressed principles widely shared and observed among other nations . However , as Judges PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had stated in their concurring opinion in the \u201c Arrest Warrant \u201d case , the \u201c unilateral \u201d GPE approach had not attracted the \u201c approbation of GPE generally \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the applicants\u2019 reliance on the recommendation of ORG DATE in respect of GPE , comments made in the judgment of ORG for the former GPE in GPE , and the judgment of ORG in GPE v. GPE ( see , respectively , paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) , Lord PERSON considered the first to be of slight legal authority , the second to be an obiter dictum and the third not to be an accurate statement of international law .", "CARDINAL . Lord GPE identified CARDINAL arguments advanced by GPE which he said were \u201c cumulatively irresistible \u201d . Firstly , given the conclusion of ORG in the \u201c FAC \u201d case , the applicants had to accept that ORG immunity ratione personae could be claimed for a serving foreign minister accused of crimes against humanity . It followed that the prohibition of torture did not automatically override all other rules of international law . Secondly , LAW did not provide for universal civil jurisdiction . Thirdly , the DATE United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) did not provide any exception from immunity for civil claims based on acts of torture ; although such an exception was considered by a working group of the ILC , it was not agreed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Lord PERSON noted in this respect that although some commentators had criticised LAW because it did not include a torture exception , they nonetheless accepted that this area of international law was \u201c in a state of flux \u201d and did not suggest that there was an international consensus in favour of such an exception . Finally , there was no evidence that GPE had recognised or given effect to any international - law obligation to exercise universal jurisdiction over claims arising from alleged breaches of peremptory norms of international law , nor was there any consensus of judicial or learned opinion that they should . For these reasons , Lord PERSON agreed with ORG that the claim brought by PERSON against GPE was to be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the individual defendants , he found that the conclusion of ORG on the torture claims could not be sustained . He considered that ORG had incorrectly departed from the position in its previous ruling in GPE that the acts of ORG officials were to be considered the acts of the ORG itself ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . He explained :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]here was no principled reason for this departure . A state can only act through servants and agents ; their official acts are the acts of the state ; and the state \u2019s immunity in respect of them is fundamental to the principle of state immunity . This error had the effect that while the GPE was held to be immune , and ORG , as a department of the government , was held to be immune , the Minister of Interior ( the fourth defendant in the second action ) was not , a very striking anomaly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON explained that this first error had led the court into a second : its conclusion that a civil claim against an individual torturer did not indirectly implead the ORG in any more objectionable respect than a criminal prosecution . He observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... A state is not criminally responsible in international or LANGUAGE law , and therefore can not be directly impleaded in criminal proceedings . The prosecution of a servant or agent for an act of torture within article CARDINAL of LAW is founded on an express exception from the general rule of immunity . It is , however , clear that a civil action against individual torturers based on acts of official torture does indirectly implead the state since their acts are attributable to it . Were these claims against the individual defendants to proceed and be upheld , the interests of the GPE would be obviously affected , even though it is not a named party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In Lord PERSON \u2019s view both errors resulted from a misreading of PERSON ( No . CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , which concerned criminal proceedings only . The distinction between criminal proceedings ( which were the subject of universal jurisdiction ) and civil proceedings ( which were not ) was , he said , \u201c fundamental \u201d and CARDINAL that could not be \u201c wished away \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Lord PERSON noted that ORG had found that jurisdiction should be governed by \u201c appropriate use or development of discretionary principles \u201d . He considered that this was to mistake the nature of ORG immunity . Where applicable , ORG immunity was an absolute preliminary bar and a ORG was either immune from the jurisdiction of a foreign court or it was not , so there was no scope for the exercise of discretion .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , concurring in the judgment , considered that there was no automatic conflict between the jus cogens prohibition on torture and the law of State immunity : State immunity was a procedural rule and GPE , in claiming immunity , was not justifying torture but merely objecting to the jurisdiction of the NORP courts in deciding whether it had used torture or not . He quoted with approval the observation of PERSON ORG ( The Law of State Immunity ( ORG , DATE ) , p. CARDINAL ) that ORG immunity did not \u201c contradict a prohibition contained in a jus cogens norm but merely divert[ed ] any breach of it to a different method of settlement \u201d . For Lord PERSON , a conflict could only arise if the prohibition on torture had generated an ancillary procedural rule which , by way of exception to State immunity , entitled a ORG to assume civil jurisdiction over other GPE . Like Lord PERSON , he found that the authorities cited showed no support in international law for such a rule .", "CARDINAL . As regards the application of ORG immunity to individual defendants , Lord PERSON indicated that in order to establish that the grant of immunity to an official would infringe the right of access to a court guaranteed by LAW , it was necessary , as in the case of the immunity of the ORG itself , to show that international law did not require immunity against civil suit to be accorded to officials who were alleged to have committed torture . He considered that , once again , it was impossible to find any such exception in a treaty . He reviewed in some detail the circumstances in which a ORG would be liable for the act of an official in international law and found it clear that a ORG would incur responsibility in international law if one of its officials \u201c under colour of his authority \u201d tortured a national of another ORG , even though the acts were unlawful and unauthorised . He said :", "\u201c DATE . ... To hold that for the purposes of state immunity [ the official ] was not acting in an official capacity would produce an asymmetry between the rules of liability and immunity .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in the case of torture , there would be an even more striking asymmetry between LAW and the rules of immunity if it were to be held that the same act was official for the purposes of the definition of torture but not for the purposes of immunity ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON found Lord Justice PERSON \u2019s conclusion that the Convention against Torture \u2019s definition of torture did not lend acts of torture any official character to be unsatisfactory , explaining :", "\u201c DATE . ... The acts of torture are either official acts or they are not . LAW does not \u2018 ORG them an official character ; they must be official to come within the Convention in the first place . And if they are official enough to come within the Convention , I can not see why they are not official enough to attract immunity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He also considered inappropriate ORG proposed approach to the exercise of jurisdiction , on the ground that ORG immunity was not a self - imposed restriction but was \u201c imposed by international law without any discrimination between CARDINAL ORG and another . \u201d He concluded that it would be \u201c invidious in the extreme for the judicial branch of government to have the power to decide that it will allow the investigation of allegations of torture against the officials of CARDINAL foreign state but not against those of another \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
