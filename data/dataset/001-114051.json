The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently an asylum seeker in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE from the GPE under EU Regulation no . PERSON ( LAW ) and applied for asylum . He was held at the reception centre for asylum seekers at GPE airport . On his arrival he handed the staff of the reception centre medical records issued in GPE and the GPE , showing that he was suffering from hepatitis C and had been treated at a hospital neurology department .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) refused the applicant entry to the territory of GPE : that is , it refused to allow him to leave the reception centre . The applicant had not been interviewed before the decision was taken . He applied for judicial review , seeking to have the refusal quashed , arguing in particular that his medical condition was incompatible with his being in the reception centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud ) quashed the refusal , on the grounds that the ORG had first to consider whether the applicant was a vulnerable person under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , in view of his medical condition , and thus whether he was to be allowed to enter the country . It added that the applicant must be heard in person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ministry again refused the applicant entry to the country . It held that he was suffering from an ordinary illness , which did not require any specialist treatment , and that he was receiving appropriate treatment at the reception centre .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for judicial review of the second refusal , stating that his state of health did not require him to be hospitalised . Moreover , as his medical treatment had not yet started , his transfer to a medical facility was not necessary . If the situation changed a fresh assessment might be required .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant once again requested leave to enter the country . ORG did not decide on his requests , relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , which stipulated that a foreigner was not entitled to lodge a new request for leave to enter the country until DATE had passed since the rejection of a previous one . It added , though , that it was proprio motu continuing to review the existence of the reasons for the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant entry to enable him to have medical treatment . It took into account his latest medical reports ; the impossibility for him to have treatment at the reception centre and the impossibility for him to have treatment at ORG because of lack of facilities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE spr\u00e1vn\u00ed soud ) quashed the CARDINAL DATE judgment and remitted the case to ORG , holding that it was insufficiently reasoned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again rejected the applicant \u2019s request for judicial review . The applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law , as by then he was no longer detained .", "CARDINAL . The asylum proceedings seem to be still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was examined by a specialist at ORG , who concluded that he was suffering from hepatitis C and that the requisite medical treatment should begin as soon as possible following further examinations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a doctor at the reception centre , noting the results of the applicant \u2019s examination at ORG , informed the applicant \u2019s lawyer in writing that the reception centre was unable to provide adequate treatment for his client . He added that it was not appropriate for the applicant to be held at the reception centre , because of the psychological stress caused by the medical treatment he required , and that he should be transferred to an open asylum facility .", "CARDINAL . During DATE several other medical reports confirmed that the applicant \u2019s condition required urgent specialist treatment , which was not available at the reception centre .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the reception centre doctor informed ORG that the applicant \u2019s state of health had been stabilised , that an appropriate diet was being provided , and that he was being provided with medication to enhance his liver function . He further stated that the medical care was adequate and that the applicant was under the permanent supervision of medical personnel . The doctor admitted that his previous assessment had been based on the assumption that a sudden deterioration of the condition was possible ; however , this had not been confirmed later . He concluded that the recent care was fully comparable to the care provided to ordinary citizens , and was appropriate to the applicant \u2019s actual state of health .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment , PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE .", "CARDINAL . With effect from DATE a new paragraph CARDINAL was introduced into section CARDINAL of LAW ( no . CARDINAL ) setting a time - limit of CARDINAL working days for a court to decide on a request for judicial review of a decision of the ORG refusing entry to GPE to an asylum seeker who was being held at an airport reception centre . If the judicial review quashes the decision , the Ministry must issue a new decision within DATE or grant the asylum seeker entry .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW the Ministry shall allow asylum seekers to enter the territory if they are unaccompanied minors , a family including minors , people with serious health problems , pregnant women , or people who have been tortured or subjected to other forms of psychological , physical or sexual violence .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) provides a similar guarantee as LAW :", "Anyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings before a court , in order that that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of his detention and order his release if the detention is not lawful .", "ORG , which is empowered to interpret the ORG , has on numerous occasions expressed the opinion that the court mentioned in LAW ORG must have the power to order release if the detention is unlawful ( see , for example , PERSON GPE , no . DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE , and PERSON v. GPE , no . DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
