{"ITEMID": "001-22148", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "UNISON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a trade union , with its registered address in GPE . It is represented before the ORG by Mr J. Clinch , the applicant \u2019s legal officer .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a union for public service employees . It has members employed with ORG ( UCLH ) , which is ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) Trust . A substantial proportion of its members at ORG are employed on terms and conditions of employment negotiated , primarily , at a national level and the applicant plays a leading role in those national negotiations . Collective negotiations on terms and conditions for most staff so employed within the ORG take place within the framework of the so - called \u201c FAC \u201d . There is a ORG which agrees terms and conditions common to all staff groups , for example , on redundancy , equal opportunities , maternity rights and joint consultation machinery and CARDINAL other specialist councils dealing with particular jobs or professions . Each ORG is composed of an equal number of employer - side staff and staff - side employees . The applicant inter alia provides the employee - side secretariat of ORG which means that it plays the leading role in co - ordinating staff - side policy within the ORG negotiations and in representing employees at those negotiations .", "During DATE , ORG was negotiating to transfer a part or parts of its business to a transferee consortium of private companies , under a mechanism known as ORG , whereby the private companies would erect and run for ORG a new hospital ( the \u201c primary transfer \u201d ) . The consortium would subsequently transfer parts of the business transferred to it by ORG to other private transferee companies ( secondary transfers ) . Thereafter , there would be yet further transfers to private companies ( tertiary and subsequent transfers ) . At all stages there was to be subcontracting out of parts of the work by transferee companies to specialist companies . The primary transfer and secondary transfers would involve most but not all the employees of ORG being transferred to one or more of the transferee companies .", "The applicant sought protection of its members for the terms and conditions of employment and collective bargaining arrangements , aiming to secure a collective agreement with ORG by which the latter would impose on the transferees terms that would guarantee for DATE that the terms and conditions of employment and the collective bargaining arrangements of those who would be employed by the primary and subsequent transferees would remain the same as or equivalent to those which would remain for existing employees who were not transferred from NORP . ORG refused the request or to offer any protection of existing terms and conditions beyond those guaranteed as a minimum by law .", "The applicant put a question to its members in the statutorily required pre - strike ballot , asking whether they were prepared to take industrial action in support of the trade union \u2019s demands for a guarantee . The ballot paper stated :", "\u201c The union has requested a guarantee that the terms , conditions and benefits enjoyed by ORG staff to be transferred to the new employer , and also staff , subsequently employed and subcontracted staff remain the same ( or at least as favourable as ) , and governed by the same collective bargaining arrangement as ORG , ORG staff . ORG has not agreed to give this guarantee by making it part of the contract with the new employers or by making it part of individual contracts of employment . The union is therefore in dispute with ORG .", "Are you prepared to take strike action in support of the request for the guarantee described above ? \u201d", "On DATE , it was announced that members had voted overwhelmingly to take strike action . The applicant called for the strike to take place on QUANTITY DATE .", "On DATE , ORG brought proceedings applying for an injunction to prevent the strike taking place .", "On DATE , ORG ordered interlocutory injunctive relief in favour of UCLH , finding that the strike did not attract the protection of section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( the DATE Act ) .", "On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , upheld the injunction and ordered costs against the applicant . It refused leave to appeal to ORG . In its judgment , as summarised by the applicant , it was found :", "( i ) that there was no dispute wholly or mainly related to current terms and conditions but instead a dispute about future terms and conditions with an unidentified future employer ( Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act did not extend to such a dispute ) ;", "( ii ) the inclusion of future employees and sub - contracted employees in the demand for protection took the dispute outside section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ;", "( iii ) even if the dispute was mainly about statutorily permitted matters and between statutorily permitted parties , the ballot paper before the strike must be restricted wholly to statutorily permitted issues to be valid .", "In his judgment in ORG , Lord PERSON noted that the applicant \u2019s counsel had accepted that the arrangement which the applicant had sought to achieve would have been difficult to enforce in any event , though considered that the applicant could claim that the guarantee could have been of benefit to its members . While counsel had also conceded that any strike of hospital staff would , regrettably , have had an impact on persons being treated in the hospital , he held that the possible adverse consequences of a strike was not relevant to the court \u2019s decision on the legal issue before it .", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s petition for leave to appeal .", "The applicant withdrew the strike call to avoid acting unlawfully and being found liable for damages .", "A strike by employees involves breaches of their respective contracts of employment . Calling or supporting a strike by a trade union involves the trade union in committing the tort of inducing the breach of contracts of the employees concerned . Section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( the DATE Act ) confers protection where the defendant is acting \u201c in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute \u201d . Statutory protection is lost and the trade union is necessarily acting unlawfully if the strike it calls is in contemplation or furtherance of something which does not fall within the statutory definition of a \u201c trade dispute \u201d .", "The term \u201c trade dispute \u201d is defined by section CARDINAL of the DATE Act which provides as relevant :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In this Part , \u2018 trade ORG means a dispute between workers and their employer which relates wholly or mainly to CARDINAL or more of the following -", "( a ) NORP terms and conditions of employment or the physical conditions in which any workers are required to work ;", "( b ) engagement or non - engagement , or termination or suspension of employment or the duties of employment , of CARDINAL or more workers ;", "( c ) the allocation of work or the duties or employment between workers or groups of workers ;", "( d ) matters of discipline ;", "( e ) a worker \u2019s membership or non - membership of a trade union ;", "( f ) facilities for officials of trade unions ; and", "( g ) NORP machinery for negotiation or consultation , and other procedures , relating to any of the above matters , including the recognition by employers or ORG associations of the right of a trade union to represent workers in any such negotiation or consultation or in the carrying out of procedures . \u201d", "Pursuant to ORG DATE ( SI DATE ) , protection is provided to workers on ( most ) transfers of undertakings ( these regulations implemented ORG . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC ) .", "By regulation CARDINAL , a contract of employment of employees employed in an undertaking immediately before a relevant transfer are saved from automatic termination and \u201c shall have effect after the transfer as if originally made between the person so employed and the transferee . \u201d All rights , powers , duties and liabilities of the transferor are deemed to pass to the transferee ( reg . CARDINAL ) ) , hence the transferee comes under an obligation to respect the terms and conditions of employment which have been agreed by the transferor . By virtue of reg . CARDINAL , employees whose contractual terms prior to transfer are expressly subject to collective negotiation , will continue to be subject to that collective negotiation following transfer , even if their new employer is not party to those negotiations ( e.g. PERSON and others v. T ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL(EAT ) ) .", "Pursuant to reg . CARDINAL of FAC , the effect of any collective agreement made between a transferor employer and a trade union is preserved , and the agreement treated as if it had been made between the trade union and the new transferee employer . Recognition of a trade union by a transferor , whether for collective bargaining purposes or otherwise also binds a transferee where the undertaking transferred maintains an identity distinct from the remainder of the transferee \u2019s undertaking ( reg . CARDINAL ) .", "Pursuant to reg . TIME ) , of FAC , an employee who is dismissed because of a transfer or for a reason connected with it is deemed to have been unfairly dismissed , giving an automatic guaranteed claim for compensation and/or re - instatement or re - engagement under s. CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c ERA \u201d ) . This is subject to the exception where the employee has been dismissed for \u201c an economic , technical or organisational reason entailing changes in the work force \u201d in which case the dismissal is not automatically unfair \u2013 reg . CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Such dismissal may nevertheless be found unfair by an ORG applying the ordinary principles set out in s. CARDINAL of ERA . A dismissal may occur at the instigation of an employer or where an employee resigns having apprehended that there is to be , or has been , a fundamental breach of contracts by the employer or a substantial change of working conditions to his detriment ( e.g. PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG ) .", "A proposal by an employer to effect a transfer also gives rise to an obligation to consult \u201c appropriate representatives \u201d of affected employees about , inter alia , the date of the transfer and the reasons for it , its legal , economic and social implications for affected employees , and the measures , if any which will be taken by the transferor and/or transferee employers in relation to those employees ( reg . ORG ) ) . The appropriate representatives include representatives of a recognised trade union .", "Any reduction in wages paid by an employer must , with certain limited exceptions , be agreed in writing . If there is no written agreement , the employee will have a claim to ORG for unlawful deduction of wages under ss . DATE ERA .", "Any reduction in wages or downgrading in other terms or conditions which is not agreed will give rise to a claim for breach of contract of employment in the ordinary courts , or , if employment has ended , in the ordinary courts or in ORG .", "If an employee is dismissed for failing to agree to a change in contractual terms and conditions , he may bring a claim for unfair dismissal pursuant to s. CARDINAL ERA . A claim for unfair dismissal may also be brought by an employee who resigns following a significant change to contractual terms and conditions ( s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(c ) ERA ) . An employee dissatisfied with changes to terms and conditions may remain in his job and claim unfair dismissal , seeking compensation for the financial shortfall between the new terms and former terms of employment .", "Pursuant to ORG , recognition of trade union and collective agreements would automatically transfer to transferee employers ( regs . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Where following transfer a transferee company wished to terminate recognition of a trade union , domestic law provides a mechanism whereby such employers may be compelled to engage in collective bargaining on certain matters .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE adds a new Schedule CARDINAL to the DATE Act , under which employers and trade unions are encouraged to agree upon recognition for collective bargaining and upon the consequences which should flow from recognition . In the absence of agreement , unions may , in certain circumstances , apply to ORG in order to secure compulsory recognition for the purposes of collective bargaining on pay , TIME and holidays . Certain conditions must be met if compulsory recognition is to be ordered , principally that the trade union can claim a minimum level of support amongst the workers it wishes to represent in collective bargaining ( paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Schedule ) and that no other trade union is already recognised as representing any of those workers ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The Schedule came into force on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
