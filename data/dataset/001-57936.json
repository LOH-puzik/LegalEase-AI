In its decision the court held that the statutory restrictions imposed on property rights under LAW , with a view to ensuring social justice , made it possible to regard controls imposing restrictions as legitimate , provided that such controls were of an exceptional and temporary nature , but that perpetuating such restrictions was incompatible with the protection of property rights embodied in LAW .", "In its decision ORG also pointed out that the statutory DATE extension of leases prescribed by PERSON no . CARDINAL should not be considered in isolation but within the context of tenancy provisions as a whole . The court drew particular attention to the fact that this extension succeeded other statutory extensions and could mark the beginning of new restrictions on freedom of contract in this field . Moreover , the statutory extension of leases had the effect of prolonging contracts in which the rent , notwithstanding the increases allowed in accordance with rises in the cost of living , were not even approximately in line with current socio - economic conditions . Further , the PERSON concerned did not give the lessor the possibility of regaining possession of the property except in cases of absolute necessity .", "ORG also held that PERSON no .
