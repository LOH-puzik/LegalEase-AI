LATVIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions)", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Erik M\u00f8se;M\u0101rti\u0146\u0161 Mits;Yonko Grozev", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . After the regaining of independence , in DATE property reform legislation came into force in GPE and provided that former owners or their heirs could reclaim property nationalised in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant and CARDINAL other individuals were the heirs of GPE In DATE they asked ORG to recognise their title to CARDINAL ha of forest in GPE ( hereinafter \u201c the contested property \u201d ) which had allegedly belonged to GPE and was nationalised in DATE . They also asked the court to recognise their right to receive a plot of land of the same value in GPE , as it had not been possible to establish the precise boundaries of the inherited land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of the claimants . It recognised that there was no question over whether the claimants were the heirs of the late GPE , as that had been established by a court order in DATE . Referring to documents received from ORG and ORG ( ORG dienests ) , it also established that FAC had purchased CARDINAL ha of forest in GPE . Referring to section CARDINAL of the Law on Land Reform in the Cities of the Republic of Latvia ( ORG zemes reformu Latvijas Republikas pils\u0113t\u0101s ) , which provided that any requests after DATE for the restoration of property rights should be decided by a court , ORG recognised that the second applicant owned a CARDINAL share of the forest in GPE and that the other CARDINAL claimants owned a sixth each . As there was no evidence of what the precise boundaries of the forest were , the court recognised the claimants\u2019 right to receive a plot of land of the same value elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . ORG was a defendant in the above proceedings and a representative of ORG contested the claim , arguing that in DATE the contested property had belonged to several individuals as undivided property , and the archive documents did not show what part of that property each claimant could be entitled to .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was not appealed against and became final on DATE . In DATE , at the PERSON request , ORG adopted an additional decision specifying that the contested property had historically been part of the PERSON estate forest .", "CARDINAL . After adoption of the above judgment , ORG informed the claimants , ORG and ORG several times of problems in enforcement of the judgment . ORG maintained that the archive material , which had been obtained after the above judgment had been adopted , did not give information as to the location of the contested property . On those grounds , in DATE ORG asked ORG to lodge an application for supervisory review ( protests ) asking for the judgment of DATE to be quashed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG dismissed the request , arguing that reassessment of evidence could not serve as grounds for triggering supervisory review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions the second applicant complained to ORG and ORG about delays in the enforcement of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In order to comply with the judgment , on DATE ORG adopted decisions allocating CARDINAL plots of land to the claimants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the title to the CARDINAL plots of land was entered in the land register , and on CARDINAL and DATE the second applicant and the other CARDINAL claimants sold their respective plots to the fifth applicant , the limited liability company ORG , the owner and director of which at the material time was the second applicant .", "DATE and DATE the first applicant was the president of the fifth applicant , and DATE and DATE the first applicant was its chairman of the board .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG of the ORG of ORG lodged an application for supervisory review with regard to the judgment adopted on DATE by ORG , arguing that there was a lack of evidence to corroborate that GPE had owned the property before DATE . As information received from ORG had suggested , the contested property had consisted of undivided shares and therefore it could not be concluded that GPE had been the sole purchaser of CARDINAL ha of a forest .", "CARDINAL . A copy of that application was sent to the second applicant and the other CARDINAL parties to the initial proceedings , inviting them to submit comments within DATE of receipt .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE attended by the representative of the claimants in the initial proceedings , the ORG of ORG quashed the judgment and remitted the case to ORG for fresh consideration . The ORG recognised that there was nothing in the case file to suggest that ORG had owned the contested property .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Bureau for the Prevention and Combating of Corruption ( \u201c the KNAB \u201d ) asked ORG to initiate proceedings to reclaim the contested property from the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The fifth applicant entered into various transactions with the contested property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE part of the property was for a total amount of CARDINAL NORP lati ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) sold to GPE who on CARDINAL and DATE sold it for the same amount to the third applicant , the limited liability company ORG , the coowner and representative of which at the material time and until DATE was GPE himself .", "On DATE and DATE the third applicant was registered as the owner of the property in the land register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the fifth applicant sold CARDINAL other parts of the contested property to the sixth and fourth applicants respectively for about ORG CARDINAL per each transaction . The purchase contract of DATE provided , inter alia , that the seller , namely the fifth applicant , guaranteed that the property was not subject to any dispute , and that seller would be liable for any third party claims made in respect of the transaction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the fifth applicant sold another part of the property to ORG , who on DATE sold it to the first applicant for about LVL CARDINAL ( about ORG CARDINAL ) . The purchase contract of DATE provided , inter alia , that the seller guaranteed that the property was not anyhow encumbered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and on DATE ( with regard to the first and the third applicants ) ORG , acting on behalf of ORG , lodged a claim against ORG , the applicants , GPE and the CARDINAL other claimants in the initial proceedings . ORG relied on the ORG \u2019s judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the request received from the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The claim stated that the second applicant and the CARDINAL other claimants in the initial proceedings had no legal right of ownership over the contested property . ORG was asked to quash the decisions of ORG allocating the CARDINAL plots of land ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG also asked for the relevant ORG records to be deleted and the rights of the ORG to the contested property to be recognised .", "CARDINAL . The claim was based on the section of the Civil Law regulating property claims , such as sections ORG , CARDINAL and DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to join the claim lodged by ORG and the claim about the restoration of property rights ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim lodged by ORG and upheld the decision recognising the second applicant and the CARDINAL other claimants as owners of the contested property .", "CARDINAL . Both ORG and ORG appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG partly upheld the appeal lodged by ORG . The court revoked the decisions of ORG allocating the second applicant and the CARDINAL other claimants the CARDINAL plots of land , and ordered that the corresponding entries be deleted from the relevant ORG records . It established that the lower court had failed to address the fact that until DATE the contested plots of land had been jointly owned by the former owner GPE and CARDINAL other individuals . Moreover , the joint ownership of the land had ceased after the passing of a decree in DATE , and after that date GPE had not registered his title to the property with ORG .", "The appellate court also dismissed part of the claim of ORG in which it claimed that the ORG ( represented by ORG ) had ownership rights over the property in question . The plots of land were returned to GPE in order for it to finalise the land reform .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the ORG argument that they had all acted in good faith when acquiring their part of the contested property , the court at the outset noted that such criteria as the date of conclusion of a contested transaction and the nature of the infringed property rights have to be considered when assessing the protection of bona fide acquirers . The court also observed that after the second applicant had sold the contested property to the fifth applicant , the owner of which was the second applicant himself , all the transactions involving the contested property ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) had been concluded after the ORG of ORG had revoked the final judgment in the initial proceedings . It also noted that PERSON had sold his respective parts of the property to the first applicant despite the fact that the civil proceedings initiated by ORG had been pending . On those grounds and on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicants were not recognised as having acted in good faith .", "CARDINAL . The first , second , fourth and fifth applicants lodged an appeal on points of law . Following an application dated DATE , the third applicant joined the cassation appeal lodged by the first applicant . The sixth applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL appellants complained , inter alia , that the ORG did not have sufficient interest in the property to justify the fact that ORG had lodged a property claim on behalf of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a final decision of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG of ORG upheld in essence the appellate court \u2019s judgment . With respect to the property claim brought by ORG , the ORG noted that even if the ORG \u2019s property rights had not been infringed , that did not prevent the court from finding that the second applicant and the CARDINAL other claimants in the first set of proceedings had had no rights to the contested property . The ORG also upheld the appellate court \u2019s conclusions about the applicants acting in bad faith .", "CARDINAL . After the above judgment took effect and at GPE request the applicants\u2019 entries were deleted from the relevant ORG records .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant was declared insolvent and ORG appointed PERSON as its insolvency administrator who replaced the former board members of the third applicant . On DATE the insolvency proceedings were terminated and on DATE the third applicant was deleted from the company register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE , who until DATE had been a board member of the third applicant , on its behalf designated a legal representative in the proceedings before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
