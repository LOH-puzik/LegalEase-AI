ORG The applicant is a GPE citizen born in DATE and resident in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE the prosecuting authorities decided to take action against the nuisance caused by drug trafficking in GPE . The police had compiled sets of photographs of persons suspected of being drug dealers . These were shown to CARDINAL drug addicts in order to collect statements from them . However , following a similar action in DATE when drug addicts who had made statements to the police had been threatened , it turned out that most of those to whom photographs were shown were only prepared to make statements on condition that their identity was not disclosed to the drug dealers whom they identified . In each set of photographs shown there was one of a person known to be innocent . Statements made by persons who identified this photograph as that of a drug dealer were regarded as unreliable and discounted .", "CARDINAL .

In view of the fact that all CARDINAL judges of ORG had been replaced , the court again recommenced its examination . The defence again made a request to have the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses examined , which was refused . The named witness ORG appeared , NORP did not . Both the prosecution and the defence were given the opportunity to put questions to ORG Asked to identify the applicant , ORG stated that he did not recognise him . On being shown the applicant 's photograph , he said that he recognised it as that of a man who had given him heroin when he was ill . However , towards the end of his examination he stated that he was no longer quite sure of recognising the man on the photograph ; it might be that the man who had given him the heroin only resembled that man . He further alleged that when shown the photographs by the police , he had only identified the applicant 's photograph as that of a person from whom he had bought drugs because at the time he had felt very ill and had been afraid that the police might not give him back the drugs which they had found in his possession . The court adjourned its further examination until DATE , ordering the appearance of the witnesses NORP and ORG , and - on a motion of the defence - of L. , an expert in the field of problems related to drug trafficking and abuse .

It was also necessary to take into account the desirability of bringing proceedings to an end as expeditiously as possible ( lites finiri oportet ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG recommenced its examination , having changed composition .", "The defence again asked the court to hear NORP and PERSON and the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses . The court , however , further considering the wish of the witnesses PERSON and PERSON to remain anonymous , concluded that it had been decided on sufficiently convincing grounds that these CARDINAL witnesses had good reasons to feel seriously threatened , in view , inter alia , of police records contained in the case file from which it appeared that there was a real possibility that drug dealers might threaten potential witnesses . Accordingly , it did not order them to be summoned . As to the witnesses PERSON , PERSON , ORG and GPE , the court accepted the findings of the investigating judge that it would be pointless to summon them .", "On the other hand , ORG ordered that the witnesses NORP and ORG be brought before it by force and adjourned its hearing until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

ORG The procurator general refused both requests on CARDINAL DATE .", "As regards the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses , he referred to his earlier decisions of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE and reiterated the finding of ORG of DATE . He based his decision not to call PERSON and PERSON on the fact that PERSON had published a book which rendered his views sufficiently clear and which the defence could quote at the hearing if desired , and on the assumption that ORG would not be able to make statements about anything other than his own experiences as a person suspected of drug offences . It was also unnecessary to call either of them in view of the fact that the expert PERSON would appear at the hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG resumed its hearing . The witness PERSON , who was in prison , did not appear . The defence withdrew its request to have him heard but maintained its request that ORG should hear the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses and the expert PERSON to its decision of CARDINAL May , ORG refused to accede to the request of the defence to hear the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses . However , in view of the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it decided to refer the case back to the investigating judge , requesting her to record her findings as to the reliability of the witnesses PERSON and PERSON , adding that if in order to appraise their reliability the investigating judge found it necessary to hear them again she should do so . Although the expert PERSON was present at the hearing on CARDINAL DATE , having been convened by the defence , ORG decided not to hear him . The reason given was that as an expert rather than a witness he could not be expected to contribute to the elucidation of the facts of the case . The witness N. was heard by ORG in the applicant 's presence and the applicant 's lawyer was given the opportunity to question him . PERSON said that his statement to the police had been untrue and that he did not in fact know the applicant . In pursuance of the court 's order of CARDINAL DATE that he be brought by force , the named witness NORP was present initially . It appears that before he was heard , he asked the court usher who was guarding him for permission to leave for TIME ; this being allowed him , he then disappeared and could not be found again . The court subsequently ordered that he be brought before it by force at its next hearing on DATE . ORG heard the expert PERSON , who stated that drug addicts often made unreliable statements concerning alleged drug dealers to the police . He understood from drug addicts that police officers made promises to them and that they made statements only in order to be allowed to leave as soon as possible . Such statements were , in his view , \" somewhere between the truth and a lie \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the investigating judge , Judge PERSON . , drew up a record of her findings regarding the reliability of the statements made to her by PERSON and PERSON on DATE . She stated in this document that she could not remember the faces of the CARDINAL witnesses , but having re - read the records of the interrogations could recall more or less what had happened . She had the impression that both witnesses knew whom they were talking about and had identified the applicant 's photograph without hesitation . With regard to the facts of which the applicant stood accused , her impression had been that the witnesses themselves believed their statements to be true . As far as she remembered , both witnesses had answered all questions readily and without hesitating although they had made a \" somewhat sleepy impression \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG At ORG hearing on DATE , the witness NORP did not appear , the police having been unable to find him . The court thereupon decided that a new order for NORP 's appearance would be pointless . The procurator general brought forward a police officer , ORG , who had been involved in the investigation and asked that he be heard . The applicant 's lawyer protested that the expert PERSON had not been heard and that the defence had no opportunity to prepare for the questioning of ORG ; to agree to hear I. now would prejudice the rights of the defence . ORG nonetheless acceded to the request , and PERSON was heard concerning the way in which the investigation had been conducted . PERSON explained that from DATE until DATE he had been a member of a police team set up to fight drug trafficking in the centre of GPE . Over DATE that team had built up a good understanding with many of the drug addicts living in that area ; making use of that relationship , they had asked them for information on drug dealers . Their cooperation was wholly voluntary . I. denied that the police made promises to drug addicts or put pressure on them ; nor were photographs shown to addicts who had been arrested . In his assessment the statements made by drug addicts were therefore highly reliable . Moreover , action was only taken against alleged drug dealers if there were CARDINAL statements incriminating them . He further confirmed that it had happened in the past that convicted drug dealers , after serving their sentence , had threatened and assaulted drug addicts who had made incriminating statements against them . Although he had never known the applicant to resort to violence or threats , he did not rule out the possibility that he might do so . The defence challenged the reliability of the statements made by the various witnesses , both named and anonymous , pointing to what they considered to be inconsistencies among them . They objected particularly to the admission as evidence of the statements made by PERSON and PERSON , on the grounds , inter alia , that both were drug addicts and that the investigating judge 's record of her findings of DATE did not contain a statement that she believed that the witnesses had been telling the truth . Relying on the GPE v. GPE judgment of ORG DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) , they moreover expressed doubts as to the impartiality of the investigating judge , Judge PERSON . , in that as a member of ORG she had taken part in the hearing of ORG of DATE and in the decisions then made . They protested against the refusal to hear PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG quashed ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , as it was adopting a different approach with regard to the evidence . It found the applicant guilty of the deliberate sale of quantities of heroin and cocaine . This finding was based on the following evidence :", "( a ) the fact , as appeared from the police records , that upon information that the applicant was engaged in drug trafficking his photograph was added to the collection of photographs of persons suspected of that offence ;", "( b ) the statements made before the investigating judge on DATE by ORG and PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "( c ) the fact that on DATE the applicant had recognised himself on the police photograph ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "( d ) the statements made to the police by the named witnesses PERSON and NORP ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "As regards the applicant 's complaint that the majority of the witnesses had not been heard in the presence of the applicant or his lawyer , the court stated that it had based its conviction on evidence given by the witnesses ORG , NORP , PERSON and PERSON .", "The latter CARDINAL had been questioned by the investigating judge in the presence of the applicant 's lawyer . ORG added that it had used their statements \" with the necessary caution and circumspection \" . It held that these statements could be used in evidence , in view , inter alia , of the consistency between them and the testimony of the police officer I. It also found that the reliability of the witnesses and the well - foundedness of their wish to remain anonymous had been sufficiently verified by the investigating judge . The witness ORG had been heard in open court both at first instance and on appeal . Although he had retracted his earlier statement to the police , that was the statement which ORG chose to believe in light of the testimony of the police officer ORG , the mere fact that the defence had not had the opportunity to question NORP did not mean that his statement could not be used in evidence . ORG rejected the applicant 's complaint based on the alleged lack of impartiality of Judge PERSON . It noted that the hearing on DATE had been summary ; ORG had only considered the applicant 's request to have the CARDINAL anonymous witnesses examined and his request for release . During that hearing ORG had not examined the substance of the applicant 's case . It did not appear , nor had it been argued , that Judge PERSON . had had any dealings with ORG and PERSON before questioning them . An investigating judge in any case did not have to provide the same safeguards as a member of a trial court . Furthermore , no particular facts or circumstances had been suggested or had come to light warranting the conclusion that she had not been able to form an unprejudiced opinion as to the reliability of the witnesses she had examined , or that she had been biased in her examination of those witnesses . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The time which he had spent in police custody and detention on remand was deducted from the sentence .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant filed an appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "Counsel for the applicant submitted a statement of grounds of appeal on DATE . The complaints put forward , in so far as relevant , were the following .", "In the first place , ORG ought not to have refused to hear the expert PERSON The fact that the court had chosen to hear I. at the behest of the prosecution , which had brought him forward at TIME , meant that the applicant had not had the possibility to obtain the attendance of a witness on his behalf under the same conditions as a witness against him . In addition , the court had failed to give sufficient reasons as to why the statement of PERSON could not serve the purpose of elucidating the facts , the court not having set out anything either in the record of the hearing or in its judgment with regard to the testimony that PERSON intended to give .", "In the second place , ORG ought not to have relied on the statements made by ORG and PERSON . It had ignored the wish of the defence to have them brought before the trial court in order that that court might itself see how unreliable they were and in order that the applicant might put questions to them in person .", "In the third place , ORG ought not to have taken account of the statement of NORP , whom the defence had not had the opportunity to question ; nor should it have decided after he had been allowed to abscond that there was no further point in attempting to obtain his attendance .", "In the fourth place , given the fact that the prosecution had brought forward the witness I. at the very last moment and without the defence having had any opportunity to prepare itself , ORG should have either declined to hear him or deferred his examination to DATE .", "In the fifth place , ORG ought not to have relied on witness statements taken by an investigating judge ( Judge PERSON . ) who had previously , as a member of a trial court and on the basis of the evidence then contained in the case file ( which included statements of all CARDINAL witnesses ) , taken part in a decision to prolong the applicant 's detention on remand . Judge PERSON . had , in his view , failed to preserve an appearance of impartiality .", "CARDINAL . ORG In accordance with the advisory opinion of the advocate general ( advocaat - generaal ) , PERSON , the applicant 's appeal was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "As to the first complaint , ORG held that ORG had given sufficient reasons for not hearing PERSON , especially since the defence had not indicated in what way his statement might be relevant to any decision regarding the charges proffered . Nor had the applicant been denied a \" fair hearing \" in this respect ; it made no difference that , in spite of the protests made by the defence , ORG had given the prosecution the opportunity to have a witness heard without previously announcing its intention to bring him forward .", "As to the second complaint , it was held that the mere fact that a defendant in a criminal case was not able to question an anonymous witness himself but had to do so through his counsel did not constitute a violation of the right to a \" fair trial \" , guaranteed by LAW CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW , or of the right protected by LAW CARDINAL ( d ) ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL-d ) .", "As to the third complaint , ORG found that the reasoning on which ORG had based its decision to make no further attempts to have NORP brought before it was not unintelligible ; in any case , it could not assess the validity of that reasoning since this was mainly a question of appreciation of facts . In view of the fact that it had proved pointless to repeat attempts to have NORP brought before ORG by force and of the fact that his statement was sufficiently corroborated by other evidence , in particular the statement made by ORG to the police , ORG had been entitled to use his statement in evidence .", "As to the fourth complaint , it was held that ORG had not been bound to construe the protests put forward by the defence either as a request for an adjournment or as a defence plea requiring a reasoned decision .", "As to the fifth complaint , ORG concurred with ORG that there was no reason to assume that Judge PERSON . had lacked the required impartiality or that the applicant could have had any cause for so fearing .
