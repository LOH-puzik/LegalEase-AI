The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant got married . At the time of the marriage , the applicant \u2019s wife had an almost DATE son , who had been born on DATE and whose father had been registered as \u201c unknown \u201d . On DATE the applicant was registered as having recognised paternity in respect of that child .", "CARDINAL . The spouses apparently stopped living together DATE after their marriage and divorced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant brought a claim in court to declare his recognition of paternity null and void . In particular , he asserted that the declaration , with which the child had been recognised and which had been enclosed in the case file , bore a signature that was not his . ORG examined his case and found that the legal requirements for recognition of the child had not been met . More specifically , the applicant had not personally expressed his will to recognise the child before the ORG agent authorised to receive such declarations ; in addition , it had been established on the basis of an expert report during the proceedings that the signature on the documents with which the child had been recognised in DATE was not that of the applicant . The court declared the recognition of the child by the applicant null and void in a final decision of DATE , which entered into force DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant \u2019s former wife brought a claim on behalf of her child to establish the applicant \u2019s paternity . She asked the court to order gynecological and blood tests in the context of the proceedings . She indicated in the claim the applicant \u2019s \u201c permanent address \u201d as the address where he could be reached .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not found at his \u201c permanent address \u201d when the authorities visited it once in DATE . According to a note by the summons officer , a neighbour had indicated that the applicant no longer lived there . The authorities proceeded by summoning the applicant with a publication in ORG in DATE . As he did not appear in court , a lawyer was appointed ex officio to represent him . The lawyer attended the court hearing before ORG which took place on DATE ; it appears that she had no contact with the applicant at any point in time , either before or after the hearing .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the claim , declaring the applicant the biological father of the child . The court also held that the child was to carry the applicant \u2019s names ( as a patronymic and family name ) and determined a DATE amount of child maintenance which the applicant had to pay . The court remained silent on the request for blood tests made by the applicant \u2019s former wife . Instead , it based its findings on DATE of the child \u2019s birth and on testimony submitted by the applicant \u2019s former wife \u2019s cousin and aunt . The latter stated that , at the time of the child \u2019s conception , the mother had been in an intimate relationship only with him . The court held that this was sufficient to conclude that the applicant was the child \u2019s father . The applicant was also ordered to pay MONEY ( ORG ) in legal fees to each of the ex officio lawyers appointed by the court to represent him and the child respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prepared CARDINAL notifications of the judgment , CARDINAL for the attention of the applicant and another for the attention of the child . The notification to the child was handed in person to the child \u2019s lawyer on DATE . As for the notification to the applicant , on DATE a court officer indicated on the court papers for notification that according to information from the applicant \u2019s neighbours he no longer lived at his \u201c permanent address \u201d and no new address was known for him . On DATE the court ordered that the notification be sent to the applicant \u2019s ex officio lawyer ; the latter was personally served a notice of the judgment on DATE . The notice indicated that an appeal against the judgment could be filed within DATE from the moment of notification . The applicant \u2019s ex officio lawyer did not appeal against the judgment and it became final .", "CARDINAL . The applicant found out about the judgment on DATE when he was informed , at his \u201c permanent address \u201d , of his obligation to pay child maintenance in accordance with a writ of execution following the DATE ORG judgment . A later certificate , issued on DATE by the bailiff service and enclosed in the case file , indicated that no payments had been received in connection with the writ .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed a request for reopening , relying on Article CARDINAL ( e ) and Article CARDINAL ( \u0436 ) of LAW in force at the time ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He claimed in particular that he had been deprived of the opportunity personally to participate in the court proceedings in which he had been declared the father of the child .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( SCC ) examined his request for reopening . It observed that the applicant had only learned about the Sofia City Court DATE decision on DATE . It found his request for reopening procedurally admissible as lodged within the statutory time - limit . Nevertheless , the SCC rejected the request on the ground that the procedure for summoning him to the hearing had been observed , namely , attempted service at the applicant \u2019s last known address and publication in ORG . The ORG also noted that a legal representative had been appointed ex officio and had represented the applicant during the proceedings . The court concluded , in a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE , that the applicant \u2019s right to take part in those proceedings and to exercise his defence had not been infringed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
