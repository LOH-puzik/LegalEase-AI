FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Guido Raimondi;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney;Yonko Grozev", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who live in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The case concerns criminal proceedings in which a judgment was rendered against the applicants by ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused the applicants leave to appeal and ORG judgment thus became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal before ORG , requesting it to annul ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE and to refer the matter back to it for a new examination . He claimed that the composition of the court had not been competent ( p\u00e4\u00e4t\u00f6svaltainen , domf\u00f6r ) as CARDINAL of the appeal court justices had been biased in the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the justice in question had been biased in the case and that therefore the composition of the court had not been competent . ORG thus annulled ORG judgment as far as the first applicant was concerned and referred the matter back to ORG for a new examination .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the second applicant also requested the annulment of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE as far as he was concerned . The outcome of his request was the same as for the first applicant : ORG annulled the Appeal Court judgment as far as he was concerned and referred the matter back to ORG for a new examination . The public prosecutors never requested annulment of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the reopened ORG proceedings the applicants claimed that ORG could no longer examine those charges which had been dismissed by the final ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE as the ORG request for reopening did not concern these parts of the case . They referred both to the prohibition of reformatio in peius and to the ne bis in idem principle . On the other hand , the public prosecutors claimed that the case had been referred back to ORG in its entirety . They claimed that , as the competency of the composition was a matter that concerned all parties , the prohibition of reformatio in peius did not apply and the examination of the case was to be conducted as if the case had only now become pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed , without examining the merits , those charges which had already been finally decided by ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The court noted that the public prosecutors had not challenged the impartiality of the composition of the court but that only the applicants had made such claims . Therefore , also taking into account the case - law of ORG , the previously dismissed charges could no longer be examined .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the public prosecutors appealed to ORG against this ORG decision . They claimed that the rules on impartiality were designed to protect all parties to the proceedings . In such a situation the prohibition of reformatio in peius was no longer applicable . As the earlier judgment had been annulled in respect of the applicants , there existed no earlier final judgment concerning them . The applicants disagreed with the public ORG conclusions . They pointed out that they did not even have any interest or right to appeal against ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in so far as it was favourable to them . A final judgment could not be annulled without any specific request to that effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the public prosecutors leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the ORG decision and referred the case back to it for a new examination . It found that the prohibition of reformatio in peius was valid in the NORP legal system and that it was applied both in ordinary and extraordinary appeal proceedings . The question of whether a case was annulled and referred back for a new examination in its entirety or only in part depended on the nature of the procedural error in the case at hand . If the procedural error affected the whole judgment and the proceedings , the case was referred back in its entirety , even if the judgment had been favourable to the appellant . The court noted that in the Convention or in its Protocols there was no specific mention of the prohibition of reformatio in peius but that it formed a part of the general fair trial guarantees . ORG had made a Recommendation on this subject in DATE . However , in the case - law of the ORG no similar case was to be found . On the other hand , there was caselaw about a judge \u2019s partiality , which issue had been considered by the ORG to be such a grave procedural error that it always led to the annulment of a judgment . The principle of ne bis in idem did not prevent new examination of the case if in earlier proceedings a grave procedural error had taken place . All partiality grounds were unconditional . In the present case the lack of competence of the composition concerned the whole ORG proceedings and the judgment in its entirety . Therefore the court had earlier annulled ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in its entirety . As the prohibition of reformatio in peius only applied to judgments which had become partially final , it did not apply to the present case in which a final judgment had been completely annulled . ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE was thus no longer binding in any respect . ORG reached this conclusion by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . The decision contains CARDINAL dissenting opinions .", "CARDINAL . There is no explicit provision concerning the principle of reformatio in peius in the domestic law . The established interpretation is , largely on the basis of the national case - law , that this principle is valid in the national legal system . This principle is inferable from LAW , LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ; as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) which reads as follows :", "\u201c [ ORG a criminal case , ORG may amend , in favour of the defendant , the judgment that ORG has given on the charges even if only the public prosecutor has appealed against this . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has dealt with the principle of reformatio in peius in some of its precedent cases .", "PERSON : After ORG had referred the criminal case back to ORG on the basis of the defendant \u2019s appeal , the complainant claimed damages in the retrial proceedings , although he had declared in the earlier proceedings that he had no claims for damages . Because the question about the complainant \u2019s right to damages had not been examined or determined by a judgment before , no impediment existed for examining the claim for damages .", "KKO:CARDINAL:CARDINAL : When sentencing the defendant to a punishment for robbery , ORG had obliged him to pay the complainant damages for mental suffering . When the defendant appealed to ORG , the complainant , in a counter - appeal , claimed an increase in the damages for mental suffering . ORG upheld the judgment of ORG . The complainant abided by ORG judgment but , on the basis of the defendant \u2019s appeal , ORG referred the matter back to ORG for a main hearing . In the new proceedings the complainant , on the basis of the counter - appeal , continued to claim an increase in the damages . ORG held that the counter - appeal could be examined in the retrial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , LAW , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that :", "\u201c On the basis of a complaint invoking procedural fault , a final judgment may be annulled :", "CARDINAL ) if the court had no quorum or if the case had been taken up for consideration of the merits even though there was a circumstance on the basis of which the court should have dismissed the case on its own motion without considering the merits ;", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , section CARDINAL , of the same Code ,", "\u201c [ i]f it is found that a procedural fault has occurred , the judgment shall be annulled in full or for the part necessary and , if the case is to be retried , it shall be referred back to the court where the procedural fault had occurred . In this event , ORG shall also order the deadline and manner for the bringing of the case to a retrial . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
