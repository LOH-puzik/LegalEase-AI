The ORG found , in particular , as follows :", "\u201c The PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office inspected [ the FAC ] and discovered that the educational process [ there ] follows a specific educational programme and class schedule and is carried out by staff teachers in exchange for pay . Students\u2019 knowledge of subjects is evaluated on a CARDINAL - point scale or with pass - fail marks ; upon completion of a course students obtain a diploma ... These elements indicate that the ORG engages in educational activities which are not listed in its articles of association ...", "LAW ( law no . NORP of DATE ) defines education as the purposeful process of upbringing and learning in the interests of the individual , society and the ORG , accompanied by the confirmation of achievement of the educational levels established by the ORG ... Pursuant to section QUANTITY of LAW , an educational institution acquires the right to conduct educational activities upon receipt of authorisation ( a licence ) ... As the materials in the case file show , the ORG has no such licence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG rejected the director \u2019s argument that the activities of the ORG fell outside the scope of the definition contained in LAW , holding that the definition \u201c may not be used to describe educational activities that are carried out in breach of LAW \u201d . The director was sentenced to pay a fine of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . In his statement of appeal , the director pointed out that LAW established specific educational levels ( basic and intermediate general education , basic , intermediate and higher professional education , and post - graduate professional education ) , none of which were mentioned in the ORG \u2019s programmes or diplomas . The religious instruction and guidance of followers fell outside the scope of LAW and were not subject to any licensing requirements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s decision in a summary fashion , without addressing the director \u2019s arguments in detail .", "CARDINAL . In concurrent proceedings , on DATE the same ORG found the applicant organisation liable for the administrative offence of violating sanitary rules and hygienic requirements in respect of all the points identified by ORG and ORG . ORG issued a warning to the applicant organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE summarily rejected the applicant organisation \u2019s statement of appeal , in which it maintained that the sanitary standards binding on ORG educational institutions were not applicable to the DATE school and Biblical college .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE town prosecutor filed a claim for dissolution of ORG . He rested his claim on the findings of the CARDINAL inspections , as described above , and the allegation of illegality of the educational activities conducted at ORG and DATE school . In his submission , such activities \u201c violated the right of an indeterminate group of people to receive education in conditions that guarantee security , improvement of health and counter the negative influence of unhealthy factors \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In his comments on the prosecutor \u2019s application , the director of ORG submitted that the applicant organisation merely dispensed religious instruction to its followers and did not provide formal education . He invited the court to reject the application and pointed out that the court could issue a separate decision ordering FAC to bring its activities into conformity with the requirements of the law . He indicated that , in response to the prosecutor \u2019s claims , ORG had promptly adopted the Rules on lecture- and seminar - based education , as a result of which it had eliminated the use of ambiguous terminology such as \u201c college \u201d , \u201c diploma \u201d , and others .", "CARDINAL . NORP The town prosecutor participated in the hearing on DATE . Responding to questions from the director of ORG , he admitted that the initial inspection had purported to uncover elements of extremism in the ORG \u2019s activities and that he had filed a claim for dissolution because \u201c it was within his competence \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A representative of ORG , the entity in charge of the registration of religious organisations , took part in the proceedings as a third party . She stated that there were CARDINAL registered religious organisations in LOC .

On DATE ORG ordered the dissolution of the applicant organisation and its removal from ORG . Having examined documents from the archive of ORG , it acknowledged that some of the ORG \u2019s activities had been one - time seminars and conferences to which the licensing requirement did not apply . However , the organisational chart of ORG , the class schedule , work contracts with teachers , lists of students and diplomas issued to them were held by ORG to be evidence of ongoing educational activities in the College for which it should have obtained authorisation ( a licence ) . Neither the Biblical Centre nor ORG were registered as an educational institution , nor had they obtained a licence for conducting educational activities . Accordingly , they had acted in breach of the requirements of CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the DATE school , ORG found that the contents and nature of religious education dispensed to children may be determined by the religious organisation providing it . Nevertheless , the material conditions of religious education should be compatible with sanitary and hygienic standards and other requirements applicable to educational institutions . ORG held that the above - mentioned judgments of CARDINAL and DATE , which had acquired the force of res judicata , were sufficient proof of both the fact that ORG dispensed education without the required licence , and the fact that the conditions in which students were educated at the DATE school and the ORG fell short of the sanitary standards .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the educational activities conducted by the applicant organisation without a licence amounted to a \u201c gross and repeated violation \u201d of the requirements of LAW and ordered its dissolution on the basis of LAW of LAW and section QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL .
