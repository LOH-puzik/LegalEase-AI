She was given her medical records and made a copy at the hospital , before returning them . According to the applicant , her copy of medical record no . CARDINAL contained no reference to the DATE referral for an ORG test .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG ( \u201c the MADEKKI \u201d ) about the quality of the antenatal medical care provided by PERSON In particular , she complained that PERSON had failed to refer her for the ORG test , which would have indicated the risk of foetal abnormality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON requested ORG to forward the applicant \u2019s medical records .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON interviewed PERSON explained that although the applicant had been referred for the ORG test on DATE , she had failed to attend because she had been hospitalised . Following her release from hospital there had been no point in carrying out an ORG test since she was by then in DATE of pregnancy . PERSON referred to the fact that the applicant had been referred for a genetic consultation in DATE of pregnancy . PERSON also explained that after the baby had been delivered , she had discovered that the applicant \u2019s eldest son had a mental illness , a fact which the applicant had concealed during her pregnancy . The applicant had further concealed the excessive alcohol consumption of her partner and father of the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having examined the applicant \u2019s medical records and interviewed relevant doctors , the PERSON issued its opinion . It found that although the applicant had been referred for the ORG test , PERSON had failed to ensure that the test was carried out . This failure was , it said , contrary to Ordinance No .

On DATE the PERSON informed the applicant of its finding that she had received antenatal medical care in accordance with national law , save that PERSON had failed to ensure that she had undergone the ORG test . It noted that ORG screening results could neither confirm nor exclude a congenital foetus abnormality but would rather serve as an indicator for further examinations . It also explained that the applicant bore some responsibility herself as she had failed to inform Dr L. of her eldest son \u2019s illness . Had PERSON been aware of the illness , she would have arranged for a medical genetic consultation in DATE of the applicant \u2019s pregnancy , thus ensuring a timely diagnosis . Finally , the PERSON informed the applicant of her right to apply to the law enforcement authorities within DATE of its decision if she was not satisfied with it .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant asked ORG to investigate whether the discrepancies in the CARDINAL copies of medical record no . CARDINAL amounted to falsification of documents . She also alleged negligence on the part of PERSON In support of her allegation , she submitted the unapproved copy of her medical records which she claims to have made in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police interviewed PERSON explained that in DATE of pregnancy she had referred the applicant for the ORG test but the test had not been carried out , for unknown reasons , because the applicant had failed to attend the appointment . PERSON referred to the applicant \u2019s right to refuse the test . She added that the applicant had concealed the genetic illness of her eldest son . Had his situation been disclosed , PERSON said that she would have arranged an immediate consultation with diagnosis by DATE of pregnancy . As regards medical record no . CARDINAL , PERSON explained that the entries in the record were made over an extended period of time as examination results were received and further appointments and treatment instructed . She also explained that medical record no . DATE had disappeared in DATE and was only recovered at DATE , when it was placed in the reception at ORG outside its working hours . She told the police that it was not in the interests of the medical staff to lose or conceal the record , since it meant that all the medical examinations would have to be carried out again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police refused to institute criminal proceedings for falsification of records or negligence . The investigators were satisfied that the applicant had been referred for the test but that she had not turned up for the appointment . The investigators also found that there were no technical means available to establish precisely the time when the contested data concerning the referral had been entered in the applicant \u2019s medical file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed the decision . She sought the institution of criminal proceedings for falsification of documents by a group of persons .

In DATE further police investigations were carried out . ORG confirmed that it did not have the ability to establish , by forensic methods , the date on which the contested entry was made .

The nurse told the police that in DATE the applicant had frequently visited her general practitioner and brought medical record no . CARDINAL with her , in order to record future appointments . The general practitioner had updated the record during her visits and returned it to her . Staff of A.

On DATE the police refused to institute criminal proceedings for falsification of documents by a group of persons .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed the decision . On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE and again remitted the complaint for further investigation . It noted that the applicant had submitted a non - approved copy of medical record no . CARDINAL and referred to the need to ascertain whether there were witnesses who could testify that the contested entry was missing in DATE when the copy was allegedly made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after further interviews with PERSON and the applicant \u2019s general practitioner , the police again refused to institute criminal proceedings . They concluded that it was not possible to determine whether the information concerning the disputed referral for the ORG test had been missing from the applicant \u2019s medical records in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The refusal to institute proceedings was upheld by ORG on DATE . However , on CARDINAL DATE , following an appeal by the applicant to ORG , the latter revoked the decision of DATE and instituted criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police requested forensic tests on medical record no . CARDINAL . An expert report dated DATE concluded that the medical records were not falsified but that they had been supplemented with new information over an extended period of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that the criminal proceedings had been terminated owing to the expiry of the statutory limitation period .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant lodged a claim for damages against ORG . She contended that PERSON had been negligent as she had not identified the applicant as belonging to a high - risk group and had not referred her for the ORG test . The applicant also alleged that PERSON had subsequently modified the medical records in order to conceal the failure . She further claimed that PERSON had not put in place a medical care plan in respect of her pregnancy and was therefore not in a position to provide the applicant with the necessary information on her treatment , in violation of sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . As a result of these failings , the applicant had been prevented from availing herself of her right to agree to or decline the ORG test . She claimed that had she known that the child had a congenital disease , she would have chosen to undergo an abortion on medical grounds . She claimed compensation for pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage , including compensation for lost wages and a lump - sum maintenance award for her daughter .", "CARDINAL . A hearing took place on DATE . The applicant \u2019s legal representative asked the court to hear the applicant as a witness in order for her to give evidence on the facts of the case . The court rejected the application without providing reasons . However , it granted the defendant \u2019s application for PERSON to appear as a witness and give oral evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s civil claim . The court held that , as it could not be proved that PERSON had falsified the applicant \u2019s medical records , the applicant had failed to turn up for the ORG test . It also noted that she had failed to inform PERSON of her eldest child \u2019s condition . It found that the applicant was not in a high - risk category merely on account of her age , and that the applicant was to blame for the fact that the ORG test was not carried out . It concluded that there was no causal link between the actions of PERSON and the birth of the applicant \u2019s child . Even though PERSON had been given an administrative fine for her failure to ensure that the applicant had the ORG test , this was insufficient to prove that PERSON had been at fault .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She argued that Dr. PERSON had been obliged to take all medical steps to establish whether her unborn child was healthy . Since she had not done everything required of her in order to discover the child \u2019s genetic abnormality in a timely manner , it had not been possible for the applicant to prevent the birth of a child with a congenital disorder . The applicant argued that the court had erred in finding that she did not belong to a risk group due to her age , since Ordinance No . CARDINAL indicated that pregnant women above DATE should have the ORG test . She also contended that the court had erred in concluding that she had been referred for the test . She maintained that the court \u2019s conclusion that she herself was to blame for the fact the test was not carried out was unfounded since the case file contained no evidence in that regard . Furthermore , she claimed that the court had given no reasons for relying on the medical records used by the PERSON instead of the earlier copy of the medical record that she had submitted . In any event , the applicant argued that even if she had been referred for the test , the referral was already too late as on DATE allegedly fixed for the test she was already in DATE of pregnancy . She further contended that had she refused to take the test , the doctor would have made a corresponding note in the medical record . As regards her eldest son , the applicant pointed out that PERSON had never asked her about the health of her other children and explained that her son had developed schizophrenia at DATE . She insisted that there was in her view a causal link between the PERSON failures and the birth of her child and that damages ought to be paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place on DATE before ORG of ORG ( PERSON tiesas PERSON tiesu pal\u0101ta ) . The applicant \u2019s legal representatives were unable to attend but the applicant asked the court to proceed in their absence . The applicant made submissions on her own behalf , and answered questions posed by the court . The court heard evidence from a representative of ORG , who explained the system of record - keeping at ORG and the loss of the applicant \u2019s medical record , and from PERSON testified that only an amniocentesis allowed an effective diagnosis of PERSON \u2019s syndrome . Although the risk of congenital abnormalities increased with age , the fact that the applicant was DATE was not as such an indicator that she ought to have an amniocentesis , which carried with it the risk of miscarriage . There were no objective medical indications to justify a referral for that procedure in the applicant \u2019s case . PERSON referred to the applicant \u2019s failure to disclose the condition of her eldest son and to disclose her husband \u2019s alcoholism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It agreed with the first - instance court \u2019s conclusion that applicant \u2019s allegations concerning the alteration of her medical record had not been proven , noting that the copy of the medical record submitted by her was not certified . The court also noted the PERSON \u2019s conclusion concerning the applicant \u2019s failure to inform PERSON of her eldest son \u2019s illness , observing that the \u201c mother \u2019s passport \u201d , which the applicant had at all times , drew attention to the importance of informing the doctor of any diseases suffered by existing children . It referred to PERSON evidence that , had she known of the illness , she would have ordered additional tests and examinations . The court also pointed out that LAW set out a duty on patients to comply with ORG instructions ; the applicant was accordingly under a duty to undergo the ORG test which she had been referred . The fact that there was no record in writing of her refusal to take the test was not proof of the fact that she had never been referred for it .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the ORG held that PERSON could not be held responsible for the child \u2019s genetic condition since no causal link could be established between the actions of PERSON and the child \u2019s condition . It also noted that :", "\u201c The result of the ORG test ... could neither confirm nor exclude genetic abnormality of a foetus , but would serve as an indication for further examination .", "Therefore the [ applicant \u2019s ] allegations that the results of the ORG test would have provided her [ with ] an opportunity to choose whether to continue with or terminate the pregnancy could not in itself serve as a basis to uphold the claim . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The only shortcoming in the applicant \u2019s medical care had been the failure to ensure that the ORG test was actually carried out . The court noted that the PERSON had already fined PERSON for this omission .", "CARDINAL . As regards the alleged falsification of medical record no . CARDINAL , it found that , since the applicant \u2019s medical record was missing at the time of her DATE appointment with PERSON , the latter had made her notes on a separate sheet of paper which had been added to the medical record once it had been recovered . The court noted the finding of the PERSON that the applicant had been referred for the ORG test and further recorded that the applicant did not dispute that she had attended an appointment with PERSON on DATE . It referred to the decision of the police of DATE not to institute criminal proceedings because there was no evidence that the medical record had been falsified . It therefore found that the applicant \u2019s account of the reason for the differences in the CARDINAL copies of her medical records had not been proven to be true .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant obtained a copy of the expert report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant subsequently filed an appeal on points of law . She argued that ORG had not assessed correctly whether the failure of PERSON to ensure that the ORG test was carried out had infringed the applicant \u2019s right to find out about any foetal abnormality . Even though the court had concluded that she had been referred for the ORG test , the judgment did not address whether the referral complied with section CARDINAL of LAW , i.e. whether she had received all the necessary information about the test ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Further , the applicant submitted that the court should have applied section CARDINAL of LAW and insisted that any refusal of the treatment should have been in writing ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She also submitted that the court had wrongly interpreted section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) by stating that she had been obliged to carry out the ORG , as it had not taken into account the need for free and informed consent before any medical intervention . Finally , she argued that in assessing whether PERSON actions had been wrongful , such as to give rise to damages , the court should have assessed whether the doctor had complied with the applicable rules , including the Ordinance No . CARDINAL . The court \u2019s conclusions as to the lack of a causal link were not compatible with the GPE , since had PERSON complied with her legal obligations , the applicant could have found out that the foetus had a genetic disease and could have availed herself of her right to have an abortion on medical grounds , thereby preventing the birth of the child . Accordingly , she maintained , the necessary causal link existed between PERSON wrongful actions and the birth of the child with PERSON \u2019s syndrome .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also contended that there had been a number of procedural failings before the appellate court . She alleged in particular that it had not assessed her claim for maintenance ; and that it had breached the rules in relation to assessment of evidence as it had uncritically accepted the testimony given by the doctor , had attached greater weight to the copy of the medical records submitted by the hospital than to the copy submitted by her , and had relied on the conclusions of the MADEKKI without itself verifying the facts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . The full text of the judgment was made available on DATE . The ORG concluded that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s allegations , the appellate court had come to its conclusions about the referral for the test and the applicant \u2019s failure to attend the appointment with due regard for a patient \u2019s right to receive information . Section CARDINAL of LAW was not applicable to this case as the applicant had simply not shown up for the test . The ORG further noted that applicant \u2019s arguments were based on the premise that she had not been referred to the test whereas the appellate court had found that a referral had been made . Her complaints of procedural flaws were rejected as unfounded", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant asked the ORG of ORG to reopen the civil proceedings on the basis of newly discovered evidence , namely the expert report of DATE which she had recently seen for the first time ( see CARDINAL and DATE above ) . On DATE the ORG dismissed the request ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
