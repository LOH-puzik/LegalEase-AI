CROATIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and living in GPE .", "In DATE the applicant , then aged CARDINAL , moved , together with his mother , to the privately owned flat in GPE he still occupies . The applicant and his mother were tenants and in possession of the flat on the basis of a lease between the applicant 's mother and the owner . In DATE the flat in question was nationalised , but DATE , in DATE , returned to the previous owner . The applicant and his mother continued to live in the flat , and in DATE the owner of the flat leased the flat to the applicant 's mother . After the mother 's death in DATE , the applicant prolonged the lease under his name .", "On DATE , the ORG enacted ORG ( Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo ) and on DATE , LAW ( Zakon o najmu stanova ) . While the first one regulates the sale of publicly - owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy , the second regulates the conditions of leasing privately - owned flats , including those previously let under a specially protected tenancy .", "The applicant , together with CARDINAL other applicants , lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) , claiming that certain provisions of LAW and ORG violated the constitutional guarantees of the right to enjoy their possessions , the respect and protection for family life and discriminated against former holders of specially protected tenancies of privately - owned flats .", "ORG ruled on DATE , and its decision was published in ORG ( ORG novine ) . The ORG quashed several provisions of LAW and dismissed the request to examine the constitutionality of ORG . As to LAW , the ORG quashed LAW , which obliged an owner of a flat let for an unlimited period of time to provide a lessee with another flat in adequate condition before cancelling the lease , if the owner intended to live in the flat himself or intended to install in the flat his children , parents or his dependants . ORG also quashed LAW , point CARDINAL , which excluded from the right to \u201c protected rent \u201d a lessee who had ceased to use the flat during DATE preceding the enactment of the LAW in question . Furthermore , the ORG quashed ORG DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL restricted the lessor 's right to terminate the lease of a lessee who does not pay the rent and charges , and is over DATE of age or receiving social security benefits , only to cases where the municipality provides such a lessee with another adequate flat with a right to \u201c protected rent \u201d in an amount affordable to the lessee . LAW provided in substance the same as the above - mentioned LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL .", "B. Relevant domestic law before amendments by ORG", "The Specially Protected Tenancies ( Sale to Occupier ) Act regulates the conditions of sale of flats let under specially protected tenancies . In general , the LAW entitles the holder of a specially protected tenancy on a publicly - owned flat to purchase it under favourable conditions of sale . However , the LAW excludes from such favourable treatment the holders of specially protected tenancies on most privately - owned flats .", "The provisions of the LAW challenged by the applicant before ORG provide as follows .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL point QUANTITY provides , inter alia , that the LAW does not concern privately - owned flats let under specially protected tenancies .", "Article CARDINAL provides that where the tenant of a publicly - owned flat has not applied to purchase it under LAW , the tenant of any privately - owned flat may lodge a request to buy it . Furthermore , this provision establishes the criteria for priority in the purchase of such flats .", "Article CARDINAL regulates the spending of the funds collected through the sale of flats let under specially protected tenancies . It requires PERCENT on such funds to be used , inter alia , to provide flats for the former holders of specially protected tenancies of privately owned - flats , while PERCENT of the funds must be used to help providing flats for families with CARDINAL or more children . If the funds originate from the sale of flats in culturally protected buildings , PERCENT of those funds must be used for the maintenance and reconstruction of such buildings while the rest is to be used according to the above mentioned criteria .", "DATE provides that the private owners of rented flats may , within DATE of the LAW 's enactment , sell their flats to the municipality . The municipality is under an obligation to purchase such a flat if the tenant undertakes to repurchase the flat from the municipality . The price of such a flat will be fixed according to the provisions for determining prices of publicly - owned flats let under specially protected tenancies .", "LAW in general regulates the legal relationship between lessee and lessor in regard to the lease of flats . It recognises a special category of lessees , those who were previously holders of specially protected tenancies on privately - owned flats . Such a category is , according to the LAW , subject to a number of protections , such as an obligation for the owners to contract a lease for an unlimited period of time , the payment of a so called \u201c protected rent \u201d , the amount of which is to be prescribed by the ORG , and strictly limited reasons for termination of the lease . This LAW abolishes the specially protected tenancy as such .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that the criteria for establishing the amount of \u201c protected rent \u201d are the condition of the flat in question , expenses for maintenance of the building and the lessee 's financial situation .", "DATE provides that , by enactment of the LAW in question , specially protected tenancies cease to exist and the former holders of specially protected tenancies become lessees .", "DATE provides that the former holder of a specially protected tenancy and the owner of the flat have to take out a lease for an unlimited period of time , and the lessee is entitled to pay the so - called \u201c protected rent \u201d , except where the lessee is using a part of the flat for some business - related activity ; or where the lessee is the owner of an inhabitable house or flat ; or where the flat has not been used by the lessee or any members of his family , during DATE preceding the entry into force of LAW , unless the owner had permitted their absence .", "Article CARDINAL provides that an owner is not obliged to lease a flat to a person who is renting CARDINAL flats . In that case the lessee is entitled to choose which flat he wants to keep as a lessee .", "Article CARDINAL obliges the owner to inform a lessee entitled to the \u201c protected rent \u201d that he is the owner of the flat , as well as of his personal address , within DATE of the LAW 's entry into force . Furthermore , the former holder of a specially protected tenancy is obliged to submit a request for a lease to the owner within DATE of the entry into force of LAW , or of a court 's decision recognising the right of the former holder of a specially protected tenancy to use the flat . If within a further period of DATE the owner does not sign the lease , the former holder of a specially protected tenancy may seek a court order imposing such an agreement . Such applications must be heard under the accellerated procedure . If the owner does not inform the former holder of a specially protected tenancy about his ownership , it is presumed that the owner is the person registered as such in the land registry .", "DATE provides that before the lease is signed , the former holder of a specially protected tenancy is obliged to pay the rent in the amount that he was paying before the entry into force of LAW .", "Article CARDINAL obliges a \u201c protected lessee \u201d to pay , besides \u201c protected rent \u201d , communal and other charges , if such charges are stipulated in the lease .", "Article CARDINAL provides that if the amount of the \u201c protected rent \u201d is changed , the lessee is obliged to pay this new rent , without a change of the relevant provision in the lease being necessary .", "Article CARDINAL provides that the names of family members sharing the same household as the former holder of a specially protected tenancy will be noted in the lease .", "Article CARDINAL transfers the legal position of a lessee to the persons referred to in the previous paragraph , in the event of the lessee 's death or relinquishment of the flat . The lessor is obliged to sign a new lease with such a person contracting a \u201c protected rent \u201d .", "DATE provides that the lessor may terminate the lease of a lessee in receipt of social security benefits or older than DATE of age , if such a person does not pay the rent or other charges , only where a municipality provides the lessee with another appropriate flat with a \u201c protected rent \u201d .", "DATE reiterates the basis on which a lessor may terminate the lease of a \u201c protected lessee \u201d , the conditions being : if the lessee does not pay the rent and charges ; if the lessee sublets the flat or part of it , without permission from the lessor ; if the lessee or other tenants in the flat disturb other tenants in the building ; if some other person , not noted in the lease , lives in the flat longer than DATE , without permission from the lessor , except where that person is a spouse , child or parent of the lessee or of the other legal tenants in the flat , or a dependant of the lessee or a person on whom the lessee is dependent if the lessee or other legal tenants do not use the flat as their home , but for other purposes ; if the lessor intends to move into the flat himself or install his children , parents or dependants there ; if the lessor does not have another flat and is entitled to social security benefits or is more than DATE of age .
