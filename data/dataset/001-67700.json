He is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "In DATE , DATE and DATE the applicant 's name appeared in various criminal investigations that were being conducted . On DATE a preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) was opened against the applicant on suspicion of narcotics and other drug related offences . A further preliminary judicial investigation was opened against him in DATE . These investigations eventually resulted in a total of CARDINAL charges being brought against the applicant . The first charge , insofar as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . that he , in or around the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE in GPE and/or elsewhere in the GPE and/or in GPE , has participated in an organisation having as its aim the commission of criminal offences and/or of which organisation he , [ the ] accused , was actually in charge ( \u201c aan welke organisatie , hij verdachte , feitelijke leiding heeft gegeven \u201d ) ;", "that organisation consisted of a group of persons , namely [ the accused ] and/or [ CARDINAL co - accused ] and/or CARDINAL or more others who were ( each time ) involved in [ offences involving synthetic drugs and cocaine , an unlawful deprivation of liberty and/or threats to life ] ;", "those crimes concerned ( each time ) intentional acts in violation of [ the provisions of LAW ( PERSON ) and/or the provisions of LAW ( PERSON ) ] ;", "[ constituting a punishable offence under ] LAW \u201d", "The remaining charges concerned :", "- the exportation of synthetic drugs , together with others or alone , from the GPE to GPE DATE and DATE ( charge no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- the exportation of synthetic drugs , together with others or alone , from the GPE to GPE DATE and DATE ( charge no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- the exportation of synthetic drugs , together with others or alone , from the GPE to GPE DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( charge no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- the exportation of synthetic drugs , together with others or alone , from the GPE to GPE DATE and DATE or , alternatively , the possession of , transporting of and/or trafficking in synthetic drugs in the GPE during that period ( charge no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- the production of , transporting of and/or trafficking in synthetic drugs in the GPE DATE and DATE ( charge no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- the production and/or possession of synthetic drugs , together with others or alone , in the GPE DATE and DATE ( charge no . CARDINAL )", "- the production , possession and/or transporting of synthetic drugs , together with others or alone , in the GPE DATE and DATE or , alternatively , having provided others with the necessary means for committing these offences ( charge no . CARDINAL) ;", "- the production , possession and/or transporting of synthetic drugs , together with others or alone , in the GPE DATE and DATE ( charge no . CARDINAL ) ;", "- the exportation of cannabis and/or hashish , together with others or alone , from the GPE to GPE DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( charge no . CARDINAL ) ; and", "- having unlawfully deprived , together with others or alone , a person of his liberty DATE ( charge no . CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE , the applicant was taken into detention in GPE on the basis of a GPE request for his extradition . Following extradition proceedings in GPE , the applicant was extradited on DATE to the GPE , where he was placed in pre - trial detention . He was summoned to appear on DATE before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE in order to stand trial on the aforementioned charges .", "In the course of the hearing held on DATE before ORG , the public prosecutor amended , inter alia , the first charge by replacing the phrase \u201c and/or of which organisation he , [ the ] accused , was actually in charge \u201d with \u201c whereas the accused , within that organisation , has fulfilled the role of director \u201d ( \u201c terwijl hij , verdachte , binnen die organisatie een rol als bestuurder heeft vervuld \u201d ) and by replacing the reference to LAW with a reference to LAW .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG declared the prosecution inadmissible in respect of the sixth , seventh , CARDINAL charges , finding that , during the criminal investigations , the authorities had used an infiltrator whose deployment and activities had not been duly recorded , thus rendering any subsequent control impossible . Although it found that the public prosecutor who had issued the summons against the applicant had not been aware of the role of the infiltrator at the outset , it was established that the prosecution had become aware of the matter before the hearing of DATE , whereupon the prosecutor should have notified ORG of this without delay . It held that , in these circumstances , there had been a serious breach of the principles of proper trial procedure ( beginselen van een behoorlijke procesorde ) for which only the most severe sanction was appropriate , namely to declare inadmissible the prosecution of these charges .", "It further declared the prosecution inadmissible in respect of that part of the first charge which had been amended by the prosecution on DATE , i.e. the factor that the applicant had acted as the director of the criminal organisation . It agreed with the defence that this point had not been examined in the NORP extradition proceedings whereas , pursuant to LAW , it should have been determined whether the charge as amended would have allowed extradition .", "ORG convicted the applicant of participation in a criminal organisation . He was also convicted on DATE charges . It acquitted him of the remaining charges and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , less the time spent in detention in GPE pending his extradition and the time spent in pretrial detention in the GPE .", "The applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE and , in this connection , requested the public prosecutor , by letter of CARDINAL DATE , to summon numerous witnesses , including the police officers X and Y who had acted as \u201c runners \u201d for PERSON , the civilian infiltrator who had been deployed in the different investigations which had led to the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant .", "ORG commenced its examination on DATE . In the course of CARDINAL hearings held DATE and DATE , ORG heard a total of CARDINAL witnesses , including QUANTITY police officers , CARDINAL public prosecutors and an investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) . Although ORG had accepted the applicant 's request to take oral evidence from the police officers X and Y , they failed to appear . In the course of the proceedings , the public prosecutor informed ORG that , given their current mental health , the QUANTITY police officers were unable to undergo questioning . This contention was supported by medical opinions drawn up by a police medical officer , a psychologist and a psychiatrist . Considering that it was pointless to summon these witnesses again , ORG rejected the applicant 's request to this effect .", "At the hearing held on DATE , ORG heard the parties ' final pleadings and set a date for judgment .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE . As regards the request by the defence to reconsider its decision not to pursue efforts to hear the witnesses X and Y , ORG held that the arguments put forward by the defence were insufficient for such reconsideration . In reaching this finding , ORG took into account that it had obtained extensive information about the activities of Z as an infiltrator by other means , such as the statements given by X and Y to ORG ( Rijksrecherche ) , a CARDINAL page fax message sent by Z to ORG ( Criminele Inlichtingendienst ) containing a \u201c report on activities concerning GPE \u201d , copies of internal notes containing information conveyed to the investigating authorities by Z and the statements given by X and Y to the PERSON investigating judge . It also rejected the argument that the prosecution should be declared inadmissible on account of the ORG 's failure to secure the appearance of these QUANTITY police officers . Although it found the situation to be highly unsatisfactory , it had not been established that this was the result of an intentional obstruction of judicial proceedings by the police officers concerned or their superiors . It further considered that , in view of the results of the investigation at trial , the interest of the defence in hearing both \u201c runners \u201d had diminished during the course of the proceedings , although the investigation at trial had not been complete .", "It upheld the decision of ORG to declare the prosecution inadmissible regarding the applicant 's purported role as the director of a criminal organisation , given that this had not been raised in the NORP extradition proceedings . It further declared the prosecution inadmissible in respect of DATE charges . Insofar as relevant , ORG held , as to the admissibility of the prosecution , as follows :", "\u201c In view of the suspicion that existed in respect of some groups to which the [ applicant ] was suspected to belong , the deployment of Z as ( a civilian ) informer / infiltrator was justified . Pursuant to the directives [ on ] infiltration dated DATE then in force , this deployment required the approval of the public prosecution department .", "Whether this approval has been given and , if so , in how far the responsible public prosecution department supervised the activities of Z , or how far Z acted upon the instructions of the runners or according to his own plans and insight , has DATE after the further investigation by the court DATE not been clarified . ... The court is of the opinion that it is plausible that , insofar as he has not respected instructions or has acted more extensively than allowed by the runners , with the supply of base materials and devices , or the production of hard drugs in the various laboratories , Z was given the opportunity , given the lack of supervision and control by ORG , to commit unpunished criminal offences and generate [ income from crime ] . In these circumstances , the public prosecution department must be held responsible for the activities not directed by ORG or the public prosecution department . ...", "This is different for the [ charges set out under nos . ] CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . Insofar as these facts can be proven , it has not been established that Z had anything to do with [ these facts ] .", "The infiltration by Z also forms no obstacle to the admissibility of the prosecution as regards [ the first charge ] . The element that Z , as an infiltrator , has in fact participated in , and possibly in certain cases has taken the initiative in , the commission of some of the punishable facts charged DATE the preparation / production of amphetamines and/or XTC \u2013 and that , in view of the probable scope of ORG 's activities , the public prosecution must be declared inadmissible in respect of those facts in the case against [ the applicant ] , does not mean that the public prosecution department must be denied its right to prosecute [ the applicant ] as regards his participation in an organisation whose aim is to commit these and other criminal offences . There is no indication whatsoever that the organisation would not have existed without the commitment of PERSON Nor has it been established that the applicant would not have participated in the organisation if Z had not become involved in it . \u201d", "ORG acquitted the applicant , for lack of evidence , on the second , third , fifth and tenth charges , and convicted him of participation in a criminal organisation and of participation in the commission of an unlawful deprivation of liberty ( first and eleventh charges ) . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment , less the time spent in detention in GPE pending his extradition and the time spent in pretrial detention in the GPE .", "As to the determination of the applicant 's sentence , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c The court has determined the sentence on the basis of the gravity of the offences and the circumstances under which they were committed , and on the basis of the person and the personal circumstances of the [ applicant ] , as has emerged from the hearings before the court .", "The court has had particular regard to the following :", "The [ applicant ] has participated in a criminal organisation involved in the production and exportation of amphetamines and ORG on a large scale . He has played a managing role ( \u201c leidinggevende rol \u201d ) in that organisation . He was motivated by financial greed , regardless of the considerable dangers which drugs such as amphetamines and ORG , as commonly known , constitute to public health . In connection with these criminal activities , the accused has further , together with others , committed an unlawful deprivation of liberty in which CARDINAL of the members of the organisation was [ deprived of his liberty ] .", "The court further takes into account that the accused , according to his own statement , was sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment in GPE in DATE in respect of a [ drug offence ] .", "In view of the nature and seriousness of the facts found proven , the court is of the opinion that only an unconditional prison sentence [ of DATE ] is a fitting sanction . \u201d", "The applicant filed an appeal in cassation with ORG ( PERSON ) and raised CARDINAL complaints . He first complained that ORG , in the reasons determining the sentence , had disregarded the law and/or the formalities entailing nullity because :", "\u201c According to LAW , it is a ( considerable ) aggravating circumstance when a participant in a [ criminal ] organisation manifests himself as a founder or director thereof . This aggravating circumstance was initially not included in the charge and it was also not notified to the extraditing ORG . ORG of GPE has thus correctly found that the public prosecution department did not have a right of prosecution in respect of this aggravating circumstance . Incomprehensibly , however , ORG subsequently attributes to this aggravating circumstance a prominent role in the prosecution via the back door in its determination of the sentence . Indeed , ORG explicitly considers that having a managing role in the organisation is significant in the determination of the punishment . Thereby , despite the prohibition on prosecution correctly determined by ORG , the [ applicant ] has been prosecuted and convicted for directing / managing the organisation [ at issue ] . The judgment has therefore not , or in any event not in a comprehensive manner , been reasoned as required by law . \u201d", "In his advisory opinion , the Procurator General to ORG proposed to reject this complaint , considering that :", "\u201c It must first be put that [ a ] \u201c managing role \u201d is not , by definition , equivalent to directing a criminal organisation or fulfilling the role of the director of that organisation , as meant by LAW of LAW . One can very well give guidance without being a director , as meant in the charge that was brought and in respect of which the prosecution was declared inadmissible . In its considerations , ORG has only indicated that [ the applicant ] has contributed more to the operation of that organisation than other participants , without \u2013 in giving this indication \u2013 finding that he performed the role of director ... The complaint therefore rests on an incorrect understanding of the judgment and it lacks a factual basis . \u201d", "In his response to the advisory opinion , the applicant submitted :", "\u201c In his advisory opinion on the first complaint , the Procurator General indicates that the complaint rests on an incorrect understanding of the judgment , as directing is not , by definition , equivalent to managing . The [ applicant ] is convinced that your Court , in your case law of DATE , has in fact indicated that \u201c directing \u201d , within the meaning of LAW , is not to be interpreted restrictively in the sense that it would only concern the civil law direction of ( for instance ) a legal person . It is indeed the managing of an organisation which is regarded by your ORG as ( a form of ) directing under LAW . Charges in which the element of \u201c directing \u201d is factually described as \u201c managing \u201d can stand the test of criticism like this . If your Court were to follow the advisory opinion , this would - in the [ applicant 's ] humble opinion - mean a departure from the current line , with considerable consequences for the prosecution of directing criminal organisations . \u201d", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's first complaint in cassation , holding :", "\u201c The charge under CARDINAL is geared to LAW . In the proceedings in first instance that charge has been amended , in the sense that , to this [ charge ] DATE undeniably as an aggravating circumstance as meant in the third paragraph of that DATE has been added \u201c whereas the accused , within that organisation , has fulfilled the role of director \u201d .", "In the impugned ruling , ORG has declared the prosecution inadmissible regarding the charge under CARDINAL , insofar as it concerns that aggravating circumstance .", "In the reasons given ... for the determination of the sentence , ORG has taken into account that the [ applicant ] has played \u201c a managing role \u201d in the organisation concerned .", "In so doing ORG apparently was referring to the managerial activities of the [ applicant ] which are not of such a nature that they mean that the [ applicant ] must be regarded as the \u201c director \u201d under LAW of LAW .", "The complaint , which rests on another understanding of the impugned ruling , thus lacks a factual basis , so that it can not lead to cassation . \u201d", "ORG also rejected the applicant 's complaint in cassation that his rights under , inter alia , LAW had been breached by the refusal of ORG to summon the witnesses X and Y again and/or to declare the prosecution inadmissible on account of the latters ' failure to appear . As regards these complaints , ORG held :", "\u201c The[se ] complaints do not constitute grounds for overturning the impugned judgment ( \u201c kunnen niet tot cassatie leiden \u201d ) . Having regard to LAW ( Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie ) , no further reasoning is called for , since these complaints do not give rise to the need for a determination of legal issues in the interests of legal unity and legal development . \u201d", "It also rejected the other complaints in cassation raised by the applicant .", "LAW ) , as in force at the material time and in its relevant part , read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Participation in an organisation whose aim is to commit offences shall be liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding DATE or a fourth category fine [ i.e. MONEY ] .", "...", "CARDINAL . For those responsible for setting up [ the organisation ] or its directors ( bestuurders ) , the term of imprisonment may be increased by CARDINAL , and a fine in the next higher category may be imposed . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) , insofar as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .

LAW lays down a general minimum sentence ( of DATE as far as imprisonment is concerned - LAW ) and , depending on the offence in question , a maximum sentence . Within these limits , the court is free to determine the appropriate sentence in the light of the accused 's", "According to LAW , where CARDINAL or more separate , indictable offences are committed , the maximum penalty which may be imposed is the combined total of the maximum penalties for each offence . However , insofar as a term of imprisonment is concerned , the penalty may not exceed the most severe maximum penalty by CARDINAL .
