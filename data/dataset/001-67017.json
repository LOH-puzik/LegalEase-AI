SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Ladislav E\u0161tok , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "summarised as follows .", "The applicant had been employed as a car mechanic with a private entrepreneur until DATE when he was dismissed with immediate effect for an alleged serious breach of work discipline .", "In a letter of DATE the applicant informed his employer that he considered the dismissal void and insisted that his employment continue .", "The applicant challenged the validity of his dismissal before the PERSON ORG ( Okresn\u00fd s\u00fad ) .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing . Immediately after the hearing , the applicant 's lawyer obtained a copy of TIME of it .", "On DATE ORG ruled that the dismissal was void for formal reasons . In particular , it did not state with the requisite clarity and certainty why the applicant was to be dismissed . The ruling became final and binding on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant took another set of civil proceedings against the above entrepreneur . He maintained that , as the dismissal of DATE was void , his employment continued . He was however neither being assigned any work nor being paid any salary . He claimed financial compensation for the wages thus lost .", "On DATE ORG took a decision on the action . It observed that , at the hearing held on DATE in the proceedings concerning the validity of the dismissal , the applicant had declared that he no longer wished to be employed by the defendant . In such a case the applicant was entitled to financial compensation for wages lost in a period limited under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( f ) of LAW to DATE following the void dismissal , i.e. until DATE ( \u201c the first period \u201d ) . ORG calculated the amount payable in respect of this period and ordered that the defendant pay this amount to the applicant . The ruling concerning the first period became final and binding on DATE . ORG finally dismissed the action insofar as it was claimed compensation for the wages allegedly lost in the subsequent period .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal . On DATE he submitted the reasons for it . He challenged ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE only insofar as it had dismissed his claim , i.e. in relation to period after DATE . He maintained that he had never made any statement to the effect that he was not interested in continuing to be employed by the defendant . There was no record of any such statement in the copy of TIME of the hearing of DATE that had been obtained by his lawyer .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) quashed the challenged part of ORG judgment and remitted the relevant part of the action ( i.e. pertaining to DATE only ) to the latter for reexamination . It noted that there was a discrepancy between the contents of the original version of TIME of the court hearing of DATE that was held in the respective courtfile and the copy of these minutes that had been submitted by the applicant . Contrary to the applicant 's copy , the version held in the courtfile contained a record of a statement by the applicant that he had no longer wished to be employed by the defendant . ORG instructed ORG to reexamine the matter after having clarified this discrepancy .", "ORG held further hearings on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE , following another hearing held on DATE , ORG determined again the remaining part of the applicant 's action . Despite all efforts , it was not possible to establish with certainty the legal nature of the applicant 's statement at the hearing of DATE as regards his further employment with the defendant . No conclusion could therefore be drawn from it and the relevant facts of the case had to be and in fact were established by means of other documentary evidence and several testimonies that were available . ORG made a distinction between the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE when ORG judgment of DATE concerning the validity of the dismissal had become final and binding ( \u201c the second period \u201d ) and the period after that date ( \u201c the third period \u201d ) . As for the second period , the applicant was entitled to compensation . ORG calculated the amount payable and ordered that the defendant pay this amount to the applicant . As for the third period , ORG finally decided that the existence and scope of any entitlement to compensation would be determined in another set of proceedings opened for this purpose under a separate filenumber . The defendant challenged this judgment by an appeal .", "On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE insofar as it concerned the second period . It found that ORG had not supported its determination of the amount payable in respect of this period by adequate reasoning and that it had failed to establish the facts relevant for this determination sufficiently .", "On DATE ORG again determined the amount payable DATE to the applicant by way of compensation for wages lost in the second period and ordered that the defendant pay this amount to the applicant . The applicant and the defendant appealed on CARDINAL and DATE respectively .", "On DATE ORG determined the appeals . It found that ORG had sufficiently established the facts of the case . ORG had however erred in its calculation of the amount payable and ORG adjusted the calculation . No appeal lay against this judgment .", "The separate set of proceedings which had been opened pursuant to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in order to determine the applicant 's claims pertaining to the third period is still pending .", "On DATE the applicant seized ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) with a complaint ( s\u0165a\u017enos\u0165 ) under LAW of ORG as in force from DATE . He objected that the length of the proceedings concerning his action of DATE had been excessive and invited ORG to find a violation of his right under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW to a hearing without unjustified delay , to order ORG to proceed with his case speedily , to award him CARDINAL NORP korunas ( SKK ) by way of just satisfaction and to order that the ORG reimburse his legal costs .", "On DATE the Constitutional Court found that ORG had violated the applicant 's above constitutional right . It ordered that ORG proceed with the case without delay and awarded the applicant LAW by way of just satisfaction in respect of nonpecuniary damage . ORG also ordered that the applicant 's legal costs be reimbursed . ORG took into consideration the whole duration of the proceedings since DATE when the action had been lodged . The subjectmatter of these proceedings was not of a particular complexity . The nature of the dispute called for special diligence . The applicant contributed to the overall length of the proceedings to some extent , in particular by not having formulated his early submissions with adequate clarity . ORG did not deal with the case effectively which was shown inter alia by the fact that its judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE had to be quashed as the relevant facts had not been established sufficiently . Moreover , the applicant 's claim in relation to the third period was still pending . ORG determined the amount of just satisfaction on an equitable basis referring to LAW .", "Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) provides , inter alia , that every person has the right to have his or her case tried without unjustified delay .", "Prior to DATE there was no \u201c effective remedy \u201d within the ORG meaning in GPE as regards this right ( see , mutatis mutandis , NORP v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . MONEY , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "As from DATE , the LAW has been amended in that , inter alia , natural and legal persons can complain about a violation of their fundamental rights and freedoms pursuant to LAW . Under this provision , ORG has the power , in the event that it finds a violation of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW , to order the authority concerned to proceed with the case without delay . It may also grant adequate financial satisfaction to the person whose constitutional rights have been violated as a result of excessive length of proceedings ( for further details see , e.g. , ORG and Others v. GPE ( dec . ) , nos .
