The applicant was born in DATE . He resides in GPE in GPE , where he is employed as a police officer with ORG of GPE ( ORG unutra\u0161njih poslova PERSON , hereinafter \u201c the NORP \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The facts , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , ORG adopted CARDINAL decisions whereby , inter alia , all of its employees who resided and worked in GPE were to be paid double salaries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a decision stating that the police officers in question were entitled to have their salaries increased by PERCENT , depending on the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reality , the applicant only received the increase approved by ORG , amounting to significantly less than the doubling of his salary envisaged by the Government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , therefore , the applicant filed a civil claim against ORG with ORG ( PERSON op\u0161tinski sud ) in GPE , seeking payment of the difference between the salary increase received and that granted by the Government . The applicant further requested the payment of unspecified amounts on account of the related pension and disability insurance contributions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered his employer to pay :", "i. MONEY ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) ( MONEY ( \u201c EUR \u201d ) at the relevant time ) in respect of the difference between the salary received from DATE and that granted by the ORG , plus statutory interest ;", "ii . the extra pension and disability insurance contributions for the above period in respect of this additional salary to the relevant ORG fund ; and", "iii . ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) for his legal costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Okru\u017eni sud ) in GPE reversed that judgment and rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . In its reasoning ORG held , inter alia , that the applicable domestic regulation was contained in the decision of ORG adopted on DATE . This judgment was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Many of the applicant \u2019s colleagues ( hereinafter \u201c the plaintiffs \u201d ) had lodged separate claims with ORG concerning the same issue , some of which were successful while others were unsuccessful : in CARDINAL other judgments rendered DATE and DATE , the same ORG ruled in favour of the plaintiffs , notwithstanding the fact that their claims were based on the same facts as those in the applicant \u2019s case and concerned identical legal issues . In its reasoning in these other cases , ORG held , inter alia , that the GPE salaries had to be paid in accordance with ORG decisions of DATE and/or DATE .", "CARDINAL . Of the CARDINAL judgments mentioned above , in CARDINAL cases the respondent lodged appeals on points of law ( revizije ) with ORG ( PERSON , see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . In the remaining CARDINAL cases , however , the respondent lodged no such appeal , apparently in the light of the statutory threshold ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government provided examples of relevant case - law adopted by ORG , in particular six separate judgments , of which one had been issued on DATE and the remaining CARDINAL between DATE and DATE . In each case , deciding upon appeals on points of law , ORG had ruled against the plaintiffs , albeit with somewhat different reasoning compared with that employed by ORG . In particular , ORG had held , inter alia , that the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE was not directly applicable .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG ( PERSON odeljenje ) of ORG held a meeting which was meant to resolve the issue of how to rule in all cases like the applicant \u2019s ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In TIME of this meeting , it was noted , inter alia , that in CARDINAL cases registered in DATE where appeals on points of law had been considered , ORG had in fact confirmed the lower courts\u2019 rulings in favour of the plaintiffs ( PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL and PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The meeting , however , was ultimately adjourned pending the outcome of a case which had been brought before ORG ( ORG ) concerning the abstract review of the constitutionality of the ORG \u2019s decision adopted on DATE . On DATE ORG held that the impugned decision was unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL separate cases the plaintiffs thereafter lodged their appeals with ORG ( ustavne \u017ealbe ) , but , according to the information contained in the case file , these proceedings are all still pending .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was not entitled to lodge an appeal on points of law since the value of his claim was below the threshold of QUANTITY . He did not attempt to obtain constitutional redress .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions are set out in the PERSON and Others v. GPE judgment ( nos .
