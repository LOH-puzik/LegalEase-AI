NORP In DATE ORG \u2019s mayoral candidate for PERSON , Mr PERSON , declared that , if elected , he would ban the calls for prayer broadcast from those loudspeakers because he believed that they disturbed persons who had other religious beliefs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , supporters of ORG mounted loudspeakers on a car and circled close to mosque , playing recordings of church bells and NORP chants during the regular DATE prayer that was taking place at the time . This was repeated during DATE that preceded the incident of CARDINAL DATE .

Video recordings of the event made by the media and broadcast on NORP television have been provided to the ORG by the parties . On the basis of those recordings , the following events can be established .", "CARDINAL . The demonstrators congregated , not on the LOC side of the mosque , but on Princess PERSON in front of the mosque , where the worshippers had already began to gather for DATE prayers .

Many carried large NORP flags and NORP flags , which were green and featured the inscriptions \u201c NORP \u201d and \u201c Let \u2019s get GPE back \u201d . In the course of the demonstration , the participants played NORP patriotic songs from loudspeakers mounted on cars .", "CARDINAL .

That is why you wash them ! \u201d One of the participants in the rally can be seen slowly cutting a NORP fez with a pocket knife , saying \u201c Can you hear me ? We shall now show you what will happen to each one of you ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . While this was happening , the mosque \u2019s imam , using the loudspeaker system , repeatedly appealed to the worshippers not to respond to the ORG provocation .", "CARDINAL . When the DATE prayer started , CARDINAL demonstrator climbed onto the roof of the single storey extension and played CARDINAL loudspeakers on the roof in order to suppress the sound of the prayer . CARDINAL or CARDINAL worshippers then interrupted their prayers , climbed onto the roof and tried to move the loudspeakers .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response , several more demonstrators entered the mosque compound by climbing onto the roof of the single storey extension . A scuffle ensued , in which members and supporters of ORG , some of whom were carrying wooden flagpoles and metal pipes , moved against the worshippers and started hitting them . Some of the worshippers hit back in response . Some can be seen holding and waving plastic tubing which appears to have been torn from the side of the mosque . TIME police officers also climbed onto the roof of the single storey extension to separate the fighting parties ; CARDINAL people were then arrested . While this was happening CARDINAL other police officers can be seen attempting to keep the demonstrators in the park beside the mosque and back from the side of the single storey extension : at this point , there were CARDINAL demonstrators in the park . Some of them can be seen throwing eggs at the worshippers .", "CARDINAL . Another few police officers can be seen attempting to maintain a human cordon between the remaining demonstrators ( another CARDINAL ) who were standing on the boulevard QUANTITY back from the area where the worshippers\u2019 prayer mats are spread out , though several members of ORG , including its leaders , can be seen standing in that latter area , just in front of the mosque railings .", "CARDINAL . The demonstrators then continued to pelt the worshippers with eggs and stones and insult them . CARDINAL of the demonstrators can be seen on the video recording wielding rolled up banner and shouting \u201c We have been putting up with you for DATE . Where else would permit this [ praying outside a mosque ] ? To whom are you praying ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . The parties accept that CARDINAL police officers , CARDINAL worshippers and Ms PERSON , who was hit on the chin by a flying stone , were injured in the course of the incident . It is not possible from the video recordings to determine who was responsible for her injury . CARDINAL of the NORP worshippers had to be hospitalised because he had concussion . CARDINAL police vehicles also sustained damage .", "CARDINAL . NORP In apparent response to the police arresting CARDINAL demonstrators on the roof of the single storey extension , Mr Siderov , surrounded by members of ORG and journalists , then spoke into a microphone and addressed the police officers who were present at the scene . He asked them why they had not arrested any of \u201c the real criminals who threw the stones \u201d and accused them of bothering \u201c NORP patriots \u201d rather than NORP who \u201c promoted violence against NORP \u201d . He then turned to the senior police officer at the scene , asking him if he was a janissary and suggesting that he put on a fez . Finally , he stated that , in GPE , there was no NORP police only a NORP one and that those police officers present were a disgrace to their uniforms .", "CARDINAL . The incident ended at TIME when , led by Mr PERSON and others , the demonstrators left the scene , Mr PERSON stating that he was going to ORG to ask for the resignation of the Minister of ORG . As Mr PERSON was about to leave , CARDINAL demonstrators wearing black t - shirts can be seen on the video recording piling some of the worshippers\u2019 prayer rugs and setting fire to them . No action was taken against those responsible , though it appears the police did call the fire brigade .", "CARDINAL . A number of politicians , including the then President of the Republic , PERSON , condemned ORG \u2019s involvement in the incident .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG adopted a declaration also condemning the incident . It read as follows :", "\u201c Members of ORG categorically condemn the aggression of the political party \u2018 Ataka\u2019 of CARDINAL DATE against worshippers in the centre of the capital . It is particularly scandalous that this was done on a DATE , DATE for NORP , at the time of their obligatory prayer . With those actions , that party isolated itself from NORP society in GPE .", "The conduct of that party is deeply alien to the NORP people , to its religious and ethnic tolerance . We express our profound disquiet at the attempts to undermine the ethnic peace and to stir up religious tensions between NORP citizens .", "Following its attempted aggression against ethnic peace , which gives rise to a threat to the national security of GPE , the political party \u2018 Ataka\u2019 has become dangerous for the government of the country .", "LAW says that it is impermissible to use religious communities and institutions , or religious beliefs , for political ends .", "We , Members of ORG , insist that all competent ORG authorities , including the prosecuting authorities and the courts , take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with the LAW and the laws of GPE .", "We call on the mass media to behave responsibly , which in this tense time full of provocations means not to provide a platform to the voice of hatred . \u201d", "CARDINAL . There have been CARDINAL separate series of investigations into the events at the mosque DATE : CARDINAL by the police , the other by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE , ORG set out the progress made in the police investigations . CARDINAL investigations had been opened : CARDINAL into the injury sustained by PERSON ; a second into injuries sustained by CARDINAL police officers and a cameraman , and criminal damage to the FAC and a police car ; and CARDINAL into the violence directed towards the worshippers . The first CARDINAL investigations have been suspended without anyone being charged .", "CARDINAL . NORP The letter also stated that , in the course of the third investigation , CARDINAL people had been interviewed as witnesses , and video recordings and other evidence had been obtained . In the course of that investigation , CARDINAL people had been charged ( \u201c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0435\u043c\u0438 \u201d ) with aggravated hooliganism contrary to LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . No information has been provided about whether those people were then prosecuted and , if so , whether any convictions were obtained .", "CARDINAL . An investigation was also opened by ORG on DATE . The focus of that investigation was whether there had been any offences committed under LAW ( the prohibition on hate speech motivated by religion : see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked to be allowed to take part in that investigation as a victim within the meaning of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request . It said that the offence under LAW DATE was a \u201c conduct \u201d ( \u201c \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u201d ) one ( see paragraphs CARDINAL", "and CARDINAL below ) and could therefore not have a victim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to ORG . On DATE the ORG referred the case back to ORG , instructing it to rule on the applicant \u2019s request by means of a formal decision . On DATE ORG did so , repeating the reasons that it had given on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision . On CARDINAL DATE the Sofia Appellate Prosecutor \u2019s Office found that the question whether an offence was a \u201c conduct \u201d ( \u201c \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u201d ) or a \u201c result \u201d ( \u201c \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e \u201d ) CARDINAL was irrelevant as to whether a person could be a victim of that offence . However , there was no evidence that the applicant had been present when the alleged offence had been committed or that the offence had directly affected him . It was therefore necessary to interview the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , on DATE the applicant was interviewed by the investigator in charge of the case . He stated that he had arrived at the mosque at TIME and had sat in the park between the mosque and FAC until prayers began . He described the ORG behaviour in the course of their demonstration , including the insults he had heard . He said that the police had done their job well in keeping the groups apart . According to the applicant , in the course of the interview the investigator was hostile to him and his religion , asking him whether he knew whether he was entitled to pray in front of the mosque and whether he had obtained permission to do so by an appropriate authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested that the supervising prosecutor assign the case to another investigator on the basis that the original investigator was ethnically and religiously biased . He also requested access to the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant once again asked to be allowed to take part in the investigation as a victim of the alleged offence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sofia City Prosecutor \u2019s Office refused the applicant \u2019s request , again finding that the offence under LAW DATE was indeed a \u201c conduct \u201d offence ( \u201c \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044a\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u201d ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) and could therefore not have a victim . It went on to reject the applicant \u2019s request to have the case reassigned to another investigator , reasoning that , not being party to the proceedings , the applicant had no standing to make such a request . For the same reason , the applicant had no right to inspect the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after unsuccessful appeals by the applicant to ORG and ORG , the deputy Chief Prosecutor decided that \u201c conduct \u201d offences ( \u201c \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044a\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u201d ) could in principle have a victim . It was therefore necessary to check whether the applicant had himself been prevented from carrying out his religious observances , and if so , in what way . That point had not been fully elucidated in his first interview , which made it necessary to interview him again , before deciding whether he could be allowed to take part in the proceedings in his capacity as a victim .", "CARDINAL . It appears that ORG investigation is still ongoing . Although a number of witnesses have been interviewed and expert reports obtained , no charges have been brought against any person in the framework of that investigation . However , the Government have submitted part of the investigation file . This includes CARDINAL statements given by a Mr M. In the second of those CARDINAL statements he admitted to being the person responsible for cutting up the fez during the demonstration . He stated that he was instructed to do so by Mr PERSON and that Mr PERSON told him to do it before Mr PERSON arrived at the scene . He said he could not refuse because he was working for PERSON at the time . PERSON also stated that it would have been possible to avoid any collisions between the demonstrators and worshippers if Mr PERSON had wanted . This could have been done by returning to the allocated place for the demonstration or by withdrawing after the scuffle on the single storey extension . PERSON also stated that young , far - right supporters of ORG had been drafted in from the town GPE specifically for the demonstration and that they had been placed in the front line of the demonstration . In Mr M. \u2019s view , Mr PERSON could have also avoided a confrontation with the worshippers had he not placed the GPE group at the front of the demonstration .", "CARDINAL . From the investigation file as submitted to the ORG , various efforts were made to summon the ORG party leaders who were at the demonstration in order to interview them . With the exception of PERSON LAW , the party \u2019s deputy leader , who has been interviewed , those efforts have failed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["9"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["9-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
