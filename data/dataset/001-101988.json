On DATE ORG issued a decision in a case brought by a private funeral provider , P. , from GPE na GPE municipality . The court found that section CARDINAL of the DATE Cemetery and Funeral Act was not in conflict with LAW , and neither was the impugned municipality decree , which established funeral services as a local public utility . ORG noted that , since no new act had been adopted in this area , funeral and cemetery services were deemed to be public utility on the basis of section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW read together with LAW Cemetery and Funeral Act .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that the restrictions resulting from the system whereby cemetery and funeral services must be provided as a public utility were justified by the public interest . In addition , the court accepted the municipality 's argument that for ethical , health and sanitary and hygiene reasons funerals could not be provided in the free market . Finally , ORG took into consideration the fact that the impugned regulation was of a transitional nature pending the adoption of a specific law , and found that the duration of this situation had not yet contravened the principle of the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( GPE za varstvo konkurence \u2013 \u201c the Competition Office \u201d ) issued a decision declaring lack of jurisdiction to deal with the complaint lodged by the private funeral services provider PERSON latter argued that the municipal enterprise authorised to provide funeral services on the basis of the municipal decree refused to accept at the cemetery remains transported by it .", "CARDINAL . ORG declared lack of jurisdiction to deal with the complaint , since the impugned decree concerned the ORG 's control of the market . Despite this , ORG expressed criticism concerning the regulation of funerals in GPE . It was , in particular , critical of the fact that , due to a legal vacuum , the DATE Cemetery and Funeral Act , adopted under the previous regime , was still in force . This Act did not distinguish between funerals and cemetery services . Consequently , funerals and cemetery services were automatically considered public utilities on the basis of section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . ORG further noted that funerals , which could not have been provided freely and privately under the previous regime , had in fact been carried out by registered private enterprises since the independence of GPE and the transition of the economic system . These private enterprises had provided all services except those concerning cemeteries .", "CARDINAL . ORG then listed the funeral products and services which should continue to be provided by private funeral enterprises . They included , inter alia , the sale of funeral articles ( coffins , upholstery , cremation urns and memorials ) , funeral flower arrangements , transport of remains ( except for emergency services which should be provided through concession ) , preparing obituary notices , obtaining the necessary permits and documents , organising ceremonies and graveside services , and the sale and installation of tombstones and memorials .", "CARDINAL . ORG was of the opinion that the listed services should undoubtedly be subject to a free market regime and that the restrictions in question could not be justified on ethical , health or sanitary or hygiene grounds .", "CARDINAL . P. lodged a new complaint in DATE , claiming that the municipal enterprise had acted in a discriminatory manner when it refused to bury the remains transported by him while allowing the remains to be transported by some other private entrepreneurs . Further to the remittal of the case by ORG , ORG issued a final decision on CARDINAL DATE . It found that while it was true that ORG had suffered damage due to the municipal enterprise 's acts , the municipal enterprise had a lawful monopoly on the territory of the respective municipality , which included the transport of remains . It has therefore protected its position by preventing PERSON from carrying out business which he could not have done lawfully . The other entrepreneurs who were allowed to bring remains to the cemetery were from other municipalities . As obiter dictum , ORG again questioned the appropriateness and constitutionality of the system , which should operate only as a transitional measure .", "CARDINAL . According to the information available to the ORG from a number of member GPE , in most of them funeral services are subject to the free market and provided by private firms . In some countries public bodies may choose to provide funeral services , however if they do they must compete with private enterprises . For example , in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , funeral services may also be provided by public bodies . If so , they are subject to market regulations and must compete on the free market with private enterprises . On the other hand , in GPE , as in GPE , funeral services are listed as public utilities and are mostly provided by public bodies .", "CARDINAL . As far as can be seen , funeral services providers are regulated by law in some countries , as is the case in GPE , GPE , GPE or GPE , and unregulated or self - regulated in others , like GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , for example , private funeral service providers may only operate with a licence or concession from a public body . Permits or licences are granted by local authorities and subject to a number of requirements , such as professional qualifications and competence , fulfilment of technical , security and health protection standards , and analysis of the company 's financial situation .", "CARDINAL . Unlike funerals , it would appear that cemetery and crematorium services are generally provided by public bodies , mostly the municipalities , since they are considered essential public services which are intrinsically linked to public health issues . When crematoria were nationalised in GPE , a transitional period was provided and a certain form of compensation was paid to the private enterprises which had formerly run the country 's crematoria ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
