He pointed out that the continued refusal to authorise the merging of DATE and of the CARDINALth school constituted an unjustified discrimination against ORG students , as it prevented them from blending into the cultural environment of the region and was motivated solely by the prefect \u2019s concern to avoid new incidents , this time on the part of the parents of students of the CARDINALth school .", "CARDINAL .
