The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON parents took her to the GPE ORG hospital because they thought that she was displaying symptoms of heart problems . The child was examined and then transferred to the PERSON paediatric hospital , where she was treated for DATE , after which the doctors decided that she should undergo heart surgery .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the operation , which took place on DATE , the patient \u2019s father signed a form setting out the potential risks facing his daughter in undergoing the surgical operation , consenting to the operation ( \u201c the consent form \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . During the post - operative check - ups a leak was detected on the periphery of the membrane covering the incision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , by decision of the hospital medical board , the patient underwent a second operation carried out by a different medical team . Prior to the operation , the patient \u2019s father signed a consent form identical to the first one . That form did not mention any risk of a serious neurological problem , but specified that the list of possible sequelae was not exhaustive .", "CARDINAL . After that second operation , the patient suffered an oedema , a brain haemorrhage , liver failure and muscle spasticity while in intensive care .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint against the doctors who had carried out the operations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the medical board of the D\u0131\u015fkap\u0131 paediatric hospital in GPE diagnosed the child with a severe irremediable psychomotor disability ( caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ) , estimating her disability rate at PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to standard procedure , the prosecutor \u2019s office applied to the Governor of GPE for authorisation to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report drawn up following the internal investigation commissioned by ORG stated that the patient was suffering from a very serious congenital heart disease , that treating that disease would entail a high - risk surgical operation and that in PERCENT of cases a leak was noted around the membrane , necessitating a second operation . It concluded that the medical team had not been guilty of negligence during the first operation .", "CARDINAL . According to the aforementioned report , the second operation , which had been carried out to rectify the leak , had also been very risky . The report pointed out that the patient \u2019s neurological complications had been a common occurrence during open - heart surgery and that they occurred when artificial pumps were installed to maintain blood circulation or where the patient was placed in hypothermia . It added that the patient continued to suffer from sequelae despite the treatment administered after the second operation . In conclusion , the investigator recommended not authorising a criminal prosecution . This preliminary investigation report explained that the relevant persons had been questioned by the instigator . It is not known in what capacity the author of the report , who is a doctor , was involved or to which hospital he is attached .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as recommended by the preliminary investigation report , ORG refused to authorise prosecution .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 challenge to that administrative decision was dismissed by ORG on DATE on the grounds that the preliminary investigation report and the appendices thereto were not such as to enable the prosecutor \u2019s office to instigate a judicial investigation .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office issued a discontinuance decision .", "CARDINAL . Concurrently with the criminal proceedings , the applicants lodged a complaint with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The expert appointed by the latter submitted his report on DATE . This CARDINAL - page document stated that the patient had displayed a congenital anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery ( ORG ) , that open - heart surgery had been carried out in order to irrigate the left coronary artery from the aorta , that DATE a leak had been detected on the membrane which had been applied to the incision during that first operation , that a second operation had been carried out which had resolved that problem , but that the patient had suffered a stroke . The expert pointed out that the patient \u2019s anomaly had been extremely serious , that it was liable to be fatal , and that the probability of complications occurring during or after such an operation had been high . The expert took the view that the second operation , geared to treating a foreseeable complication stemming from the first operation , had in fact been even riskier . He considered that open - heart surgery presented risks not only to the organ being operated on but also to other organs . The expert concluded his report as follows :", "\u201c The stroke [ suffered by ] the patient PERSON was one of the possible complications occurring during open - heart surgery .", "No negligence or fault has been noted on the part of the medical teams which carried out the first and second operations . The teams showed great efficiency and a high degree of medical expertise . The complication [ which occurred in the present case ] was an eventuality which can be observed in cases of anomalies [ such as that suffered by the patient ] and as a result of open - heart surgery . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought an action for damages against the doctors before ORG ( \u201c CCGJ \u201d ) alleging that they had not practised their profession properly and had caused the very severe sequelae with which their daughter PERSON was afflicted . In support of their claim they submitted a private expert report dated DATE on the amount of the damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG appointed a board of experts comprising CARDINAL professors and a lecturer in cardiovascular surgery from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The board of experts submitted its report on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to that report the patient had originally been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy ( an illness which significantly diminishes the \u201c pumping \u201d capacity of the heart ) at ORG , and following more detailed examinations at ORG , ORG , also known as ORG syndrome , had been diagnosed .", "CARDINAL . The experts explained that the patient had undergone a PERSON operation to create an intrapulmonary tunnel and that a leak had been noted on the periphery of the membrane during the check - ups conducted DATE . They stated that that leak had led to a second surgical operation , that the patient had been placed on respiratory support owing to the emergence of a tonic - clonic contraction after the operation and that the neurological sequelae had appeared during that period of intensive care .", "CARDINAL . After those initial findings , the experts stated in their report that the heart disease from which the patient suffered and for which she had undergone surgery was rare , accounting for PERCENT of all congenital heart diseases . Without treatment the mortality rate was PERCENT , and those affected seldom reached adulthood . The board of experts considered that the only treatment for that disease was surgery , and that the most appropriate type of surgery was the PERSON operation . The board added that the latter had a mortality rate of PERCENT , that in PERCENT of all cases a leak could occur around the membrane following such heart surgery and that , taking all types of complications together , the rate of re - operation was PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . The experts added that in PERCENT of cases congenital cardiovascular diseases were accompanied by neurological disorders , and that a multi - country study had shown that the rate of neurological damage in the immediate post - operative period stood at PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . In their conclusions , the experts pointed out that ORG was a very serious heart disorder and that the patient \u2019s parents had signed a consent form before their child \u2019s operation . They considered that the fact of the patient \u2019s dilated cardiomyopathy had further exacerbated the already serious risks posed by the operation . According to the report , the leak which had been observed around the membrane after the first operation had been a complication which occurred in PERCENT of cases , and the operation carried out to resolve that issue had been even riskier than the first one . The experts also pointed out that the neurological damage suffered by the patient had been a complication which was often encountered in cases of patients suffering from a congenital heart defect who underwent post - operative intensive care .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report , which quoted CARDINAL so bibliographical sources , ended with the following words :", "\u201c In short , this patient \u2019s situation could be seen as CARDINAL large complication . There can be no question of the doctors having committed a medical or surgical error . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants contested the report , deeming it inadequate . They considered that the document , which cited scientific studies , was more like a magazine article than an expert report . It contained no concrete and objective facts about the case in hand and would not help in determining the dispute . The applicants did not deny that there had been a risk , but considered that neither that risk nor the signing of a consent form released the doctors from their duty to practise their profession properly . They submitted , however , that the report , which lacked any explanations or reasoning on that point , had not mentioned any checks carried out with regard to the risk factors . Consequently , they asked the court to commission a second expert assessment , either from a different medical board or from a specialist section of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG rejected the applicants request for a second expert assessment .", "With regard to the expert report of DATE and the facts set out in the prosecution investigation file , the court held that the doctors had not been responsible for the sequelae affecting the child after her high - risk operations , to which her parents had given their consent .", "CARDINAL . The parents lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment , reiterating their previous criticism of the expert report , which they considered inadequate . They also emphasised that the report had been based on the medical file and that their daughter had not been examined by the experts . Furthermore , under established case - law , the experts should have begun by explaining the acts and procedures required by medical lege artis and comparing them with the acts which the doctors in question had actually carried out in order to determine whether and how far the said rules had been observed . Furthermore , they submitted that it was not the ORG usual practice in this type of case to confine themselves to a single expert report . In that connection , the rejection of their request for a second expert report had amounted to a blatant injustice . They alleged , moreover , that CARDINAL of the doctors who should have been present during the operation had stayed away from the theatre after having been alerted by telephone that the patient \u2019s heart had stopped during the operation , pointing out that the expert report had neither analysed nor even mentioned that fact .", "CARDINAL . Their appeal was dismissed by judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL .
