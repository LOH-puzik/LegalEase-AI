They also caused damage to a motor car .", "Following investigations , Mr PERSON and CARDINAL other men were arrested and remanded in custody . The applicant was indicted on a charge of assault and armed robbery , a charge of wilful damage and CARDINAL charges relating to firearms . DATE and DATE he stood trial in the High Court of Justiciary sitting in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant received legal aid for the preparation of his defence and for his representation by counsel at the trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG During the trial a prosecution witness , PERSON , entered the courtroom prior to giving evidence and spoke to one of the applicant \u2019s co - accused , against whom charges had been dropped . When PERSON was called to give evidence , the applicant \u2019s counsel objected on the basis of her earlier presence in court . The trial judge adjourned the case and instructed prosecuting counsel to make further inquiries into the matter so that it could be determined whether PERSON attendance was due to any negligence or failure on the part of the ORG . Prosecuting counsel informed the judge that inquiries had revealed no fault on the part of anyone for whom the ORG bore responsibility . This was not disputed by the applicant \u2019s counsel , who , moreover , was unable to give any indication as to how PERSON evidence could be affected by her earlier presence in court . The trial judge accordingly took the view that no injustice would be done by PERSON examination . Finding that the relevant legal conditions were satisfied ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he therefore exercised his discretion and permitted her to give evidence . Subsequently , counsel for the applicant had the opportunity to cross - examine PERSON on the matter of her attendance in court .", "In her evidence , PERSON stated that the applicant had been at her home TIME before the robbery and had spoken of robbing the post office . TIME he had left the house and returned later with a bag , in a state of nervousness . Other evidence against the applicant included the fact that a shotgun and various items stolen from the post office were found on the applicant \u2019s LOC .

Mr Boner instructed new solicitors , who asked a different counsel to advise on the prospects of an appeal and to draft a note of appeal .", "In his opinion dated DATE counsel stated his view that the only possible ground of appeal related to the \" admissibility of the evidence of PERSON \" and to the question \" that the trial judge erred in exercising discretion in allowing her to be present \" . However , he conceded that he had not been provided with sufficient information to be able properly to base an opinion or to frame grounds of appeal . Notwithstanding this acknowledgement he did draft a note of appeal which contained CARDINAL grounds , the first CARDINAL of which concerned the trial judge \u2019s decision to admit the witness . This note of appeal was filed by the applicant \u2019s solicitors on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Up to this point all the work had been covered by the legal aid granted for the trial . An application to extend legal aid to the appeal proceedings had been submitted in DATE . On DATE ORG ( \" the Board \" ) asked the applicant to provide an opinion from counsel on the prospects of success . The earlier opinion dated DATE was accordingly forwarded to ORG , together with a supplementary opinion from the same counsel dated DATE . In this latter opinion counsel reiterated the view that the appeal rested on the question whether PERSON evidence was admissible . However , he again stated that he had not been provided with sufficient material on which to assess the merits of the appeal . \" I regret meantime I am unable to answer the fundamental question in this case \" , he concluded .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors informed the ORG by telephone that counsel had finally decided that he could not support the application for legal aid or the appeal ; that they were of the same view ; and that , consequently , they could no longer act for the applicant .

ORG On DATE ORG notified Mr PERSON \u2019s solicitors that his application for legal aid had been refused as the ORG was not satisfied , as it was required to be under the relevant legislation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that he had substantial grounds for taking an appeal and that it was reasonable that he should receive legal aid . In a letter of DATE to the applicant the ORG added that it could not see any merit in the appeal . Despite the advice of his solicitors and counsel , Mr PERSON decided to proceed with the appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant , who had no legal knowledge and had no assistance with his submissions , presented his own case on DATE before ORG of Justiciary , sitting in GPE and acting as an appellate court . The ORG was represented by counsel . There is no indication in the record that the court required counsel for the ORG to address it .", "CARDINAL . ORG The appeal court considered the first CARDINAL grounds of appeal relating to PERSON and held that these were ill - founded and that the trial judge had approached the matter properly . As the applicant did not address the court on the remaining grounds of appeal , these were not considered by the court . It did however examine other points raised by the applicant , but reached \" the clear conclusion that there was no miscarriage of justice in the case \" .
