He referred to the warning that he had given to the jury to put out of their minds anything which they might have heard or seen about the case outside the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . During the trial , the prosecution presented evidence for the purpose of establishing that the CARDINAL defendants were criminally responsible for their actions in that they knew that what they were doing was wrong ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The applicant had refused to be examined by Dr PERSON , a consultant psychiatrist instructed by the prosecution . Dr PERSON , a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist who had originally been instructed by ORG 's solicitors , was subpoenaed by the ORG to give evidence . In her report of CARDINAL DATE prepared for the applicant 's solicitors , PERSON had expressed the opinion that the applicant presented as a boy of good or at least average intelligence who had answered questions spontaneously and appropriately and who would have known the difference between right and wrong in DATE , more particularly that it was wrong to take a child from his mother , injure him and leave him on a railway line . In addition , she found that T. showed the signs of post - traumatic stress disorder , involving a constant preoccupation with the events of the offence , a generalised high level of anxiety and poor eating and sleeping patterns . This disorder , combined with the lack of any therapeutic work since the offence , limited his ability to instruct his lawyers and testify adequately in his own defence . At trial Dr ORG stated that , although she considered that the applicant was fit to stand trial , she had some concern as to how the post - traumatic stress symptoms affected his understanding of the procedures .", "The prosecution also called the headmistress at the school attended by the CARDINAL boys .

In a report on the applicant dated DATE , PERSON of ORG , who had worked with GPE since DATE , explained that \u201c trust building has been a difficult and long drawn out process which is partly due to [ T.

As part of the process of trust building , PERSON had agreed with the applicant that their sessions should be confidential , with progress being reported in general terms only . It follows that there is limited psychiatric evidence relating to , inter alia , the effect of the trial on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In his memorial to the ORG the applicant stated that , due to the conditions in which he was put on trial , he was unable to follow the proceedings or take decisions in his own best interests . He had been severely intimidated and caused feelings of anxiety and oppression by the procedures followed .", "CARDINAL . In a report on the applicant PERSON dated DATE , Sir PERSON , Professor of ORG at ORG , ORG , observed :", "\u201c I have also been asked to comment on the likely mental and emotional effects on children in general , and on [ ORG ] in particular , of the prolonged trial process being in public . In my opinion there are CARDINAL negative aspects of the trial process as they apply to children of [ ORG 's ] age . First , one serious consequence of the long time involved in a trial means that there is an inevitable delay in providing the psychological care and therapeutic help that is needed . A child of DATE of psychological development still to come and it is most important that there is not a prolonged hiatus when this is impeded by the trial process . In particular , when children have committed a serious act , such as killing another child , it is most important that they are able to come to terms with the reality of what they have done and with all that that means . That is not possible at a time when a trial is still underway and guilt has still to be decided by the court . Thus , I conclude that the very prolonged nature of the trial process is bound to be deleterious for a child as young as QUANTITY or eleven ( or even older ) . The fact that the trial process is held in public and that the negative public reactions ( often extreme negative reactions ) are very obvious is a further potentially damaging factor . While it is crucially important for young people who have committed a serious act to accept both the seriousness of what they have done and the reality of their own responsibilities in the crime , this is made more difficult by the public nature of the trial process ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant and ORG 's conviction for murder , the judge sentenced them , as required by law , to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "He subsequently recommended that a period of DATE be served by the boys to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence ( the \u201c tariff \u201d \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . He commented that he could not determine the boys ' relative culpability , and stated :", "\u201c Very great care will have to be taken before either defendant is allowed out into the general community . Much psychotherapeutic , psychological and educational investigation and assistance will be required . Not only must they be fully rehabilitated and no longer a danger to others but there is a very real risk of revenge attacks upon them by others . ... If the defendants had been adults I would have said that the actual length of deterrence necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and general deterrence should have been DATE . However these QUANTITY boys came from homes and families with great social and emotional deprivation . They grew up in an atmosphere of matrimonial breakdown where they were exposed to , saw , heard , or suffered abuse , drunkenness and violence . I have no doubt that both boys saw video films frequently showing violent and aberrant activities . In my judgment the appropriate length of detention necessary to meet the requirement of retribution and general deterrence for the murder , taking into account all its appalling circumstances and the age of the defendants when it was committed is DATE ... . DATE is ' very very many years ' for a DATE . They are now children . In DATE time they will be young men . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Lord Chief Justice recommended a tariff of DATE . The applicant 's representatives made written representations to the Home Secretary , who was to fix the tariff period .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG informed the applicant that the family of the deceased child had submitted a petition signed by CARDINAL people urging him to take account of their belief that the boys should never be released , accompanied by CARDINAL letters of support from the public ; that a Member of ORG had submitted a petition signed by CARDINAL people calling for a minimum of DATE to be served ; that CARDINAL coupons from the PERSON newspaper supporting a whole life tariff and a further CARDINAL letters and small petitions had been received of which CARDINAL wanted a higher tariff than the judicial recommendations .", "The applicant 's solicitors were given an opportunity to submit further representations to the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG informed the applicant that he should serve a period of DATE in respect of retribution and deterrence . The letter stated , inter alia :", "\u201c In making his decision , the Secretary of ORG had regard to the circumstances of the offence , the recommendations received from the judiciary , the representations made on your behalf and the extent to which this case could be compared with other cases . He also has regard to the public concern about this case , which was evidenced by the petitions and other correspondence the substance of which were disclosed to your solicitors by our letter of DATE , and to the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice . The Secretary of ORG takes fully into account the fact that you were DATE when the offence was committed . He further acknowledges that a much lesser tariff should apply than in the case of an adult . The Secretary of ORG notes the representations which were made on your behalf regarding the relative culpability of yourself and your co - defendant . The Secretary of ORG notes that the trial judge was unable to determine this . The Secretary of ORG has reached the same conclusion . The recommendations made by the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice were that the appropriate tariff should be DATE , and DATE respectively . The trial judge added that if the defendants had been adults then the appropriate tariff would have been DATE . The Secretary of ORG has had regard to these views . He takes the view that this was an exceptionally cruel and sadistic offence against a very young and defenceless victim committed over a period of several hours . The Secretary of ORG believes that if the offence had been committed by an adult then the appropriate tariff would have been in the region of DATE and not DATE as suggested by the trial judge . For these reasons , and bearing in mind your age when the offence was committed , the Secretary of ORG has decided to fix a tariff of DATE in your case . The Secretary of ORG is satisfied that such a tariff is consistent with the tariffs fixed in other cases . The Secretary of ORG is prepared to consider any fresh representations which you or your representatives might wish to make about the length of the tariff and , in the light of such fresh representations , to reduce the tariff if appropriate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted judicial review proceedings challenging , inter alia , the tariff which had been set by the Secretary of ORG as being disproportionately long and fixed without due regard to the needs of rehabilitation . Leave was granted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG upheld part of the applicant 's claims . On DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal of the Secretary of ORG . On DATE , ORG by a majority dismissed the Secretary of ORG 's appeal and allowed the applicant 's cross - appeal . A majority of ORG found that it was unlawful for the Secretary of ORG to adopt a policy , in the context of applying the tariff system , which even in exceptional circumstances treated as irrelevant the progress and development of a child who was detained during Her Majesty 's pleasure . A majority of ORG also held that in fixing a tariff the Secretary of ORG was exercising a power equivalent to a judge 's sentencing power and that , like a sentencing judge , he was required to remain detached from the pressure of public opinion . Since the Secretary of ORG had misdirected himself in giving weight to the public protests about the level of the applicant 's tariff and had acted in a procedurally unfair way , his decision had been rendered unlawful ( see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The tariff set by the Secretary of ORG was accordingly quashed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG informed ORG that , in the light of ORG judgment , he had adopted a new policy in relation to young offenders convicted of murder and sentenced to detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure , pursuant to which , inter alia , he would keep the tariff initially set under review in the light of the offender 's progress and development . The Secretary of ORG invited the applicant 's representatives to make representations to him with regard to the fixing of a fresh tariff .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the adoption of this judgment , no decision has been taken in respect of the applicant 's tariff . The Government in their memorial informed the ORG that although the applicant ORG had submitted representations regarding the appropriate length of tariff , similar representations were still awaited in respect of T. , and the Home Secretary was in addition seeking independent psychiatric advice regarding both detainees .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG as amended by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the age of criminal responsibility in GPE and GPE is DATE , below which no child can be found guilty of a criminal offence . The age of DATE was endorsed by ORG ( composed of Members of ORG ) in DATE ( ORG , Sixth Report of the Session DATE , Her ORG ) . At the time of the applicant 's trial , a child DATE was subject to a presumption that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong ( doli incapax ) . This presumption had to be rebutted by the prosecution proving beyond reasonable doubt that , at the time of the offence , the child knew that the act was wrong as distinct from merely naughty or childish mischief ( C.

At the time of the applicant 's conviction the effect of the sentence of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure was that the child or young person was detained for an indeterminate period , the duration of which was wholly within the discretion of the Home Secretary . The Secretary of ORG had a discretion to refer the case of a detained child to ORG for its advice and , if so advised by ORG , had a discretion to decide to order the child 's release ( Criminal Justice Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , sections PERSON ) and ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) ; see the speech of Lord PERSON in ORG , NORP v.

In the judicial review proceedings brought by the applicant ( Ex parte V. and ORG , op . cit . ) , ORG gave consideration , inter alia , to the nature of the tariff - fixing exercise in respect of sentences of detention during Her Majesty 's pleasure .", "Lord PERSON held :", "\u201c The starting point must to be inquire into the nature of the power to fix a tariff which the Home Secretary exercises . Writing on behalf of the Home Secretary ORG explained that : ' The Home Secretary must ensure that , at all times , he acts with the same dispassionate fairness as a sentencing judge . ' The comparison between the position of the Home Secretary , when he fixes a tariff representing the punitive element of the sentence , and the position of the sentencing judge is correct . In fixing a tariff the Home Secretary is carrying out , contrary to the constitutional principle of the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary , a classic judicial function . ORG entrusted the underlying statutory power , which entailed a discretion to adopt a policy and fix a tariff , to the ORG Secretary . But the power to fix a tariff is nevertheless equivalent to a judge 's sentencing power . \u201d", "Lord Hope held :", "\u201c But the imposition of a tariff , which is intended to fix the minimum period in custody is , in itself , the imposition of a form of punishment . This has , as Lord PERSON observed in NORP v. Secretary of ORG for ORG , ex parte Doody at p. CARDINAL - B , the characteristics of an orthodox judicial exercise , which is directed to the circumstances of the offence and those of the offender and to what , having regard to the requirements of retribution and deterrence , is the appropriate minimum period to be spent in custody . The judge , when advising the Secretary of ORG about the tariff , must and does confine his attention to these matters ... If the Secretary of ORG wishes to fix a tariff for the case DATE in order to replace the views of the judiciary with a view of his own about the length of DATE he must be careful to abide by the same rules ... \u201d", "Lord Hope also commented on the imposition of a tariff on a child offender :", "\u201c A policy which ignores at any stage the child 's development and progress while in custody as a factor relevant to his eventual release date is an unlawful policy . The practice of fixing the penal element as applied to adult mandatory life prisoners , which has no regard to the development and progress of the prisoner during this period , can not be reconciled with the requirement to keep the protection and welfare of the child under review throughout the period while he is in custody . \u201d", "Lord PERSON stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... if the Secretary of ORG implements a policy of fixing a penal element of the sentence of a mandatory prisoner pursuant to his discretionary power under LAW , he is to this extent exercising a function which is closely analogous to a sentencing function with the effect that , when doing so , he is under a duty to act under the same restraints as a judge will act when exercising the same function . In particular , should he take into account public clamour directed towards the decision in the particular case which he has under consideration , he will be having regard to an irrelevant consideration which will render the exercise of his discretion unlawful . In so holding I wish to draw a distinction in the present context between public concern of a general nature with regard to , for example , the prevalence of certain types of offence , and the need that those who commit such offences should be duly punished ; and public clamour that a particular offender whose case is under consideration should be singled out for severe punishment ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
