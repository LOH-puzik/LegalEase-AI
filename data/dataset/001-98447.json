They alleged that ORG had not assessed the relevant facts correctly . In particular , the applicants challenged the conclusion that the predecessors of the plaintiffs had acquired the property in question pursuant to a document issued on DATE . In any event , they argued that the document was invalid as it contained incorrect information . Finally , the applicants alleged that the property in question had not been specified with sufficient certainty in the document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG publicly delivered a judgment dismissing the applicants ' appeal on points of law . The judgment stated that ORG had examined the case without a hearing pursuant to Article CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure . It indicated that the plaintiffs had submitted observations on the applicants ' appeal on points of law . In their observations the plaintiffs had alleged that their predecessors had acquired the property in question by virtue of the document of CARDINAL DATE or , in any event , by prescription .", "CARDINAL . ORG upheld the conclusions reached by ORG . It held that , despite several inconsistencies in the text of the administrative document of DATE , it was evident that the land in question had been allocated to the plaintiffs ' predecessors . Similar administrative documents were to be presumed correct and binding to the extent that they had been delivered by a competent authority and had become final . The ordinary courts could not subsequently review the merits of such decisions . The fact that , according to the document , further action had been needed with a view to completing the allocation of the property to the persons concerned was irrelevant as regards the acquisition of the property by the plaintiffs ' predecessors by virtue of that document . Such situation was in conformity with the law in force at that time .", "CARDINAL . The applicants filed a complaint with ORG . They relied on LAW . They complained that ORG had had before it observations submitted by the plaintiffs which had not been communicated to the applicants . They further contended that ORG had not taken into account the fact that the document in issue did not clearly indicate the persons to whom the land had been allocated and that ORG had not remedied that shortcoming .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' complaint . It found that the parties had had ample opportunity to submit their arguments on the relevant issues before the ordinary courts at CARDINAL levels . With reference to the judgment of ORG , ORG held that the plaintiffs ' observations in those proceedings had contained no new arguments . The reasons for ORG judgment relied on facts and arguments which had been known to the applicants and on which they had been able to comment at an earlier stage of the proceedings . ORG had taken no evidence . It had addressed the relevant issues and had given sufficient reasons for the conclusions reached , which did not appear arbitrary . The fact that the applicants had not been able to comment on the plaintiffs ' submissions to ORG , and that the latter had dismissed their appeal on points of law , was not contrary to the applicants ' right to a fair hearing . ORG further held that , in view of its above conclusions , the applicants ' complaint regarding the alleged violation of their property rights as a result of ORG decision was manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ) \u00a7 CARDINAL permits the court of cassation to dispense with a hearing , inter alia , where an appeal on points of law is based on the argument that the lower court had incorrectly assessed the case . Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL ) provides that no evidence is taken in cassation proceedings ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
