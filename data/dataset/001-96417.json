GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been working as a licensed doctor in GPE from DATE . Since DATE he has been practising medicine in GPE .", "CARDINAL . He is a member of ORG ( PERSON ) , a corporation under public law and since DATE had been paying compulsory contributions to its pension scheme until his change of residence to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to his move to GPE , he was informed by ORG pension scheme ( GPE ) that he could either terminate his membership or continue to stay as a member on a voluntary basis while paying contributions at the full or a reduced rate . The applicant opted for the continuation of his membership and chose to pay voluntary contributions in an amount equal to CARDINAL of the maximum contribution rate .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE he has also paid the full compulsory contribution to the relevant GPE pension scheme .", "CARDINAL . Ever since his move to GPE the GPE pension scheme has informed the applicant DATE in writing about the amount of his future pension entitlement . He objected to the corresponding notifications on several occasions alleging that while the amount of contributions had been increased , his expected pension had been unduly reduced compared to DATE . He was repeatedly informed by the GPE pension scheme that the decrease of his pension entitlement was due to the agreed adjustment of his contributions DATE .", "CARDINAL . By letters of CARDINAL and DATE the GPE pension scheme advised the applicant of the option to have the meanwhile accrued contributions transferred to the GPE pension scheme subject to the latter 's approval . It further specified that a transfer of the contributions could only be effected by means of a direct payment to the GPE pension scheme and that it was not possible to disburse the amount accrued to the applicant himself . By a letter dated DATE the applicant asked for his contributions to be transferred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE pension scheme informed the applicant that the conditions of a transfer were not fulfilled since the GPE pension scheme was not in a position to accept a direct transfer of the contributions . The applicant notified the GPE pension scheme on DATE that he nevertheless wanted to continue the payment of his voluntary contributions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to a further objection by the applicant on DATE regarding the calculation of the amount of his future pension entitlement , the GPE pension scheme , by letter dated DATE , specified that the definite amount of the applicant 's pension claim would be determined once he had become eligible to the actual payment of pension benefits and could only be challenged together with a corresponding payment order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought an action against ORG ( PERSON ) with ORG claiming the transfer of the total amount of his compulsory and voluntary contributions accrued with ORG pension scheme including interest and compensation for inflation to the GPE pension scheme . Alternatively , he requested that the GPE pension scheme be obliged to freeze his pension entitlement at the current amount while maintaining the amount of contributions to be paid by him .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that there existed doubts as to the admissibility of his action . It asked in particular for information as to whether there existed a decision of ORG rejecting the transfer of his contributions and whether he had instituted preliminary administrative proceedings ( PERSON ) in this respect . As regards the applicant 's alternative action , ORG pointed out that a corresponding dispute could only be instituted once the applicant was entitled to the payment of the pension . The applicant replied by letter dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . By letters dated DATE and DATE ORG submitted its written observations to which the applicant replied by written submissions dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . At his repeated request , the applicant was informed by ORG , by letters dated DATE , DATE and DATE , that it was not yet foreseeable when a decision in the matter would be taken since older pending matters were being treated as a priority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG assigned the case to a single judge for a decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing took place . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the action as primarily inadmissible and did not grant the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's claim for a transfer of his pension contributions ORG held that he was lacking the need for judicial relief ( Rechtsschutzbed\u00fcrfnis ) since following the failed attempts to transfer the contributions in DATE the applicant had voluntarily continued to pay the contributions and had not repeated his request to have them transferred by the GPE pension scheme . It found that the applicant could only have had recourse to the courts after having challenged an administrative decision rejecting his request . The applicant 's alternative claim was rejected as manifestly ill - founded by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
