On DATE he supplemented his application for asylum and put forward the same arguments as in the extradition proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE his application for asylum was refused by ORG ( \u201c the MA \u201d ) , on the ground that the applicant \u2019s fears of persecution on political grounds in his home country were unfounded . He was formally notified of that decision on DATE . The ORG concluded that the applicant had committed crimes on the territory of NORP . The applicant belonged to organisations which had been banned by a decision of ORG in DATE ; therefore , his presence at the demonstration in DATE in support of his arrested brother had been of itself a criminal act . The applicant \u2019s allegation that CARDINAL of the population of the town of PERSON had been prosecuted for their political views was , in the view of the ORG , absurd , since there were not enough police officers in NORP to prosecute so many people . The ORG also concluded that the applicant \u2019s membership of PERSON was merely passive , and therefore that he was not at risk of ill - treatment in this connection . The ORG found , in particular , that \u201c it was certain that the applicant did not belong to any political , religious or civic organisations \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

ORG noted , in particular , that in DATE he had been travelling freely between GPE and GPE , and that DATE he returned to NORP to visit his relatives in PERSON . The applicant had applied for asylum only after his arrest in GPE and not immediately at border control . The applicant \u2019s closest relatives lived in NORP undisturbed and did not leave the country . The court concluded that this demonstrated that the applicant had not been a victim of political persecution as he alleged .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s membership of PERSON and his brother being a former leader of ORG , the court noted that the applicant \u2019s political involvement was not official , that he only shared their political opinions and did not attend meetings , nor did he engage in agitation . The mere fact that he had political views which were different from the government \u2019s official position did not give him the right to claim asylum .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that NORP was a member of many international conventions , had an ombudsman , and respected human rights . As regards the references to other sources which cast doubt in GPE \u2019s human rights record , that information had been obtained from the mass media , was opinionated , and was therefore not objective .", "CARDINAL . The court held that he had not produced sufficient evidence of the risk of persecution for political reasons at home , and that NORP complied with its international obligations in the human rights area .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment on appeal in a summary fashion .", "DATE . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s appeal against the extradition order . At the hearing the applicant was represented by a lawyer of his choice . The applicant denied committing the offences imputed to him and presented an alibi . The defence also claimed that if extradited to NORP the applicant would be tortured , as many others accused of \u201c religious extremism \u201d had been . The defence referred in this respect to the relevant case - law of the ORG and to numerous reports of international human rights NGOs and ORG bodies competent in the field . The applicant also claimed that he had learned about the criminal prosecution against him only at the moment of his arrest in GPE . He also referred to numerous inconsistencies in the documents submitted in support of the extradition request by the NORP authorities ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution did not contest that the applicant belonged to the opposition movement and had been present at political gatherings . However , they drew the court \u2019s attention to numerous inconsistencies in his submissions , cast doubt on the reliability of the sources of information relied on by the applicant , and stressed that the applicant was involved in a terrorist organisation .", "CARDINAL . Having heard the parties , ORG upheld the extradition order . ORG reasoning can be summarised as follows . The court observed that the applicant faced serious criminal accusations and that the acts imputed to him would in principle qualify as \u201c crimes \u201d under NORP law . It was not the task of the NORP court to establish whether the applicant was guilty of the impugned crimes . The court held that the inconsistencies in the Tajikistani documents were \u201c technical errors \u201d and did not affect the validity of the extradition request .", "CARDINAL . It was impossible for the court to establish when exactly the applicant had entered the territory of GPE for the last time , since the applicant \u2019s own submissions in this respect were inconsistent , and there was no official information on the matter . However , the court found that it certainly had not been in DATE , as the applicant had alleged . According to his original statement to the prosecutor , the applicant had been residing permanently in GPE since DATE . He had not applied for political asylum in GPE before his arrest . Although the applicant had lost his passport in DATE , he did not contact the embassy of NORP to obtain a new one . During the interview the applicant was unable to indicate his exact address in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had a family in NORP , which included his brother \u2019s family and his first wife and children . They all lived in their family house . He regularly spoke to them on the telephone , and it was impossible that they would not tell him about the criminal prosecution . The court concluded that the applicant had been living in GPE permanently since DATE , that he had been aware of the criminal proceedings against him in NORP , and that he had been hiding from the Tajikistani authorities in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court did not find any evidence that the applicant \u2019s case was \u201c political \u201d . At the first questioning he mentioned that he had come to GPE to find work , not out of fear of persecution . At the hearing the applicant stated that he had attended a political gathering in DATE , but that his role had been limited to giving a lift in a car to his relatives and taking them to the venue of the gathering . He denied having been involved in any political anti - governmental activity in NORP . His activity in the PERSON political movement was minimal : he simply shared their political opinions . The court observed that the applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON , was serving a prison sentence in NORP ; however , other members of his family , including his elder brother PERSON , were all living in GPE . The applicant \u2019s first wife lived in NORP with their CARDINAL children and his second wife had been able to leave NORP freely and come to GPE . His family owned QUANTITY of orchards near a recreational zone . He was able for DATE to maintain himself and his family with his earnings from selling dried fruit in GPE . The authorities thus did not interfere with his business interests or those of his family , despite the allegedly political underpinning of the case against him . His own testimony about the political nature of the prosecution was inconsistent . He first stated that the criminal case against him resulted from personal animosity between him and the chief of the local police following a quarrel in a caf\u00e9 . Later in the court proceedings the applicant suggested that the criminal prosecution had been instituted so that his family \u2019s land could be taken away .", "CARDINAL . The court also examined letters received from ORG in support of the applicant \u2019s cause , and noted that they did not contain anything which would point to the existence of a risk of ill - treatment to him personally .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court finally analysed the institutional and legislative guarantees against ill - treatment which existed in NORP , as well as its international obligations , and concluded that they were sufficient to guarantee that the applicant would not be subjected to any ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ruled that the applicant \u2019s detention would not be extended pending extradition , because the period of the applicant \u2019s detention had reached the maximum established by law ( DATE ) . At the same time , the court indicated that since the applicant had been residing in GPE without papers , he could have been subjected to expulsion ( administrative removal ) proceedings and detained on that ground .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the validity of the extradition order and upheld the reasoning of the lower court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office forwarded the relevant documents in respect of the applicant to the police , who drew up a report on his illegal stay in GPE , which amounted to an administrative offence under LAW ( \u201c the CAO \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of LOC examined the case against the applicant and found him guilty . The court established that the applicant had unlawfully resided in GPE from DATE until his arrest on DATE with a view to extradition . The court imposed an administrative fine on the applicant , ordered his expulsion ( administrative removal ) from GPE and placed him in detention pending expulsion because of the gravity of the offence and because the applicant had no stable income in GPE . No specific time - limit for the applicant \u2019s detention was given by the court . The court did not address his arguments about the risk of ill - treatment in the event of his deportation to NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor ordered the applicant \u2019s release from detention pending extradition , because the maximum term prescribed by law had expired . In the release order the prosecutor noted that an extradition check was in progress . The applicant was not released but was transferred to the Serpukhov ORG in LOC , according to the detention order issued in the course of the expulsion proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyers appealed against this order to ORG . They submitted that the court had refused to consider the applicant \u2019s arguments concerning the possibility of ill - treatment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , during TIME of CARDINAL DATE he was visited in the detention centre by QUANTITY police officers from the antiextremism department of ORG . They offered the applicant the opportunity to leave GPE for NORP voluntarily , with a plane ticket provided by them . He was also photographed . It appears that the Dolgoprudniy Town prosecutor in charge of his case was not informed of that visit . Nor were the applicant \u2019s lawyers informed thereof . The applicant declined the offer and was returned to his cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned the hearing concerning the expulsion order due to the failure of CARDINAL of the witnesses , a police officer who had issued the administrative offence report , to appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the appeal . The police officer did not appear at the hearing , but the court decided to proceed with the case . The applicant was not present at the hearing either , since the police had not arranged for him to be transferred from the detention centre to the court ; however , his lawyer was present . According to the applicant \u2019s lawyer , the judge told her that the court had no obligation to arrange for the applicant to attend in person . The court confirmed the validity of the expulsion and detention orders . The court did not address the arguments concerning the risk of the applicant being illtreated in NORP . The court did not specify the period of the applicant \u2019s detention with a view to expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to ORG in LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the applicant \u2019s representative \u2019s request , ORG of the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( ORG ) expressed the following opinion on the risk of ill - treatment the applicant faces in NORP :", "\u201c In accordance with numerous reports of international organisations as well as generally accessible information on GPE , because of mass violations of human rights and basic principles of international law by the ORG authorities , including the principle of prohibition of torture , in particular , widespread practices of torture and ill - treatment by law - enforcement bodies , especially to extract confessions in criminal proceedings , violations of fair trial provisions , such as denial of access to legal counsel and lack of an independent judiciary , taking into account the fact that in NORP the applicant is to be prosecuted in connection with criminal offences , ORG considers that there exists a real risk of torture for the applicant in the event of his expulsion to NORP . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
