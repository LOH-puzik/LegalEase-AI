Furthermore , amongst the witnesses \u2013 including victims who have been ill - treated or are family members of the victims , there is a fear of the defendant and the available material in the case file shows that the witnesses have been threatened ...

[ The accused are suspected of ] shooting and bombing family houses , locking civilians in basements without windows or light , taking civilians to unknown locations and shooting them or killing them with hard or sharp objects , and the killing of the entire PERSON family and part of the PERSON family out of revenge and ethnic discrimination ... Therefore both defendants are suspected of particular cruelty and mercilessness ... , which , in view of the number of [ victims ] and the consequences of such conduct , the impugned offences in their entirety significantly surpass the usual circumstances pertinent to such grave offences .
