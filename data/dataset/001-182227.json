The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery committed in an organised group .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vyborgskiy ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) remanded the applicant in custody . ORG relied on the particularly serious nature of the crime with which the applicant had been charged and his position on the merits of the arrest and the charges brought against him . The court also relied on the risk that he might flee from the investigating authorities and the court , exert pressure on victims , witnesses and other participants in the criminal proceedings , or otherwise hamper the administration of justice in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked ORG to adjourn the hearing until DATE so as to enable her to review the prosecution material and discuss her position with the applicant . The judge refused to adjourn the hearing until DATE , but granted a TIME adjournment until TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , having found no grounds for altering or lifting the custodial measure and having taken note of the particular complexity of the case . The applicant \u2019s argument to the effect that no investigative measures were being carried out with his participation was rejected with reference to the investigator \u2019s discretion to lead the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the above decision , claiming , inter alia , that the TIME adjournment of the hearing on CARDINAL DATE had not permitted him to consult his lawyer in private ; nor had it allowed his lawyer to have sufficient time to review the prosecution material .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) found that there were no reasons to vary the preventive measure , and it upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE on appeal . ORG held that the TIME adjournment granted by ORG had been sufficient for studying the prosecution file consisting of CARDINAL pages . Most of the file consisted of procedural documents concerning issues relating to the institution of the criminal proceedings , the extension of the time - limit for the investigation , the joinder of criminal cases , and documents which had been previously handed to the applicant . Besides , all these documents had been examined in the hearing on DATE . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint as to his inability to have a confidential exchange with his lawyer before the hearing of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the applicant and his lawyer had been given the opportunity to communicate in the courtroom . However , they had refused to communicate in such conditions . This did not amount to a breach of the applicant \u2019s right to defence , because the applicant \u2019s lawyer could have had a confidential meeting with the applicant in the remand prison without any restrictions , and they could have developed their defence position beforehand . In any event , the hearing could not have been adjourned until DATE , since the time - limit for the applicant \u2019s detention had been due to expire on DATE , and therefore the decision on the preventive measure had had to be taken before then . Both the applicant and his lawyer participated in the appeal hearing .", "CARDINAL .

However , the adjournment was refused . Legal aid counsel was appointed for the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , reiterating the reasons which had prompted the application of the custodial measure in the applicant \u2019s case , ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE pending examination of the case file .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed , complaining , inter alia , about the refusal to adjourn the hearing so as to enable his lawyer to defend him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that there were no reasons to vary the preventive measure , and it upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE on appeal . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint regarding the alleged violation of his right to defence by the refusal to adjourn the hearing of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s lawyer had failed to prove her sickness by providing a medical certificate . This made the examination of the issue of the applicant \u2019s detention in her absence lawful under domestic law , as legal aid counsel had been appointed for the applicant . Both the applicant and his lawyer participated in the appeal hearing , the applicant by means of a video link from the remand prison .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG further extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE pending examination of the case file . The court noted that the grounds which had prompted the application of the custodial measure in the applicant \u2019s case had not changed , and referred to the considerable size of the case file , a case file which neither the applicant , nor his co - defendants or their lawyers had been able to examine in full .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the above decision on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of all charges in a jury trial . The judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
