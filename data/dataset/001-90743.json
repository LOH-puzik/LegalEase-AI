The applicant was born in DATE and is currently in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and applied to ORG ) for asylum and a residence permit , claiming that he had left GPE due to his fear of PERSON and his regime . He brought his CARDINAL children with him ( born in DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively ) while his wife arrived in DATE . At the initial interview held with the applicant on DATE of his arrival in GPE , he stated , inter alia , that he was NORP and had worked as a major in ORG where he had served in a transport division for heavy vehicles . He had deserted from the army DATE previously and had fled to the northern part of GPE where , with the help of a smuggler , he had managed to get on a plane to GPE . He had had neither ticket nor passport and his wife had remained in northern GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a written submission dated DATE the applicant added mainly the following to his initial account . He was born in GPE but had moved to GPE in DATE when he married . DATE and DATE , during the war with GPE , he had served in the military and he had been called up again between DATE and DATE , during the occupation of GPE , to serve in an armoured transport division assigned to transport tanks . He had been given CARDINAL military awards for bravery and CARDINAL medals , however such medals had been given to a large number of officers and soldiers . In DATE he had been called upon to carry out military assignments ( allegedly murders and terrorist acts ) against the GPE in FAC . As he had felt unable to murder his own people , he had deserted and left GPE on DATE . In this respect , he submitted that he sympathised with all organisations working against PERSON and working towards a democratic government . Following his desertion , he had visited his relatives in GPE and then made his way , with his family , to northern GPE , where he and his children had travelled to GPE via GPE with the help of smugglers . Since he had held the rank of major in the reserve and had deserted , he would be executed if he were forced to return to GPE . Apart from his QUANTITY medals he also had an identity card as a major which confirmed that he was CARDINAL of PERSON friends .", "CARDINAL . At a second interview at ORG , held on DATE , the applicant confirmed the information provided by him and added , in particular , that he had not engaged in any political activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE another CARDINAL in - depth interviews were held with the applicant in which he essentially stated the following . He was NORP and belonged to ORG where he had attained the level of \u201c advanced sympathiser \u201d which was the level before becoming a full member . He had been drafted to the military in DATE , had become an officer in DATE and had risen to major in DATE . He claimed that he had never participated in any combat or killed anyone since his military work had mainly consisted of ensuring the functioning of transports and support for the front line . As an officer , he had been placed under the orders of others and thus had never had any influence himself . He had participated in the war against GPE and when this ended in DATE he had been transferred to an armoured tank division within ORG . In DATE he had received CARDINAL medals for bravery from ORG . He stated that CARDINAL officers had received such medals and that they were mainly perceived as an encouragement to the officers . At this time he had also received a special identity card , \u201c Friends of PERSON \u201d , which almost every officer in ORG and some officers in the regular army received . He had never met PERSON personally but the card gave certain privileges , inter alia , in contacts with the authorities . During the interview on DATE , the applicant changed certain statements which he had previously given to ORG . In particular , he claimed that he had not been called back into service after he left the military in DATE . Moreover , he stated that he had applied for a visa for a tourist trip to GPE with his family at FAC in GPE and that they had received both visas and exit permits for DATE . Hence , on DATE , the family had travelled legally from GPE to GPE and from there by plane to GPE . He and his children had then travelled to GPE from GPE , with the help of smugglers . The applicant stated that he wished to return to GPE if PERSON lost power .", "CARDINAL . One further supplementary interview was held with the applicant on DATE in which he maintained that he had left GPE legally on DATE by car to GPE , after the family had received valid passports , exit permits and visas . He also added that , from GPE , the family had flown to GPE from where they had intended to continue to GPE . Since this had not been possible , they had returned to GPE before travelling to GPE where they had arrived on DATE . Since the smugglers had not been able to arrange a passport for his wife , she had had to remain in GPE when the rest of the family went to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Swedish Security Police ( S\u00e4kerhetspolisen ) proposed a rejection of the applicant \u2019s asylum request for security reasons . On the basis of this , ORG decided to transfer the case to the Government for consideration but it recommended that the application be rejected . In its view , the applicant had not convincingly shown that he was in need of protection in GPE . Although it accepted the applicant \u2019s military background , it did not believe his reasons for leaving GPE , inter alia , because he had only admitted leaving GPE legally with his own passport and an exit permit , and the route used , once confronted with facts .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in DATE , the Security Police informed the Government that they no longer had any objections to the application from the point of view of security . Hence , the case was transferred back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application for asylum with reference to its recommendation to the Government and noting that it found no reason to change the evaluation made at that time . Moreover , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit on the ground that it was not competent to change or repeal a final court judgment concerning expulsion . ORG observed that only the Government could repeal an expulsion order based on a criminal conviction and , in that connection , consider a request for a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE , before the asylum application had been determined , ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to forensic psychiatric care , the duration of which was subject to a medical evaluation . It further ordered that the applicant be expelled from GPE with a prohibition on returning . The applicant had admitted that he had killed his wife but claimed that he had acted in psychosis and had not intended to kill her . He had suspected that she had been unfaithful and had conspired against him behind his back . In its judgment , the court noted that the applicant , after having locked the door to the children \u2019s room , had repeatedly stabbed his wife while she was asleep . In these circumstances , the court found that the applicant had been completely indifferent as to whether his wife died or not and therefore should be convicted of murder . However , since a forensic psychiatric examination showed that he had committed the crime in a state of \u201c serious mental disturbance \u201d ( allvarlig psykisk st\u00f6rning ) and was still , during the examination , suffering from such a disturbance , the court concluded that he was in need of treatment and sentenced him to forensic psychiatric care .", "CARDINAL . As concerned the expulsion , the applicant had stated before ORG that he had been an officer in PERSON army and often away on missions . Because of the war , he and his family had fled from GPE in DATE but he had psychological problems stemming from the war .", "CARDINAL . ORG had also consulted ORG and it had submitted that , although it had not yet made a decision regarding the applicant \u2019s application for asylum and a residence permit , it considered that there were no impediments to the expulsion of the applicant to his home country . ORG noted that the applicant , an army officer , had left GPE legally with a valid NORP passport containing a DATE exit visa . He had not brought his national passport with him when he entered GPE . Having regard to the ORG \u2019s view and noting that the applicant had committed a very serious crime , ORG concluded that he should be expelled from GPE for life .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal against the judgment which , consequently , gained legal force .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that , following the applicant \u2019s criminal conviction , his children were taken into compulsory public care and placed with a NORP family . Furthermore , a special guardian was appointed for them and they were granted permanent residence permits in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE decided to end the forensic psychiatric care and to release the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , in DATE , the applicant requested the ORG to repeal the expulsion order against him . He insisted that he would be tortured and executed if he was returned to GPE because he had deserted from the NORP army .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the request as they found that no special reasons existed for repealing the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant renewed his request in DATE , maintaining his claims . Upon request by the Government , ORG ( Migrationsverket ) submitted its view on the case , stating that the applicant \u2019s reasons had been examined previously and that no new circumstances had appeared for which reason the enforcement of the expulsion could take place . However , ORG added that there had been practical impediments to enforcement for some time with regard to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government found that there were insufficient reasons for revoking the expulsion order . However , having regard to the situation in GPE at the time , the Government decided to grant the applicant a temporary residence permit and work permit up until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a new application , dated DATE , the applicant requested that the expulsion order be revoked and that he be granted a permanent residence permit or , in the alternative , that his temporary residence permit be extended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted its comments on the case on DATE , concluding that there were no legal or practical impediments to the enforcement of the expulsion order and that the applicant should be able to return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Following the fall of PERSON regime in DATE , ORG sent another submission to the Government on DATE where it noted that the applicant \u2019s case now had to be seen in another light . His reasons for fearing a return to GPE had been removed now that PERSON was no longer in power . ORG governing GPE at the time was striving to build up a society characterised by democracy and respect for human rights and those who had been close to the old regime and who had committed war crimes and other crimes against humanity would be brought to justice . Thus , ORG considered that the applicant would not risk being tortured or treated inhumanely if sent back to GPE and consequently there was no impediment to his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply , the applicant claimed that since he had been an officer in ORG , he would be exposed to persecution and acts of revenge from primarily Shi\u2019a NORP groups and that there was no functioning legal system or police force which could give him protection against abuse . It followed that there existed impediments to the enforcement of his expulsion .", "CARDINAL . Since the Government had several pending cases concerning expulsion to GPE , they requested ORG at ORG in GPE to reply to some questions relating to the situation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG sent , inter alia , the following information to the Government , which was communicated to the applicant . In DATE the death penalty was reintroduced in GPE for offences such as murder , kidnapping and crimes against national security . Moreover , according to LAW of DATE , a person who had been convicted or acquitted by final judgment in another country could not be retried in GPE . However , it was not known whether this provision had been modified or changed by ORG . Furthermore , it was difficult to assess \u201c tribal justice \u201d in GPE due to the poor security situation in the country but it was possible that , if a person were to return to an area where he was known and his victim was also known , there could be a risk of revenge or \u201c tribal justice \u201d . It was further noted that there were reports of harassment against NORP and that attacks had been directed against NORP and other minorities during DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant commented on the information and stressed that he was NORP and that the NORP minority in GPE was being persecuted . Moreover , he had held a prominent position in ORG , had belonged to the exclusive circle that had been given the \u201c PERSON \u2019s Friends \u201d identity card and he was well known and hated by many . Thus , it was certain that he would be killed if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of Justice at the time decided to suspend the enforcement of the expulsion order until otherwise decided or until the Government made a final decision on the case . He further decided that the applicant should report to the police CARDINAL times per week in order to prevent him from going into hiding .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the ORG requested ORG at ORG in GPE to reply to some supplementary questions relating to the situation in GPE , which it did on DATE . In its reply it noted that , at the time , it was very difficult to obtain a complete overview and clear information about GPE . Still , it observed that persons who had been part of ORG , other special military units or the military in general were being arrested and tried in GPE . According to sources such as the ORG , the activities of these persons within their organisation determined how they were being treated more than to which military unit they had belonged . However , their position and military rank was of relevance as an indication of who could be targeted . In this context it was noted that members from special units , such as ORG , were being re - employed into the current special units . Moreover , the ORG had stated that even though many NORP were harassed as a result of their former membership of ORG , this harassment did not necessarily amount to persecution . A careful individual assessment was always necessary .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , in a comment on ORG information , maintained that there was a real risk that he would be subjected to extrajudicial execution if returned to GPE due to his previous connections to PERSON regime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG submitted its opinion on whether the reintroduction of the death penalty in GPE in DATE had an impact on the enforceability of the applicant \u2019s expulsion order . It considered that none of the information submitted by the applicant , in his detailed asylum interview in DATE and later , regarding his position and activities until he left GPE in DATE , indicated that he would risk legal measures , least of all the death penalty , from the current NORP government . Neither his membership of ORG nor his relatively subordinate position in a non - combat unit were likely to cause him problems with the NORP authorities upon return to his home country . Thus , there were no impediments to the enforcement of the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government decided not to revoke the expulsion order and rejected the applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit . It found that there was neither any impediment to the enforcement of the expulsion nor any other special reason under LAW to revoke the expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . As the expulsion order had become enforceable anew , the police authority , on DATE , detained the applicant awaiting the enforcement of his expulsion order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of his expulsion to GPE . He alleged that he would be executed or tortured and imprisoned if returned to his home country because he had been an officer during PERSON regime and had belonged to his \u201c inner circle \u201d . Moreover , since he was NORP , he risked persecution on religious grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to apply Rule DATE and to suspend the expulsion until DATE in order to obtain some further information from ORG . In particular , the Government were requested to give their opinion on whether the applicant would risk being brought to trial before ORG ( hereafter referred to as \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and sentenced to death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Minister of Justice at that time decided to suspend the expulsion of the applicant until further notice . He also decided to keep the applicant in detention since there was reason to believe that he would otherwise try to abscond . The detention decision was reconsidered DATE until DATE , when it was decided that he should be released and that he should report to the police twice a week .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the ORG replied to the ORG \u2019s request . They first observed that the ORG had jurisdiction over individuals residing in GPE accused of war crimes , genocide , crimes against humanity and a number of \u201c political \u201d offences under NORP law , including waste of national resources and abuse of position . It applied the penalties available in NORP law , including the death penalty . ORG had agreed that the ORG should process a limited series of CARDINAL trials , focusing on major events that showed the geographic and temporal spread of the regime \u2019s crimes , and that only the highest - level perpetrators should be tried before the ORG . Other perpetrators should be tried by regular NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . The Government further noted that the applicant \u2019s claim that he had belonged to PERSON inner circle was recent and did not correspond to the detailed statements given by him during the asylum proceedings . They also stressed that the applicant had neither claimed to have committed any crime , nor that he was , or might be , suspected of having committed a crime which fell under the jurisdiction of the ORG . The sole fact that he had held a subordinate position as an officer in ORG or been a member of ORG did not give reason to believe that he would be suspected of such serious or brought to trial before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG extended the application of Rule DATE until DATE in order to enable the applicant to reply to the ORG \u2019s comments .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted his comments in reply to those of the Government on DATE . He stated that ORG had been an elite party with only a few full members . He had been an \u201c advanced sympathiser \u201d which meant that he had held a high position in the hierarchy . Moreover , although he had not been in the infantry , he had participated in battle in an armoured unit during the various wars until DATE when he had left the country because he had been ordered to carry out military actions that were against international law . The Government \u2019s allegation that he had said that he had not been or could not be suspected of crimes under the jurisdiction of the ORG was wrong . The assessment of his application for asylum took place in DATE , at a time when the ORG had not yet come into existence and he had also not been asked about it later . Apart from the risk of being sentenced by the ORG or another jurisdiction , there was a real risk that he would be the victim of an extrajudicial killing . Extremist militias tried to find and kill all officers who had fought for PERSON in the war against GPE or who had fought against the GPE in southern GPE in DATE . The retaliation was collective and directed against all officers who had fought under PERSON . The applicant also stressed that as a NORP he would be without protection in GPE and his situation upon return would thus be most serious .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Court extended the application of Rule CARDINAL until DATE , on which date it was extended until further notice .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , LAW ( ORG , FAC ) , a crime may , apart from ordinary sanctions , result in special consequences defined by law . Expulsion on account of a criminal offence constitutes such a consequence and the decision in this respect is made by the court in which the criminal proceedings take place .", "CARDINAL . Provisions on expulsion on this ground are laid down in LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , CARDINAL ) on DATE . However , the rules on expulsion on account of a criminal offence remain the same in substance under LAW as under the old LAW . Thus , in the following , reference will only be made to LAW .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act , an alien may not be expelled from GPE on account of having committed a criminal offence unless certain conditions are satisfied and the person \u2019s links to NORP society have been taken into account .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the court must have regard to the general provisions on impediments to the enforcement of an expulsion decision . Thus , pursuant to LAW , LAW , there is an absolute impediment to expelling an alien to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Furthermore , a risk of persecution generally constitutes an impediment to enforcing an expulsion decision .", "CARDINAL . A decision to expel an alien on account of having committed a criminal offence is , according to LAW , section DATE ) of LAW , enforced by the police authority . If the police authority finds that there are impediments to the enforcement , it shall notify ORG , which shall refer the matter to the Government to examine whether the expulsion can be executed ( LAW , LAW ) . If there are no impediments to the enforcement , the alien shall normally be sent to his or her country of origin or , if possible , to the country from which he came to GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , section DATE CARDINAL Act , if the Government find that a judgment or decision to expel a person on account of having committed a criminal offence can not be executed or if there are otherwise special reasons not to enforce the decision , the Government may repeal , in part or completely , the judgment or decision of the court . When considering whether to repeal an expulsion order , the Government shall above all take into account any new circumstances , namely circumstances that did not exist at the time of the courts\u2019 examination of the criminal case . In the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , strong family ties and severe illness are given as examples of such \u201c special reasons \u201d that may warrant revocation of an expulsion order . The Government may also , in accordance with LAW , LAW , of ORG ( Regeringsformen ) , pardon or reduce a penal sanction or other legal effect of a criminal act .", "CARDINAL . In cases where the expulsion order is not revoked , the ORG may still grant a temporary residence permit and work permit . For as long as such a permit is valid , the expulsion order may not be executed ( LAW , section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG ) , ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) found that , at that time , the security situation in GPE was very serious but that it did not amount to an internal armed conflict , as defined by international law . Moreover , it noted that it was practically possible to return to GPE voluntarily and that some NORP indeed did so . In these circumstances , an individual assessment of each asylum seeker \u2019s personal grounds for requesting asylum and a residence permit in GPE had to be carried out . This conclusion has been reiterated by ORG on several occasions during DATE ( see , for example , ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , on DATE , in a leading decision concerning CARDINAL NORP asylum seekers from GPE ( a mother and her CARDINAL minor children ) , the Director - General for Legal Affairs of ORG made the assessment that the general situation for NORP in GPE , and in the province of GPE ( where GPE is situated ) , was not so serious that this group could be considered to be in need of protection in GPE . An individual assessment had to be made in each case of the reasons invoked by the asylum seeker .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG signed a Memorandum of Understanding with ORG , whereby the CARDINAL countries \u201c resolve to cooperate in order to assist the voluntary , dignified , safe and orderly return to and successful reintegration in GPE of NORP now in GPE \u201d . Although primarily focusing on voluntary returns , the Memorandum also allowed for forced returns of failed asylum seekers .", "CARDINAL . During the regime of PERSON , GPE was at war with GPE DATE . In DATE , GPE invaded GPE , which led to the \u201c First Gulf War \u201d , lasting for DATE between DATE and CARDINAL DATE . DATE and DATE the regime suppressed a NORP insurgency in northern GPE and a Shi\u2019a insurgency in the south of the country . In DATE the \u201c FAC \u201d started when GPE - led multinational forces invaded GPE and overthrew PERSON regime . ORG was involved in all of these conflicts . It expanded rapidly during the Iraq - Iran War and comprised the best equipped and trained units among PERSON forces . In DATE ORG , the NORP army , the police and ORG were officially dissolved by ORG ( hereafter \u201c the CPA \u201d ) in a process called the \u201c LAW \u201d ( through CPA LAW DATE ) . Subsequently , in DATE power was transferred from the CPA to ORG and , in DATE , a permanent government was elected by the NORP .", "CARDINAL . The Ba\u2019ath ORG membership lists have never been found and there is relatively little information about the inner workings of the party and its structure . However , it would appear that membership was originally highly restricted but that the rules were significantly relaxed in DATE , leading to a great expansion of the membership in order to bolster stability ( ORG , Briefing Paper : GPE \u2019s ORG and Justice \u201d PERSON , DATE , hereafter \u201c ORG Paper \u201d ) . There were several levels of membership ( DATE , depending on the source ) and training and probation periods ( divided into CARDINAL levels ) were always required before becoming a full member of the party ( Ibid . and ORG , NORP - partiet . Medlemskapsniv\u00e5er og partiorganisasjon [ ORG . Membership levels and party organisation ] , DATE hereafter \u201c Landinfo \u201d ) . The total number of party members has been estimated to CARDINAL ( ORG ) . A person who was a \u201c sympathiser \u201d or an \u201c advanced partisan \u201d was not a full member of the ORG . Moreover , it would appear that persons who had been in the Ba\u2019ath ORG for DATE were called \u201c Friends of PERSON \u201d ( PERSON , QUANTITY , Note by the Secretary - General , Situation of Human Rights in GPE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The LAW process was widely criticised as it was seen as a collective punishment while , at the same time , providing impunity for others . Therefore , in DATE ORG passed the Accountability and Justice Act which established a clearer legal framework for dismissals and reinstatements of former ORG members and introduced an element of individual responsibility into the process . The law allows for some higher ranking members of ORG to apply for reinstatement ( CARDINAL persons ) and makes most individuals who have been dismissed eligible for pensions , with the exception of some of the highest part members and those who have been involved in corruption or committed crimes ( ICTJ Briefing Paper and ORG , PERSON , Uncertainty surrounds new NORP GPE law , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Holders of high positions in the Ba\u2019ath ORG who were suspected of having been close to the old regime and/or taken part in different violent actions could be , and had been , arrested and called to account . It was the person \u2019s own background and the credibility of his or her account that determined the risk of judicial proceedings ( Information from ORG in GPE to ORG , dated DATE ; hereafter \u201c ORG Information \u201d ) . Hence , in DATE , ORG ( ORG , formerly the ORG ) was created to try persons accused of committing war crimes , crimes against humanity , genocide and specified offences DATE and DATE . The ORG had already tried and convicted PERSON and a few of his closest collaborators . Several of them had been sentenced to death and some to life imprisonment .

According to ORG , for individuals who did not \u201c qualify \u201d for examination by the ORG , there still remained a risk of review by the usual legal system and its criminal courts . The death penalty had been reintroduced in DATE for , inter alia , crimes against national security , murder , kidnapping and drug trafficking and it was increasingly used . Moreover , in particular in GPE , southern and central GPE , several Shi\u2019a militia groups more or less systematically , and very extensively , sought out people who were guilty of acts of aggression under the former regime . The more well known a person had been as a representative of the former regime , the greater the risk of being discovered and punished .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the NORP parliament adopted an LAW which provided a general amnesty for all convicted NORP and those accused of crimes but who were still under investigation or trial . It did not apply to persons convicted of very serious crimes such as murder , rape , kidnapping , drug - related crimes and embezzlement ( ORG , PERSON : GPE \u2019s amnesty and provincial powers law , DATE ) . By DATE just over CARDINAL detainees in NORP jails had been released by virtue of the NORP law , while roughly CARDINAL remained in prison as the law did not apply to them ( GPE Updates , Voices of GPE , CARDINAL detainees covered by amnesty law , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

However , there were reports that law enforcement activities often continued as if the state of emergency was still in effect ( ORG ) . Civilians were targeted by attacks by NORP and Shi\u2019a groups across the country , and there were widespread and severe human rights abuses , including kidnappings , disappearances , torture and killings . The authorities frequently did not maintain effective control over security forces and did not have effective mechanisms to investigate and punish abuse and corruption ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG of the Secretary General for GPE stated there had been a noticeable drop in violence over DATE and that GPE had made significant strides towards stability and institution building although the human rights situation continued to be serious ( UNAMI press releases DATE , UNAMI Commemorates the CARDINALrd United Nations Day ) . According to ORG www.iraqbodycount.org as downloaded on DATE ) , civilian deaths in GPE had gradually decreased since DATE , with the exception of DATE and DATE . Thus , there were CARDINAL civilian deaths in DATE and CARDINAL in DATE , as compared to CARDINAL in DATE and CARDINAL in DATE . The decrease in civilian deaths has mainly been attributed to the cease - fire declared in DATE by PERSON , the leader of ORG ( a Shi\u2019a paramilitary force created in DATE to fight against the multinational forces ) . The ceasefire was initially declared for DATE but was prolonged and , in DATE , PERSON announced an indefinite ceasefire and stated that anyone in his ORG who did not follow his order would not be considered a member of his group ( ORG , PERSON declares another ceasefire , QUANTITY DATE ) . Moreover , according to ORG , violence has abated because NORP and Shi\u2019a populations have fled from mixed areas and thus have become increasingly divided into geographically distinct communities ( ORG , ORG \u2013Iraq , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Another sign of the decrease in violence is the establishment of ORG \u2019s ( WHO ) permanent office in GPE in DATE ( UNAMI press release DATE , ORG in GPE ) and the activities of some CARDINAL humanitarian international NGOs with programmes in GPE , operating directly or via implementing partners , although ORG was the only agency operating openly nation - wide through its CARDINAL branches ( Center of Excellence , Iraq Crisis Report , DATE ) .
