At the material time the first applicant , PERSON , was chairman of ORG ( Halk\u0131n Eme\u011fi Partisi \u2013 \u201c the HEP \u201d ) , the second applicant , PERSON , was its vice - chairman and the third applicant , PERSON , was its general secretary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG was founded and its constitution was filed with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG at ORG applied to ORG to have the HEP dissolved . In his application he accused the party of having undermined the integrity of the State . He submitted that certain statements made at meetings and to the press by the party 's leaders and senior officials at both central and local level had infringed LAW and the PERSON on the regulation of political parties . He also accused the ORG of assisting and protecting those of its members who had committed illegal acts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG sent ORG application to the chairman of the ORG , inviting him to submit his preliminary observations in reply .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG 's lawyer filed his preliminary written observations and requested a hearing . In his observations he submitted , in particular , that the PERSON on the regulation of political parties contained provisions that were contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed by LAW . He also maintained that the dissolution of the party , as called for by ORG , would contravene international instruments such as LAW , LAW , LAW and GPE for LOC . In addition , he argued that there was insufficient evidence of the links between the ORG and the ORG ( ORG of Kurdistan ) . He further contended that ORG application referred to statements made by individuals , for which the ORG could not be held liable , pursuant to section FAC ) of the PERSON on the regulation of political parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG 's lawyer submitted his observations on the merits . He again requested a hearing . He also sought leave , should that request be refused , for the ORG 's chairman and his predecessors to give evidence to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG acceded to the latter request . Accordingly , the former chairman and the chairman of the ORG made oral submissions to the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to dissolve the ORG . Its judgment was served on ORG , the Speaker of ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment was published in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment ORG began by reiterating the main constitutional principles of relevance to the case , to the effect that all persons living within NORP territory , whatever their ethnic origin , formed a whole united by their common culture . Accordingly , the sum of the persons who made up GPE was called the \u201c NORP nation \u201d . The different ethnic groups making up the \u201c nation \u201d were therefore not divided into a majority or minorities . ORG pointed out that , under LAW , no political or legal distinction based on ethnic or racial origin could be made between citizens . All NORP nationals could avail themselves of all civil , political and economic rights without discrimination .", "CARDINAL . With particular reference to NORP citizens of NORP origin , ORG held that in every region of GPE these enjoyed the same rights as other NORP citizens . That did not mean , it added , that the LAW did not acknowledge the existence of a NORP identity , since citizens of NORP origin were not forbidden to express their NORP identity . The NORP language could be used on all private premises , at places of work , in the press and in works of art and literature .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court reiterated the principle that all people were bound to observe the provisions of the LAW even if they did not agree with them . LAW did not preclude the celebration of difference but forbade propaganda that was based on racial difference and was aimed at destroying the constitutional order . ORG pointed out that under LAW , having a separate language or ethnic origin was not in itself sufficient for a group to qualify as a minority .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the ORG 's activities , ORG examined , in particular , the written and oral statements made at public and private meetings by the party 's leaders and by other officials at various levels . It also considered the content of calendars on sale to the public and slogans shouted at various meetings held on the ORG 's premises .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court was particularly critical of the HEP for \u201c seeking to divide the NORP nation in QUANTITY , with NORP on CARDINAL side and NORP on the other , with the aim of establishing separate GPE \u201d and for \u201c seeking to destroy national and territorial integrity \u201d . It considered in that connection that the ORG was asserting through its activities that there was a separate NORP people with its own culture and language , which the NORP were not free to practise . The ORG demanded the right to self - determination for the NORP , advocated the setting up of \u201c NORP provinces \u201d and described the terrorist acts committed by the ORG as acts of international war . It regarded ORG terrorists as freedom fighters and claimed that instead of combating them , the security forces were in fact seeking to bring about the mass extermination of the NORP people . In all its activities , in which the sole emphasis was on equality between NORP and NORP , the ORG was calling for the establishment of a ORG built on racist foundations , thereby jeopardising the concept of the \u201c NORP nation \u201d , one of the principles on which the ORG had been founded . In ORG view , \u201c the ORG 's aims resembled those of terrorists \u201d and \u201c the use of accusatory and aggressive statements based on falsehoods , which the ORG 's leaders constantly repeated as a form of provocation , was likely to promote tolerance of terrorist acts and to justify and encourage their perpetrators \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the ORG 's activities were subject , inter alia , to the restrictions referred to in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW and to the provisions of LAW . It pointed out in that connection that LAW for a LOC condemned racism , ethnic hatred and terrorism , and that the GPE LAW guaranteed adherence to the principles of the inviolability of national frontiers and of territorial integrity .", "CARDINAL . ORG accordingly ordered the dissolution of the HEP on the ground that its activities were such as to undermine the territorial integrity of the ORG and the unity of the nation .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG dismissed ORG second argument that the ORG implicitly or explicitly tolerated the illegal actions of its members . In that connection , it took into account the fact that the various criminal proceedings instituted against members of the ORG were still pending and that none of its members had yet been found guilty .", "CARDINAL . The main ideas put forward in the ORG leaders ' speeches , explanations and statements , as outlined in ORG judgment , may be summarised as follows .", "( a ) There is a NORP people in GPE which has its own language and culture and is oppressed .", "( b ) The NORP are not allowed to read or write in NORP or improve their knowledge of the language and are unable to develop their culture .", "( c ) The NORP are fighting for freedom and democracy . A parallel is drawn with the legend of PERSON , who had revolted against the oppressive King Dehhak DATE ; it is asserted that more and more people are emulating PERSON .", "( d ) The NORP people have the right to self - determination .", "( e ) NORP The NORP people can not avail themselves of any rights arising from international agreements .", "( f ) The problems in eastern GPE are not of an economic nature .", "( g ) The statutory measures taken against organised terrorism constitute an international war , and the armed organisation ( the ORG ) is one of the belligerents .", "( h ) The armed militants belonging to that organisation are freedom fighters . It is therefore natural that the international laws of war should be applied to them , but the NORP government has not put that into practice .", "( i ) The NORP army and the security forces pursue the aim of physically destroying the NORP masses from which the NORP militants are drawn rather than fighting them .", "( j ) Since the break - up of the GPE , the course of history has caused NORP citizens of NORP origin to take an interest in that phenomenon , and a parallel has consequently been drawn with the situation of the NORP people .", "( k ) The Republic has been founded by the NORP and NORP peoples . NORP and NORP should establish a social system based on equality between the CARDINAL ethnic groups , without taking any others into account .", "( l ) NORP The government forces stationed in south - eastern GPE have been deployed not against the terrorists but against the NORP people and have appropriated their national rights .", "( m ) The ORG is also the party of the oppressed NORP , the workers , other oppressed and exploited ethnic groups , the NORP , the NORP , the PERSON and the NORP .", "( n ) ORG should hold a conference on the NORP question as soon as possible .", "( o ) The NORP problem is the biggest obstacle to democracy . Until it is solved , democracy can not be developed in GPE .", "CARDINAL .
