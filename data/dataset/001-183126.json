MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Conditional release;Length of pre-trial detention)", "JUDGES": "Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska;Iulia Motoc;Marko Bo\u0161njak;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Georges Ravarani", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained at ORG , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having murdered his former partner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was charged before ORG , as a ORG , with inter alia , wilful homicide . He was remanded in custody thereafter .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the acts of the proceedings that from the applicant \u2019s arraignment until DATE , the applicant filed CARDINAL requests for bail which were all rejected after the relevant submissions were made , including oral hearings . Apart from the hearings related to the bail applications and other specific requests , CARDINAL hearings were held where scores of witnesses gave evidence and another QUANTITY hearings were held where nothing happened and the case was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime on DATE the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional competence . He complained of a violation of LAW in so far as he had been detained for DATE since his arrest .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( First Hall ) rejected the applicant \u2019s claims . By a judgment of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed the appealed judgment .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant had been held in custody for the maximum period of detention allowed by law , he became entitled to bail in accordance with Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a)(iii ) of LAW ( see relevant domestic law ) .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , following his request of CARDINAL DATE , by a decree of CARDINAL DATE , ORG granted the applicant bail subject to the following conditions : that he appears for all the scheduled hearings in the criminal proceedings ; that he does not go abroad or abscond ; that he does not contact or approach , directly nor indirectly , witnesses for the prosecution ; that he does not commit a crime of a voluntary nature while released on bail ; that he present himself at FAC DATE TIME ; that he be home not later than TIME and that he does not leave home before TIME ; that he inform the Police of any change of address by not TIME of such a change ; that he deposit by way of security the amount of MONEY ( ORG ) in the court registry ; and that he undertake a personal guarantee of LAW . In the event of any bail condition being breached , the entire amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL would be forfeited in favour of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , as he considered the conditions too lenient and that they would not serve as a sufficient deterrent against absconding or interfering with the proper administration of justice . He requested the court to set a higher deposit reflecting the nature of the crimes with which the applicant was accused and to amend the conditions by disallowing the applicant to be in locality NORP where the victim and her family resided .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant objected to the Attorney General \u2019s appeal , noting that he had remained in detention precisely because he could not fulfil the conditions imposed . At the same time he filed an application requesting the court to reduce the amount to be deposited by him . He explained that since he had been detained for DATE he was unemployed , and thus he could not pay the relevant amount . He submitted CARDINAL documents showing that he received unemployment benefits in the sums of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL in DATE and DATE respectively and offered to explain his financial situation ( if necessary with further documentary evidence ) during an oral hearing . It appears from the acts of the proceedings that he then submitted tax assessment forms of DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG , having examined the documents submitted by the applicant , rejected the Attorney General \u2019s request to increase the deposit but added the condition that the applicant could not be in the vicinity of locality NORP It also rejected the applicant \u2019s request considering that ORG had correctly applied its discretion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed another application requesting the court to reduce the amount of the deposit . He complained that although he had been in detention for DATE , and was entitled to bail , he had nevertheless remained in detention since he ( and his family ) could not afford to pay such an excessive amount by way of deposit . He further noted that the main witnesses had already been heard in the committal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General objected to the applicant \u2019s new request , noting that the applicant was not reliable , and that his inability to pay the deposit showed that he would be unable to pay the personal guarantee if he were to breach his conditions . Moreover , the family of the victim , particularly her daughter , lived in fear of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of DATE , having seen the request and the reply submitted by the Attorney General , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed another application requesting the court to reduce the amount that he had to deposit . He noted that he had remained in detention for DATE since the decree granting him bail due to his inability to pay . The Attorney General objected in view of the seriousness of the crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court again rejected the applicant \u2019s request ; it noted that its previous decisions had determined the deposit in order to strike the requisite balance between , on the one hand , the seriousness of the crime and the potential punishment , and , on the other hand , the obligation of the accused to fulfil the imposed conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed yet another application requesting that the amount of deposit be reduced . He noted that he had been in detention for DATE since the decree granting him bail , and yet he was still not in a position to benefit from such bail - to which he was entitled by law - since he could not pay the deposit imposed . The Attorney General objected considering that the amount imposed was adequate in view of the severity of the crime and the circumstances of the case . On DATE the applicant filed a note reiterating his request .", "CARDINAL . By a decree of CARDINAL DATE the court , having considered the parties submissions , as well as its decree of DATE , was of the view that it should not alter the considerations made in the latter decision . It , thus , rejected the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the court to accept his mother PERSON ( and other relatives ) as surety in lieu of the deposit . He referred to a property the relatives had inherited which they were willing to put forward as a guarantee instead of the deposit . The Attorney General requested that the applicant submit relevant evidence of the inheritance and the value of the property and that the court hear relevant witnesses in this connection , before making his final submissions . He further highlighted that a public deed would be required for the purposes of the relevant hypothec .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted all the relevant documents concerning the property at issue which was valued at ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court accepted that the applicant \u2019s mother stand as surety by means of a hypothec on the above - mentioned property which she owned together with other relatives . Such property was to serve as a guarantee for the applicant observing the conditions imposed ; in the event of a breach of any of those conditions , the property would be forfeited in favour of the Government of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently on DATE the applicant having signed a personal guarantee of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and his mother having effected the relevant hypothec as guarantee , the applicant was released from custody after DATE of pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the committal proceedings and hearing of witnesses continued throughout this time ; further witnesses were heard during CARDINAL hearings and another QUANTITY hearings were adjourned . On DATE the prosecuting authority had declared that it did not have further evidence to produce .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime on DATE the applicant instituted a new set of constitutional redress proceedings , complaining of a violation of LAW in connection with the \u201c exorbitant sum \u201d requested ( in particular reference to the sum set as deposit ) which did not allow him to effectively enjoy bail .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional competence rejected the applicant \u2019s claims .", "It held that when a court accepted that an applicant had to be granted bail , that court had to establish the proper conditions which the applicant had to satisfy to be released and yet appear for court proceedings . If the guarantees included the deposit of a sum of money , such pecuniary condition had to be considered by reference to the person of the accused and his means as well as his relation with the person who would act as his surety . The court referred to the ORG \u2019s judgment of ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) where it had been held that the accused whom the judicial authorities declared themselves prepared to release on bail must faithfully furnish sufficient information , that can be checked if need be , about the amount of bail to be fixed . The court noted that the applicant did not satisfy this obligation . It was his duty to provide the courts with information on his income , savings and list his assets . Nevertheless , the applicant had only provided copies of self - assessment forms for purposes of income tax for DATE . According to the court , if an applicant argued that the deposit was too high , he had to show the court what he could afford by providing a list of his assets and property , even if this meant that he had to conduct researches in ORG , and provide the relevant documentation . In its view an applicant had to show not only that he did not have the necessary means to deposit the sum requested but also that he was in an objective impossibility of finding the necessary means . He further had to show that he was unable to find persons who offered to act as surety . It was only when all this was shown that an applicant would have satisfied his duty to furnish sufficient information , thus enabling the court to make an objective assessment .", "CARDINAL . In the court \u2019s view , in the present case , bearing in mind the seriousness of the crime and the potential punishment , the applicant had not brought enough evidence before the courts of criminal justice to substantiate his claim that those courts had imposed excessive conditions ( including that referring to the amount of deposit ) . It further noted that ORG [ in the first round of proceedings ] had not been convinced that there would be no tampering with evidence . Indeed even though the collection of evidence had come to an end , one had to guarantee that the evidence remained intact and thus relevant guarantees were necessary .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and confirmed the judgment of the first court .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court referred to its judgment in the case The Police v. PERSON and ORG , of DATE , where it had held that there must be proportionality between the amount to be deposited by the applicant for his release on bail and his financial circumstances . The level of bail set out should not be too high and it should ensure the presence of the accused at the various stages of the criminal proceedings . It also made reference to the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 MONEY , ECHR DATE ) as well as ORG judgment PERSON v. Attorney General , of DATE , where it had been held that in establishing the amount to be deposited as security , the court must also consider other circumstances such as the seriousness of the offence and the danger to society .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the onus of proving that the amount of deposit was too high for the applicant when considering his financial means lay with the applicant himself . An applicant must provide information to the court on his financial situation and on the real possibility of finding a surety able to guarantee the observance of the conditions imposed . In the present case , ORG held that the latter option had not been contemplated by the applicant and it was only after various requests to have the amount reduced that he eventually proposed his mother to act as a surety . It noted that although the applicant \u2019s mother did not own the tenement she had used for the purposes of the guarantee , it was already in her possession for a period of time before the last application for the reduction of the amount was filed . Thus , the applicant could not argue that he could not have taken this course of action before . Although the applicant relied on the ORG \u2019s judgment of ORG ( cited above ) , where a violation had been found on the basis that it took DATE for the NORP authorities to adjust the conditions for bail , ORG held that ( even if this were the case ) , the applicant \u2013 who was legally represented had not explored all avenues to satisfy the courts with an adequate guarantee for the observance of the conditions of bail . No explanation as to why he only obtained a guarantee in the form of a surety at a subsequent stage was provided by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Noting that the applicant had stated that at times he worked as a bus driver and as a horse trainer , apart from other activities , ORG distinguished the applicant \u2019s case from that of a person who was living on relief payments . The fact that the applicant had at times worked and had a salary or wage made the need to provide information to the court on his means more relevant .", "CARDINAL . On the fixing of the amount of the deposit , ORG referred to LAW ( see relevant domestic law below ) which provided the factors to be considered for this purpose . Under NORP law these included the seriousness of the offence and the applicable punishment . ORG considered that although the law also referred to the financial situation of the person accused , this factor was not to be taken in isolation \u2013 it was for the court fixing the amount of deposit to consider all the factors taken together and not separately . In the present case bearing in mind those factors , the amount of deposit of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL was justified especially since the law provided for the opportunity to provide a surety \u2013 a course of action subsequently undertaken by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view the criminal courts\u2019 concern that the applicant did not give the necessary guarantees that there would not be any tampering with evidence , subsisted throughout the whole criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the applicant was found guilty of breaching his bail conditions and his bail was revoked . Further bail requests were lodged and rejected until DATE when a bill of indictment was issued against the applicant . From DATE until his indictment some QUANTITY hearings were held where nothing happened and the case was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG was informed that a plea bargain had been concluded between the applicant and the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s admission to all the charges against him , ORG pronounced a guilty verdict and sentenced the applicant to DATE imprisonment and to the payment of court experts\u2019 fees ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
