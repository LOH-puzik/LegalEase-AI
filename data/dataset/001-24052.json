He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in Waalwijk .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant arrived in the GPE . On DATE , he applied for asylum . In support of his claim for asylum he submitted the following :", "Whilst living in GPE , the applicant and his family ( consisting of his mother and his CARDINAL brothers ) were frequently harassed by the authorities . By threatening to arrest the family members , the authorities wanted to exert pressure on the applicant \u2019s father to give himself up . The applicant \u2019s father was a professional soldier who did not agree with the regime . When he was ordered to fight against the NORP in GPE , he deserted , fled the country and applied for asylum in the GPE in DATE . Although his father was not recognised as a refugee within the meaning of LAW relating to LAW DATE ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) , he had been granted a residence permit . In order to avoid arrest , the applicant and his mother and siblings stayed with different relatives , making sure never to stay at any CARDINAL address for very long . However , the authorities always managed to trace them . The applicant was unable to go to school because his name featured on a list of people who were not allowed to attend school . According to the applicant , this was because his father was wanted by the authorities .", "In DATE the GPE PERSON NORP ( Islamic Revolutionary Guards , \u201c PERSON \u201d ) came to arrest the applicant \u2019s older brother , PERSON , but his uncle PERSON had managed to organise PERSON \u2019s departure to GPE before he could be arrested . In DATE , the applicant , his mother and younger brother also managed to reach GPE . However , when PERSON was arrested in GPE and sent back to GPE , the other relatives also decided to return to GPE out of concern for him . PERSON was detained for DATE and tortured during that time . His uncle PERSON managed to obtain PERSON \u2019s release , presumably through the payment of bribes .", "The applicant resumed his life of staying at different addresses .", "On DATE , students demonstrated in GPE following the closure of a newspaper . TIME , security services raided dormitories on the university campus . Several students were wounded and others arrested in the raid . As a result , more student protests followed . The protests spread to other cities . Non - students , including the applicant , also participated . During CARDINAL of the demonstrations , the applicant handed out wood and stones to the students , helped set fire to a bus and a fire engine and built barricades . Troops responsible for public order charged at the demonstrators ; the applicant was beaten and his hand broken . After the demonstrations , many people were arrested and nothing more was heard of them . The applicant learnt that photographs had been taken of the people who had set fire to the bus and the fire engine . His uncle PERSON thought that it would be better for the applicant to leave the country and he put up the money for the applicant to go to GPE in DATE . Until his departure , he remained in GPE , staying in hiding at the houses of friends .", "Whilst in GPE , the applicant was told by his mother on the telephone that a summons in his name , ordering him to report to ORG , had been delivered to his uncle \u2019s address .", "The applicant stayed in GPE for DATE . He did not apply for asylum in GPE . A \u201c travel agent \u201d arranged for him to go to the GPE , together with a number of other people . They travelled by foot , boat , bus and train . The applicant used a NORP passport in the name of a man of NORP origin . The passport had been given to him by the \u201c travel agent \u201d . The applicant did not know through which countries his journey took him .", "In the proceedings on his first request for asylum , the applicant submitted copies of CARDINAL summonses . The first ( \u201c document ( A ) \u201d ) was dated DATE and bore the number CARDINAL , the second ( \u201c document ( B ) \u201d ) was dated DATE and bore the number DATE the applicant stated that the summons bearing number CARDINAL had never been received . The summonses had been issued by ORG and stated , without giving any reasons , that the applicant was to report to a specific place at a specific time . According to the applicant , these summonses had been given to his mother .", "Having considered that the applicant \u2019s asylum request could be dealt with in the so - called accelerated procedure ( see below ) , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the request on DATE . The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision was dismissed as manifestly ill - founded on DATE by the Acting President of ORG of GPE , together with his request for a stay of expulsion . The Acting President agreed with the Deputy Minister that the applicant \u2019s failure to submit documents capable of establishing his identity , his nationality or his travel route affected the sincerity of his account and detracted from its credibility . The Acting President further expressed doubts as to the credibility of the applicant \u2019s account concerning the problems encountered by his family in GPE allegedly as a result of the situation of his father . It was noted in this respect that the applicant \u2019s father had told the GPE authorities that he had never encountered problems for political reasons , but that he had been unable to obtain promotion in the army on account of several episodes of desertion . The Acting President also did not find it sufficiently established that the NORP authorities were aware of the applicant \u2019s participation in the student demonstrations , or that he was \u201c wanted \u201d by those authorities as a result of his participation . The applicant was found to have been inconsistent in this regard , first telling the immigration authorities that , whilst in GPE , his mother had told him that a summons had been sent to his uncle \u2019s address , yet the copies of the summonses submitted dated from the time when the applicant had still been in GPE , and they had allegedly been given to his mother . Finally , the summonses submitted were not originals and did not state the reason why the applicant was supposed to report to the authorities .", "On DATE the applicant requested both the Deputy Minister and ORG to review their respective decisions in view of the fact that he had in the meantime managed to obtain original documents . ORG refused this request in a decision on DATE , stating in an obiter dictum that the documents might lead the applicant to decide to lodge a new request for asylum . On DATE the Deputy Minister informed the applicant that a request for revision could only be made in the form of a new request for asylum . The applicant was subsequently informed when and where he should formally lodge such a new request .", "The applicant lodged his second request for asylum on DATE . This was also dealt with in the accelerated procedure . In support of this request he submitted the originals of the above - mentioned summonses ( A ) and ( B ) , as well as a further summons ( \u201c document ( C ) \u201d ) , dated CARDINAL DATE . He also stated that his uncle in GPE had recently managed to get a third person to obtain the following , original , documents from a file on the applicant :", "\u2013 a letter / memo dated DATE from ORG in the LOC district to ORG , stating that the applicant was being prosecuted on charges of participation in the revolt at the university campus , and requesting the addressee to arrest the applicant ( \u201c document ( D ) \u201d ) ;", "\u2013 an undated letter / memo ( the space after \u201c date : \u201d is left blank ) from the assistant criminal investigations officer in the police operations division to the commanding officer of border controls , in which reference is made to a letter dated DATE of the public prosecution department , and in which the addressee is requested to ensure that the applicant does not leave the country and is arrested should he try to leave ( \u201c document ( E ) \u201d ) ;", "\u2013 an undated letter / memo ( the space after \u201c date : \u201d is left blank ) from an assistant information officer to his counterpart in the police identification division , in which reference is made to the order issued by the commanding officer of ORG relating to the identification of the suspects at the university campus , and in which the addressee is requested to make available all information concerning the background of the applicant ( \u201c document ( F ) \u201d ) ;", "\u2013 an undated letter / memo ( the space after \u201c date : \u201d is left blank ) from an assistant information officer to the commanding officer of LOC , in which reference is made to the order issued by the ORG commanding officer relating to the arrest of those persons who had \u201c caused the university campus [ disturbance ] \u201d , and in which the addressee is requested to observe all of the applicant \u2019s movements so that he could be arrested once his whereabouts were known ( \u201c document ( G ) \u201d ) .", "The applicant \u2019s second request for asylum was rejected by the Minister for ORG and Integration ( Minister PERSON Integratie , the successor of the Deputy Minister of ORG ) on DATE . The Minister held that the documents submitted by the applicant did not constitute newly emerged facts or altered circumstances . In this respect , the Minister found that no decisive importance could be attributed to the undated documents . The new documents did not lead to a conclusion different from the one reached on the first request for asylum , given that in those earlier proceedings the applicant \u2019s account had not been found wholly credible ; the applicant had not established his identity so that it could not be ascertained whether the new documents related to him , and he had failed to give a plausible explanation as to why he could not have submitted the new documents at an earlier stage . For these reasons , the Minister did not consider that the merits of the new request for asylum should be examined . He therefore rejected it by referring to the decision on the first request , in accordance with LAW ( PERSON ) .", "On DATE the provisional - measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , rejected both the applicant \u2019s request for a stay of expulsion and his appeal ( beroep ) against the decision of the Minister . The judge agreed with the Minister that no newly emerged facts or altered circumstances had been adduced by the applicant . Such facts or circumstances only existed if they had not played a role in the proceedings on the first request for asylum and if they could not have been submitted at that time . Facts and circumstances which had been known to the applicant prior to DATE ( the date of the final decision on the first request for asylum ) could thus in principle not be considered . The documents ( E ) , ( F ) and ( G ) could only be seen as further arguments ( nadere bewijsvoering ) relating to the first request which had already been rejected .", "The applicant lodged a further appeal ( hoger beroep ) with ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ) , in which he argued that there were \u201c altered circumstances \u201d : his first request for asylum had been rejected because his account was found not to be credible , whereas the new documents showed that it was credible .", "The further appeal was rejected on DATE , ORG finding that since documents ( E ) , ( F ) and ( G ) were undated , it could not be established that it had been impossible for the applicant to submit them in the proceedings on his first request for asylum . It was further held that the applicant had not adduced any exceptional facts and circumstances relating to him personally , on the basis of which his new request for asylum fell to be assessed outside the framework of Article CARDINAL of LAW .", "Following the rejection of the applicant \u2019s first request for asylum by the Deputy Minister of Justice on DATE , the applicant \u2019s entitlement to ORG - sponsored reception facilities ceased , and it was not revived with the lodging of the second request for asylum . The applicant subsequently received some financial support from refugee and charitable organisations and private donors , but from DATE he was no longer in receipt of any kind of income . On DATE he lodged an official request to ORG for ORG opvang ORG ; hereafter the \u201c ORG \u201d ) to be provided with facilities to meet his basic needs . Having received no reaction , the applicant lodged an objection against the implied refusal ( fictieve weigering ) of his request on CARDINAL DATE . He also applied to ORG for a provisional measure . Both procedures are currently still pending .", "Under LAW of LAW DATE ( vreemdelingenwet , hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , which was in force until DATE , aliens coming from a country where they have a well - founded reason to fear persecution on account of their religious or political convictions , or of belonging to a particular race or a particular social group , could be admitted as refugees . The expression \u201c refugee \u201d in this provision was construed to have the same meaning as in LAW ( decision of ORG of DATE , PERSON [ ORG ] DATE , no . CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE , LAW entered into force . On the basis of LAW , an alien may be eligible for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum if , inter alia ,", "\u2013 he or she is a refugee within the meaning of LAW , or", "\u2013 he or she has established well - founded reasons to assume that he / she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin .", "Requests which , after a first intake interview with the applicant , are judged to be inadmissible and/or manifestly ill - founded , may be dealt with in an accelerated procedure if they do not require a time - consuming investigation , meaning that they can be processed with all due care within TIME . This fast - track procedure was introduced following a huge rise in the number of asylum applications that began in DATE .", "Article CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ) provides that an applicant must adduce newly emerged facts or altered circumstances ( nieuw gebleken feiten of veranderde omstandigheden ) if a new request is filed following a decision in which the original request is , either totally or partially , rejected . When no such facts or altered circumstances have been adduced , the administrative authority may reject the new request with reference to the decision on the original request . Article CARDINAL thus embodies the ne bis in idem principle for the administrative law . Nevertheless , an exception has been made in this particular area of the law , in that an alien may adduce exceptional facts and circumstances relating to him or her personally , on the basis of which the new request may be assessed outside the framework of Article CARDINAL . In the case of a repeat asylum application which also invokes the risk of treatment contrary to LAW , an assessment by the court outside the framework of Article CARDINAL is therefore possible . ORG of ORG has on CARDINAL occasion quashed the dismissal of a repeat application for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum despite the absence of new facts or altered circumstances ( judgment of DATE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON Asiel- en ORG [ Newsletter on ORG and Refugeelaw ] CARDINAL ) . It did so on the basis of the exceptional circumstance that there was no dispute between the parties , that on his return to his country of origin , the alien would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment or punishment proscribed by LAW .", "During the initial asylum procedure , an alien is entitled to reception and other facilities provided by the ORG . However , entitlements do not exist if the application has been refused in the accelerated procedure . Pursuant to LAW , an alien whose stay in the GPE is not lawful is not entitled to reception facilities . This provision applies to asylum seekers whose applications have been unsuccessful . Also , a second or further application for asylum does not confer a new entitlement to reception facilities . An exception to that basic principle can nevertheless be made if , inter alia , the asylum seeker finds him or herself in extremely compelling humanitarian circumstances ( FAC schrijnende humanitaire omstandigheden , LAW of FAC ) . The question whether such circumstances exist is always considered after it has been ascertained that the second or further application for asylum will not be processed in the accelerated procedure . It may also be considered if a person , who has submitted a second or further application , requests reception facilities due to extremely compelling humanitarian circumstances .", "The ORG decides whether or not reception facilities will be provided . Appeal lies against a decision to refuse reception , but also against a failure to decide ( or to decide within a reasonable time ) on a request for reception facilities . The lodging of an appeal does not suspend the denial of reception facilities , but a provisional measure may be requested to the effect that such facilities are made available pending the appeal proceedings .", "In a decision of DATE ( nr . ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG ) , the provisional - measures judge of ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , noted that the legislator had omitted to regulate whether or not an entitlement to reception facilities existed during the period for which an interim measure pursuant to Rule CARDINAL of ORG was in place . The judge considered that , as a result of the application of Rule CARDINAL , the petitioner could not be said to be under an obligation to leave the country and his stay in the GPE was , therefore , lawful . In addition , the denial of reception facilities DATE which was aimed at encouraging a departure from GPE \u2013 might detract from the effectiveness of the interim measure . In these circumstances , the judge perceived cause to grant a provisional measure to the effect that the ORG should provide the petitioner with reception facilities pending the proceedings on his appeal against the ORG \u2019s refusal of such facilities .", "In different proceedings , ORG of ORG held on DATE that , as long as an interim measure pursuant to Rule CARDINAL of ORG is in place , the stay in the GPE of the person concerned is lawful ( nr . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Policy is based on official country reports ( ambtsberichten ) , periodically drawn up by ORG .", "The country report on GPE of DATE described how student demonstrations followed parliamentary discussions on a bill relating to the press and the closure of a newspaper on DATE , which got out of hand when riot police , security forces and units of the fundamentalist PERSON raided the campus of ORG and used force against the students , resulting in a number of deaths and CARDINAL of injuries . The violent attack on the students led to mass street protests in several NORP cities , where demonstrations for greater openness and freedom were held over DATE . These led to violent confrontations with the police , security services and groups supporting conservative forces . President PERSON finally banned all demonstrations . It appeared that CARDINAL students were arrested . At the time of the country report , CARDINAL were still thought to be in detention . The CARDINAL \u201c instigators \u201d of the protests had allegedly been condemned to death , although ORG neither confirmed nor denied such reports . Prison terms varying from DATE ( for CARDINAL of the \u201c instigators \u201d ) were imposed .", "The country report concluded that the human rights situation in GPE remained a source of concern , despite a few positive developments . Notably those groups or individuals perceived in GPE as a threat or potential threat to a society based on NORP values and standards were at risk of becoming victims of human rights violations . The policy formulated on the basis of this country report meant that inter alia the following persons were eligible for consideration as possible refugees :", "\u2013 persons viewed , whether individually or as a member of a particular group , as a threat , or a potential threat , to a society based on NORP values and standards ; and", "\u2013 intellectuals , and in particular writers , journalists or publishers , who were viewed as a threat , or a potential threat , to society on the basis of their publications or other utterances in GPE .", "According to the country report of DATE , students in GPE were relatively quiet in the period leading up to the commemoration on DATE of the riots of DATE . However , a demonstration on DATE that was intended to be peaceful got completely out of hand . The police intervened when the marchers began to shout slogans , students were arrested and fights broke out . Many participants in the demonstration at ORG were in fact ordinary people , rather than students .", "On DATE , PERSON announced an amnesty for CARDINAL people who had been involved in the riots of DATE . The death penalty was imposed on one of the participants in the student disturbances but not carried out , the sentence being commuted to DATE imprisonment . The CARDINAL \u201c instigators \u201d of the student unrest of DATE , who had been arrested on DATE , and on DATE sentenced to long terms of imprisonment , were acquitted on appeal in DATE .", "The country report of DATE showed that the human rights situation in GPE had deteriorated in DATE and DATE . The persecution of reformist intellectuals continued unabated . Nevertheless , in DATE it was reported in the press that the speaker of the NORP parliament had requested PERSON to grant an amnesty to the DATE students still in prison because of their activities during the student revolt . CARDINAL students from this group DATE the ones who had received the heaviest sentences \u2013 were still in prison at the time of the country report . They were primarily members and sympathisers of a student union that was viewed with suspicion by the regime .", "The most recent country report , that of DATE , states that , as far as could be ascertained , CARDINAL of the students imprisoned for taking part in the riots of DATE were still in prison , CARDINAL students having been released in DATE .", "In the light of the most recent developments in GPE , as described in the country reports , GPE policy on admitting NORP nationals has remained largely unchanged . Every asylum seeker from GPE must still demonstrate that the personal facts and circumstances of his or her case \u2013 viewed objectively \u2013 justify a fear of persecution as defined in refugee law or might lead to the conclusion that he or she would be subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if returned . Furthermore , the mere fact of a person being a student is no reason to fear persecution by the NORP authorities . In order to be eligible for a residence permit , students who have taken part in demonstrations or riots , or who occupy important positions within the student movement , have to establish that , because of that fact , they personally are viewed with suspicion by the authorities . Moreover , not every form of suspicion immediately leads to the conclusion that there can be said to be persecution within the meaning of refugee law .", "On DATE ORG released the DATE Country Report on ORG in GPE . It stated inter alia :", "\u201c The ORG \u2019s poor human rights record worsened , and it continued to commit numerous , serious abuses . ... Continuing serious abuses included : summary executions ; disappearances ; torture and other degrading treatment , reportedly including severe punishments such as beheading and flogging ; poor prison conditions ; arbitrary arrest and detention ; lack of habeas corpus or access to counsel and prolonged and incommunicado detention .
