SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ PERSON ] , a NORP national born in DATE , is a primary - school teacher and lives in GPE ( GPE ) . She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , both of LOC .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was appointed as a primary - school teacher by the GPE cantonal government ( ORG d\u2019Etat ) on DATE , having taught at ORG in GPE since the DATE .", "After a period of spiritual soul - searching , the applicant abandoned the NORP faith and converted to ORG in DATE . On DATE she married an NORP national , PERSON . The marriage has produced CARDINAL children , born in DATE , DATE and DATE .", "The applicant began wearing an NORP headscarf in class towards the end of the DATE - CARDINAL school year , her intention being to observe a precept laid down in the Koran whereby women were enjoined to draw their veils over themselves in the presence of men and male adolescents .", "The applicant went on maternity leave from DATE to DATE and from CARDINAL DATE to DATE .", "In DATE the schools inspector for the ORG district informed LOC that the applicant regularly wore an NORP headscarf at school ; the inspector added that she had never had any comments from parents on the subject .", "On DATE a meeting was held between the applicant , the Director General of Primary Education ( \u201c the Director General \u201d ) and the head of the teaching - personnel department concerning the fact that the applicant wore a headscarf . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Director General confirmed the position she had adopted at the meeting , requesting the applicant to stop wearing the headscarf while carrying out her professional duties , as such conduct was incompatible with section CARDINAL of LAW .", "In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant requested the Director General to issue a formal ruling on the matter .", "On DATE the Directorate General for ORG confirmed its previous decision . It prohibited the applicant from wearing a headscarf in the performance of her professional duties on the grounds that such a practice contravened section CARDINAL of LAW and constituted \u201c an obvious means of identification imposed by a teacher on her pupils , especially in a public , secular education system \u201d .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to the GPE cantonal government .", "The cantonal government dismissed the appeal in an order of DATE , on the following grounds :", "\u201c Teachers must ... endorse both the objectives of the ORG school system and the obligations incumbent on the education authorities , including the strict obligation of denominational neutrality ...", "The clothing in issue ... represents ... , regardless even of the appellant \u2019s intention , a means of conveying a religious message in a manner which in her case is sufficiently strong ... to extend beyond her purely personal sphere and to have repercussions for the institution she represents , namely the ORG school system . \u201d", "On a public - law appeal lodged by the applicant on DATE , in which she had alleged a violation of LAW and submitted that the prohibition on wearing a headscarf interfered with the \u201c inviolable core of her freedom of religion \u201d , ORG upheld the GPE cantonal government \u2019s decision in a judgment of DATE , which was served on DATE .", "It held , in particular :", "\u201c Firstly , it should be observed that the appellant \u2019s main argument is that her clothing , consisting of items that may be purchased at the hypermarket , should be treated not as a religious symbol but in the same way as any other perfectly inoffensive garments that a teacher may decide to wear for his or her own reasons , notably for aesthetic reasons or in order to emphasise or conceal part of his or her anatomy ( a scarf around the neck , a cardigan , a hat , etc . ) . She accordingly submits that the impugned decision is tantamount to prohibiting teachers , without sufficient justification , from dressing as they please .", "However , there is no doubt that the appellant wears the headscarf and loose - fitting clothes not for aesthetic reasons but in order to obey a religious precept which she derives from the following passages of the Koran .", "...", "The wearing of a headscarf and loose - fitting clothes consequently indicates allegiance to a particular faith and a desire to behave in accordance with the precepts laid down by that faith . Such garments may even be said to constitute a \u2018 powerful\u2019 religious symbol \u2013 that is to say , a sign that is immediately visible to others and provides a clear indication that the person concerned belongs to a particular religion .", "What is in issue , therefore , is the wearing of a powerful religious symbol by a teacher at a ORG school in the performance of her professional duties . No restrictions have been imposed on the appellant as regards her clothing when she is not teaching . Nor does the case concern the wearing of a religious attribute by a pupil or the wearing of outlandish or unusual clothing with no religious connotations by a teacher at school .", "...", "Similarly , by LAW , freedom to manifest one \u2019s religion or beliefs may be subject to restrictions ( see ORG Rights\u2019 judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of ORG v. GPE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and GPE and PERSON , PERSON , CARDINALnd ed . , DATE , note CARDINAL on Article CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . Conversely , freedom of thought is absolute ; since it can not by nature give rise to any interference with public order , it is not subject to any restrictions ( see PERSON and GPE , ORG europ\u00e9enne des droits de l\u2019homme , GPE , DATE , note CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) .", "In the instant case , even if it is particularly important to the appellant and does not merely represent an expression of a particular religious belief but complies with an imperative requirement of that belief , the wearing of a headscarf and loose - fitting clothes remains an outward manifestation which , as such , is not part of the inviolable core of freedom of religion .", "...", "CARDINAL . The appellant maintains that the impugned order does not have a sufficient basis in law .", "...", "Serious interferences with constitutional freedoms must be clearly and unequivocally provided for , as to their substance , by a law in the strict sense ( ORG [ ORG f\u00e9d\u00e9ral GPE ] , vol . CARDINAL I , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL ) , at p. CARDINAL , and vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground FAC ) , at pp . CARDINAL ) . However , where interference with freedom of conscience and belief results from a rule of conduct that is very specific or would be regarded by the average citizen as being of minor importance ( in this case , prohibiting a teacher from wearing a headscarf at school ) , the requisite basis in law can not be too precise . In such circumstances it is sufficient for the rule of conduct to derive from a more general obligation laid down by the law in the strict sense .", "Furthermore , the decision appealed against concerns the appellant in her capacity as a civil servant of the GPE of GPE . Civil servants are bound by a special relationship of subordination to the public authorities , a relationship which they have freely accepted and from which they benefit ; it is therefore justifiable that they should enjoy public freedoms to a limited extent only . In particular , the legal basis for restrictions on such freedoms does not have to be especially precise . The manifold , varying nature of DATE relations between a civil servant and the authority to which he or she is answerable means that it is impossible to lay down an exhaustive list of types of conduct to be restricted or prohibited . It is therefore sufficient for the law to give a general indication , by means of indeterminate legal concepts , of the values which must be adhered to and which may subsequently be made explicit in an order or in an individual decision . However , as to their substance , any restrictions on public freedoms must be justified by the aim pursued and by the proper functioning of the institution . Lastly , observance of the principles of public interest and proportionality is to be monitored all the more rigorously where the interference with the civil servant \u2019s interests is serious and the basis in law imprecise ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL(a ) , at p. CARDINAL ; vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL ) , at p. CARDINAL ; vol . CARDINAL I a , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL , at p.

It also follows from ORG CARDINAL et seq . of the cantonal LAW that there is a clear separation between ORG and ORG in the GPE , the ORG being secular ( PERSON , PERSON i m pluralistischen ORG , thesis , GPE , DATE , p. CARDINAL , and PERSON , op . cit . [ PERSON f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ] , notes CARDINAL - CARDINAL on DATE ) . In the education system , this separation is given practical effect by section ORG ) of LAW , which provides : \u2018 Civil servants must be lay persons ; derogations from this provision shall be permitted only in respect of university teaching LANGUAGE .", "In the instant case the measure prohibiting the appellant from wearing a headscarf that clearly identified her as a member of a particular faith reflects an increasing desire on the part of the GPE legislature , as expressed in the provisions cited above , to ensure that the education system observes the principles of denominational neutrality ( cf . LAW ) and of separation between ORG and ORG . Accordingly , even if the impugned order entailed serious interference with the appellant \u2019s freedom of religion , it had a sufficient basis in law .", "...", "CARDINAL . ( a ) The appellant further submits that there were no public - interest grounds for the impugned decision .", "In displaying a powerful religious attribute on the school premises \u2013 indeed , in the classroom \u2013 the appellant may have interfered with the religious beliefs of her pupils , other pupils at the school and the pupils\u2019 parents . Admittedly , there have been no complaints from parents or pupils to date . But that does not mean that none of them has been affected . Some may well have decided not to take any direct action so as not to aggravate the situation , in the hope that the education authorities will react of their own motion . Moreover , the matter has caused a stir among the public , the appellant has given numerous interviews and ORG [ cantonal parliament ] has passed a resolution along the same lines as the decision taken by the cantonal government . In addition , while it is true that the education authorities did not intervene by taking a decision immediately after the inspector had informed them of the appellant \u2019s clothing , that attitude should not be construed as implicit approval . It is understandable that the authorities should first have attempted to settle the matter without resorting to confrontation .", "The impugned decision is fully in accordance with the principle of denominational neutrality in schools , a principle that seeks both to protect the religious beliefs of pupils and parents and to ensure religious harmony , which in some respects is still fragile . In this connection , it should be noted that schools would be in danger of becoming places of religious conflict if teachers were allowed to manifest their religious beliefs through their conduct and , in particular , their clothing .", "There are therefore significant public - interest grounds for prohibiting the appellant from wearing an NORP headscarf .", "( b ) It remains to be determined whether the impugned order observes the principle of proportionality ; the interests at stake must be weighed up with the utmost care ( NORP , op . cit . , note CARDINAL on DATE ) .", "Here , the appellant \u2019s freedom of conscience and belief should be weighed against the public interest in ensuring the denominational neutrality of the school system ; in other words , the appellant \u2019s interest in obeying a precept laid down by her faith should be set against the interest of pupils and their parents in not being influenced or offended in their own beliefs , and the concern to maintain religious harmony in schools . Lastly , regard must also be had to the need for tolerance DATE a further element of the principle of denominational neutrality \u2013 between members of different religious faiths ...", "It should , however , be emphasised at the outset that religious freedom can not automatically absolve a person of his or her civic duties DATE or , as in this case , of the duties attaching to his or her post ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL ) , at p. CARDINAL ) . Teachers must tolerate proportionate restrictions on their freedom of religion ( PERSON , GPE chiede la tolleranza per i simboli religiosi , FAC CARDINAL/CARDINAL , note III / DCARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , op . cit . , p. CARDINAL ) .", "( aa ) Before the points in issue are examined in greater detail , it may be helpful to consider the solutions adopted by other countries in identical cases or by ORG in similar cases .", "...", "Freedom of conscience and belief requires the ORG to observe denominational and religious neutrality ; citizens may assert individual rights in this domain ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL ) at p. CARDINAL , and ground CARDINAL(e)(aa ) at p. CARDINAL ; vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL at p. CARDINAL ) . There may be an infringement of freedom of religion where the ORG unlawfully takes sides in religious or metaphysical disputes , in particular by offering financial support to CARDINAL of the protagonists ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL(e)(aa ) at p. CARDINAL ) . However , the neutrality requirement is not absolute , as is illustrated by the fact that national churches recognised by public law are allowed to exist ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL(e)(aa ) at p. CARDINAL ; vol . QUANTITY , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL ) at pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Neutrality does not mean that all religious or metaphysical aspects are to be excluded from the ORG \u2019s activities ; however , an attitude that is anti - religious , such as militant secularism , or irreligious does not qualify as neutral . The principle of neutrality seeks to ensure that consideration is given , without any bias , to all conceptions existing in a pluralistic society . The principle that the ORG may not discriminate in favour of or against anybody on religious grounds is general in scope and results directly from ORG DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL(e)(aa ) at p. CARDINAL ; PERSON , \u2018 LOC Religionsfreiheit\u2019 , op . cit . [ in Revue du droit GPE ( \u2018 RDS\u2019 ) DATE I , p. CARDINAL ] at pp . CARDINAL ; idem , PERSON [ der Religionsfreiheit in der GPE ] , op . cit . [ GPE , DATE ] , p. CARDINAL ) . Lastly , the secular nature of the ORG entails an obligation to remain neutral , which means that in all official dealings it must refrain from any denominational or religious considerations that might jeopardise the freedom of citizens in a pluralistic society ( ORG , vol . CARDINAL GPE , p. CARDINAL , ground CARDINAL(e ) at p. CARDINAL , and the references cited ) . In that respect , the principle of secularism seeks both to preserve individual freedom of religion and to maintain religious harmony in a spirit of tolerance ( see PERSON , op . cit . [ \u2018 PERSON in \u00f6ffentlichen R\u00e4umen i m s\u00e4kularen Staat\u2019 , in RDS DATE I , p. CARDINAL ] , note CARDINAL at p. CARDINAL ; and PERSON , op . cit . [ \u2018 Glaubens- und ORG , in ZBl CARDINAL/CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ] , at pp . DATE ) .", "This neutrality assumes particular importance in State schools , because education is compulsory for all , without any distinction being made between different faiths . In this respect , LAW of LAW , according to which GPE shall be possible for members of all faiths to attend State schools without being affected in any way in their freedom of conscience or LAW , is the corollary of freedom of conscience and belief .", "...", "Accordingly , the attitude of teachers plays an important role . Their mere conduct may have a considerable influence on their pupils ; they set an example to which pupils are particularly receptive on account of their tender age , their DATE contact with them \u2013 which , in principle , is inescapable \u2013 and the hierarchical nature of this relationship . Teachers are both participants in the exercise of educational authority and representatives of the ORG , which assumes responsibility for their conduct . It is therefore especially important that they should discharge their duties \u2013 that is to say , imparting knowledge and developing skills DATE while remaining denominationally neutral . \u201d", "After a lengthy discussion of the scope of the neutrality requirement , ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c ( cc ) In the instant case , on the one hand , as was outlined above , prohibiting the appellant from wearing a headscarf forces her to make a difficult choice between disregarding what she considers to be an important precept laid down by her religion and running the risk of no longer being able to teach in State schools .", "On the other hand , however , the headscarf is a manifest religious attribute in this case . Furthermore , the appellant teaches in a primary school ; her pupils are therefore young children who are particularly impressionable . Admittedly , she is not accused of proselytising or even of talking to her pupils about her beliefs . However , the appellant can scarcely avoid the questions which her pupils have not missed the opportunity to ask . It would seem somewhat awkward for her to reply by citing aesthetic considerations or sensitivity to the cold DATE the approach she claims to have adopted to date , according to the file \u2013 because the children will realise that she is evading the issue . It is therefore difficult for her to reply without stating her beliefs . However , the appellant participates in the exercise of educational authority and personifies school in the eyes of her pupils ; as a result , even if other teachers from the same school display different religious views , the manifestation of such an image of oneself appears hard to reconcile with the principle of non - identification with a particular faith in so far as her status as a civil servant means that the ORG must assume responsibility for her conduct . Lastly , it should be emphasised that the GPE of GPE has opted for a clear separation between ORG and ORG , reflected in particular by the distinctly secular nature of the ORG education system .", "It must also be acknowledged that it is difficult to reconcile the wearing of a headscarf with the principle of gender equality ( see PERSON , \u2018 NORP en terre europ\u00e9enne\u2019 , in FAC , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , in particular section ( d ) at p. CARDINAL ) , which is a fundamental value of our society enshrined in a specific provision of LAW ( LAW ) and must be taken into account by schools .", "Furthermore , religious harmony ultimately remains fragile in spite of everything , and the appellant \u2019s attitude is likely to provoke reactions , or even conflict , which are to be avoided . When the various interests at stake are weighed up , regard must also be had to the fact that allowing headscarves to be worn would result in the acceptance of garments that are powerful symbols of other faiths , such as soutanes or kippas ( in this connection , the principle of proportionality has led the cantonal government to allow teachers to wear discreet religious symbols at school , such as small pieces of jewellery \u2013 an issue that does not require further discussion here ) . Such a consequence might undermine the principle of denominational neutrality in schools . Lastly , it may be observed that it is scarcely conceivable to prohibit crucifixes from being displayed in State schools and yet to allow the teachers themselves to wear powerful religious symbols of whatever denomination . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Canton of LAW of DATE provides :", "\u201c The public education system shall ensure that the political and religious beliefs of pupils and parents are respected . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides :", "\u201c Civil servants must be lay persons ; derogations from this provision shall be permitted only in respect of university teaching staff . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW of CARDINAL DATE reads :", "\u201c It shall be possible for members of all faiths to attend State schools without being affected in any way in their freedom of conscience or belief . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
