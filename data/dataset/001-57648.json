GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 10", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;J.A. Carrillo Salcedo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG The first applicant , markt intern , is a publishing firm , whose registered office is at GPE . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , is its editor - in - chief .", "CARDINAL . ORG intern , which was founded and is run by journalists , seeks to defend the interests of small and medium - sized retail businesses against the competition of large - scale distribution companies , such as supermarkets and mail - order firms . It provides the less powerful members of the retail trade with financial assistance in test cases , lobbies public authorities , political parties and trade associations on their behalf and has , on occasion , made proposals for legislation to the legislature .", "However , its principal activity in their support is the publication of a number of bulletins aimed at specialised commercial sectors such as that of chemists and beauty product retailers ( \" markt intern - Drogerie- und Parf\u00fcmeriefachhandel \" ) . These are DATE news - sheets which provide information on developments in the market and in particular on the commercial practices of large - scale firms and their suppliers . They are printed by offset and are sold by open subscription . They do not contain any advertising or any articles commissioned by the groups whose cause they espouse .", "ORG intern claims to be independent . Its income is derived exclusively from subscriptions . It also publishes other series of bulletins containing more general consumer information , such as \" ORG \" , \" Versicherungstip \" and \" ORG \" , which are aimed respectively at taxpayers , holders of insurance policies and air travellers .", "CARDINAL . ORG On several occasions undertakings which had suffered from the applicants\u2019 criticism or their calls for boycotts instituted proceedings against them for infringement of LAW of DATE ( PERSON gegen den unlauteren PERSON - \" LAW \" ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE an article by PERSON appeared in the information bulletin for chemists and beauty product retailers . It described an incident involving an NORP mail - order firm , ORG ( \" the Club \" ) , in the following terms :", "\" \u2018 I ordered the DATE beauty set ... from ORG and paid for it , but returned it DATE because I was not satisfied . Although the order - form clearly and expressly stated that I was entitled to return the set if I was dissatisfied , and that I would be reimbursed , I have not yet seen a pfennig . There was also no reaction to my reminder of DATE , in which I gave them until DATE to ORG This is the angry report of PERSON , a chemist at GPE , concerning the commercial practices of this English ORG .", "On DATE we telexed the manager of the ORG , PERSON , as follows : \u2018 Is this an isolated incident , or is this part of your official policy?\u2019 In its swift answer of DATE , the ORG claimed to have no knowledge of the set returned by PERSON or of her reminder of DATE . It promised however to carry out a prompt investigation of the case and to clarify the matter by contacting the chemist in GPE .", "Notwithstanding this provisional answer from ORG , we would like to put the following question to all our colleagues in the chemists and beauty product trade : Have you had similar experiences to that of PERSON with ORG ? Do you know of similar cases ? The question of whether or not this incident is an isolated case or CARDINAL of many is crucial for assessing the ORG \u2019s policy . \"", "\" \u2018 PERSON beim Cosmetic - Club International das Sch\u00f6nheits - Set ... von DATE und bezahlt , aber wegen Nichtgefallen nach DATE ORG zur\u00fcckgesandt .

PERSON GPE bekannt ? Die Ein- oder PERSON solcher F\u00e4lle ist f\u00fcr die ORG \u00e4usserst wichtig . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG Previously , on DATE and DATE and on DATE , markt intern had already published articles on the ORG and advised retailers and manufacturers to be cautious in their dealings with it because the ORG had failed to respect certain dates and promises . On DATE markt intern described as correct the ORG \u2019s statement in a legal pleading that \" a change in the attitude of the industry show[ed ] that the call for a boycott [ had ] not failed to make an impression \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG instituted proceedings in ORG ( ORG ) which , on DATE , pursuant to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure , issued an interim injunction prohibiting markt intern from repeating the statements published on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG Since the applicants had requested a decision as to the main issue ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ) , the ORG instituted the appropriate proceedings within the time - limit laid down by the court . It asked the court", "\" to restrain markt intern from publishing in its information bulletins :", "CARDINAL . the statement that PERSON had given an angry account of the ORG \u2019s commercial activities to the effect that she had returned the beauty set - because she was dissatisfied with it - but had not been reimbursed despite sending a reminder ,", "without stating at the same time that the ORG had immediately sent to PERSON an enquiry , which it had prepared , for submission to the postal authorities , and that it had assured her that it would reimburse her expenses ;", "CARDINAL . the statement that in its immediate response to markt intern , sent on DATE , the ORG had stated that it had no knowledge of the beauty set \u2019s being returned or of the reminder sent in DATE ,", "without making clear at the same time that there was no intention to raise doubts as to the accuracy of the ORG \u2019s statement ;", "CARDINAL . the question asking colleagues of the chemists and beauty product retailers trade whether they had had similar experiences to that of PERSON or knew of similar cases - because it was of the greatest importance in assessing the ORG \u2019s policy to know whether this case was an isolated incident or whether there had been others ,", "without making clear at the same time that it was not sought to insinuate that the ORG \u2019s official policy was to accept payment without immediately supplying the products due \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE . It dismissed the ORG \u2019s first head of claim because the statement was accurate and there was no reason to think that markt intern would disseminate it again without indicating what had occurred since the publication of its information sheet of DATE ( enquiries made to the postal authorities , etc . ) . On the other hand , it allowed the other CARDINAL heads of claim , basing its decision on LAW , according to which , \" anyone who untruthfully alleges or disseminates a fact liable to affect adversely a person \u2019s creditworthiness or to cause him other disadvantages relating to his earning capacity or his career advancement , shall be liable to pay compensation for any such damage he may have caused \" . It found that LAW was not applicable and left open the question whether the ORG could also rely on LAW .", "In ORG view , in writing that the ORG claimed to have no knowledge of the return of the beauty set and of PERSON reminder ( the ORG \u2019s second head of claim ) , markt intern had not only expressed doubts as to the accuracy of this information but had also virtually asserted , without providing any proof , that the information provided was untruthful .", "By inviting chemists to inform it of any \" similar experiences \" with ORG the ORG \u2019s third head of claim ) , markt intern had solicited information , which , if possible , was to be of a negative character regarding the ORG , despite the fact that there were not at that stage sufficient grounds to suggest that the ORG \u2019s commercial policy was reprehensible .", "ORG acknowledged that economic activities were subject to critical review by the press . However , it considered that the principles of the protection of legitimate interests ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) and of the freedom of expression ( LAW ) did not protect the repetition of untruthful statements .", "The court concluded that the applicants\u2019 conduct was culpable . ORG intern ought not to have generalised from the case of PERSON , the circumstances of which had not yet been clarified , and used it to formulate criticism of the ORG . This method of proceeding could not be reconciled with the obligations incumbent on journalists . The defendants ought to have begun by taking their enquiries further , but not in the form of their request for information from the retailers .", "Under the terms of the judgment , for each contravention the applicants were liable to a fine ( NORP ) or detention ( NORP ) to be fixed by the court , but not exceeding DM CARDINAL or DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG found for the applicants and quashed ORG judgment .", "In ORG view , LAW was not applicable because , by publishing its article on DATE , markt intern had not acted from competitive motives , in other words with a view to increasing the turnover of chemists and beauty shops , to the detriment of the ORG ; it had sought to inform its readers that the ORG had not dealt as it should have done with a matter concerning one of its own customers . Nor could the ORG rely on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW because the allegations published on DATE were not untruthful .", "As regards the return of the beauty set and PERSON reminder ( the Club \u2019s first head of claim ) , the applicants\u2019 statements had been consistent with their obligations as journalists . LAW ( Article CARDINAL ) in principle allowed unfavourable assessments regarding business services in so far as they sought to protect legitimate interests . Article CARDINAL of LAW recognised that the role of the press was to contribute to the forming of public opinion . Finally , there was no risk that markt intern would repeat this particular statement .", "The statement that the ORG had claimed to have no knowledge of the beauty set and PERSON reminder ( \" will ... weder ... noch ... wissen The form of words merely indicated to the readers that markt intern could not confirm the information provided by the ORG .", "By its request for information from chemists ( the ORG \u2019s third head of claim ) , markt intern had not cited facts or made allegations suggesting that the incident in question represented the ORG \u2019s official policy . It had simply recommended that its readers verify the ORG \u2019s commercial practices and , indeed , had left open the question whether PERSON case was an isolated incident . It had of course expressed the opinion that it was , in its view , possible that there had been a number of other cases of the same type . This was , however , merely a value judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG The ORG appealed to ORG which , on DATE , set aside ORG judgment and , varying ORG judgment , ordered the applicants to refrain from publishing in their information bulletin the statements disseminated by markt intern on DATE in the form referred to by ORG in its heads of claim at first instance ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "For each contravention , the applicants were liable to a fine or detention to be fixed by the court , but not exceeding DM CARDINAL,CARDINAL or DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG based its judgment on LAW CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , according to which :", "\" Any person who in the course of business commits , for purposes of competition , acts contrary to honest practices may be enjoined from further engaging in those acts and held liable in damages . \"", "\" PERSON i m gesch\u00e4ftlichen FAC zu ORG des PERSON vornimmt , die gegen die PERSON , ORG in GPE genommen werden . \"", "( a ) Notwithstanding the lack of a competitive relationship between markt intern and the ORG , the CARDINAL Act was said to apply because it was sufficient in this respect that the contested conduct was objectively advantageous to an undertaking , to the detriment of a competitor . That was exactly the aim pursued in this instance . On these points , ORG referred to the established case - law , and in particular its own , concerning LAW .", "In so far as ORG had held that the applicants did not intend to intervene in favour of the specialised retail trade to the detriment of the ORG , its judgment did not stand up to scrutiny . It had not taken sufficient account of all the circumstances nor attached the correct weight to the evidence adduced . Having regard in particular to the previous reports published by markt intern on ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG ought to have found that the applicants had not merely provided information as an organ of the press , but had embraced the interests of the specialised chemists trade and , in order to promote those interests , had attacked the ORG \u2019s commercial practices . ORG ought consequently to have concluded that markt intern intended to act in favour of the specialised trade and to the detriment of the ORG . In general , it was extremely unusual for the press and the news media to cite an isolated incident such as the case of PERSON - according to markt intern it could even have been simply \" a breakdown in communications \" - in order to raise immediately in public the controversial question whether this case reflected the ORG \u2019s official policy . ORG ought to have regarded markt intern \u2019s call for information from its readers concerning negative experiences of a similar type as an even more unusual step , which again revealed the intention to influence the market .", "( b ) LAW was thus applicable in this case . It was infringed because the disputed statements were contrary to honest practices on the following grounds :", "\" By their publication of the article complained of ... , the respondents acted in a way contrary to honest practices within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW . It is immaterial in this connection whether the statements regarding the witness GPE ( first head of claim ) were true . The mere fact that a commercially damaging statement is true does not necessarily constitute a defence against a charge of acting in breach of the principles of fair competition . According to the rules of competition , such statements are acceptable only if they are based on sufficient grounds and if the manner and extent of the criticism in question remains within the limits of what is required by the situation because it is contrary to honest practices to engage in competition by making disparaging statements about competitors ( see ORG , PERSON ( \" BGH GRUR \" ) DATE , pp . CARDINAL and PERSON ) . In this case , at the time of the publication there was not sufficient cause to report this incident . The exact circumstances had not yet been clarified . The appellant in its reply had agreed to undertake an immediate investigation and to contact PERSON in order to clarify the position . The respondents were aware that criticism of the appellant could not be fully justified before further clarification had been sought , as they themselves had described the appellant \u2019s reply as a provisional answer . Accordingly , they should have taken into consideration that any such premature publication of this incident was bound to have adverse effects on the appellant \u2019s business , because it gave the specialised retailers an effective argument which was capable of being used against the appellant with their mutual customers , and one which could be used even if the incident should turn out to be an isolated mishap from which no conclusion could be drawn as to the appellant \u2019s business policy . In these circumstances , at all events at the time of the publication , there were not sufficient grounds for reporting this isolated incident . Such conduct is , moreover , very unusual in business competition .", "As regards the second head of claim , the appeal on a point of law must be allowed for the simple reason that the sentence : \u2018 ORG claimed to have no knowledge of the set returned by PERSON or of her reminder of June\u2019 can be understood only in the light of the information contrary to honest competition which is referred to under the first head of claim . As , simply , an additional and related item of information , it qualifies for the same legal assessment , in particular because it was liable to strengthen the unfavourable impression which inevitably resulted from the mere recounting of the incident . ORG considered that this was no more than an illustration of the fact that the journalist had not been in a position to verify what had been told to him , but this observation conflicts with its earlier conclusion that the wording used expressed at least serious doubts as to the accuracy of the information and that in this case , consequently , the description of events put forward by the appellant was presented as being , probably , unreliable . ORG ought therefore to have stated on what basis it reached a conclusion contrary to the ordinary meaning of the words . It did not do so , so that it may be presumed that at least a significant proportion of the readers of the bulletin would interpret the words employed in accordance with general usage , which was liable to show the appellant in an even more unfavourable light .", "ORG dismissal of the third head of claim was based on the following considerations . The question put to chemist and beauty store colleagues asking whether their experiences with the ORG had been similar to that of PERSON or whether they knew of similar cases , which was said to be very important in assessing the ORG \u2019s policy , indicated that the respondents considered it possible that a number of cases of this type had occurred . However , this merely represented a value judgment , and as such could not give rise to objections . Yet , under section CARDINAL of LAW , the decisive issue is not whether the statement is to be regarded as a value judgment or as an allegation of fact . The expression of a value judgment can also exert an unacceptable influence in the field of competition under section CARDINAL of LAW ( see BGH PERSON , p. CARDINAL - Betonzusatzmittel ) . In this case , there were in any event not sufficient grounds for such a sweeping suspicion . A single case of this type did not constitute evidence for suspecting immediately that the appellant \u2019s commercial policy was fraudulent . It is moreover contrary to honest commercial practices to solicit , in such circumstances and at such an early stage , compromising information .", "As the respondents were aware of the circumstances giving rise to the criticism that they had acted contrary to honest practices , there can be no reservations , from the subjective point of view , against finding a contravention of LAW . As regards the risk of repetition , regard must be had to the principle laid down by ORG in its case - law , according to which , where the rules of competition are infringed , there is a presumption of fact that such a risk exists ( see ORG , civil cases ( \" BGHZ \" ) CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL - Constanze II ) . This is the case for articles in the press where - as here - the nature of the questions dealt with gives grounds for supposing that the debate was not closed by the publication of the first article ( ORG , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL - Alte Herren ; ORG , ORG ( \" ORG \" ) DATE , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL - Reichstagsbrand ) . The respondents have not put forward any legally valid evidence that the danger no longer existed . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicants then appealed to ORG , claiming a violation of the freedom of the press ( LAW ) .", "Sitting as a committee of CARDINAL judges , ORG decided , on DATE , not to entertain the appeal . It considered that the appeal did not offer sufficient prospects of success , for the following reasons :", "\" As ORG held in its decision of CARDINAL DATE ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL and others [ Entscheidungen PERSON , volume DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ] ) , the requirements which must be satisfied in order for freedom of expression and of the press to override other legal interests protected under statutes of general application are not fulfilled where an item published in the press is intended to promote , in the context of commercial competition , certain economic interests to the detriment of others . This is the case as regards the statements prohibited by ORG . The second sentence of LAW did not therefore require a different interpretation and application of LAW from that given by the judgment appealed .", "As that decision is not based on a violation of the second sentence of LAW ( freedom of the press ) , it is immaterial that ORG did not , in the reasons given for its decision , expressly address the question of the scope of the freedom of the press in relation to the application of LAW . \"", "* * *", "CARDINAL . PERSON was not the only customer to complain about the ORG . CARDINAL others informed the applicants that they had encountered similar difficulties ; the first approached them before the publication of the bulletin of DATE and the second after it .", "According to its own statements , the ORG sold CARDINAL beauty sets DATE and DATE . In DATE , CARDINAL identifiable persons returned the sets and were reimbursed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
