ORG was disturbed by public statements by NORP officials , including the President of GPE , in the wake of both the ORG murders and the GPE bombings , which , if not directly sanctioning the use of violence by ORG agents against certain sections of the population , could be perceived at the very least to condone the use of unlawful methods such as torture and ill - treatment .
