In DATE PERSON worked as a newspaper journalist in GPE . In DATE she headed the GPE bureau of ORG . In DATE she became a spokesperson for the then - Prime Minister , PERSON , a move which was widely perceived as constituting a significant change of sides in the political debate on Ms NORP \u2019s part . In DATE she was elected as a member of parliament on the list of ORG , led by PERSON . At the material time she frequently presented her party \u2019s and PERSON views on various television and radio programmes and debates .", "CARDINAL .

Of course , she is such a professional ...", "I thought that after her speech CARDINAL would join ORG . I used to think that one could easily debate with PERSON .

On DATE PERSON lodged a defamation claim with the GPE ORG against the applicant company and the article \u2019s author . She sought a retraction \u2013 in the form of the publication of a court judgment in her favour \u2013 of the allegedly false statements made in the article concerning her alleged acquisition of a flat , . She also sought compensation for non - pecuniary damage . The applicant company maintained that the statements in question had constituted a value judgment in respect of the legal provision entitling members of parliament to housing support .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the plaintiff \u2019s claims in part . It found that the following extracts constituted an untrue statement :", "\u201c And [ if I had an offer ] to become a member of parliament , as in PERSON case ?

We do n\u2019t have many stars , like PERSON , [ whose worth is ] that of a flat in GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The court found that the plaintiff had not requested or received a flat in her capacity as a member of parliament ; she had bought her own flat in DATE , before she had been elected . The court considered that the above statements suggested that the plaintiff had become a member of parliament for the sole purpose of obtaining a flat in GPE . In the court \u2019s view this was not a value judgment because only concrete information as to whether Ms NORP had exercised her entitlement to housing support could serve as the basis for such statements . Rather , the statements in question constituted statements of fact which had not been verified or proved by either of the defendants , and were negative and insulting to the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . Relying in particular on the provisions of LAW and of LAW and referring to the constitutional provision guaranteeing respect for private life ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , the court ordered the applicant company to retract this information by publishing the operative part of its judgment and to pay the plaintiff CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) at the time ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The court also found that the following extract constituted a value judgment on the author \u2019s part and rejected the claim in this respect :", "\u201c What if I were given MONEY a month ? ... I believe that all journalists dream of selling themselves for a flat in GPE , even those who already have CARDINAL ... I listened to PERSON and I wish I were as lucky as she is . I wish I could sell myself like that ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed , arguing , in particular , that the statement in question had been an expression of the author \u2019s opinion . In particular , he had wondered what could have induced PERSON , \u201c a former nationalist \u201d , to change her political sympathies . Being aware that the Member of ORG \u2019s Status Act provided for housing support , the author speculated that he might be willing to change his views in exchange for a flat in GPE . For the applicant company , the lack of coherence in the plaintiff \u2019s demand that a subjective opinion be retracted was illustrated by the fact that the plaintiff and the first - instance court had been unable to formulate a specific statement of retraction and had resorted to the requirement to publish the text of the judgment itself . For the applicant company , the plaintiff \u2019s failure to formulate a specific retraction illustrated the rationale behind section CARDINAL of LAW , under which value judgments were not subject to retraction . The applicant company argued that the requirement to retract the statement by publishing the text of the court judgment contradicted section CARDINAL of LAW . The applicant company also argued that the author had not had the requisite intent to disseminate untrue information . In support of its arguments it invoked the constitutional provision guaranteeing the freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE , finding the applicant company \u2019s arguments unsubstantiated and ORG conclusions correct .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed on points of law . In addition to reiterating the arguments it had raised on appeal , it referred to the ORG \u2019s judgments in ORG v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) , and PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) , arguing that according to the ORG \u2019s case - law the limits of acceptable criticism were wider with regard to a politician than in relation to a private individual and that such criticism could include recourse to a degree of exaggeration , or even provocation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found no grounds to review the case on points of law , finding that there were no reasons to believe that the lower courts\u2019 decisions had breached any provisions of substantive or procedural law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
