{"ITEMID": "001-22055", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "ADNANE v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The first applicant has both NORP and NORP citizenship . He was born in DATE and is living in GPE . The second applicant is his daughter . She is a NORP national , born in DATE , and currently living with her father . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant was born and raised in GPE , where in DATE he married PERSON , whom he divorced by repudiation on DATE . The second applicant was born out of this marriage and , after her GPE divorce , remained in the care and custody of her mother .", "On DATE , the first applicant married with PERSON and , on DATE , moved to the GPE . Out of this marriage , CARDINAL children were born in the GPE in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . Like the first applicant , PERSON has both NORP and NORP citizenship .", "After having learned in DATE that , on DATE , PERSON had entrusted the second applicant \u2019s care and custody to her sister PERSON , the first applicant took proceedings before ORG in PERSON ( GPE ) seeking to obtain the custody of the second applicant .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG Instance noted that PERSON had remarried in the meantime and held that , consequently , she had lost the entitlement to the custody of her daughter to the benefit of the father . It therefore awarded the second applicant \u2019s custody to the first applicant . PERSON was ordered to hand the second applicant over to the first applicant , who in turn was to pay A.B. a maintenance allowance for the second applicant \u2019s care as well as an allowance for having looked after the second applicant . This judgment was notified to the parties on DATE . On DATE , the second applicant took up residence with her parental grandparents in GPE .", "On DATE , on behalf of the second applicant , the first applicant filed a request for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) on grounds of family reunification . Such a visa is normally a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit which confers more permanent residence rights .", "On DATE , the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON ) rejected the request . Insofar as the applicants relied on LAW , the Minister held that there had been no interference with these rights in that the second applicant had not been deprived of a residence entitlement enabling her to enjoy family life with her father in the GPE . The Minister further held that there was no positive obligation under LAW to allow the second applicant to take up residence in the GPE since the refusal to grant her a residence permit did not prevent a continuation of the applicants\u2019 family life as it existed then whereas it had not been established that there was an obstacle to the exercise of their family life outside the GPE .", "On DATE , the second applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the Minister of ORG against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . In the course of a hearing held on DATE , the first applicant stated , inter alia , that \u2013 apart from his parents DATE he also had CARDINAL married sisters and CARDINAL brothers living in GPE . In his decision of DATE , the Minister rejected the objection . On DATE , the second applicant filed an appeal with ORG ( ORG ) sitting in GPE .", "At some unspecified date in DATE , the second applicant travelled to the GPE , where she moved in with the first applicant \u2019s family .", "Following a hearing held on DATE , ORG rejected the appeal on DATE . ORG held , inter alia , that there was no indication that the first applicant had always had the intention of being reunited with the second applicant . It noted in this respect that , when the first applicant left GPE for the GPE in DATE , he had left the second applicant behind with her mother in GPE and found it established that this situation had been intended as being a permanent arrangement . It was only after having learned that the second applicant was in fact being cared for by her maternal aunt that the first applicant took proceedings seeking to obtain the custody of the second applicant . Furthermore , ORG did not find it established that there had been any regular contacts between the applicants during the period when the second applicant had been cared for by her mother and her maternal aunt . On this point , it noted that the first applicant learned only after DATE that the second applicant had been entrusted to the care of her maternal aunt . This was not altered by the fact that the first applicant had paid for the costs of the second applicant \u2019s care and upbringing since he had only started to do so after a judicial order to this effect .", "As regards LAW , ORG held that this provision does not contain a general obligation to enable the exercise of family life by way of immigration , but that the existence of such an obligation is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case . In this connection , ORG held that the applicants had not submitted any facts or circumstances on the basis of which it should be held that their personal interest outweighed the interests of the GPE authorities in maintaining a restrictive immigration policy , and concluded that the Minister had not acted unlawfully in refusing to grant the second applicant a provisional residence visa .", "In view of the situation in the GPE as regards population size and employment , Government immigration policy DATE defined in FAC ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) of DATE is aimed at restricting the number of aliens admitted to the GPE . In general , aliens are only granted admission for residence purposes if : ( a ) the GPE are obliged under international law to do so ; ( b ) this serves the \u201c essential interests of the GPE \u201d , e.g. economic or cultural interests ; and ( c ) there are \u201c cogent reasons of a humanitarian nature \u201d ( LAW ACARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL of FAC ) .", "The policy for admission for family reunification purposes is laid down in LAW of FAC . This provides , insofar as relevant , that a residence permit for the purposes of family reunification may be granted to a parent of NORP nationality with minor children , when the children factually belong to his / her family and family ties with one of the parents already existed abroad . Family ties are considered to have definitely ceased to exist in case of long - term integration of the child into another family while the parent(s ) no longer exercise parental authority and no longer provide for the costs of the upbringing and care of the child ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
