He claimed that , in DATE and in DATE , he had been arrested during a demonstration . On both occasions he had been ill - treated during his detention and released after DATE . He further claimed that in DATE he had been caught by a policeman when he was kissing a male friend in an alley . He was arrested and taken to the vice squad police office where his particulars were recorded and his fingerprints taken . He was forced to write and sign a statement in which he declared that he was a homosexual and that he had been caught in flagrante delicto . After having been raped by this policeman , he was released DATE . He was told by the policeman that he should report DATE to him at the vice squad police station . The applicant further stated that this policeman had raped him on CARDINAL further occasions when he had reported to him at the police station . The applicant also claimed that , on DATE , he had attended a protest meeting in the course of which films had been shot and photographs taken , including photographs of the applicant in the company of a good friend . This friend was arrested at the meeting and released on DATE . On DATE , the friend 's body was found in a ditch . The words \u201c freedom of expression has this as a consequence \u201d had been written on the body . Fearing the same fate , the applicant decided to flee GPE . He had travelled by car to GPE and from there by airplane to the GPE . He arrived in the GPE on DATE .", "On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicant 's asylum request , holding that the applicant 's account lacked credibility .", "The applicant 's appeal against this decision was rejected on CARDINAL DATE by ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE sitting in PERSON . ORG held :", "\u201c ORG notes that the defendant has rejected the request under LAW ( f ) of the LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) . Pursuant to this provision , in the determination of an [ asylum ] application , account must also be taken of the fact that the alien has not been able to submit any supporting travel or identity documents or other documents necessary for the determination of the application , unless the alien can demonstrate that he can not be held responsible for the non - production of such documents .", "The defendant has observed in this context that it can not be considered credible that the [ applicant ] would not have been in possession of personal documents during his journey though GPE and was unaware of the NORP legal rules on this point since there is an identification obligation in that country for all persons from DATE . In addition , and contrary to his stated intentions , the [ applicant ] has not had sent to the GPE documents from which his identity could be confirmed . The defendant furthermore does not consider it plausible that the [ applicant ] was unable to submit a single indicative element of proof of his journey to the GPE . The [ applicant ] has also been unable to submit newspaper reports about the events of DATE or to indicate in which newspapers information about these events was published . However , according to the [ applicant ] , such information had been published .", "In addition to the above , the defendant has found that the [ applicant ] , who indicated that he had been politically active , was unable to state clearly the activities in which he had been engaged . In the opinion of the defendant , the [ applicant ] has also given vague and incredulous statements about the events of DATE , the audiovisual recordings of these events , the death of his friend in relation to these events and the manner in which he was informed of his death . The defendant further considers it doubtful that the [ applicant ] participated in the meeting of DATE as he would have attracted the negative attention of the authorities and would have been subject to an obligation to report DATE . The [ applicant ] also remained DATE in his home but failed to comply with his obligation to report DATE . Also , the arrests and detentions alleged by the [ applicant ] in DATE and DATE can not be considered credible as in that period the [ applicant ] was still doing his military service . Being a conscript , it can not be considered credible that he would have been unconditionally released on each occasion after DATE without encountering any negative consequences , whereas an intelligence file on him would have existed .", "The defendant also considers it not credible that the [ applicant ] would have been caught performing homosexual acts . Moreover , given what is known about that , it is not plausible that the [ applicant ] would be punished solely on account of homosexual conduct .", "ORG is of the opinion that the defendant 's decision can pass the judicial test . ... In the court 's opinion , the defendant could , having regard to the extensive reasoning in his decision as set out above , which has remained unchallenged in both the written and oral appeal submissions , in all reasonableness find the applicant 's account not credible . The defendant has justifiably and on good grounds decided that the [ applicant ] can not be regarded as a refugee .", "As regards the report of the ORG ( ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ) GPE submitted by the applicant , ORG considers that this can not be given the significance sought by the [ applicant ] . According to the constant case - law , an official report ( ambtsbericht ) of the Minister of ORG must be regarded as an expert report , and the contents of the report cited by the [ applicant ] do not contain a definite rebuttal of the information on the punishment of homosexuals set out in the official report of DATE . Therefore , it is not necessarily contradictory .", "The [ applicant ] can not , therefore , derive entitlement to a residence permit from LAW ( a ) of the LAW .", "Noting the above considerations , it has also not been established that the [ applicant ] has well - founded reasons for assuming that he , when expelled , runs a real risk of being subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ... ORG further finds no appearance of such compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature linked to the reasons for leaving the country of origin that the defendant could not , in all reasonableness , have adopted the position that the [ applicant ] can be asked to return to his country of origin ... \u201d", "The applicant 's subsequent appeal was rejected on DATE by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG , which upheld ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "The general official report ( algemeen ambtsbericht ) on GPE of ORG , dated DATE and in so far as relevant , states :", "\u201c Homosexuality is a big taboo subject in NORP society .

In order to risk policiary sanctions \u2013 maltreatment or a short time in custody / jail , regardless of the fact that the penalty according to the law is death or whipping - a homosexual couple must behave with great indiscretion , almost provocatively , in a public place .", "According to a sociologist specializing on GPE and charg\u00e9e de conferences at FAC ( GPE ) , the law stipulates that people engaging in sexual relations with a person of the same sex ... would only be put on trial if the prosecution can produce CARDINAL righteous men who witnessed the sexual act , or CARDINAL of the partners admits to having sexual relations with another man ... If there are CARDINAL men to testify to the homosexuality of a person , the accusation of homosexual activities can not be proven . The sociologist stated that it would be suicidal to ' admit one 's homosexuality ' and added that such an admission is implausible . In practice , the burden of proof lies so heavily on the prosecution that ... a homosexual will very rarely be tried or sentenced . The sociologist has never come across any case that went to trial and stated there are many more stonings for heterosexual relations prior to marriage and for adultery than for homosexuality .", "Another sociologist ... at ORG stated ... that legislative repression is not directed against ' homosexuals ' but against heterosexual relations outside marriage . Repressing ' homosexual activities ' is rare for the security forces because of the difficulty of identifying who is ' homosexual ' and who is not since NORP men have very close physical contact ( holding hands and kissing ) which is socially acceptable behaviour in GPE . It is very rare that a person would be arrested for ' homosexuality ' but if a person were arrested and convicted as a homosexual the punishment would be harsh .", "According to another sociologist and a researcher on GPE with the ORG , although NORP and NORP laws punish ' homosexuality ' by death , in practice , it rarely happens , except in the cases of pedophilia ... ' Homosexuality ' is a common phenomenon and is tolerated as long as it does not disturb public order and remains a private activity .

Certain ' health clubs ' in GPE are for example known to be frequented by homosexuals . Furthermore , it is by no means unusual to meet openly homosexual persons \u2013under otherwise heterosexual private circumstances like social events .", "... There is a park in central GPE called GPE ( student ) that is famous and well - known as a place where men who are looking for sexual relationships with other men meet .

Furthermore , sex changes are permitted in GPE and operations are frequently and openly carried out . A different sexual orientation may , however , create problems . Still , homosexuality is practised every day , and as long as this happens behind closed doors within your own CARDINAL walls , and as long as people do not intend to proselytise \u201c transvestitism \u201d or homosexuality , they will most likely remain unharmed .", "CARDINAL .

From a legal point of view it is important to take a look at NORP law LAW , which carries the following provisions for homosexual acts :", "Art .

Punishment for sexual intercourse among lesbians is CARDINAL lashes and in case of recidivity CARDINAL times execution .", "CARDINAL . So far , no cases of execution only on the grounds of homosexual relations have been identified . In fact , the burden of proof is quite high and it would be difficult to prove homosexual liaisons or intercourse .

It is not confirmed whether the homosexual act alone led to execution or whether the person was accused on other charges too .", "CARDINAL . DATE there were reports that a man accused of sodomising and then murdering his nephew was to be thrown over a cliff in a sack .

However , jurisprudence , burden of proof notwithstanding , certainly has used accusations of homosexuality .
