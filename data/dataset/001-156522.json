Both parents think they are doing what is best for their child , while forgetting that their conflict is the major obstacle to the normal psycho - physical development and functioning of their child ... [ The mother ] thinks that the child should be with her and that the wish of the child , who also expresses the wish to be with her , should be respected . [ The father ] thinks that that his role is to protect the child from the mother \u2019s negative influence and ensure stability for her . Those views are PERSON , but the only question is how much each of them negatively affects the child by fighting for their own position ? For a compromise people need to be ready to partially abandon their position , but they are not ready to do so . In my view , both parents have a good relationship with the child ; they [ both ] try to spend quality time with her . They differ to some extent in their methods and parenting styles ( [ the mother \u2019s ] is permissive and directed at [ developing ] a friendly relationship with her daughter , which may also be a strategy for \u2018 winning\u2019 the child , whereas [ the father ] is more impulsive , with a tendency to give in , and is oriented towards the traditional role of the father , which would not be a problem if the CARDINAL parents would cooperate ... Neither of them disputes that the role of the other parent is also important for the child , but they both find it important that the child lives with them , believing that in that way they would diminish the harmful influence \u2018 the other parent has on the child\u2019 . This means that the main problem is unresolved parental conflict , and the parents should probably work on that outside the [ social welfare ] centre . When they are able to talk to each other , and when they realise why and which of their actions are harmful for [ the child ] ( and stem from their personal conflict ) then they will be able to function better . In that regard I think that the supervision measure can not provide a better solution to the problems they have . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
