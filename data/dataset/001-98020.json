On DATE the L\u00fcbeck ORG ( ORG ) issued a warrant for the applicant 's arrest on suspicion of trafficking in and importing narcotic substances . He was subsequently remanded in custody .", "CARDINAL . Following negotiations with the applicant 's legal representatives , ORG gave the applicant an assurance that the prosecution service would institute proceedings under LAW on ORG ( NORP Treaty Series no .

Furthermore , they would refrain from requesting a sentence exceeding DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .

Prior to the oral hearing , the applicant 's counsel informed the trial court of the agreement reached between the applicant 's defence lawyers and the public prosecution service .", "CARDINAL . During the oral hearing before LOC ( Landgericht ) , which took place on DATE , the applicant gave a full confession . ORG requested a sentence of DATE imprisonment . According to the transcript of the hearing , ORG moreover declared as follows :", "\u201c .... ORG does not see any reason not to proceed in accordance with LAW ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the L\u00fcbeck ORG , on the basis of the applicant 's confession , convicted him of unlawful trafficking in and importing narcotic substances and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The court accepted the applicant 's confession as a mitigating factor . The applicant having waived his right to appeal , the judgment became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the GPE - Holstein Ministry of ORG to institute transfer proceedings under LAW . In his pleadings , the applicant 's counsel relied upon the agreement between the defence , the criminal chamber at LOC and ORG at ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acknowledged receipt of the applicant 's request and informed him that the Head of ORG ( Leitender Oberstaatsanwalt ) in PERSON had been invited to submit comments on it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of the Chief Public Prosecutors stated that he would only endorse a transfer under LAW on condition that the NORP authorities gave an assurance of continued enforcement and did not release him before CARDINAL of the sentence had been served .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant reminded ORG that , during the oral hearing held on DATE , ORG had given an assurance that he would support the applicant 's request to be transferred under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sent the applicant 's submissions to the Head of ORG for comment . They pointed out that it was no longer standard practice in GPE to institute transfer proceedings under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of the Chief Public Prosecutors submitted a report containing a statement given by ORG at the hearing . The latter stated that , when giving the assurance , he had not known the difference between Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and had expected the applicant to be transferred to the GPE to serve the sentence imposed by the NORP courts . It had been important to him to express his view that the applicant should be allowed to serve his sentence in his home country .", "CARDINAL . Based on this statement , ORG considered that the applicant could not be under the impression that he had been promised a transfer under LAW with binding effect on ORG . Subsequently , the Head of the Chief Public Prosecutors refused to endorse a transfer under LAW and suggested a transfer under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked the ORG ( GPE ) for a judicial determination under LAW of LAW to LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz zum Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz , ORG , see Relevant Domestic Law , below ) with regard to ORG decision to pursue the applicant 's transfer under LAW and not , as he had previously been assured , LAW . He submitted that he had only confessed in the light of ORG assurance that the prosecution service would support his transfer under LAW , and that ORG decision to pursue the transfer under LAW violated his right to a fair trial under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's request as inadmissible . Referring to ORG submissions , ORG considered that ORG comment on the applicant 's transfer request did not constitute a judicial decision within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW , as it did not concern the domestic administration of criminal justice , but related to a diplomatic relationship with a foreign State . Furthermore , the Convention on ORG did not confer any individual rights on the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the ORG 's decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , declined to consider the applicant 's constitutional complaint . According to ORG , the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies . With regard to domestic remedies , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c The applicant has no right to a judicial review of the exercise of discretion in so far as the decision is based on general , in particular foreign policy , considerations ... , the evaluation of which belongs to the core area of Government . However , the judicial review of discretionary powers in respect of law enforcement remains unaffected thereby , in particular with regard to the statement made on DATE of the trial by ORG ... It can not be denied that uncertainties may remain for the person seeking justice in this connection in view of the previously disputed contestability of decisions by the authorising authority , as well as in regard to the possible legal remedies . Sufficient account is taken of the possible uncertainties in regard to the legal remedy on account of the possibility of a binding referral under section CARDINALa LAW . It is reasonable to expect the applicant to have recourse to a disputed legal remedy . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , it was for the lower courts to decide which court was competent in the applicant 's case . These courts had further to consider whether the impugned act interfered with the applicant 's right to a fair trial or with the principle of protection of legitimate confidence . Notwithstanding the possibility of lodging a fresh request , the fact that the relevant time - limits for lodging appeals might in the meantime have expired did not lead to the constitutional complaint being admissible .", "CARDINAL . NORP This decision was served on the applicant 's counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant unsuccessfully lodged a fresh request with ORG that execution of his sentence be taken over under LAW .", "CARDINAL .

Section CARDINALa \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz ) reads as follows :", "\u201c If the invoked court is not competent to adjudicate the case , the court shall decide thus of its own motion after hearing the parties and shall , at the same time , refer the legal dispute to the competent court ...

If a party has been prevented from complying with this time - limit through no fault of their own , they can lodge a request to restore the previous time - limit . However , such a request is inadmissible if it has been lodged DATE after expiry of the time - limit , with the exception of cases of force majeure ( section CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The German Act on International Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters does not explicitly define the role of the enforcement authority in the transfer proceedings . The LAW merely provides that the authorising authority , which is ORG \u2013 which can delegate its competence to ORG DATE must send a transfer request to the administering State . If the decision is taken by ORG , that Ministry , after consulting the public prosecutor 's office , exercises discretion with regard both to foreign policy considerations and law - enforcement issues .", "CARDINAL .
