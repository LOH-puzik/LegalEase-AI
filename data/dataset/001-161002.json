Parental responsibility was exercised jointly by both parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON and the child went to GPE on holiday , with the applicant \u2019s consent . On DATE PERSON informed the applicant that she was not coming back to GPE with the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a return order for the child under LAW .", "CARDINAL . It appears that in DATE the application was registered with ORG . Judge PERSON was assigned to preside over the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the applicant \u2019s request , PERSON submitted that in DATE she and her husband had become distant from each other ; the applicant had lost interest in his family and had been spending his spare time playing computer games . For those reasons , and also out of fear that the child would never again be allowed to leave GPE , PERSON did not agree to her daughter \u2019s returning to GPE alone and informed the domestic court that she did not wish to go back there with the child .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing was held on DATE before ORG , with Judge PERSON presiding . The applicant and his lawyer attended the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The second hearing was held on DATE before the same judge . The applicant and his lawyer attended the hearing . The domestic court heard CARDINAL witnesses and ordered a report of experts in psychology from ORG ( Rodzinny O\u015brodek PERSON RODK \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the experts examined the applicant , PERSON and the child , who was DATE at the time . The report was issued on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The third hearing was held on DATE before Judge PERSON At this hearing , ORG decided to dismiss the applicant \u2019s request for the child \u2019s return ( III Nsm CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court ruled on the basis of the following evidence : testimony of the applicant , PERSON and the members of both families and the RODK experts\u2019 report .", "CARDINAL . The RODK experts were ordered to make the following assessment :", "\u201c whether moving [ the child ] into her father \u2019s care , linked with her separation from the mother , would disturb [ the child \u2019s ] sense of security and would affect her emotional state in a negative way ; or is it recommended , [ with a view to ] the adequate psycho - physical development of the child , to [ put the child under the father \u2019s care ] linked with [ giving ] an order to surrender the child by the mother . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The experts concluded that \u201c the child \u2019s return to GPE and her separation from the mother \u201d , her primary caregiver , \u201c would cause more emotional harm to the child than the lack of DATE contact with her father . \u201d In particular , the child \u2019s sense of security and stability could be disturbed . To this effect the report read as follows : \u201c Considering the [ young ] age and the sex of the child , it must be stated that the mother is currently best suited to satisfy her daughter \u2019s needs . \u201d", "The experts also noted that the child was emotionally attached to both parents ; she was developing well ; perceived GPE and GPE on an equal footing ; spoke NORP and had adapted well to her new life in GPE . It was recommended that the child should stay with her mother in GPE and have regular contact with her father .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court considered that the RODK \u2019s report was thorough , clear and of a high evidentiary value .", "CARDINAL . On the merits , ORG considered that it was called to examine \u201c the relationship between the child and [ each of ] the parents , her physical and psychological development and also , any [ possible ] physical or psychological harm [ which could occur ] in the event of the child \u2019s return to her father without the mother . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The domestic court attached importance to the young age of the child ( who was DATE and DATE at the time of the ruling ) and the fact that the mother had always been the child \u2019s primary caregiver . The reasons for the mother \u2019s refusal to return to GPE together with the child were not discussed by the domestic court . The district court held , relying on the PERSON report , that there was a grave risk of psychological harm if she were to return to GPE without her mother . It was noted that LAW ( b ) of LAW protected abducted children to such a great extent that it did not allow for their return if that was going to place them in a \u201c disadvantageous situation \u201d ( w niekorzystnej sytuacji ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing among others the following points of fact and law : the first - instance court ruled in breach of LAW ( b ) of LAW , firstly in that they concluded that in re was a grave risk that the child \u2019s return to GPE would expose her to intolerable psychological harm and would place her in a disadvantageous situation , and secondly in that they wrongly assumed that the child would have to be separated from the mother even though the latter had not cited any objective obstacles to her returning to GPE ; the first - instance court ruled in breach of LAW and its general directive that the best interest of the child be protected ; the facts as established by the domestic court contradicted the evidence produced in the course of the proceedings ; the court \u2019s conclusion that the child \u2019s return would expose her to intolerable psychological harm contradicted the findings of the expert report ; and the court should not have refused to adjourn the hearing at which the applicant was not represented by a lawyer .", "CARDINAL . At the appellate hearing , the applicant also argued ( CARDINAL ) that the experts in psychology who had drafted the RODK \u2019s report for the firstinstance court were incompetent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal ( IV Ca CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court fully relied on the findings of fact made by the first - instance court , and held that the child \u2019s return to GPE with or without the mother would place her in an intolerable situation ( \u201c w sytuacji nie do zniesienia \u201d ) . Firstly , in view of the child \u2019s very young age and the fact that since the retention the child had been under her mother \u2019s care practically round the clock and that her contact with the applicant had been rare , the child \u2019s separation from her mother would cause negative and irreversible consequences . Secondly , the child \u2019s return with her mother would not have a positive impact on the child \u2019s development either . To this effect , it was noted that PERSON had never adapted to her life in GPE ; she was in conflict with the applicant and her departure from GPE would be against her will and forced by the circumstances .", "CARDINAL . As to the remaining grounds of the applicant \u2019s appeal , the regional court ruled in the following manner : contrary to the applicant \u2019s impression , the RODK \u2019s report was clear and adamant in its conclusion that the child \u2019s best interest would be better served if she were allowed to stay in GPE with her mother ; in view of the fact that the applicant \u2019s lawyer had gone on holiday and the applicant had not agreed to be represented by a substitute lawyer , granting his motion for adjournment was not justified ; and the argument about the incompetence of the RODK \u2019s experts was , firstly , belated ( the applicant had not raised that issue before the first - instance court or in his appeal ) and , secondly , inconsistent with the applicant \u2019s reliance on the impugned report in support of his remaining arguments .", "CARDINAL . At the first hearing , held on DATE by ORG , the applicant \u2019s lawyer applied , expressly citing LAW of LAW , for arrangements for organising and securing the effective exercise of the applicant \u2019s right of contact during LAW proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The domestic court did not rule on that application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for a contact order in respect of the child . He did not rely on LAW . He asked , inter alia , for an interim order to be issued obliging PERSON for the duration of the LAW proceedings to allow him to take the child to his house DATE from TIME on DATE until TIME on DATE , and to talk to the child by telephone or ORG DATE TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , with GPE as the presiding judge , decided under LAW to stay the proceedings concerning the applicant \u2019s contact with the child until the end of the couple \u2019s divorce proceedings , which had been instituted before ORG on DATE ( III . NORP ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the divorce application lodged by PERSON ( IC MONEY ) was rejected by ORG , with PERSON as the presiding judge accompanied by CARDINAL lay judges . The regional court favoured the jurisdiction of the NORP courts because the last common place of residence of the couple was in GPE , GPE . On DATE the ORG , with GPE as the presiding judge , dismissed PERSON \u2019s interlocutory appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that when LAW proceedings had been pending in GPE , he had seen his daughter on several occasions , in the mother \u2019s house and in her presence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decision on the applicant \u2019s contact with his daughter . A copy of this decision has not been submitted to the ORG . It appears that the applicant was authorised to see his daughter the second and DATE of DATE ; during DATE ; during DATE and on selected DATE and GPE holidays . It appears that the applicant did not appeal against this decision .", "On DATE ORG , with GPE as presiding judge , confirmed that the above - mentioned decision was binding and enforceable as of DATE .", "CARDINAL .
