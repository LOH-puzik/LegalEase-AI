Initially , ORG ( its judgement is undated ) dismissed the action against the applicants . After an appeal by the heirs of Mr PERSON , PERSON PERSON and PERSON , on DATE the ORG overturned that ruling , allowed the rei vindicatio claim and ordered the applicants to surrender possession of the plot . It found in particular that the land commission \u2019s decision of DATE was sufficient to render the claimants the owners of the disputed land . It pointed out that of the CARDINAL rival claims to the same plot the law \u2013 namely section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW \u2013 gave priority to the CARDINAL based on restitution , and thus had the effect of rendering devoid of any legal force the contract under which the second applicant and the remaining applicants\u2019 predecessors had bought the plot .", "CARDINAL .
