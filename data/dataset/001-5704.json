FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE and currently resident at Muurame . He is represented by Ms. PERSON , a lawyer in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON , Director ORG , and Mr PERSON , Director , both of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant and P. are the parents and custodians of A. , born in DATE , and J. , born in DATE . In DATE the applicant started serving a prison sentence which was to DATE and DATE and had been imposed for attempted manslaughter , aggravated robbery , CARDINAL thefts and unlawful use of a vehicle ( all committed in DATE ) . From DATE to DATE the children lived with P. while she was serving a prison sentence .", "On DATE the children were provisionally placed in public care pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW ( lastensuojelulaki , barnskyddslag DATE ) . In her decisions ORG Director noted that , on DATE , P. had left the children with another person , who had brought them to ORG mother NORP , since they had not been picked up by P. as promised . NORP had considered herself unable to take care of the children . The Acting Director ordered the children \u2019s placement in a children \u2019s home in GPE , where PERSON and NORP would be able visit them in agreement with the staff .", "On DATE and DATE respectively , the applicant and PERSON consented to the public care proposals under preparation for ORG ( perusturvalautakunta , grundtrygghetsn\u00e4mnden ) of PERSON . The applicant \u2019s consent was limited to the children \u2019s temporary placement while he was serving his sentence . At a meeting on DATE concerning the terms of the care plan ( which the applicant had not been invited to attend ) P. agreed to visit the children CARDINAL times a week and to seek help in resolving her alcohol and other problems .", "On DATE ORG confirmed the care orders and the terms of their implementation . It noted , inter alia , that P. had repeatedly left the children in the care of others and had failed to pick them up as promised . According to the staff of the children \u2019s home , the children seemed particularly frightened and anguished . The applicant \u2019s prison sentence would last at least until DATE and PERSON was also expected to serve a prison sentence . PERSON had refused to acknowledge any problems and open - care assistance would in any case have been insufficient in view of the children \u2019s specific needs .", "During DATE the applicant called the children once DATE and they visited him in prison . He also visited them in the children \u2019s home in DATE and DATE when he had been granted his first leaves .", "At a meeting with social welfare officials on DATE staff of the children \u2019s home considered it to be in the children \u2019s best interests that they be transferred to a substitute family as soon as possible . The applicant had not been invited to attend the meeting and P. failed to attend it . On DATE , however , the applicant was heard in prison in respect of the social authorities\u2019 intention to transfer the children to a foster family . According to the social welfare official \u2019s notes , the applicant consented to such a placement provided it would last only up to his release from prison .", "By judgment of DATE the applicant \u2019s sentence was extended to DATE and DATE on account of his conviction on CARDINAL further count of robbery ( committed in DATE ) .", "On DATE ORG decided to place the children in a foster family . According to its investigations , P. had remained unable to assume their physical , mental and social development . As from DATE she had no longer visited the children as promised and had failed to respect her obligation under the care plan to seek treatment for her alcohol problem . From DATE to DATE she had had no contact with the children whatsoever and her whereabouts had been unknown . She had continued to face financial problems and had been evicted from her flat . In addition , the applicant would be serving a prison sentence at least until DATE . He had started serving his sentence when PERSON was DATE , whereas J. had been born during his imprisonment . While serving his sentence he had only been able to meet the children in prison . In DATE they had apparently visited him only once . They could no longer stand the constant change of nursing staff in the children \u2019s home and were in need of stable and secure human relations . The applicant \u2019s wishes could therefore not be considered when deciding on the further implementation of the public care .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of PERSON , claiming that ORG had failed to consider the possibility of returning the children to him on his release from prison . He referred to his regular contacts with the children during their placement in the children \u2019s home . ORG had omitted any reference to those visits . Contrary to the ORG \u2019s view the children had been developing well in the children \u2019s home . Starting in DATE the applicant would be granted a DATE leave DATE and he intended to use DATE of those leaves to see his children . In prison he was studying and practising to become a welder , which would enable him to support the children after his expected release on parole in DATE . He was therefore doing all he could to prepare himself to assume the care of the children . The mother \u2019s problems were also of a temporary character . If need be , the applicant would consider requesting sole custody of the children . At any rate , he would try to ensure the children \u2019s need of contact with their mother . The applicant furthermore submitted that he had not been notified of all documents which ORG had apparently relied on . He also requested an oral hearing .", "In its submissions to ORG stated , inter alia , that it had no proof that the applicant would be capable of assuming the children \u2019s care and upbringing . His prison sentence was expected to end at the earliest in DATE , whereas children of the age in question could not wait for DATE to have a parent .", "In his rejoinder the applicant objected to the social LOC apparent requirement that he should be rejecting PERSON It was not for the applicant to prove his ability to assume the care of his children , but for the authorities to prove the contrary . He further objected to certain case notes of the social welfare officials according to which he had , during a meeting with the children , \u201c pretended \u201d to be a tender and loving father . Another note proved that in DATE an official had told the applicant that the children would be placed in a foster family , \u201c where they could grow up to become adults while maintaining contact with their biological parents \u201d . The applicant therefore feared that any placement in a foster family would become irrevocable .", "P. also appealed against the decision of CARDINAL DATE , arguing that the children \u2019s transfer to a foster family had been decided without the authorities\u2019 having had appropriate time at their disposal for verifying her inability to assume the care and upbringing of the children and without affording her a reasonable opportunity to solve her problems .", "In respect of P. \u2019s appeal ORG submitted , inter alia , that the family conditions had been monitored from DATE and that her problems were not temporary in nature . P. had failed to respect the terms of the care plan which she had herself accepted . She had last visited the children in DATE and had interrupted her treatment for her alcohol problem .", "ORG afforded the applicant an opportunity to comment on ORG appeal as well as on the complete version of the social welfare officials\u2019 case notes , from which CARDINAL page ( concerning the period DATE ) had been missing . In his final observations the applicant agreed with the views put forward by PERSON further objected to not having been invited to attend the meeting on DATE for no good reason . Finally , since the statements made by staff of the children \u2019s home disclosed their negative attitude towards the applicant , those opinions should not be given any decisive weight .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeals , having found an oral hearing unnecessary . It considered , inter alia , that the manner in which the applicant had been heard in prison on DATE had not been such as to require that the ORG \u2019s decision be quashed . As for the decision to transfer the children to a foster family , ORG reasoned as follows :", "( translation from NORP )", "\u201c When a child has placed in the care of a social welfare board , the board is entitled to pursue the aim of that placement by deciding on the care , upbringing , supervision \u2026 and whereabouts of the child . In considering whether to amend the terms of \u2026 the public care the best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration . Given [ A. \u2019s and ORG ] age and their symptoms in the children \u2019s home , it is at this moment in their best interests that they be provided with [ foster ] care . Neither does [ such care ] prevent contact between the children and their [ biological ] parents . Accordingly , there is no reason to reverse the ORG \u2019s decision .", "In its decision ORG has not \u2013 nor could it have \u2013 decided on the children \u2019s permanent placement in [ a foster family ] . Under section CARDINAL of LAW a social welfare board must terminate the public care of a child when the need for [ such care ] as described in section CARDINAL \u2026 no longer exists , unless such termination would be manifestly contrary to the child \u2019s best interests . When considering [ those ] interests regard shall be had to the quality of the relationship between the child and his or her foster parents as well as the contacts between the child and his or her [ biological ] parents . \u201d", "ORG relied on LAW , section CARDINAL ( subsection CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL ( subsection CARDINAL ) of LAW as well as on LAW ( hallintomenettelylaki , lag om f\u00f6rvaltningsf\u00f6rfarande CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , requesting an oral hearing . He submitted , inter alia , that he was visiting the children during every prison leave and was telephoning them once DATE . In its observations on the appeal ORG stated , inter alia , that CARDINAL of its officials had informed the social worker of the applicant \u2019s prison that his presence at the meeting on DATE would not be required , since he had already been informed of the ORG \u2019s intentions and was to be heard on DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal without an oral hearing and ORG decision was upheld .", "Meanwhile , on DATE ORG had implemented its decision of CARDINAL DATE by placing PERSON J. in a substitute family at PERSON near GPE with the assistance of the association GPE lapset r.y . \u2013 PERSON r.f ( \u201c Save The Children \u201d ) . The applicant was allowed to see the children for TIME every third month . He apparently met them twice in the substitute family , once on office premises in GPE and once in a shelter for women and children in GPE . He continued to call the children once a week .", "It appears that DATE and DATE P. served a DATE sentence in GPE inter alia on CARDINAL count of robbery ( committed in DATE ) , CARDINAL counts of theft ( committed in DATE ) , CARDINAL count of fraud , CARDINAL counts of attempted fraud and CARDINAL counts of forgery ( all committed in DATE and DATE ) . She also served a DATE prison sentence in GPE ( inter alia for theft , attempted fraud and forgery committed in DATE ) . In DATE she was convicted of violent resistance against a public official , deprivation of liberty and escape from prison ( all committed in DATE ) . Her DATE prison sentence was commuted into community service ( yhdyskuntapalvelu , samh\u00e4llstj\u00e4nst ) .", "In DATE the applicant and PERSON married .", "In an opinion of DATE Dr PERSON , a child psychiatrist of ORG , concluded that PERSON \u2019s mental state would be incapable of surmounting any form of uncertainty , particularly as regards changes or losses in his human relations . This should be taken into account when considering meetings between A. and his biological parents as well as the public care as a whole . The opinion was based on interviews with NORP separately as well as together with his substitute parents .", "In DATE the applicant was released from prison and P. \u2019s parole ended . At a meeting on DATE for the purpose of updating the care plan social welfare officials and regional director ( social worker ) A.R. of Save The Children requested the biological parents to limit their telephone calls to the children to CARDINAL every CARDINAL or three weeks and to tell the children in clear terms that they would be able to remain in the foster family . The requests were justified in particular by A. \u2019s negative reactions after such telephone calls as well as by his perception that he might have to give up his foster parents . The biological parents agreed to the visiting arrangements so far implemented as well as to the further limitation of telephone calls . They had last visited the children in DATE and the next meeting would take place in DATE . A. was expected to receive individual therapy starting in DATE .", "In DATE the biological parents moved to the municipality of ORG , where their third child was born in DATE . They requested permission to visit GPE and DATE and to be able to telephone them once DATE . On DATE ORG maintained the restriction on contacts at CARDINAL meeting DATE and CARDINAL telephone call DATE . The biological parents were still allowed to send post cards . The restriction was to be in force until DATE . ORG based itself on Dr PERSON \u2019s opinion of DATE as well as on notes drawn up by PERSON", "The biological parents appealed , stressing that Dr PERSON \u2019s opinion was DATE and that the authorities had not investigated the reasons for A \u2019s symptoms . In any case the symptoms could not be deemed to have resulted from his meetings with the biological parents . The symptoms could have been caused by the severe access restriction or the various changes in the foster family \u2019s circumstances . Moreover , according to an opinion of DATE issued by CARDINAL officials of ORG of the municipality of ORG , no criticism could be expressed against the biological GPE family conditions which were furthermore stable .", "Among the evidence apparently adduced by ORG was a further opinion of Dr PERSON dated DATE . In an opinion of DATE Dr R.S. , a paediatrician , noted that the children and their biological parents had met DATE ( most recently in DATE and DATE ) on the premises of Save the Children or at an emergency shelter . The meetings had been supervised . The parents no longer had any prison sentences to serve and had solved their alcohol problem . The original family unit had not been sufficiently supported and meetings to that end had been prevented for no good reason . It had transpired from Dr PERSON \u2019s discussions with PERSON and Dr PERSON of ORG that the latter had not been in contact with the applicant and PERSON for DATE . The discussions had revealed a clearly negative attitude to the proposals of Dr PERSON for increasing the contacts and assessing A. \u2019s interaction with his biological parents as well as his need for therapy . Dr PERSON concluded that there were no obstacles to meetings between the children and their biological parents or to the ultimate revocation of the public care .", "At an oral hearing on DATE ORG heard the biological parents , the foster parents and a representative of ORG . The court ex officio took witness testimony from Dr PERSON and nursery director PERSON was heard at the Board \u2019s request , whereas the children \u2019s maternal grandmother NORP and the CARDINAL social welfare officials from the NORP municipality were heard at the request of the biological parents . Dr PERSON was not opposed to more frequent meetings as long as the children could feel certain that they would remain in the foster home . There was no reason to apply different restrictions to ORG director PERSON stated that A. \u2019s behaviour had improved significantly after DATE . According to PERSON , the children \u2019s hospital had been unwilling to commence A. \u2019s therapeutic treatment until he had rooted himself in the foster family . The foster mother , although maintaining her objection to meetings taking place in the foster home , considered that CARDINAL meeting DATE would \u201c tie down \u201d the foster family excessively .", "On DATE ORG reversed ORG decision as not being based on sufficient grounds . It ordered that GPE and PERSON be entitled to meet the biological parents once DATE and to speak with them over the telephone once DATE . The meeting LOC were to be defined by ORG . The court found it established that A. had displayed physical and psychological symptoms both before and after meeting with his biological parents which were placing him in a situation of conflict . The court did not , however , find it established or likely that more frequent meetings and other forms of contact would manifestly jeopardise A. \u2019s development . As it had not been established that his symptoms had been caused by the biological GPE behaviour during meetings , it had not been established either , nor was it likely , that fewer meetings and generally less contact would support his development . The court found PERSON written opinions and oral testimony contradictory . No reason had been shown for restricting meetings between PERSON and her biological parents .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s parole ended . On DATE the biological parents requested ORG to terminate the public care . According to the request , A. and J. had been able to meet them once DATE up to DATE , on premises assigned by a social welfare official or the foster parents . Normally the meetings had also been attended by the foster parents . In DATE the biological parents had requested that the number of meetings be further increased and that they take place in their home . On DATE they had been informed that the request had been refused and that the access restriction had been prolonged until DATE . It had been agreed , however , that through DATE the DATE meetings would be extended from TIME and would take place in the home of the biological parents . On CARDINAL DATE a social welfare official had informed them that the children \u2019s opinions in respect of the meetings would be ascertained at the child psychiatric clinic of ORG by hearing the foster and biological parents separately , both with and without the children , DATE . On DATE the dates for the DATE meetings through DATE had also been agreed . In a memorandum of CARDINAL DATE the child psychiatric clinic had stated that meetings between the children and their biological parents were important and should be organised in accordance with the children \u2019s best interests and capacity to adjust to them . This position had been repeated in an opinion of DATE by PERSON , a child psychiatrist at the clinic .", "In their request of DATE the biological parents recalled that the meetings had been discontinued during and after the child psychiatric examination in DATE . When they had wondered why ORG decision was no longer being implemented , PERSON had replied that it was no longer valid and that there was no obligation to organise meetings .", "The biological parents stated , moreover , that when meetings had taken place in the absence of the foster parents , the children had been behaving naturally and had shown confidence in their biological parents . The foster GPE hostile attitude to the biological parents had been reflected in the children \u2019s behaviour when the foster parents had attended meetings . When the foster parents had been present , the children had not spoken of their own initiative . Whenever the biological parents had been telephoning the children , they had been given the impression that they were disturbing the foster family . At a meeting on DATE a social welfare official had noted that no meetings had taken place since DATE due to the children \u2019s refusal to go with the biological parents when they had come to fetch them from the foster home .", "According to their submissions of DATE the biological parents had requested , on CARDINAL DATE , that meetings be allowed on TIME from TIME until DATE , following which the meetings should be extended until DATE They had further requested ORG to clarify what measures it had taken as from DATE for the purpose of fulfilling its obligation under LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW . At a meeting on DATE no consensus had been reached as to the future meetings . On DATE the ORG had restricted the meetings from DATE through DATE to CARDINAL meeting DATE lasting TIME . No clarification had been given as to how ORG had met its obligation under section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW .", "In their request of DATE the biological parents concluded that the foster parents had not fulfilled their obligation to secure ORG \u2019s and ORG right to a positive and close relationship with their biological parents . When the biological parents , in DATE , had requested more frequent contacts with them , the foster parents had referred to A. \u2019s behavioural disturbance . Since A. had been a client at ORG since DATE but his therapy had commenced only in DATE , the foster parents had also failed to secure his balanced development .", "In their request of DATE the biological parents finally submitted that they had recently found out that NORP and PERSON had been seeing their maternal grandmother NORP on a regular basis . As PERSON had not wished to have anything to do with P. , such meetings had not been , in the view of the biological parents , in the children \u2019s best interests . The social authorities had concealed the meetings from the biological parents and had failed to support the children \u2019s right to meet their paternal relatives .", "On DATE ORG refused to terminate the public care , as such termination would be contrary to the children \u2019s best interests , given their own wishes , the duration of the foster care and the quality of their relationship with their foster parents . ORG noted the children had expressed a wish to remain in the foster family . In order to support their development it was necessary to assure them that their current home and its permanent human relations would remain stable .", "The biological parents appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) of GPE , arguing that the ORG had not found termination of the public care to be \u201c manifestly \u201d contrary to the children \u2019s interests , only that those interests would be secured better through public and foster care . Even if ORG had not criticised the current conditions of the biological parents , they requested ORG to order an investigation into their situation . They also requested an oral hearing . The biological parents had previously appealed against the access restriction issued on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed both appeals after an oral hearing of the biological parents , the foster parents and officials of ORG . PERSON , PERSON \u2019s therapist as from DATE and CARDINAL other witnesses were heard at the request of the biological parents .", "ORG noted inter alia that ORG and ORG had been in public care for DATE from DATE and PERSON from DATE . Before their placement in their current foster family the children had been living in insecure conditions , first when cared for by their biological mother while the applicant had been serving his sentence , and subsequently while cared for in a children \u2019s home . During their stay in the foster family the children had met their biological parents seldom . For DATE there had been no contact whatsoever between the children and the biological mother . From then DATE it had been difficult to organise meetings with the biological parents as the children had opposed such contact and had stated that they did not trust them . Instead the children had become strongly attached to their foster parents . Any cutting of those ties would be harmful to the children . In such circumstances the termination of their public care would be manifestly contrary to their best interests .", "ORG did not find it established that the children \u2019s meetings with their biological parents had jeopardised their development . The meetings nonetheless had to take place in accordance with the opinion expressed by the children . They had repeatedly and clearly been opposed to very frequent meetings . According to PERSON , they had even been categorically opposed to meetings . On the other hand , no problems had occurred during actual meetings and the children had then considered them \u201c quite all right \u201d . The children \u2019s opposition to meetings had evidently been triggered in part by their fear of having to give up their foster family and return to their biological parents . This fear might also have been compounded by the biological GPE wish to see the children returned to them and by the foster GPE fear of losing them . It had not been established , however , that the children \u2019s opinion had been influenced in an inappropriate manner . In these circumstances the frequency of meetings requested by the biological parents would be manifestly contrary to the best interests of the children . Those interests required that the number of meetings be increased with their consent and gradually . Although finding no reason at this stage to amend the access restriction in force until DATE , ORG recalled that ORG was under an obligation continuously to support meetings and other forms of contact between the children and the biological parents .", "The relevant legislation is outlined in the ORG \u2019s judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . Those provisions of particular relevance to the present case are described below .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , ORG shall take a child into care and provide substitute care for him or her if ( a ) the child \u2019s health or development is seriously endangered by lack of care or other conditions at home , or if the child seriously endangers his or her health and development by abuse of intoxicants , by committing an illegal act other than a minor offence , or by any other comparable behaviour , ( b ) the measures of assistance in open care are not appropriate or have proved to be inadequate ; and ( c ) foster care is considered to be in the best interests of the child . PERSON care shall be provided without delay where it is needed and is in the best interests of the child ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) .", "If a child is in imminent danger or otherwise in need of an immediate care order and foster care , ORG may take him or her into care without submitting the decision to ORG for prior approval ( section CARDINAL ) . An emergency care order shall expire within DATE of the decision , unless referred for reconsideration under LAW of LAW . An ordinary care order pursuant to section CARDINAL must be issued within DATE , or on special grounds within DATE , of the emergency order . Both ordinary and emergency care orders may be appealed to the administrative courts .", "The child \u2019s custodians , biological parents and de facto carers shall be heard in respect of a proposal to issue or revoke a public care order or to place a child outside his or her original home . They shall further be notified of the decision taken ( section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , as amended by Act no . GPE ) . The hearing procedure is governed by LAW ( hallintomenettelylaki , lag om f\u00f6rvaltningsf\u00f6rfarande CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Under LAW of the said LAW a party shall be afforded the opportunity to reply to any claims put forward by others as well as to any evidence that may affect a decision to be taken . LAW does not lay down any minimum period of time which a party shall have at his or her disposal for preparing such a reply . A matter may be decided without a preceding hearing of a party inter alia if such a hearing would be manifestly unnecessary , would jeopardise the purpose of the decision or if the decision can not be postponed . LAW requires that the competent authority duly investigate the matter before it and ensure the equality of the parties .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW , a child who is being cared for outside his or her original home shall be ensured those important , continuous and secure human relations which are important for his or her development . The child is entitled to meet his or her parents and other close persons and to keep in touch with them ( subsection CARDINAL ) .
