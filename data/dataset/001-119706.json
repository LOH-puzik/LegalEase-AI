The treatment of patients with WHO Stage IV disease ( clinical AIDS ) should not be dependent on a CDCARDINAL cell count determination . However , where available , this test can be helpful in categorizing patients with Stage III conditions with respect to their need for immediate therapy . For example , pulmonary GPE can occur at any CDCARDINAL count level and , if the CDCARDINAL cell count level is well maintained ( i.e. > CARDINAL/mmCARDINAL ) , it is reasonable to defer therapy and continue to monitor the patient . For Stage III conditions a threshold of ORG has been chosen as the level below which immune deficiency is clearly present such that patients are eligible for treatment when their clinical condition portends rapid clinical progression ... For patients with Stage I or Stage II HIV disease the presence of a CDCARDINAL cell count < CARDINAL is an indication for treatment .", "In cases where CDCARDINAL cell counts can not be assessed the presence of a total lymphocyte count of CARDINAL or below can be used as a substitute indication for treatment in the presence of symptomatic HIV disease . While the total lymphocyte count correlates relatively poorly with the CDCARDINAL cell count in asymptomatic persons , in combination with clinical staging it is a useful marker of prognosis and survival . An assessment of viral load ( e.g. using plasma HIV-CARDINAL RNA levels ) is not considered necessary before starting therapy . Because of the cost and complexity of viral load testing , WHO does not currently recommend its routine use in order to assist with decisions on when to start therapy in severely resource - constrained settings . It is hoped , however , that increasingly affordable methods of determining viral load will become available so that this adjunct to treatment monitoring can be more widely employed .", "It should be noted that the current WHO Staging System for HIV Infection and Disease for Adults and Adolescents was developed DATE and has consequent limitations . Adaptations at the level of national programmes may therefore be appropriate . Nevertheless , it remains a useful tool for assisting in defining parameters for initiating therapy in resource - limited settings and thus has continued to be applied in this revision . \u201d", "Under these Guidelines , if CDCARDINAL testing was , at the time , not available , it was recommended that ORG be offered to patients with : ( i ) WHO Stage IV disease , irrespective of the total lymphocyte count ; ( ii ) WHO Stage III disease , irrespective of the total lymphocyte count , the recommendation to start ORG in all patients with stage III disease without reference to total lymphocyte counts reflecting , in the ORG \u2019s opinion , the consensus of expert opinion ; and ( iii ) WHO Stage II disease with a total lymphocyte count PERSON . A total lymphocyte count of \u2264 CARDINAL/mmCARDINAL could be substituted for the CDCARDINAL count when the latter was unavailable and HIV - related symptoms existed . It was not useful in the asymptomatic patient . Thus , in the absence of CDCARDINAL cell testing , asymptomatic HIV - infected patients ( WHO Stage I ) should not be treated because there was currently no other reliable marker available in severely resource - constrained settings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG also published \u201c HIV / AIDS Treatment and Care . WHO Protocols for countries of ORG \u201d . The Protocols provide that the initial evaluation of an HIV positive patient must , inter alia , include routine laboratory assessments ( haemoglobin , white blood cell count and differential , urinalysis , liver function tests , creatinine ) and a CDCARDINAL cell count .

In order to facilitate the rapid scale - up of ART programmes with a view to achieving universal access to this therapy , WHO emphasizes the importance of using clinical parameters in deciding when to initiate it . However , it is recognized that the value of clinical staging in deciding when to initiate and monitor ORG is improved by additional information on baseline and subsequent ( longitudinal ) CDCARDINAL cell counts . While WHO continues to advocate wider availability of affordable point - of - care CDCARDINAL cell count testing , the lack of a CDCARDINAL count should not delay the initiation of ART if the patient in question is clinically eligible . WHO encourages national programmes to increase access to CDCARDINAL measurement technologies ...", "Clinical staging is intended for use where HIV infection has been confirmed by HIV antibody testing .

Immunological monitoring ( CDCARDINAL testing ) is the ideal way to approach this situation . A baseline CDCARDINAL cell count not only guides the decision on when to initiate ORG but is also essential if CDCARDINAL counts are to be used to monitor ART ...", "The benchmark threshold marking a substantially increased risk of clinical disease progression is a CDCARDINAL cell count of QUANTITY . Although it is never too late to initiate ART , patients should preferably begin the therapy before the CDCARDINAL cell count drops to or CARDINAL cells / mmCARDINAL [ A - III ] . The optimum time to initiate ORG with a CDCARDINAL cell count of QUANTITY is unknown .", "Patients with CDCARDINAL cell counts in this range require regular clinical and immunological evaluation .", "The treatment of patients with WHO clinical stage CARDINAL disease should not depend on a CDCARDINAL cell count determination : all such patients should initiate ART [ A - III ] . For WHO clinical stage CARDINAL conditions , a threshold of QUANTITY has been identified as a level below which functional immune deficiency is present and ORG should be considered . This level also conforms to what is indicated in other consensus guideline documents . QUANTITY counts can be helpful in categorizing patients with stage CARDINAL conditions in respect of their need for immediate therapy . For example , pulmonary tuberculosis or severe bacterial infections can occur at any CDCARDINAL count level and it is reasonable to delay ORG and continue to monitor patients with CDCARDINAL cell counts QUANTITY .
