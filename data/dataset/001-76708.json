GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Impartial tribunal)", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and is at present serving a prison sentence in GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his suspected accomplice NORP were arrested in GPE in GPE on suspicion of having murdered PERSON On DATE ORG ( ORG ) issued an arrest warrant against the applicant . As the applicant objected to being extradited to GPE , he remained in detention in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE D. \u2013 the victim \u2019s adopted son \u2013 was extradited to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a chamber of ORG ( ORG ) , presided by judge ORG and also comprising judges PERSON and PERSON , convicted NORP of murder and of having committed robbery followed by death constituting CARDINAL single offence ( PERSON in GPE ) , and of attempted murder . NORP was found guilty of having murdered his adoptive mother PERSON , of having attempted to murder his adoptive father and of having robbed his adoptive GPE belongings . According to the findings of ORG , which were primarily based on the statements and admissions of the accused , these offences had been committed jointly with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The passages of the judgment establishing the facts of the case which refer to the applicant read as follows :", "\u201c PERSON , who was primarily interested in the loot , having been at first indifferent to the murder ... , consented to drive to GPE with the accused ... On the ground floor , GPE looked for an appropriate weapon . He removed the loose but stable handle from a big axe and handed it to the accused . Having in the meantime agreed to the murder , he did not want to run any risks . The accused could see that PERSON put a hammer weighing QUANTITY into his pocket in order to be prepared for any eventualities ... As PERSON and the accused feared the failure of their endeavour , the former approached PERSON , kept her mouth shut with a pillow and inflicted severe hammer blows on her head in order to kill her . The accused was aware of this because he knew that a human life counted for little with PERSON ... The accused credibly submitted to the court that he had informed GPE about his plan to murder his adoptive father , which left the latter indifferent because he was primarily interested in the loot . The chamber deduces from this submission that the accused knew that a human life counted for little with GPE ... Because of the blows inflicted by the accused , the chamber is convinced that the accused consented to PERSON \u2019s brutal actions , even if it meant her death , in order to reach his real aim to kill his adoptive father ... Because of the many heavy hammer blows on the victim \u2019s head , the accused was aware that PERSON wanted to kill the adoptive mother of the accused , at least in order to gain the prospected loot ... By following PERSON \u2019s request to keep PERSON at bay by dealing her a blow , the accused expressed his consent to PERSON \u2019s massive use of force and was willing to accept the action ... Cooperating with PERSON , the accused wanted to slay his sleeping victim , thus perfidiously exploiting his unsuspecting victim \u2019s defencelessness . Despite the accused \u2019s intention to commit the crime on his own , PERSON was so intensely involved in the planning and in the choice of a weapon that his actions did not merely constitute supportive measures , but an autonomous part of the action , the more so as the dominant PERSON pursued his own interest in the deed : to have access to the loot . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that this assessment of the facts followed essentially the accused \u2019s own submissions , who tried to place all responsibility on the applicant . Nevertheless , ORG found him guilty himself . It further considered whether it was necessary to hear the applicant \u2013 who remained at the time in detention in GPE \u2013 as a witness in the proceedings against NORP Having regard to the fact that the applicant had denied any involvement in the crime , the chamber did not expect that the applicant \u2019s testimony would yield any further information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was extradited to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the main hearing was opened before a chamber of ORG presided by judge PERSON and including judge PERSON ; both had already sat in the chamber which had previously tried NORP", "CARDINAL . At the opening of the trial , the applicant objected to the participation of judges PERSON and PERSON on the ground of possible bias ( Ablehnung wegen LOC ) . He argued that the passages in the court \u2019s judgment against NORP , seen from his viewpoint , but also objectively , were susceptible of raising doubts about the impartiality of these judges . On being informed that a chamber presided by judge DATE who had presided over the trial against DATE would decide about the objection , the applicant raised an objection against PERSON on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . On DATE judges PERSON and PERSON submitted their respective official statements ( dienstliche GPE ) on the objection . They pointed out that it would have been more satisfactory to try both NORP and the applicant in joint proceedings , as the same facts were concerned . However , this had not been possible as NORP had already been extradited on DATE and it could not be foreseen at the time when the extradition proceedings relating to the applicant would be terminated . Having regard to the necessity to expedite proceedings , the chamber found it appropriate to consider both cases in separate proceedings . During the main proceedings against NORP , the applicant had not been available to the court . The establishment of the facts of the case in the judgment against NORP were mainly founded on NORP \u2019s own submissions . In order to assess the extent of NORP \u2019s guilt , it had been essential to cast light on the applicant \u2019s involvement . As the chamber could only base its assessment on NORP \u2019s own submissions , they had been aware of the fact that their sources of knowledge were limited and that an assessment of the applicant \u2019s possible involvement had to be left to the main proceedings against the applicant . Both judges emphasised that they had neither reached a final opinion nor adopted an inner attitude which could negatively influence their impartiality towards the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the substitute chamber of ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s objection against the presiding judge PERSON It found that the simple fact that a judge had been previously dealing with the same facts in a case against another , subsequently convicted person did not suffice to justify an objection against that judge because an accused person would reasonably presume that a judge based his judgment exclusively on the outcome of the public hearing in the specific case . According to the court , an objection would have been justified only if the judgment of DATE had contained unjustified and degrading value judgments on the applicant . The court found this not to be the case , because it was clear from the judgment of DATE that the passages referring to the applicant were exclusively based on NORP \u2019s submissions , as the applicant himself , having objected to his extradition from GPE , had at the time not been available to the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the substitute chamber dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection against judges PERSON and PERSON for the same reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant , who had denied any involvement in the crimes , of murder and of having committed robbery followed by death constituting CARDINAL single offence and sentenced him to life imprisonment . According to ORG findings , the applicant had killed PERSON in order to cover up the robbery ; while NORP had approved of the applicant \u2019s actions . ORG based its judgment mainly on the applicant \u2019s own statements given both during preliminary investigations and during the main hearing , on incriminating testimony given by NORP , which the chamber followed only to a certain extent , and on corroborative evidence such as the analysis of traces found at the scene of the crime .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently appealed on points of law , arguing that judges PERSON and PERSON should have been excluded from the trial . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) rejected the appeal as unfounded , following a statement of ORG ( ORG ) which confirmed ORG reasoning on the issue of the impartiality of the judges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was represented by counsel , lodged a constitutional complaint in which he gave a complete account of the proceedings before the lower courts and alleged that the impugned decisions violated his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the NORP Basic PERSON and by the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The relevant passages of the complaint read as follows :", "\u201c LAW in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the German Basic PERSON , and LAW , guarantee that criminal cases shall be heard in a fair trial , without arbitrariness and , in particular , by an unbiased and impartial judge . According to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , a judge can be challenged for fear of bias if there is a justifiable reason to doubt his impartiality . This is the case if the accused , taking into account the facts known to him , has reason to believe that a judge \u2019s attitude towards him might negatively influence his impartiality and neutrality . In general , this fear can not be based on the mere fact that a judge has previously convicted another person who participated in the same crime and , on that occasion , ruled on the involvement of the accused . However , a different approach is urgently needed if a judge \u2019s behaviour in the previous proceedings ( or , similarly , his reasoning in a previous judgment ) justifies the fear of bias . In particular , negative value judgments about the accused \u2019s personality , or about his actions before or after the crime , may induce the accused reasonably to fear that a judge might not be impartial towards him in the new proceedings . It has been said of the person accused in the present case , who has denied his involvement in the crime , that a human life counted for little to him , that he acted brutally and used massive violence , and that he , as a dominant actor , made an autonomous contribution to the attempted murder of the adoptive father . On the basis of such value judgments , the accused does indeed have reason to fear that the judges , who were deciding for a second time on the same crime , whether consciously or unconsciously , would maintain their previous opinions ... . Comparing this case with ( one ) published in volume CARDINAL of the collection of the decisions of ORG , it is clear that the applicant has been exposed to a high degree of value judgments on his person and his actions . If CARDINAL were to apply the ruling of ORG to the present case , there would no longer be any possibility of removing a judge for fear of bias due to the decision in a previous case ... . Such a result is unacceptable for the person concerned , as has been sufficiently demonstrated . LAW ( impartial , unbiased judge and fair trial ) has been violated for the same reasons . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to accept the applicant \u2019s complaint for adjudication .", "CARDINAL . The relevant passages of that court \u2019s decision read as follows :", "\u201c The constitutional complaint is not accepted for adjudication because there are no grounds therefor . The constitutional complaint has no prospect of success , because it is inadmissible . Its reasoning does not meet the minimum requirements found in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , and section CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure of ORG . The applicant has to describe the alleged violation of a Basic Right and the proceedings leading to its violation in a substantiated and conclusive way ( cf . the decisions of ORG published in the official collection BVerfGE CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , [ at p. CARDINAL ] ; DATE , p. CARDINAL , [ at p. CARDINAL et seq . ] ) . The allegation that ORG rejected the objection against the competent judges on erroneous grounds does not meet these requirements , because not every rejection of an objection which is erroneous with respect to ordinary laws means that there is at the same time a violation of LAW . According to the consistent case - law of ORG , a violation of the right to a decision rendered by the legally competent judge ( ORG gesetzlichen Richter ) is only possible if the decision of the court on the objection is based on arbitrary considerations ( cf . BVerfGE CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , [ at p. CARDINAL ] ; CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , [ at p. CARDINAL et seq . ] ; CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , [ CARDINAL ] ) , or if the court has fundamentally misjudged the meaning and implications of LAW , second sentence ( cf . BVerfGE DATE , CARDINAL , [ CARDINAL ] , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , [ CARDINAL ] ) . Accordingly , a mere allegation that the objections have been rejected in violation of the ordinary legal provision of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW will not suffice to substantiate an alleged violation of the constitution . \u201c", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL", "\u201c An objection can be raised on the ground of fear of bias if there is a reason which may justify doubts on the impartiality of a judge . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL", "\u201c An appeal on points of law can only be based on the allegation that the judgment was based on a violation of the law . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL", "\u201c A judgment shall always be considered to be based on a violation of the law :", "... CARDINAL . if a professional judge or lay judge participated in the drafting of a judgment after he has been challenged for bias and if the motion for challenge was either declared to be well - founded or erroneously rejected ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of the German Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) provides that no one shall be deprived of his right to a decision rendered by the legally competent judge ( gesetzlicher Richter ) .
