The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , then aged DATE , was placed in pre - trial detention for TIME , following a criminal complaint made DATE by ORG , a girl aged DATE . She had complained that QUANTITY girls , also minors , had brought her to an apartment where they had hit her and forced her to have oral sex or sexual intercourse with the applicant and QUANTITY other boys , who were minors too .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of DATE the PERSON ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) placed the applicant and the CARDINAL other boys in pre - trial detention for DATE . ORG considered that this measure was necessary , given the aggravated circumstances of the alleged offence and the serious risk it posed to society , the dangerous character of all the defendants , and their attitude during the investigation . By a decision of DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) dismissed an appeal by the applicant against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was regularly extended , by ORG interlocutory judgments on DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE . ORG dismissed appeals by the applicant against these judgments on DATE , CARDINAL May , CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and DATE . The reasons given for continuing his detention remained the same throughout the proceedings , namely the seriousness of the offence , the sentence provided by the law , and the lack of any new circumstances justifying release pending trial .", "CARDINAL . Several incidents occurred during the proceedings related to the pretrial detention .", "CARDINAL . On the one hand , the appeal against the judgment of DATE was reviewed twice by mistake , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . By an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG rectified this mistake .", "CARDINAL . On the other hand , on DATE and CARDINAL and DATE , when the appeals on points of law were reviewed by ORG , the applicant was not brought before the judges . On each occasion the registrar of ORG had telephoned ORG , where the applicant was held at the time . According to the registrar \u2019s transcript , prison staff replied that it was not possible for them to bring the applicant to court because no such service for detainees was available on the dates in question ( \u201c nu exist\u0103 planificare pentru data de ... \u201d ) . At the hearings on DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant was represented by a lawyer appointed by ORG . The applicant had himself appointed a lawyer for the whole duration of the proceedings , but he maintained that the authorities had failed to notify his lawyer of the hearings held on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . His lawyer was only present at the hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to documents adduced to the file by the Government , on DATE , DATE and DATE as well as on DATE and DATE the applicant was absent from the hearings at which ORG reviewed his appeals on points of law against the interlocutory judgments extending his pre - trial detention . According to the registrar \u2019s transcript drafted on each occasion the reason for his absence was also given as the lack of such a service for detainees on the dates in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police heard D.A. in connection with her criminal complaint . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was not present during that questioning .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the police also heard the applicant and his CARDINAL co - defendants . The applicant declared that he knew both the victim and his co - defendants , whom he had met before . With regard to the victim \u2019s allegations , he declared that he had gone to the apartment with the sole purpose of giving her and CARDINAL of the other girls a lift home , and denied abusing the victim . He also declared that he had taken the victim home and had not noticed any signs of abuse on her .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s co - defendants made different statements : CARDINAL of the CARDINAL girls denied all the accusations and claimed that she had not seen the victim being abused ; the other admitted that she had seen the victim being abused by the other girl and some of the boys , but denied being responsible herself . She declared that after the incident \u201c she had heard \u201d that the applicant had had oral sex with the victim . The boys either denied the accusations or claimed that they had had protected sexual intercourse or oral sex with the victim , who had acted willingly . CARDINAL of the boys declared that the applicant had been in the same room as the victim and that on coming out of the room he had said that he had had oral sex with her and that she was not looking good ( \u201c ar\u0103ta r\u0103u \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , CARDINAL witnesses were heard . They confirmed that the applicant had been present at the apartment but claimed that they did not see or hear the victim being abused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the prosecutor attached to ORG and requested a confrontation with D.A. He claimed that during the investigations the victim had made inconsistent statements and implied that such inconsistencies made it necessary for her to be confronted with the defendants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor attached to ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request with the reasoning that the factual situation had been clearly established and a confrontation would not have been useful to the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor attached to ORG issued a bill of indictment against the applicant on a charge of rape . The prosecution held that the applicant had forced ORG to have oral sex with him while being aware that she was a minor , and that she had been abused by the others before he had arrived at the apartment where the events took place .", "CARDINAL . The case was registered with ORG . The applicant , through his lawyer , repeated several times his request for a confrontation with the victim for the contradictory aspects of her statements to be clarified .", "CARDINAL . On DATE D.A. was present before ORG , with her mother and her lawyer . She was not heard by the court with regard to her criminal complaint . She only declared that she had civil claims to make .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard all the defendants and the CARDINAL witnesses . The applicant again denied the charges against him . The girl who had previously declared that she heard that he had abused the victim changed her statement , and declared that she had not seen the applicant abuse D.A. ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . At the same hearing ORG agreed to the GPE request to cross - examine the victim . On DATE and DATE ORG ordered D.A. to attend the trial by virtue of a warrant to appear .", "CARDINAL . On DATE D.A. was present at the hearing of ORG . However , in application of the rules of procedure , she was not heard by the court because CARDINAL of the defendants , a minor , was in hospital and therefore absent ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . The court relied on the statements made by the victim before the prosecutor and those made by the applicant \u2019s co - defendants and the CARDINAL witnesses . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s statements , judging that they did not corroborate the other evidence or that they were inconsistent .", "CARDINAL . All the parties lodged appeals . The applicant relied mainly on the fact that he had not had a confrontation with ORG , who had purposely refused to appear before the courts . He claimed that her statements had not been supported by any other evidence , and that he should not be sentenced solely on the basis of the victim \u2019s complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal but allowed the prosecutor \u2019s and victim \u2019s appeals . The applicant was sentenced to a heavier sentence , of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The court did not address the applicant \u2019s arguments related to the absence of a confrontation with the victim .", "CARDINAL . Following appeals on points of law lodged by all the parties , on DATE ORG allowed the prosecutor \u2019s and the victim \u2019s appeals . ORG found that the lower courts had correctly assessed the evidence but that the clemency of the sentences did not match the gravity of the GPE acts . It therefore increased the applicant \u2019s sentence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed an extraordinary appeal by the applicant ( \u201c revizuire \u201d ) on the ground that the legal requirements for a reopening of the proceedings had not been met .", "CARDINAL .
