From TIME the applicant held a power of attorney from his adoptive mother , PERSON , and , on DATE , he was appointed administrator ( god man ) for her friend , PERSON . As both PERSON and PERSON became unable to care for themselves because of their advanced age , they were placed in a nursing home by GPE . The nursing home charged them for medical care and the applicant effected the relevant payments .", "When he subsequently realised that the nursing home was a charitable association , he stopped paying the fees on the ground that the institution in question was not entitled to charge them . A dispute arose between the applicant and the nursing home and the latter brought a court action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while the above - mentioned proceedings were pending , ORG the Board \" ) in GPE asked ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) in the same town to appoint an administrator for PERSON . The applicant , on his own and PERSON \u2019s behalf , filed a counter - claim and sought the immediate dismissal of the members of ORG . Referring to Article CARDINAL para .

The orders were made in the form of decisions ( beslut ) . He appears to have paid the fines .", "CARDINAL . In his written observations of CARDINAL DATE to ORG he stated , inter alia , that the ORG could be described as \" a basket of municipal rotten eggs of different colours with a common denominator and overriding ideology , namely fascism \" . Accordingly , the rights and legitimate interests of individuals within the municipality - if these were taken into account at all , so intoxicated were the authorities with power - were never given proper consideration amounting to an effective examination of the needs of the community . As a result , such needs were defined by so - called democratically elected \" peoples\u2019 courts \" - officially named \" boards \" and \" councils \" of the municipality of GPE - the members of which \" consist[ed ] to a surprising degree of the local public mob \" or \" pure rotten eggs \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG , considering the applicant \u2019s statements \" improper \" within the meaning of LAW , LAW , ordered him , at a sitting on CARDINAL DATE , to pay a fine of MONEY .

He expressed the opinion that the likelihood of his being granted leave to appeal was very small in view of the \" generally lethargic [ , ] ... lax and allergic attitude of the final instance \" , which resulted from the \" anti - human rights indoctrination received by its members during their many years\u2019 service in public administration \" .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , without holding an oral hearing , ORG confirmed ORG decision and ordered the applicant to pay a further fine of MONEY , finding that his written observations of CARDINAL DATE also contained improper remarks prejudicing the good order of court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then applied to ORG for leave to appeal , alleging that the lower and appellate courts had not only denied him a fair trial but had also violated his right to freedom of expression . Such leave was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , ORG , without holding a hearing , accepted the applicant \u2019s and PERSON objection against the ORG \u2019s request for the appointment of an administrator , but rejected their demand for the dismissal of the members of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , on his own and PERSON behalf , lodged an appeal with ORG , seeking to have the case referred back to ORG for reconsideration , as well as an oral hearing before the lower court .", "On this occasion , he asked that his case be heard by a specially composed ORG as he wished to have certain members disqualified from sitting . He alleged that CARDINAL of its members , whom he named , had a \" far - reaching tendentiously fascist way of presiding \" over the court and was \" grossly partial in favour of municipal interests , collegiate corruption and abuse of public power through high - handedness , terror and reactionary principles \" . When composed of the said judge and certain other members , who were also mentioned by name , ORG had been generally autocratic and had applied the law in a manner which had been heavily in favour of the municipal authorities .", "On DATE , in a separate decision from the one mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , ORG rejected the appeal . In addition , it again ordered the applicant to pay MONEY for improper remarks in his appeal . It did not hold a hearing .", "CARDINAL .
