NORP The chief inspector concluded , lastly , that the death of CARDINAL people and the injuries to CARDINAL others ( figures available at the material time ) on DATE had been caused by the CARDINAL mayors ' failure to take appropriate steps in the exercise of their duties and that they should account for their negligence under LAW .

Nor could he be blamed for not having rehabilitated the PERSON tip when none of the CARDINAL sites in GPE had been rehabilitated ; in that connection , relying on a number of measures which had nonetheless been taken by the city council , he argued that the tip could not have been fully redeveloped as long as waste continued to be dumped on it . Lastly , he submitted : \u201c the elements of the offence of negligence in the exercise of duties have not been made out because I did not act with the intention of showing myself to be negligent ( sic ) and because no causal link can be established \u201d between the incident and any negligence on his part .", "PERSON submitted that the groups of dwellings which had been buried dated back to before his election on DATE and that since then he had never allowed slum areas to develop .

In a judgment of DATE , the ORG found the CARDINAL mayors guilty as charged , considering their defence to be unfounded .", "In reaching that conclusion , the judges held as follows :", "\u201c ... although they were aware of the [ experts ' ] report , the CARDINAL defendants took no proper preventive measures . Just as a person who shoots into a crowd should know that people will die and , accordingly , can not then claim to have acted without intending to kill , the defendants can not allege in the present case that they did not intend to neglect their duties . They do not bear the entire responsibility , however . ... They were negligent , as were others . In the instant case the main error consists in building dwellings beneath a refuse tip situated on a hillside and it is the inhabitants of these slum dwellings who are responsible . They should have had regard to the risk that the mountain of rubbish would CARDINAL day collapse on their heads and that they would suffer damage . They should not have built dwellings QUANTITY from the tip . They have paid for that lack of foresight with their lives ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Basing its decision on the experts ' report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it found a direct causal link between the accident of DATE and the contributory negligence of the CARDINAL authorities in question . Accordingly , it ordered them to pay the applicant and his children GPE CARDINAL in non - pecuniary damages and TRL CARDINAL in pecuniary damages ( at the material time those sums amounted to CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively ) .", "The latter amount , determined on an equitable basis , was limited to the destruction of household goods , save the domestic electrical appliances , which the applicant was not supposed to own . On that point the court appears to have confined its assessment to the authorities ' submissions that \u201c these dwellings had neither water nor electricity \u201d . The court dismissed the remainder of the claim ; in its view , the applicant could not claim to have been deprived of financial support because he had been partly responsible for the damage incurred and the victims had been young children or housewives who had not been in paid employment such as to contribute to the family 's living expenses . The court held that it also ill befitted the applicant to claim compensation for the destruction of his slum dwelling given that , following the accident , he had been allocated a subsidised flat and that , even if ORG had not exercised its power to destroy the dwelling , nothing could have prevented it from doing so at any time .", "The court decided , lastly , not to apply default interest to the damages awarded for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL .
