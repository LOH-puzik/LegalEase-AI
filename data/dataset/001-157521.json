The investigator rejected the request as irrelevant to the robbery case .", "CARDINAL . Following the application by the applicant \u2019s counsel ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , investigator PERSON of the GPE prosecutor \u2019s office carried out a preinvestigation inquiry into the alleged illtreatment of the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

In particular , police officer PERSON stated that in the course of a \u201c conversation \u201d ( \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0434\u0430 ) which he had had with the applicant , the latter had suddenly jumped to his feet and hit his head against the wall , as a result of which his nose had started bleeding .

On DATE investigator PERSON held that the applicant \u2019s allegations of ill - treatment , in particular the claims that he had been struck \u201c in his kidneys \u201d and pushed so that his face had hit the wall and he had fainted , had not been based on real facts and that no criminal case was to be opened against police officers PERSON , PERSON . , PERSON , pursuant to LAW CCrP ( lack of the elements of a crime in the impugned acts ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prosecutor set aside the investigator \u2019s decision of DATE as unlawful and unfounded , on the ground that the circumstances in which the applicant had received his injuries had not been reliably established . He referred to the description of the applicant \u2019s injuries on his arrival in the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and his examination by the forensic medical expert ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He stated that the expert \u2019s suggestions as to how the injuries had been sustained made it doubtful that the applicant could have received his injuries as a result of a CARDINAL - off impact by his face against a wall . The prosecutor further noted that the applicant had explained that he would most likely be able to identify the police officer who had beaten him at the police station . However , it was not possible to carry out an identification parade and a confrontation in a preinvestigation inquiry . The prosecutor considered that it could not be ruled out that , after his arrest , the applicant had been subjected to acts of violence in order to make him confess to the crime . The applicant \u2019s version of his illtreatment by the police officers could only be verified by way of a full investigation . In order to do so it was necessary to open a criminal case , given that there was sufficient information disclosing elements of a crime under LAW CARDINAL ( a ) of LAW ( official misconduct with the use of violence ) . The prosecutor ordered that a criminal case be opened .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the ensuing investigation the police officers who had arrested the applicant were questioned as witnesses .

On DATE a deputy prosecutor of GPE set aside the investigator \u2019s decision and reopened the criminal proceedings . CARDINAL further decisions to terminate the proceedings were subsequently taken and then set aside as unfounded and based on an incomplete investigation . In CARDINAL of the decisions , dated DATE , the deputy prosecutor ordered that the inconsistencies between the statements of the police officers and that of the applicant be eliminated and that identification parades and confrontations be held , if necessary . When questioned again as a victim , the applicant stated , inter alia , that he remembered that police officer PERSON had hit his head against the wall and started punching him \u201c in the kidneys \u201d ( as stated in a decision to terminate the proceedings of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The most recent decision to terminate the proceedings for lack of the elements of a crime under LAW ( a ) of LAW in the acts of police officers PERSON , PERSON . and PERSON was taken on CARDINAL DATE . The investigator concluded that the applicant \u2019s allegations had been refuted by police officers PERSON and PERSON , who stated that the applicant had hit his own head against the wall ; by the record of his surrender and confession and the forensic medical report of DATE , in that the applicant \u2019s injuries could have been sustained as a result of impacts from blunt hard objects with a limited contact surface . It does not appear from the decision that investigative acts such as identification parades and confrontations with the applicant \u2019s participation were carried out .", "CARDINAL . At a preliminary hearing held by ORG on DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel requested that the record of the applicant \u2019s surrender and confession of CARDINAL DATE , on which the prosecution relied , be excluded from evidence pursuant to LAW ORG , as it had been obtained in the absence of a lawyer . ORG dismissed the request .", "CARDINAL . At his trial , the applicant pleaded his innocence and submitted that he had written his confession statement on the instructions of police officer PERSON as a result of physical and psychological coercion by the police officers ; in particular , police officer PERSON had beaten him \u201c in the kidneys and liver \u201d and his head had been struck against the wall so that he had fainted . He had not been informed of his right under LAW of the LAW not to give selfincriminating statements , as that part of the record had been added by police officers at a later stage . The applicant asserted , in particular , that on TIME of the robbery he had arrived at the commercial centre , by car and at B. \u2019s request , and had towed B. \u2019s car until its engine started , without knowing anything about the robbery . DATE PERSON had offered him gold jewellery , allegedly belonging to B. \u2019s acquaintance , for sale . The applicant had returned some of the jewellery to PERSON and kept the rest for himself . He had understood from police officer PERSON that the gold which he had received from PERSON had been stolen from the GPE district commercial centre . He had therefore told PERSON about the gold he had kept at his home .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s co - defendant Zh . pleaded his innocence , asserting that he had given self - incriminating statements as a result of his illtreatment by police officers , in particular by PERSON , who had allegedly beaten him up , kicked him and burned his fingers with a cigarette ; he also stated that after his arrest on CARDINAL DATE he had seen the applicant , on his knees and bleeding , at the police station .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s co - defendant PERSON admitted before the trial court that he had committed the robbery together with a certain PERSON . , and stated that the applicant and PERSON . were innocent . In particular , PERSON stated that on TIME of the robbery he had called the applicant , asking him for help because his car had broken down ; the applicant had arrived by car as requested , towed B. \u2019s car ( with the stolen property inside ) until the engine started and then left without knowing anything about the robbery . DATE , since he was experiencing difficulties with storing and selling the stolen property , PERSON had asked the applicant to look after the gold jewellery and to buy some of it if he wished . The applicant had agreed . PERSON also stated that he had not given any selfincriminating statements during the preliminary investigation , in spite of the physical violence used against him by the police officers , in particular by PERSON", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s wife stated , among other things , that on DATE of his arrest the applicant had been taken back to their home by the police officers in order for their flat to be searched . He had had an abrasion on his head , his lip was burst and his nose was swollen .", "CARDINAL . Police officer PERSON , examined by the trial court as a witness , stated that he and other police officers had arrested the applicant and his CARDINAL codefendants after PERSON \u2019s girlfriend had reported their involvement in the robbery . At the police station he had talked to the applicant about the robbery several times . The applicant had confessed , named his accomplices and expressed his readiness to surrender the stolen gold . PERSON had suggested that the applicant write a statement of his surrender and confession . The applicant had agreed and PERSON had asked his subordinates to prepare the necessary document . No violence or threats had been used against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Police officer PERSON stated that after the applicant \u2019s arrest he had taken the applicant to the police station . The applicant had been taken to PERSON \u2019s office and later PERSON had requested PERSON to obtain from the applicant a statement of his surrender and confession . The applicant had written down his statement and signed it . PERSON had not used any violence against the applicant . PERSON had come out of his office to register the statement with an officer on duty , while the applicant had stayed with police officer PERSON On returning to his office , PERSON had seen the applicant suddenly jump to his feet and strike his head against the wall . The applicant had fallen to his knees and started bleeding , \u201c probably from his nose \u201d . PERSON had given him a towel and asked whether he needed a doctor . The applicant had answered negatively . PERSON had then taken the applicant to his office again .", "CARDINAL . Police officer PERSON stated that the applicant had jumped to his feet and struck his forehead against the wall once and then had fallen to his knees . PERSON had wanted to call a doctor but the applicant had refused . He had given the applicant a towel because the applicant was bleeding . PERSON denied any violent behaviour on the part of the police officers .", "CARDINAL . Investigator PERSON stated that she had investigated the robbery case and had given instructions ( \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) to the police officers in the criminal investigation unit of the GPE police department . She had not instructed them to question the applicant or to collect a statement of his surrender and confession . Police officer PERSON had obtained the applicant \u2019s statement of his surrender and confession as a result of the applicant \u2019s free will . When questioning the applicant as a suspect ( on CARDINAL DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) she had noticed his injuries and asked if he had needed medical assistance , but he had refused .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel maintained before the trial court that the applicant \u2019s statement of his surrender and confession , which he had retracted on DATE when questioned for the first time in the presence of a lawyer , should be declared inadmissible evidence . She noted that investigator PERSON had drawn up the record of the applicant \u2019s arrest as a suspect on CARDINAL DATE . However , for unknown reasons she had not questioned him as a suspect on DATE . Instead , the police officers had obtained the statement of his surrender and confession on their own initiative , without any such instruction from the investigator . They had done so using psychological and physical coercion , as confirmed , inter alia , by the statements of Zh . and the applicant \u2019s wife ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , the certificate from detention facility GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and the forensic medical expert report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Furthermore , his confession statement had been obtained in the absence of a lawyer . Under LAW of the ORG , a statement of CARDINAL \u2019s surrender and confession was meant to be voluntary . Therefore , if obtained from a person arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime , any such statement should be subjected to particular scrutiny . Its voluntary nature was ensured through procedural guarantees under Articles CARDINAL ( \u201c The suspect \u201d ) and CARDINAL ( \u201c Compulsory participation of counsel for the defence \u201d ) of the CCrP. Otherwise , such a confession statement should be declared inadmissible evidence in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the CCrP.", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ORG held that the applicant \u2019s allegation that the statement of his surrender and confession had been given under duress was unsubstantiated . It relied on the statements by the police officers , denying any wrongdoing on their part ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , the investigative authority \u2019s most recent decision to terminate the criminal proceedings against them which , as ORG noted , had been taken in accordance with LAW and had not been revoked or quashed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and a report from an internal police inquiry which had dismissed the applicant \u2019s allegations of illtreatment .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that it had critically assessed the applicant \u2019s statements at the trial and concluded that they represented the position of the defence , in that they were aimed at evading criminal responsibility . Those submissions had been refuted by his and Zh . \u2019s statements of surrender and confession , as well as by the statements by the following witnesses : PERSON \u2019s girlfriend , who had provided hearsay evidence about the applicant \u2019s involvement in the robbery ; CARDINAL police officers who had participated in the applicant \u2019s and his co - defendants\u2019 arrest or the operative follow - up , in particular PERSON , and PERSON ; investigator PERSON , in charge of the robbery case ; Z.A. , who had denied seeing the applicant in the porch of his building on the night of the robbery ( where , according to her former boyfriend who had been heard by the court as a witness for the defence , she had spent time that evening ) , and her mother GPE , who had stated that Z.A. had not gone out after TIME ; and PERSON . , who had been an attesting witness during the search at the applicant \u2019s home during which certain items were seized .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that it had based its judgment on the statements of surrender and confession given by the applicant and Zh . , along with statements by the victims , the prosecution witnesses and other evidence . It found that on DATE B. , Zh . and the applicant had entered into a conspiracy to commit theft from the shops in the commercial centre . According to the roles agreed on between them , the applicant had remained on guard in his car outside the commercial centre , while PERSON and PERSON . had entered while the centre was still open and had hidden there . During the night they had attacked a woman guard and tied her up . Then they had forced locks and stolen property , in particular jewellery and mobile phones . The applicant had helped them to carry the stolen property out and load it into his car , in which they all had left .", "CARDINAL . ORG convicted the applicant of high - value theft with unlawful entry , committed in conspiracy by a group of persons , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In sentencing the applicant ORG took into account information about his personality , in particular that he had received positive character references from his places of residence and employment , and that he had no criminal or administrative offences record . It considered his statement of surrender and confession , the fact that he had CARDINAL minor children and that he had voluntarily surrendered the stolen gold jewellery , as well as his health condition , as mitigating circumstances . PERSON and Zh . were convicted of robbery with the use of violence and sentenced to DATE imprisonment respectively . ORG granted the GPE civil actions and ordered the applicant and his co - defendants to pay MONEY ( RUB ) jointly in respect of pecuniary damage . The ORG remaining claims were to be examined in separate civil proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his counsel appealed against the judgment . His counsel argued , inter alia , that the trial court had based its judgment on inadmissible evidence , in particular the statement of the applicant \u2019s surrender and confession of CARDINAL DATE , which had been given by him as a result of ill - treatment by the police officers and in the absence of a lawyer . She reiterated the arguments put forward before the trial court ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE examined the case on appeal . It endorsed in full the trial court \u2019s decision concerning the admissibility of the statement of the applicant \u2019s surrender and confession . It held , in particular , that the statement had been obtained in accordance with LAW . Under LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL of that Code , a statement of surrender and confession was a voluntary statement by a person about a crime committed by him . It had not therefore been necessary to have an instruction from an investigator in order to obtain it . The law did not provide for any additional requirements to such a statement , save that the individual concerned was to be warned of his or her criminal responsibility for deliberately giving false information . Therefore , the absence of a lawyer had not rendered the statement unlawful and had not violated the applicant \u2019s right to defend himself . He had been informed of his right under LAW , as confirmed by his signature on the record of his surrender and confession .", "CARDINAL . ORG of the Komi Republic further noted that the trial court had examined as witnesses all of the police officers who had seen the applicant at the police station with a view to verifying their implication in the alleged crime . They had all denied any wrongdoing . It had been established that , having written his confession , the applicant had suddenly jumped to his feet and hit his head against a wall . ORG also referred to the most recent decision by the investigative authority , dated DATE , by which the criminal proceedings against the police officers had been terminated ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and to the results of the internal police inquiry dismissing the applicant \u2019s allegations of illtreatment ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It upheld the judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel unsuccessfully raised the issue of the admissibility of the record of the applicant \u2019s surrender and confession in her requests for supervisory review of the case before ORG of GPE and ORG of GPE . The former court rejected it for the same reasons as before ( decision of a judge of ORG of GPE DATE dismissing the request , as endorsed by the President of that court on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG of GPE similarly stated that the applicant \u2019s argument \u2013 that the statement of his surrender and confession had been obtained in the absence of a lawyer \u2013 lacked a basis in domestic law , and that the allegation of the applicant \u2019s illtreatment at the hands of the police was unsubstantiated , as shown through its examination by the trial court which had heard the police officers , particularly PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( decision of a judge of ORG of GPE of DATE dismissing the request for supervisory review , as endorsed by a Deputy President of ORG on DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
