The ORG can normally only hear an administrative appeal if the appellant has a live ( present or future ) interest in taking proceedings . If the interest in taking proceedings has ceased to exist , the case becomes purely academic and must not continue unless special circumstances require a decision on the merits , for example where it would otherwise not be possible to give a binding ruling on matters of principle in time ...", "( a ) the PERSON community - antenna co - operative and its subscribers have only a contingent interest in taking proceedings , depending on whether ORG is going to resume broadcasting ; so long as there are no broadcasts , there is nothing to feed into the cable network . If it is highly unlikely that the broadcasts will be resumed , there is no need to examine the merits of the appeal .", "ORG claimed to have made all the arrangements necessary for restarting its broadcasts in the event of the present appeal \u2019s being held to have a suspensive effect ( or of its succeeding ) . That statement , however , was unsupported by any evidence , although the burden of proof is on the appellant in this regard and ORG \u2019s submission is open to serious doubt . The company claimed to have ceased its broadcasts - independently of the consequences of the station \u2019s having been struck by lightning - because of the PTT \u2019s ban on retransmission . Other reasons may have weighed more heavily , however . With the arrival of experimental local radio stations and a third frequency for ORG [ ORG und Fernsehen der deutschen und r\u00e4toromanischen GPE ] , the transmitter on ORG had to face serious competition , including that from ORG ; the transmitter \u2019s survival is accordingly no doubt in jeopardy irrespective of the ban on retransmission . That being so , ORG gratuitous statement that it was ready to resume its activities is not sufficient to prove that the PERSON community - antenna co - operative and its subscribers have a live interest in taking proceedings . It follows that there is no need to examine the merits of their appeal .", "The ORG does not need to determine the question whether there might be a live interest if the transmitter resumed or had already resumed its broadcasts , which are incompatible with international telecommunications law - subject to any contrary decision by the NORP courts and , possibly , by an international court of arbitration .", "( b ) For the same reasons there is no need to consider the merits of the appeal brought by ORG .", "The company can not plausibly maintain that if its appeal succeeded , it would resume its activities - which have been made impossible , short of new investment , by a storm that occurred after the appeal was brought - and would , furthermore , have the financial means to do so .", "Moreover , this case is a wholly exceptional CARDINAL . Transmitters which broadcast in contravention of national or international law can not usually survive for long . Matters are different as regards the PERSON transmitter only because proceedings are still pending in GPE and because hitherto none of the means of settling disputes provided for in LAW ... has been used . It is unlikely that a second case of this kind will arise , if only because of the doubtful profitability of such transmitters . There is therefore insufficient justification for determining , with an eye to the future , the issues raised by the case , some of which are extremely sensitive .", "In any case , even if it were to be held that ORG had a possible interest in taking proceedings , its claim to retransmit again , through the co - operative \u2019s cable network , its probably unlawful ... broadcasts , after resuming them , would not deserve the law \u2019s protection . \"", "Lastly , the court made an order for costs against ORG since its appeal could not succeed as the company had breached the law by attempting to circumvent a ban on retransmission that had been imposed by the PTT and that , moreover , did not concern it directly .", "CARDINAL .
