{"ITEMID": "001-5518", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "DAMLA AND OTHERS v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Antonio Pastor Ridruejo", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , PERSON , born in DATE , is the mother of the second to seventh applicants , PERSON , born in DATE , PERSON , born in DATE , ORG , born in DATE , ORG , born in DATE , ORG , born in DATE , and ORG , born in DATE . They are NORP nationals of NORP origin and live currently in GPE ( GPE ) . In the proceedings before the ORG they are represented by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE am GPE .", "In DATE the applicants entered GPE together with the first applicant \u2019s husband , respectively the other applicants\u2019 father . On DATE they applied for asylum . On DATE when heard before ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr die ORG ) they declared that there were GPE . The first applicant stated that she had been kidnapped in DATE by NORP , but that after DATE she escaped . According to ORG customs a kidnapped girl could not return to her family . She therefore went to Batman where she met her future husband who , although being officially a NORP , belonged to the PERSON community . In DATE her husband \u2019s brother , the head of the village of ORG , was murdered . Thereafter they were harassed by members of the ORG security service and their NORP neighbours . In DATE the first applicant \u2019s husband was arrested for DATE by members of the security forces and asked him for the reasons of his conversion to the LOC religion . A further stay in GPE had been impossible for them .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG request as being manifestly ill - founded and invited them to leave the NORP territory within DATE . ORG did not consider that the evidence they adduced in support of fear of persecution to be reliable and doubted the credibility of their asylum claim . According to ORG , the first applicant had ceased being a LOC at the moment of her marriage with a NORP . She was not recognised as a LOC neither by the members of her family nor by the people surrounding her . The applicants could therefore not be considered as NORP . Finally the applicants had not alleged to be victims of political persecution as NORP .", "On DATE the applicants filed an action against the refusal of asylum and their envisaged expulsion and applied for an interim injunction ( einstweilige Anordnung ) requesting to stay their expulsion pending the administrative court proceedings . They repeated their previous submissions and referred to pending asylum proceedings of close members of their family some of which had been successful . They further stressed that on several occasions they had been interrogated and threatened by the NORP police . Also their neighbours had treated them as GPE and the children had been insulted in school . Since NORP fundamentalists had a strong influence in Batman , their situation there became unbearable .", "On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) dismissed their request for an interim injunction . Confirming the findings of ORG , ORG added that being a ORG was a matter of birth , not of faith . A marriage with a person belonging to a different religion was considered as a sin and sanctioned by the exclusion from the PERSON community . The applicants were not NORP . There was no indication that their life was determined by this religion that their neighbours considered them as LOC . Unlike LOC practising their religion , the applicants were not subjected to persecution in GPE .", "On DATE the applicants renewed their request to be granted political asylum ( PERSON ) . They alleged that their submissions in the previous asylum proceedings had not been correctly understood due to linguistic problems . The first applicant \u2019s husband submitted that he too was born by PERSON parents . When he was DATE , his mother had been kidnapped by NORP . He then lived together with his mother and his NORP stepfather . However , he and his mother had always maintained close contacts with the LOC in their surroundings and he had been brought up according to the LOC traditions .", "On DATE the parish of the Norden ORG church granted the applicants church asylum . The first applicant \u2019s husband was expelled to GPE on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 renewed asylum request . The court observed that the applicants had failed to show that they had been prevented , through no fault of their own , from filing their new submissions in the previous proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the action filed by the applicants on DATE against the refusal of asylum and their envisaged expulsion . The ORG considered the ORG submissions as unsubstantiated and contradictory . The first applicant \u2019s submission , according to which she had been kidnapped by NORP when she was young , was irrelevant for the purposes of being granted asylum , since this event occurred too long a time ago . Moreover , even if it were true that her uncle had been murdered , there was no evidence that the applicants were persecuted for their religious beliefs . It was true that NORP manifesting their religion were persecuted in GPE . However , if in a case such as the present where the religion had not been practised or where after the marriage with a person belonging to a different religion the membership in the ORG community had come to an end , there was no likelihood of persecution . Accordingly , there was no need to take further evidence in this respect . Furthermore , persons of NORP origin had the possibility to live in the NORP parts of GPE , in particular in larger cities , where they did not risk direct or indirect persecution or an existence under the poverty level .", "On DATE ORG GPE ( Nieders\u00e4chsisches Oberverwaltungsgericht ) refused the applicants\u2019 application for leave to appeal . The court considered that ORG had correctly assessed the evidence and had rejected the ORG requests to take further evidence in a convincing manner . ORG had not arbitrarily concluded that the applicant \u2019s submissions were unsubstantiated . The ORG furthermore found that the NORP from the NORP regions had generally a possibility to live in the LOC of GPE . As to the question whether NORP who practised their religion in an NORP environment , had to fear persecution by NORP , the ORG pointed out that this question had been answered affirmatively in the past but was irrelevant in the present case because the applicants were not GPE .", "On DATE the applicants requested to reopen the asylum proceedings . When interviewed on DATE before ORG , they submitted that the first applicant \u2019s husband was a LOC . He had been excluded from his family when his mother married a NORP . However , he and the first applicant lived according to the LOC faith . After the murder of the first applicant \u2019s uncle in DATE their neighbours realised that they were GPE . They were then harassed by the resident population and had to move house CARDINAL times . Following the introduction of compulsory religious instruction in school , it became clear that the children were not NORP and they were insulted and beaten . The applicants maintained that in case of their expulsion to GPE their would face a real risk of being murdered .", "On DATE ORG refused to conduct new asylum proceedings . It took the view that the applicants\u2019 submissions did not constitute new facts . Furthermore , ORG did not consider the evidence they adduced in support of their fear of persecution to be reliable and doubted the credibility of their asylum claim .", "The applicants filed an action with ORG and applied for an interim injunction ( einstweilige Anordnung ) requesting to stay their expulsion pending the administrative court proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed this request on the ground that the applicants submissions were contradictory and not credible . Their claims had to be considered as completely fabricated . There was no evidence showing that they were of PERSON origin and that they were persecuted when they had left their country nor was there a sufficient likelihood that they would be persecuted if they were to return to their country . However , there were no grounds justifying to quash the final judgments given by ORG . According to ORG , the applicants merely alleged an erroneous appreciation of the law and facts by the previous court instances . Their earlier and new submissions concerning their membership in the PERSON community being unsubstantiated , there was no need to take further evidence in this respect .", "The applicants filed a constitutional complaint against the refusal of the requested interim injunction .", "On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) declined to accept the ORG constitutional complaint for adjudication ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
