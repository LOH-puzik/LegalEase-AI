In DATE , after his NORP citizenship had been restored , the applicant returned to live in GPE .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL concerning the organisation and practice of the legal profession , the applicant \u2019s reinstatement as a lawyer fell within its own field of competence and not that of the Bar . The ORG thus found that ORG had acted ultra vires in taking its decision of CARDINAL DATE . Furthermore , it declared that ORG decision of DATE , annulling the applicant \u2019s ineligible status , was illegal , having regard to the fact that it had been based on the unlawful decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE was never notified either to the applicant or to ORG . The decision was not communicated to him until DATE , when he was involved in other proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL .

During the proceedings , and following several hearings , ORG invited the applicant to attend a meeting organised by ORG on DATE . The applicant was informed at this meeting that ORG was willing to consider his application for a transfer , provided that he clarified his status with the ORG . He was then told that the ORG had annulled his reinstatement as a member of ORG .

On DATE the applicant filed an application with the ORG requesting the annulment of that decision and confirmation of his status as a lawyer and a member of ORG , by way of reparation for an abuse committed under the communist regime .

No information was given to the applicant as to the manner in which his status could be clarified in order to practise as a legally registered lawyer . Similar statements concerning alleged fraud on the applicant \u2019s part were made by the ORG during the proceedings before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings against the ORG before ORG seeking the annulment of the decision of DATE . In his application , he submitted that : following the entry into force of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , the ORG had had no power to annul ORG decision of DATE ; that , under LAW no . CARDINAL , its decision of DATE was invalid since it had been delivered after the DATE period prescribed by that provision and since only the courts had had jurisdiction to annul in DATE a decision taken in DATE ; and that , as regards the merits of his application , which the court was expressly invited to examine , in the absence of specific regulations indicating where to apply to remedy an unlawful administrative decision deleting him from the GPE list of lawyers , he had acted in good faith , according to the principles of administrative law , when he had lodged his application with ORG in DATE . The applicant pointed out that his administrative application of DATE to the ORG had not constituted a remedy . That case was joined to the proceedings against ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during a hearing before ORG , the applicant alleged that the decision of DATE had been unlawful since he had not applied to have his registration as a lawyer cancelled and , consequently , ORG had been entitled to adopt its decision of CARDINAL DATE in order to redress the abuse committed in DATE .", "The applicant submitted a number of questions to be answered by the ORG . The ORG replied to the question whether the fact that he had applied to ORG in DATE for the annulment of the DATE decision was unlawful : it considered that the applicant could have lodged such an application with the Bar , but that the decision to be taken fell within the ORG \u2019s exclusive field of competence . The ORG conceded that the legal basis of its decision of DATE was LAW ( j ) of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . As regards the DATE Bar and ORG fees paid by the applicant , the ORG replied that these were insignificant and that , according to the letter of DATE from ORG , the applicant provided legal services to many companies , but he had not established an office for that purpose , nor had he paid the PERCENT fees to the ORG social - security fund , thus committing fraud and unlawfully practising the profession of lawyer .", "At the same hearing , suspecting that the decision of DATE had been fabricated at DATE , namely during the proceedings before ORG , the applicant also requested that the ORG \u2019s original ORG be disclosed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court acceded to the applicant \u2019s request . However , on DATE it reversed its decision of DATE and ruled that the ORG did not have to disclose the original register . The court declared that , in the absence of a criminal complaint alleging forgery lodged by the applicant against the ORG , it was satisfied that the decision purportedly given on DATE had indeed been given on that date . The court \u2019s new position was due mainly to the production , by the ORG , of CARDINAL photocopies , CARDINAL being of an undated excerpt of the TIME of a meeting of DATE describing the procedure leading to the impugned decision , and the other being of another page of those minutes with no link to the applicant \u2019s case . Both these pages bore the stamp of the ORG and the signature of its secretary with the words \u201c certified copy \u201d . It is not clear from these documents how many pages the TIME of the meeting of DATE amounted to in all , who signed the TIME or who voted during that meeting .", "CARDINAL . The applicant formally objected to that ruling , insisting that it was not his intention to prolong the procedure by lodging a criminal complaint and that the register could easily be disclosed , given that the ORG shared the same building as the court . The applicant \u2019s objection was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during a hearing before ORG , the applicant replied to questions submitted by the ORG . He contended that he had not provided legal services since he had come back to GPE , that he had not practised as a lawyer with an established office and that , consequently , he had not paid PERCENT of his income required by PERSON no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application , holding that , pursuant to LAW no . ORG , ORG had acted ultra vires in taking its decision of CARDINAL DATE , and that , according to LAW ( \u201c the Rules \u201d ) issued by the ORG in DATE , the latter had been entitled to annul the decisions of local bars on grounds of illegality . As regards the fact that in DATE the applicant had lodged an application with GPE , considering himself entitled to be reinstated as a lawyer by the body that had unlawfully cancelled his membership with the Bar in DATE , the ORG noted that the DATE decision had been adopted on the basis of a request by the applicant himself .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the aforementioned decision of ORG , submitting that that court had not taken into account all the arguments and the evidence submitted . Accordingly , in his grounds of appeal he submitted that the court had erroneously found that he had been at fault for not lodging an application with the competent body in DATE for re - registration as a lawyer , given that he had applied in DATE , on the basis of Law no . DATE , to the body that had taken the unlawful and politically motivated administrative decision of CARDINAL DATE , although he had not requested to be deleted from the Bar \u2019s list of lawyers . Considering that he should not have had to request to be readmitted to the legal profession because he had been excluded from the ORG by a decision without any legal basis , the applicant had lodged the application with the issuing body , namely ORG , as there was no provision for specific proceedings to redress the effects of such unlawful administrative decisions . The applicant also submitted that , pursuant to the aforementioned LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which repealed Legislative Decree no . DATE , the ORG had no longer been competent in DATE to annul Bar decisions , and that LAW could not have supplemented that law . The applicant underlined that the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE had been illegal because the ORG had been time \u2013 barred in DATE , according to PERSON no . ORG , and because the legal basis for the decision , namely Legislative Decree no . ORG , had been repealed by PERSON no . CARDINAL .", "In his grounds of appeal and also in his written observations to ORG , the applicant added that , according to the documents in the file , the ORG had known since DATE that he had been registered as a lawyer by ORG in DATE , and that , in accordance with LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the ORG had at that time not only had the power but also the duty to review and possibly annul the decision of CARDINAL DATE by ORG . The applicant referred to the ORG \u2019s reply to the questions of CARDINAL DATE and concluded that , even supposing that the ORG should have been consulted in DATE by ORG on his re - registration as a lawyer , he was not to blame for lodging the application with that GPE or for the latter \u2019s or the ORG \u2019s failure to follow the proper procedure . The applicant requested the court to consider whether it was normal in these circumstances that he could not practise his profession in GPE , and asked it to annul the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE and to allow his transfer to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that , in DATE , Legislative Decree no . ORG had vested in ORG the exclusive authority to determine applications relating to the admission or readmission of lawyers to the Bar , and that the provisions of LAW ( g ) and ( i ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL should be interpreted as conserving these prerogatives .", "On the basis of LAW , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that PERSON no . PERSON had removed the ORG \u2019s powers under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL to annul Bar decisions , conceding nevertheless that in the text of this law such a power was not expressly maintained . As to the time within which the ORG had been entitled to annul the applicant \u2019s registration with ORG in DATE , ORG held that , given the issuing body \u2019s lack of jurisdiction , the annulment could have been decided upon at any time . Finally , ORG pointed out that the annulment of the applicant \u2019s registration with ORG on the ground of illegality did not remove his right to apply to the competent authority to decide on his application for reregistration as a member of the Bar .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant applied to ORG for registration as a lawyer registered with a foreign Bar , but to date he has not received any reply in spite of the fact that , according to him , in the interim ORG has approved the registration of CARDINAL foreign lawyers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined the applicant \u2019s request of DATE to ORG , the latter \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE and the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE , annulling the applicant \u2019s registration with ORG . The ORG decided to repeal its decision of DATE , to restore the applicant \u2019s previous status as a lawyer eligible to practise and to notify this new decision to him and to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s transfer to ORG , ordered his registration on that GPE \u2019s list of lawyers and decided to notify this decision to him and to ORG .", "CARDINAL .
