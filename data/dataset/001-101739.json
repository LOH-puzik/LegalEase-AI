CARDINAL of the co - defendants filed a statement of defence . The applicant alleged that it was impossible for him to do so since he had no knowledge of the evidence against him .", "CARDINAL . The indictment of CARDINAL DATE stated , inter alia , that in DATE a person described by the applicant as an anonymous witness had passed on certain information to the investigators . A record of DATE noted the informer \u2019s wish to remain anonymous , based on fears for his safety \u201c in view of the importance of his information and the media outcry that has always surrounded the [ ORG ] case \u201d . The person was never interviewed by the investigating judge . He had given the investigators information obtained in confidence from a person whose identity he refused to disclose .

Accordingly , in the present case it simply constituted information capable of giving fresh impetus or a new slant to the investigation and enabling lawful evidence to be gathered independently .", "When examined as witnesses at the trial , [ the CARDINAL non - commissioned gendarmerie officers ] stated that their informer was not CARDINAL of the defendants and had not personally witnessed any of the acts he described ; he had merely relayed information he claimed to have received in confidence from a person whose identity he refused to disclose .", "They also noted that some of the information supplied by their informer , relating in particular to other politicians mentioned in the submissions by counsel for PERSON ... , could not be corroborated by any evidence , despite their inquiries .", "...", "In the NORP view , the process of drawing up an official record of information given to them by an anonymous informer did not in itself constitute any infringement of the defence rights of the persons named by the informer . That step solely involved the disclosure , with a view to its analysis and verification , of information that might be of interest to the investigation and might assist in clarifying the facts . Viewed in isolation from any objective data that might subsequently confirm it , this information did not constitute evidence of the acts allegedly carried out by the persons whose identity was mentioned by the informer .", "...", "Lastly ... it is not possible to speak of a re - examination , seeing that it does not appear from the case file or the oral proceedings that [ the person described as an anonymous witness ] gave evidence under oath to an investigating judge .", "With regard to the application for an examination of that person , firstly , the court is unaware of his identity and , secondly , regardless of the considerations referred to by the judicial investigating bodies in that connection , such an examination does not appear useful for establishing the truth and would delay the proceedings needlessly without giving cause to hope for more certain results . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Those provisions leave it open to the trial court to appoint an investigating judge to that end if such a step appears useful for establishing the truth .", "The judgments take the view , on the basis of a factual assessment which this court is not empowered to overrule , that the examination sought would delay the proceedings needlessly without giving cause to hope for more certain results .", "The judgments also observe that the information obtained anonymously did not correspond to the evidence obtained lawfully and independently against the defendants .", "It does not appear from ORG reply to the ORG submissions that the trial court contested their right to rebut the evidence produced at the trial .", "On that account , these grounds of appeal can not be allowed .", "As to the remaining argument , LAW ( d ) of the LAW ... is not breached by the mere fact that the trial court considered it unnecessary or impossible to order the cross - examination of the anonymous informer whose disclosures provided helpful guidance for the investigation .", "On that account , these grounds of appeal have no basis in law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the Questions \u00e0 la ORG programme broadcast by ORG ( the ORG broadcaster for the LANGUAGE - speaking part of GPE ) in DATE , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants , ORG , stated that he had been the anonymous informer and had acted as a \u201c middleman \u201d on behalf of another co - defendant , GPE , whose accusations he had relayed . During the same programme , the identity of the anonymous witness was confirmed by the Minister of ORG who had been in post at the time of the events .

Following the CARDINAL French Revolution , the jury featured in DATE and LAW . At that time , GPE was part of NORP territory .

The jury was seen above all as a political affirmation of the freedom won by the people , the symbol of the people \u2019s sovereignty . It was instituted by the decree of DATE ; membership was initially based on function ( jury capacitaire ) and subsequently , from DATE , on property ( jury censitaire ) . By virtue of a Law of DATE , a new reform made the composition of the jury more democratic and representative of all social classes , the result being the CARDINAL - member lay jury that still exists DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Pursuant to LAW must read out the indictment and the defendant or his counsel the statement of defence . LAW states that the questions put to the jury must derive from the indictment ( which itself must be consistent with the judgment committing the accused for trial LAW CARDINAL of the ORG ) and must comply with certain formal requirements ; for example , questions that are complex or concern points of law are prohibited .", "CARDINAL . At the close of the oral proceedings , questions are put to the jury in order to establish the factors likely to lead to the precise determination of whether or not the accused is guilty as charged . The president of ORG is empowered to put questions to the jury on all the circumstances which might have an influence on the facts which served as the basis for the indictment , provided that these circumstances were discussed during the oral proceedings . The principal question concerns the constituent elements of the offence , while there must be a separate question in respect of each count . Separate questions regarding other facts , such as aggravating circumstances or the existence of any justification or mitigating factor , may also be put . The prosecution and the accused can challenge the questions and have the opportunity to ask the president to put CARDINAL or more additional questions to the jury . In the event of a dispute regarding the questions , ORG must decide by a reasoned judgment .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that , after asking the questions , the president hands them to the jury ; at the same time , he hands over the indictment , the reports establishing the offence and the documents in the file other than the written witness statements .", "CARDINAL .

The jury answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative , leaving the other questions unanswered .", "The judgment appealed against sentenced the appellant to DATE imprisonment for murder , on the basis of the verdict expressed solely by answers in the affirmative or the negative to the questions put in accordance with the law . The judgment states that there is no need to give any further reasons for the finding of guilt , on the ground that the precision of the questions adequately offsets the brevity of the decision .", "However , the bare statement that the appellant is guilty of murder and that there are no mitigating factors does not disclose the precise reasons why the charge , which the appellant denied , was found to have been made out , and does not enable this court to review , inter alia , whether the conviction was based to a decisive extent on the deposition by an anonymous witness incriminating the accused or was supported by other corroborating evidence in accordance with Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW .", "While conforming to NORP law , which does not require jurors to account for how they reached their personal conviction , the decision is contrary to LAW in so far as that provision may be construed as meaning that the right to a fair trial encompasses a statement of reasons for the verdict . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
