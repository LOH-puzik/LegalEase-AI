The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was employed by the ORG as an audio editor and interpreter . In this capacity he had access to classified information ( gerubriceerde informatie ) , which he was under a duty not to divulge to persons not authorised to have knowledge of it .", "CARDINAL . The suspicion arose that the applicant had forwarded copies of classified documents to persons outside the service , including in some cases persons who were under covert investigation by the ORG in connection with possible terrorist activity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested . He was charged with divulging ORG secret information to persons not authorised to take cognisance of it and taken into detention on remand ( voorlopige hechtenis ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG advised the applicant in writing that he was still under an obligation of secrecy . Consequently it would be constitutive of a further criminal offence if he were to discuss matters covered by his duty of secrecy with anyone including his counsel .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel were also warned that they might be prosecuted should they divulge any ORG secret information to third parties .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial opened before ORG ( rechtbank ) on DATE . It was adjourned several times .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s counsel protested against the restrictions affecting communication between themselves and the applicant , which in their submission undermined the effectiveness of the defence . They also asked for certain documents to be added to complete the file : these included the internal ORG report that was the basis of the prosecution , which was absent from the file altogether , and the documents which had supposedly been leaked , which had been added to the case file in redacted form with parts blacked out . They further repeated a request , made earlier in writing , for the applicant to be released unconditionally from his duty of secrecy in order to conduct his defence ( vrijwaring ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) announced that some but not all of the documents requested by the defence would be added to the file but refused to release the applicant from his duty of secrecy unconditionally .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision remitting the case to the investigating judge , to whom it would fall to carry out investigations in such a way as to mitigate , and compensate as far as possible , the handicaps under which the defence laboured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the ORG informed the applicant in writing that communication of matters covered by his duty of secrecy was permitted , subject to the following conditions :", "He would be allowed to discuss such matters only with his counsel , PERSON and Mr Pestman ;", "He was not allowed to reveal the identity of any ORG staff or human sources ;", "He could discuss only \u201c that which [ was ] contained in the case file \u201d ;", "This exemption covered only information that was strictly necessary for the defence ;", "This exemption was valid only until the final judgment in the domestic proceedings was given .", "The letter continues :", "\u201c In order to preclude any misapprehension I stress that this release from the duty of secrecy does not apply to the suspect \u2019s counsel . In the event that counsel wish to make use of information obtained from the suspect with a view to the defence of M , this must be done in consultation with the investigating judge . The investigating judge will then determine whether the ( answers to the ) questions are of any relevance to the criminal proceedings ( strafvorderlijk van belang ) . If this is the case , the ORG will then indicate to what extent ORG secrets are at stake in this context . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of the ORG wrote to the investigating judge in the following terms :", "\u201c ... I consider it of great importance that the suspect ( verdachte ) should be able to defend himself adequately against the matters of which he is suspected . This entails that he will have to consult his counsel for that purpose . To that end I have granted the suspect conditional release from his duty of secrecy . These conditions are necessary and serve the interest of national security . There exists a certain tension within these frameworks , i.e. a ( more far - reaching ) release ( as requested ) of the duty of secrecy and the interests of national security . After all , the ORG can only carry out its statutory duty within a certain measure of secrecy . CARDINAL criteria are of importance in this respect , namely that the ORG should be able to maintain the secrecy of its current levels of intelligence , its sources and its working methods . These are critical thresholds that can be seen as the practical implementation of the so - called \u2018 ORG criterion in the case - law of ORG .", "...", "... CARDINAL additional conditions apply :", "CARDINAL . NORP the release from his duty of secrecy granted [ the applicant ] shall apply solely to communication between the suspect , his lawyers PERSON and ORG , Public Prosecutor PERSON and the court , and", "CARDINAL . NORP shall take place within the confines of the offices of the Investigating Judge or in the presence of the trial court in a closed hearing .", "...", "The parties to the proceedings are to submit their questions and other requests to you [ i.e. the investigating judge ] . You then check whether the questions and requests are of any procedural significance ( strafvorderlijk belang ) in these proceedings , as you have indicated to me with regard to the CARDINAL subjects mentioned by counsel . In the affirmative , you offer me the opportunity to consider whether the text of the questions in itself can harm national security .", "In the ( probably most likely ) event that the questions in themselves can not harm national security , the answer can be provided in the accustomed way , i.e. by means of an official ORG report ...", "In addition , and if the parties to the proceedings consider it necessary , more specific answers can be given by means of , for example , the hearing of witnesses . Perhaps unnecessarily I would observe that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act ( FAC inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten ) applies .", "In the event that the line of questioning ( vraagstelling ) in itself is capable of endangering national security , it is my responsibility , pursuant to section CARDINAL of the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act , to ensure the secrecy of the information that should remain so and accordingly the classification of that information . I therefore propose that you do not place this information , after I have classified it , in the case file and to request ORG to deal with those questions at a closed hearing . I am of the opinion that the above procedural proposal serves the interests of all parties to the proceedings , taking into account the interests involved in national security .", "...", "The second condition , which is that the suspect should not be allowed to disclose the identities of ORG members or human sources , appears clear enough to me . All information that , whether or not in combination with other information , may lead to the identities of ORG members or human sources becoming known , falls within the scope of the second condition for release [ from the duty of secrecy ] .", "...", "As regards the third and fourth conditions , I am of the view that these too are sufficiently clear : [ the applicant ] is released from his duty of secrecy vis - \u00e0 - vis his counsel PERSON and PERSON in so far as consultation between the suspect and his counsel [ Dr ] PERSON and Mr Pestman relates to the crimes with which he is charged . In the event that counsel wish to discuss documents with the suspect which they may wish to add to the case file , the third and fourth conditions should be interpreted to mean that the documents must be relevant and directly necessary for the defence in this case and may possibly be added to the case file . [ These requirements of ] relevance and direct necessity also apply to the preparation of requests and defences .", "As to the latter condition : if and when such a procedure becomes a real possibility I will consider , if asked , whether release from the duty of secrecy , conditional or not , is possible .", "...", "Fourthly , you have asked me to react to the witnesses requested by counsel . I presume that you mean the ORG members . I am of the opinion that this is above all a matter of criminal procedure , the public prosecutor indicating in her letter that the questions counsel would like to ask relate primarily to the working methods of the ORG , the spreading of the leaked information and the internal investigation into this . I can agree with the position taken by the public prosecutor that these questions can most probably be answered by me or my deputy during a witness hearing . Whether and to what extent national security permits the questions to be answered will have to be seen for each question . This will require me first to have the questions intended to be asked at my disposal , so that the Ministers of Justice and of ORG and ORG can decide together and in due time on the application of section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act .", "As to the possible questioning of ORG members as witnesses , I would ask you to make it possible , in pursuance of Article CARDINALc of the Code of Criminal Procedure , for special access to be granted to an additional ORG member . This person can consider the interests of national security for each specific question during the interrogation . This will also permit the defence to put \u2018 sub - questions\u2019 , questions arising from the questions previously submitted in writing . The hearing of witnesses will thus , in my opinion , considerably speed up the pace of the proceedings \u2013 at least as far as the hearing of witnesses is concerned \u2013 since the ( additional ) ORG member present will in many cases be able to decide almost immediately whether the said sub - questions can be answered . This acceleration of the proceedings , in my opinion , benefits all parties to the proceedings . I am prepared to advise the Ministers of Justice and of ORG and ORG , on the basis of section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act , to consider this in any exemption decision .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision in which , following the public prosecutor , it refused to make the exemption unconditional . It expressed the view that it would serve no useful purpose to allow the applicant to disclose the identities of ORG staff members and informants to his counsel . The interests of the applicant were sufficiently protected inasmuch as the exemption covered information strictly necessary for his defence . ORG ordered the investigating judge to hear CARDINAL witnesses referred to by name and CARDINAL witnesses referred to by a code name or number . It refused to order the hearing of QUANTITY other witnesses referred to by a number and CARDINAL named witness immediately , leaving that decision to be taken by the investigating judge after a particular witness , an ORG staff member called PERSON , had been heard . As to the partially blacked - out documents , ORG noted that it too was thereby prevented from considering whether they held secret information within the meaning of Articles CARDINAL and FAC of LAW ( Wetboek van Strafrecht , see below ) ; even so , the prosecution interest in maintaining secrecy prevailed .", "CARDINAL . The named witness PERSON was heard on DATE and DATE . It appears that he refused to answer certain questions because of his duty of secrecy .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE the investigating judge decided to refuse to hear the CARDINAL witnesses requested by the defence for lack of available time ( agendatechnische redenen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge decided that the unnamed witnesses permitted to be questioned would be heard at a secret location , under heavy disguise and with the use of voice distorting equipment . A representative of the ORG and legal counsel of the ORG would attend in addition to the prosecution and the defence .", "CARDINAL . The defence lodged an objection against the investigating judge \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE with ORG , stating also that they would not cooperate in any witness hearing held at a secret location . They also asked for the named witnesses already heard to be relieved of their duty of secrecy and to be heard anew .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing in camera on DATE . The defence outlined its provisional strategy , which was to aim for an acquittal by identifying potential sources of the leaks other than the applicant and by demonstrating that the documents leaked did not contain ORG secrets properly so - called . They also wished to establish the applicant \u2019s attitude to his work for the ORG . This strategy required the applicant \u2019s former direct colleagues to be questioned and uncensored copies of the documents in question to be made available to the defence and the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave an order for CARDINAL further named witnesses to be heard but dismissed the defence \u2019s objection for the remainder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defence challenged CARDINAL judges of the trial chamber who had also taken part in the decision of DATE , arguing on various grounds that positions taken in the latter decision prejudged the outcome of the trial .", "CARDINAL . The following day , DATE , the challenge was dismissed and the trial hearing was resumed . The defence asked for documents to be added to the file , including all those found in the applicant \u2019s desk . ORG remitted the case to the investigating judge for the hearing of the witnesses authorised to be heard , in so far as they had not already been heard , and requested the prosecutor to add documents to the file including a description \u2013 to be prepared by the AIVD \u2013 of the documents found in the applicant \u2019s desk .", "CARDINAL . Witnesses were heard on various dates . In so far as they were unnamed ORG staff members , they were identified by a number ; they were heavily disguised and they were placed in a box that left only their upper body visible ; and their voices were distorted . The applicant states that it was impossible to discern their body language and facial expressions . He further states that an ORG official was present , who could \u2013 and did \u2013 prevent named and unnamed witnesses from answering a proportion of the questions put by the defence , and that this was permitted by the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . The trial hearing was resumed on DATE . Finding no indication that the ORG information had been leaked by someone else , ORG yet again refused to hear the named witness and the CARDINAL unnamed witnesses . As to ORG staff members who refused to disclose certain information based on their duty of secrecy , it stated that the final decision whether to allow this lay with the trial court itself but found that it could not set precise limits as the prosecution wanted .", "CARDINAL . The trial hearing was resumed on CARDINAL and DATE . The applicant made no statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial hearing resumed . The prosecution and the defence made their closing statements .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE . It convicted the applicant and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . The appeal hearing opened on DATE . Among other things , the applicant \u2019s counsel objected to the refusal , in the proceedings at first instance , to allow the defence an unconditional exemption that would allow the applicant and his counsel to communicate unimpeded ; to the hearing of unnamed witnesses under heavy disguise , in a closed box that partially hid them from view and with the use of voice distortion , even though they were the applicant \u2019s former direct colleagues ; to the withholding of evidence by the witnesses , based on their duty of secrecy as ORG staff members ; and to the withholding of documentary evidence requested by the defence . The prosecuting Advocate General ( advocaatgeneraal ) conveyed an offer by the ORG to allow an independent expert to see uncensored ORG documents and report on their content ; the expert proposed had previously been a member of a committee appointed to investigate the internal functioning of the ORG itself . The defence protested that this expert lacked independence precisely for that reason .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered an interlocutory judgment on DATE . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c The duty of secrecy arising from DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act Serviced Act is subject only to the exceptions set out in that LAW . The implication is that only the possibility offered by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that LAW offers a solution for the applicant \u2019s present predicament .", "The interests of ORG security , which DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act and LAW and following of LAW seek to protect , stand in the way of a complete release from the duty of secrecy as the defence would wish and a complete exemption from prosecution for disclosing ORG secrets to be granted by ORG . It is obvious that the said duty of secrecy constitutes a restriction of \u2013 normally entirely \u2013 free and confidential consultation between the suspect and his counsel and DATE if it remained in force in its entirety \u2013 it would prevent a fair trial . In the present case , the suspect has been granted conditional release from that duty by the ORG , based on the latter section of the DATE Intelligence and Security Service Act , as have his CARDINAL counsel . The conditions accompanying that release , all of which concern interests of ORG security in relation to interests of the defence in the present criminal proceedings , appear to ORG neither unreasonable within the framework of the interests of ORG security nor unworkable within the framework of the interests of the defence .", "...", "Finally , it is the case that if the suspect and the defence , if they consider that the space left to them by the said release is not sufficient to conduct a defence meeting the requirements of the LAW and they consider , in their assessment , that he / they have to transgress his / their duty of secrecy further than the conditions governing the release allow , they can plead justification ( rechtvaardigingsgrond ) , namely the interest of a proper defence within the meaning of LAW . The Advocate General gave the assurance at the hearing of DATE that no prosecution would be brought if a violation of the duty of secrecy by the suspect \u2013 and as ORG presumes , his counsel as well \u2013 was justified by invoking LAW . \u201d", "and", "\u201c ORG assumes that the defence request [ for access to the internal ORG investigation materials ] comprises all investigations undertaken by the ORG after it had become known that a third party , i.e. S. , possessed [ a copy of a classified ORG document ] . It does not appear from the file that these internal investigations were set out in any report . The case file contains criminal complaints ( aangiftes ) based on those investigations .", "It must be noted in the first place that the defence request does not concern documents in the possession of ORG within the meaning of LAW ; none of the participants in the proceedings is aware of the content of the internal investigations , save for what has been stated by witnesses in this respect , and what is set out in the said criminal complaints . There is therefore no violation of the principle of \u2018 equality of arms\u2019 .", "Quite apart from the question whether the ORG , given its duty and responsibility ... , would be willing to submit its report or any written documents concerning its internal investigation to the public prosecution service to be added to the file , the question needs to be considered whether these documents , which do not emanate from any investigatory body , can in reason be relevant to the defence .", "The defence has not , in the present case , suggested , let alone shown , that the materials compiled by the ORG within the framework of its internal investigation have been obtained unlawfully or are unreliable , but only that the documents and information provided by that service have been accepted uncritically ( voor zoete koek aangenomen ) first by ORG ( Rijksrecherche ) and then by ORG and can not be checked .", "ORG takes DATE without wishing to prejudge its final decision [ on the question whether the trial was fair ] \u2013 that the said materials can be assessed based on the statements of the witnesses questioned , albeit , as far as ORG members are concerned , subject to some restrictions owing to their duty of secrecy . \u201d", "It noted the \u201c particular tension between fundamentally opposed interests \u201d , namely the applicant \u2019s interest as a defendant in a criminal trial and the ORG interest in maintaining the secrecy of ORG information , but rejected the protests put forward on the applicant \u2019s behalf . The judgment took note of a promise made by the Advocate General not to prosecute for a violation of the duty of secrecy if that violation was justified by reliance on LAW ( gerechtvaardigd is door een beroep op artikel TIME ) . It asked the prosecution to submit certain official reports but not the uncensored ORG documents requested by the defence .", "CARDINAL . The appeal hearing was resumed on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant announced that he might , in his own defence , have to reveal ORG secret information . This prompted ORG to exclude the public from the interrogation of the applicant , despite the latter \u2019s protests .", "CARDINAL . In the course of questioning by his counsel the applicant mentioned the names of particular ORG staff members ; these are not recorded in the official record of the hearing . The Advocate General protested against the mentioning of these names in so far as they were not already to be found in the case file , which in his view was not justified by LAW , and announced his intention to prosecute if the applicant should \u201c transgress those limits \u201d ( mocht hij die grenzen overschrijden ) . The applicant \u2019s counsel replied that the defence needed these names in order to decide whether to call the persons concerned as defence witnesses and pointed out that the public had been excluded . After the president decided that the Advocate General should be entitled to state a view on the acceptability of questions put to the applicant by his counsel , the applicant stated that he would for the remainder of the hearing comply with his duty of secrecy . Thereupon the hearing was reopened to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel Mr Pestman sent the Advocate General a letter by fax , to which was appended a list of questions he and PERSON would have wished to ask the applicant in support of the case for the defence . These questions concerned ORG working methods and procedures and ORG members . CARDINAL question asked the applicant to identify individual ORG members on a handwritten anonymised organigram by name . Other questions asked the applicant to state the names of ORG members other than himself who would have had access to the documents found to have been leaked .", "CARDINAL . The hearing continued on DATE . The Advocate General announced his intention to prosecute the applicant should he answer questions naming ORG sources , providing an insight into ORG working methods or relating to the blacked - out parts of the redacted documents . Responding to protests by the defence , ORG referred to its interlocutory judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , in which it had stated that if the applicant considered a breach of his duty of secrecy in the interest of his defence he would , if prosecuted , be able to pray the right under LAW to defend himself in justification . The decision to prosecute , however , belonged to ORG alone to the exclusion of the courts .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal gave judgment on DATE . It quashed the judgment of ORG on the technical ground that ORG judgment could not be simply endorsed , convicted the applicant and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL .

That is apparent from the chapeau paragraph of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act , which imposes on ORG officials a duty of secrecy \u2018 without prejudice to ORG CARDINAL of the Criminal Code\u2019 . That obligation extends to \u2018 all information the confidential character of which he knows or ought reasonably to suspect\u2019 . Only a ministerial decision as referred to in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that Act can relieve the official of this duty of secrecy if he wishes to act as a witness . The legislature has thus placed the choice in the \u2018 conflict ... between the interests of ORG security , which may imperatively require certain sources or information to be kept secret , and the interest of establishing the material truth in , among other things , ... criminal PERSON [ reference to the statutory drafting history of an earlier Act , repealed by DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act , omitted ] in the hands of the said Ministers .", "...", "The above leads ORG to conclude as follows . In addition to ORG secrets within the meaning of LAW there are other matters that ( in the view of the ORG ) fall under the duty of secrecy of CARDINAL of the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act . ORG deduces , on the basis of what is laid down in CARDINAL of that Act , that that obligation ( in principle ) prevails over the duties of a witness in a criminal trial . ORG examination of the question whether an ORG staff member has rightly invoked his duty [ of secrecy ] is necessarily detached / marginal . Things are different where it concerns the question whether the right of the defence to question witnesses is materially impaired , it being relevant , in the opinion of ORG , whether the statement of that particular witness is used in evidence . \u201d", "and", "\u201c The interests of ORG security , which DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act and ORG and following of LAW are intended to protect , stand in the way of granting a complete exemption from the duty of secrecy as desired by the defence .", "It is obvious that the said duty of secrecy constitutes , to some extent , a restriction on \u2013 normally entirely DATE unimpeded free and confidential discussion between the suspect and his counsel and that \u2013 had it been in force unmitigated \u2013 it would prevent a fair trial .", "As ORG held in its interlocutory judgment of DATE , the duty of secrecy is subject only to the exceptions set out in the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act .", "This means that the situation in which the suspect finds himself in the present criminal case leaves only the avenue left by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the said LAW . \u201d", "and", "\u201c The Advocate General has given the undertaking , at ORG hearing of DATE , that [ the applicant ] shall not be prosecuted if a violation of the duty of secrecy by [ the applicant ] is justified by reliance on LAW , with due regard to the demands of proportionality and subsidiarity inherent pertaining to a legal defence ( strafuitsluitingsgrond ) .", "The conditions attached to the exemption aforementioned , all of which concern the interest of ORG security in relation to the interests of the defence in the present criminal proceedings , do not appear unreasonable to ORG within the framework of the interests of ORG security and in ORG opinion have done no relevant harm to the interests of the defence . \u201d", "and", "\u201c ORG can only answer the question whether the information in issue is to be considered \u2018 State secret\u2019 or as information relating to State security by referring to the texts , as contained in the file , of [ the documents concerned ] , to the extent that these documents have been added to the file in censored form as appendices to the ORG \u2019s official record of DATE , [ an uncensored e - mail relevant to CARDINAL of the charges ] and the explanations to these documents given by the ORG , especially as contained in the said official record of the head of the ORG of DATE and the official record of the acting head of the ORG of DATE , which latter report has been verified by ORG for Counter - terrorism ( NORP PERSON ) as appears from the latter \u2019s official report of DATE .", "ORG considers itself sufficiently able to determine the nature and character of this information on the basis of these documents , considered in context .

There is no statutory provision for an exception to the duty of secrecy laid down in CARDINAL of the DATE Intelligence and Security Services Act in the event that the official concerned is a suspect .

The guiding principle ( richtsnoer ) in so doing is whether , if this information can not be disclosed after all , there can still be a fair trial within the meaning of LAW .", "If the trial court reaches the finding that it is necessary , from the point of view of that LAW guarantee , to take cognisance of that secret information and the handicap for the defence [ resulting from not being able to disclose it ] is not sufficiently compensated by the procedure followed , it will have to determine \u2013 for example , by hearing the appropriate ORG official or officials on this point \u2013 whether the duty of secrecy is to be maintained intact in relation to that information .
