The applicants are brothers and sisters . Before the NORP occupation of GPE in DATE the applicants ' father owned QUANTITY of land ( \u201c the original land \u201d ) . The land was nationalised by the NORP authorities in DATE . Following the restoration of NORP independence in DATE , the applicants became entitled to a claim in regard to their late father 's land under LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested that compensation in land be given to them in accordance with the Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants changed their position , requesting that the original land be returned to them in kind . By letter of the administrative authorities of CARDINAL DATE the applicants were informed that part of the original land ( QUANTITY ) had already been allocated to a third person , PERSON , by decision of ORG DATE .

On DATE ORG upheld the first instance judgment . The applicants submitted a cassation appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a final judgment whereby it quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE . ORG concluded that the authorities and the lower courts had been responsible for the delays in restoring the applicants ' rights under LAW . It held inter alia :", "\u201c From the material in possession it appears that the plaintiffs submitted a request to restore their property rights on DATE . Pursuant to LAW ] , a decision on the request must have been adopted within DATE from DATE . ... [ The ] plaintiffs ' right to an effective remedy was [ therefore ] violated . ...", "The plaintiffs had submitted enough evidence [ enabling the administrative authorities ] to adopt a decision on restitution of their property rights , even more so as the case - file contains no evidence that other persons claim restitution of property rights in regard to the land which belonged to the plaintiffs ' father . ...", "Having regard to the fact that the plaintiffs ' property rights have not been restored since DATE ... [ further litigation ] would breach the plaintiffs ' rights guaranteed by ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered that the PERSON regional administration \u201c take a decision to restore the [ applicants ' ] property rights to the land which belonged to [ their father ] prior to the nationalisation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With respect to the applicants ' claim about the allocation of part of the original land ( QUANTITY ) to FS , ORG noted that in their original application for restitution of their property rights the applicants had asked for compensation , not for return of the original land , and that they had changed their claim only on DATE , i.e. DATE following the authorities ' decision of DATE to allocate the impugned portion of land to FS . ORG concluded that thus the applicants could not have this part of the original land returned to them . It also noted however that the applicants were entitled to compensation for the impugned portion of land in accordance with the provisions of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON regional administration made an offer to the first applicant to afford her compensation in land for QUANTITY of her late father 's former land that could not be returned in kind . The necessary formalities for the transfer of property rights to the first applicant have not yet been finalised as she did not reply to a number of the administration 's letters requesting her to sign the relevant papers .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the administration allotted the fourth applicant QUANTITY of land in compensation for the equivalent part of the original land that could not be returned in kind .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional administration made an offer for the fourth applicant to be allotted a further QUANTITY of land in compensation . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the regional administration made an offer to compensate the fourth applicant for a further QUANTITY hectares of her father 's former land . The formalities for the transfer of property rights to her in this respect have not yet been finalised as she did not reply to a number of the administration 's letters requesting her to sign the relevant papers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional administration made an offer to the second applicant to compensate in land for QUANTITY of the original land that could not be returned to him .

The Restitution of Property Act ( Nuosavyb\u0117s teisi\u0173 ... atk\u016brimo \u012fstatymas ) ( of DATE , amended on numerous occasions ) provides for CARDINAL forms of restitution : CARDINAL ) the return of the property in certain circumstances , PERSON ) compensation in other cases ( compensation can be made in land or money ) .", "On DATE ORG examined the issue of compatibility of the LAW with the domestic laws on restitution of property rights . In its decision ORG held inter alia that possessions which had been nationalised by the NORP authorities since DATE should be considered as \u201c property under the de facto control of the ORG \u201d . ORG also stated : \u201c The rights of a former owner to particular property have not been restored until the property is returned or appropriate compensation is afforded . The law does not itself provide any rights while it is not applied to a concrete person in respect of a specific property item . In this situation the decision of a competent authority to return the property or to compensate has such a legal effect that only from that moment does the former owner obtain property rights to a specific property item . \u201d ORG also held that fair compensation for property which could not be returned was compatible with the principle of the protection of property .", "In decisions of DATE and DATE the ORG emphasised that the notion of restitution of property rights in GPE essentially denoted partial reparation . In this respect ORG noted that the authorities of GPE as a re - established ORG in DATE were not responsible for the NORP occupation DATE , nor were they responsible for the consequences of that occupation . ORG held that since DATE many private persons had bought , in accordance with the legislation applicable at the material time , various property items which had been previously nationalised . The denial of these factual and legal aspects was impossible , and the domestic legislation on restitution of property rights duly took into account not only the interests of the former owners , but also the interests of private persons who had occupied or purchased the property under lawful contracts .", "On DATE ORG also said that the choice by ORG partial reparation principle was influenced by the difficult political and social conditions in that \u201c new generations had grown , new proprietary and other socio - economic relations had been formed during DATE of occupation , which could not be ignored in deciding the question of restitution of property \u201d .", "On DATE ORG ruled that a person who qualifies for compensation for property which can not be returned is entitled to choose the form of compensation ( land or money ) by giving written permission for the authorities to proceed with the decision . ORG also held that the executive authorities have discretion to decide on appropriate compensation in each case , but that a person is entitled to contest that compensation by way of a court action .", "Under LAW ( all versions until DATE ) , the authorities were required to obtain the written permission of the person concerned before they determined the actual compensation for the property which could not be returned .", "Pursuant to the version of ORG as amended from DATE , the executive authorities are now entitled to decide the question of compensation without the person 's approval . That decision can be appealed to a court in accordance with the procedure established in LAW . No stamp duty is required to file such an action ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
