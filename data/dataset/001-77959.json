The first applicant , Mr PERSON , and the second applicant , Mr Per PERSON , were born in DATE and DATE respectively and both live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the first applicant of illegal possession of a firearm and , with CARDINAL other co - accused , namely the second applicant and \u201c C \u201d , of possessing QUANTITY of amphetamines and attempting to import those drugs by ferry from GPE ( GPE ) to GPE on DATE . The first applicant was given a prison sentence of DATE , the second applicant DATE and C six years .", "CARDINAL . The summary of facts contained in ORG judgment took note of statements made to the NORP police by a fourth person , \u201c ORG , concerning transportation of the drugs from GPE to GPE by \u201c FAC ( the second applicant \u2019s nickname ) and another person . Before driving his car onto the ferry in GPE , T.A. was stopped by NORP customs officials , who found a total of QUANTITY of amphetamines in a rucksack and a bag in the car boot . Immediately after ORG arrest , NORP police officers travelled to FAC to take part in his questioning . PERSON was tried and convicted in GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its reasoning in the first applicant \u2019s conviction , ORG based its decision on circumstantial evidence , notably on his and his cohabitant \u2019s use of a mobile telephone , and its finding that there could be no doubt that the telephone in question , which used CARDINAL specific pre - paid card numbers , had functioned as a means of communication in the operation and had played a central role in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in separate proceedings , convicted a fifth person , \u201c D \u201d ( who had absconded to GPE but later returned ) , in relation to the same offences and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , the second applicant , C and D subsequently appealed to ORG , which decided to join the proceedings . Whereas D appealed only against the sentence , the other appellants appealed against other aspects , including the procedure , the assessment of evidence and the application of the law with regard to the question of guilt .", "CARDINAL . In the appeal proceedings before ORG , the prosecutor requested that D be heard first , before the other defendants , because the giving of testimonies in this order would be the most appropriate in the interests of elucidating the case and ensuring effective administration of justice . The applicants\u2019 respective defence lawyers protested against the order requested by the prosecutor . ORG considered that , since NORP was to give evidence on matters of relevance to his sentence , normal practice should be followed , which was to hear first those defendants who had appealed against the lower court \u2019s judgment as a whole . After C , the first applicant and the second applicant had given oral evidence , it transpired that D did not wish to give oral evidence . As to the procedure thereafter , the court record states :", "\u201c The prosecution asked , with reference to LAW , for permission to read out the depositions that the accused [ D ] had made to the police on DATE , DATE and DATE .", "[ D ] \u2019s defence counsel , Mr PERSON , had no objections to this . Mr PERSON , defence counsel for [ C ] , wanted the depositions to be read out . Mr ORG , defence counsel for [ the first applicant ] , did not wish to express any particular opinion on the right to read them out . Mr PERSON , defence counsel for [ the second applicant ] , opposed the reading - out of the police depositions . He argued that such a reading would be in conflict with the requirements of a fair trial laid down in FAC , and would also be in conflict with the minimum rights contained in LAW ( d ) of the LAW , namely the right of the accused to examine witnesses against him , inasmuch as he maintained that testimony from [ D ] at this stage of the case would have the nature of witness testimony .", "The ORG thereafter ruled as follows :", "The High Court finds that the reading - out of [ D ] \u2019s police depositions is permissible under LAW . Reference is made to the ORG commentary [ on LAW ] , volume II , page CARDINAL , from which the following citation is taken :", "\u2018 In ORG an appeal against the assessment of the evidence may be joined to a limited appeal ... During the appeal hearing , all the accused will normally be present . The reading - out of their previous depositions must be done in accordance with the rules of LAW , not LAW , even if the deposition to be read concerns a co - accused , that is , someone other than the person giving the deposition himself . The procedure is different when a former co - accused has had his case finally and enforceably adjudicated and is appearing as a witness in the case.\u2019", "The High Court finds accordingly and can not otherwise see that the reading - out of [ D ] \u2019s depositions will be in conflict with ... LAW ( d ) ... of the LAW . [ D ] has the status of an accused , and the High Court finds that this must be decisive even if he has lodged a limited appeal in the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second applicant \u2019s counsel then asked ORG to adjourn the proceedings in so far as the second applicant was concerned until a legally enforceable judgment existed with respect to D , so that D could be summoned as a witness with an obligation to testify . ORG rejected the request for adjournment .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor then read out D \u2019s statement , following which the second applicant \u2019s counsel asked to put a question to NORP He referred to the fact that in CARDINAL of his statements to the police D had stated that his deposition contained so many errors that he saw no point in going through it any further . In this connection , the court record states :", "\u201c The President of the ORG noted that [ D ] had invoked his right to remain silent , and that it would not therefore be permitted to question him directly , but that the President would ask [ D ] whether he wanted to testify , wholly or in part .", "[ D ] replied that he still wished to remain silent , including in response to the questions put by PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , noting that the jury had answered in the negative with regard to ORG criminal guilt and in the affirmative with regard to that of the other defendants , acquitted C and convicted the other defendants . It sentenced the second applicant and NORP to DATE imprisonment and the first applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . ORG judgment contained no summary of the assessment of the facts in relation to the jury \u2019s verdict , only a description of the facts in so far as relevant for sentencing , which was decided by the judges .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants appealed against the High Court proceedings to ORG ( the first applicant had also sought to appeal against the sentence but was refused leave to do so ) , which on DATE rejected their appeal , finding no incompatibility with the requirements of LAW and CARDINAL ( d ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . In his reasoning , approved in the main by the other CARDINAL justices sitting in the case , the first voting judge , Mr ORG , observed , inter alia , that CARDINAL difficulty for ORG in reviewing the appeal was that ORG , contrary to ORG case - law , had proceeded from the assumption that , as a co - accused , D had not been a \u201c witness \u201d for the purposes of LAW ( d ) of the LAW . ORG had therefore failed to carry out an assessment of the evidence according to the relevant criteria , notably the importance of ORG depositions in relation to other evidence in the case , although this would have been difficult to do at such an early stage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that extensive evidence had been adduced before ORG . The hearing had lasted for DATE during which CARDINAL witnesses had been heard . GPE evidence and statements related to the use of a number of mobile telephones connected to the case had been of central importance . It was difficult to say whether the statements by D , the only accused who had confessed to the offences , were an element of minor importance compared with the evidence seen as a whole . In his statements , D had implicated the second applicant and , probably indirectly , also the first applicant . However , his statements had not given any clear negative picture of the latter .", "CARDINAL . It would be inconsistent with the purposes of proceedings involving full examination at CARDINAL judicial levels if the evaluation of evidence carried out by ORG were to carry significant weight in the assessment of the evidence before ORG . In this regard ORG pointed to the fact that C had been acquitted by ORG and that the ORG judges had based their findings regarding certain points , in particular with respect to the transportation of the drugs from the GPE to GPE , on facts different from those relied upon by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG continued :", "\u201c The prosecutor has pointed out that in her directions to the jury the President of ORG had stated that , in her opinion , there was no question of \u2018 entirely dominant or crucial evidence against any of the accused\u2019 . I find it difficult to place particular weight on this factor . In addition , she had also said in her direction to the jury that in her view the depositions would be \u2018 CARDINAL of several elements in a consideration of whether the accused are guilty\u2019 ... As I see the case , I do not find it defensible to draw any particular conclusion as regards the police ORG significance in the overall evidentiary picture presented to ORG . In view of the state of the evidence at hand , it may indeed appear probable that D \u2019s confession was a more important element with respect to the other GPE convictions than was his deposition about their role . But the doubt that here obtains means that , despite the other important evidence in the case , I must regard it as \u2018 a real GPE that the reading - out of D \u2019s police depositions had \u2018 decisive significance for the overall assessment of the evidence\u2019 ( see PERSON . DATE ) .", "In those instances where there is a real possibility that the police statements would have a decisive influence on the assessment of the evidence , the reading - out of these would as a rule have to be refused unless the accused has had an opportunity to put questions to the witness ( see ORG . DATE - CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that in this case none of the defendants had had an opportunity to put questions to D either during the trial before ORG or at any time prior to the High Court proceedings . At ORG hearing D had availed himself of his right to silence . After his depositions had been read out , the President of ORG had , on a request by counsel for the second applicant , asked D again whether he wished to give oral evidence in full or in part . Thus the arrangement was that counsel for the other defendants should have an opportunity to put questions to D , but his unwillingness to give evidence had made a real examination impossible . Under NORP case - law , the requirements of LAW and CARDINAL ( d ) of the Convention would be met if the accused or his counsel were given a formal opportunity to put questions , even if the witness refused to reply , provided that the proceedings considered as a whole were fair . In this connection reference was made to PERSON v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ORG DATE ; and LOC v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG was satisfied that Article QUANTITY CARDINAL ( d ) had been complied with as the defence had had an opportunity to put questions to D during the trial , even though the latter had opted to refuse to answer those questions . When the cases had been joined , there had been no reason to believe that D would not reply to questions at the trial . A complicating factor had been the divergence of views among the defendants during the trial as to whether the reading - out of D \u2019s depositions should be permitted . To separate the proceedings regarding D and to postpone the trial concerning the other defendants until the case regarding D had been finalised ( and he could be required to answer questions as an ordinary witness ) would have entailed unreasonable consequences , both from the point of view of elucidating the case and of ensuring effective administration of justice , and would have enabled the defendants to obstruct and protract the trial unduly .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant provisions on the reading - out at a trial hearing of depositions made to the police may be found in LAW and CARDINAL of LAW , which deal respectively with depositions made by an accused and by a witness .", "\u201c Any reproduction in the court record or a police report of any statement that the person indicted has previously made in the case may only be read out if his statements are contradictory or relate to points on which he refuses to speak or declares that he does not remember , or if he does not attend the hearing . The same applies to any written statement that he has previously made in relation to the case . \u201d", "\u201c Witnesses who can give evidence that is deemed to be of significance in the case should be examined orally during the main hearing unless special circumstances prevent this .", "At such examination any reproduction in the court record or a police report of any statement that the witness has previously made in the case may only be read out if the witness \u2019s statements are contradictory or relate to points on which he refuses to speak or declares that he does not remember . The same applies to any written statement that the witness has previously made in relation to the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The above provisions are subject to limitations , which are not contained in LAW but follow from interpretations by ORG ( see , in particular , a decision of DATE , ORG . DATE ) in the light of the LAW case - law , which may be summarised as follows .", "( a ) As a general rule , witnesses must be examined \u201c at a public hearing in the presence of the accused \u201d .", "( b ) ORG may be made in special circumstances if , taken as a whole , the proceedings are \u201c proper and fair \u201d .", "( c ) The reading - out of depositions may take place if the accused or his defence is given an \u201c adequate and proper opportunity to challenge and question a witness against him , either when he was making his statements or at a later stage of the proceedings \u201d . Particular care should be exercised if a conviction is secured \u201c solely or to a decisive extent \u201d on the deposition .", "( d ) It is not a condition that the witness answer the questions asked by the accused or his defence .
