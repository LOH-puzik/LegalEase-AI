The first , second , third and fourth applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively . The second and fourth applicants are the first applicant \u2019s sons and the third applicant is his brother . The first , second and fourth applicants live in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . New political forces came to power in GPE ( \u201c the AAR \u201d ) in DATE , following the so - called \u201c Rose Revolution \u201d which occurred in the country in DATE ( see ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , who had previously held the posts of PERSON Deputy Minister of the ORG and President of ORG , was charged , amongst other offences , with abuse of authority and extortion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of the ORG initiated proceedings before ORG to confiscate wrongfully and inexplicably acquired property from the applicants under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c CAP \u201d ) ; the legislative provisions in question had been adopted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor affirmed that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the salaries received by the first applicant in his capacity as Deputy Minister of the ORG DATE and President of ORG DATE could not have sufficed to finance the acquisition of the property , which had occurred during the same time span , by himself , his sons and his brother .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecutor attached to his brief numerous items of evidence ( CARDINAL documents ) which showed that , on the one hand , the first applicant had earned CARDINAL and MONEY ( ORG ) respectively in official salaries when he had occupied the above - mentioned CARDINAL posts in ORG , whilst , on the other hand , the total value of the property that he and the other applicants had acquired corresponded to some EUR CARDINAL ( CARDINAL NORP laris ( GEL ) ) . The latter figure was based on the expert opinions of CARDINAL independent auditors who had conducted an assessment of the disputed property on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor therefore requested ORG to rule that the items of property concerned , which are listed below , should be confiscated from the applicants and transferred to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s property included :", "( a ) a house located at DATE FAC , GPE ;", "( b ) a house located at CARDINAL FAC , GPE ;", "( c ) the first floor of a house located at TIME , GPE ;", "( d ) a share in the capital of FAC , PERSON ;", "( e ) a ORG car ;", "( f ) a flat located at FAC , PERSON .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG accepted the public prosecutor \u2019s request for an examination on the merits . It transmitted the prosecutor \u2019s brief together with all the supporting documents to the applicants , inviting them to submit their written replies and attend an oral hearing scheduled for DATE .", "CARDINAL . As attested by the relevant postal acknowledgements of receipt , ORG subpoenas were duly served at CARDINAL applicants\u2019 home addresses , but only the second applicant , represented by legal counsel , filed written comments on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant submitted that the property mentioned at ( b ) above in fact belonged to him and not to the first applicant . To prove it he produced a contract of sale dated DATE , between himself and a certain ORG a document from ORG . He stated that he had purchased the property for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . His father - in - law , with whom the second applicant and his wife lived after they married , had helped him purchase the property . He produced a certificate from the bank stating that his father - in - law had taken out the loan , as well as statements by different witnesses .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant further explained that the property mentioned at ( f ) above belonged to Mr GPE , who was neither a close relative nor in any way connected with the first applicant . It was therefore not subject to confiscation .", "CARDINAL . As to the property mentioned at ( g ) above , the second applicant alleged that the first applicant had had no part in purchasing or renovating it and that he , the second applicant , was the sole owner . He had bought the property from a lady for ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL with the help of his godfather , PERSON , who had allegedly lent him MONEY ( ORG ) to renovate the site .", "CARDINAL . In sum , the second applicant requested that the properties mentioned at ( b ) and ( f ) and ( g ) above be removed from the confiscation list , and that due consideration be given to the evidence he had presented showing that the property concerned had not been wrongfully acquired .", "CARDINAL . As the first , third and fourth applicants failed to submit written arguments or appear before ORG on DATE , the latter decided to postpone the hearing until DATE . The relevant subpoenas were again duly served at those applicants\u2019 home addresses , but none of them appeared before the court , either in person or by designating an advocate , on the second occasion either .", "CARDINAL . ORG opened a hearing on DATE which the first , third and fourth applicants and their lawyers failed to attend , without giving reasons . It was attended by the second applicant \u2019s lawyer , who additionally pleaded that the property mentioned at ( d ) above also belonged to him , but that he was giving it to the ORG as a gift . In response , ORG changed the name of the defendant in that part of the case and named the second applicant as the owner of the property concerned . The second applicant further explained that in addition to the money his godfather had lent him , he had bought and renovated the property mentioned at ( g ) above with his salary as the director of a company in which he owned CARDINAL of the shares . According to TIME of that company \u2019s board meeting of DATE , the profit generated by its activities was EUR CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment in the absence of the first , third and fourth applicants , who had been notified twice but had failed to appear without good reason ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Thus , ORG ordered the confiscation of the property belonging to the first applicant listed under ( a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) , that belonging to the second applicant listed under ( d ) and ( g ) , and that listed under ( i ) to ( m ) belonging to the fourth applicant . It considered in particular that the sums of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL which the first applicant had earned as Deputy Minister of the ORG and President of ORG respectively could not have sufficed to acquire the property in issue , and that the other applicants did not earn enough either . The salaries the first applicant earned were only enough to provide for the needs of a family of CARDINAL . The court stated that the applicants , in particular the CARDINAL who had failed to appear before the court , had failed to discharge their burden of proof by refuting the public prosecutor \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . As regards the property mentioned at ( g ) above , ORG concluded that the second applicant had failed to prove the lawful origins of the money he had used to acquire the property , which had been valued by independent auditors who had assessed both the plot of land and the CARDINAL guest houses situated on it at no less than ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG of Ajara considered it established that the property mentioned at ( b ) above belonged to the second applicant and that the property mentioned at ( f ) belonged to a third party . The prosecutor \u2019s case concerning these QUANTITY properties was thus dismissed : concerning the first property , the court accepted the second applicant \u2019s arguments as to its lawful origins .", "CARDINAL . As regards the third applicant \u2019s property mentioned at ( h ) above , it was established that this was a family home unrelated to the first applicant \u2019s activities . However , as the property had been refurbished while the first applicant was in public office , making it worth ORG CARDINAL according to an official valuation , the third applicant was ordered to pay the ORG compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL applicants , represented by legal counsel , as well as the public prosecutor , appealed against the first - instance court \u2019s judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants requested that the confiscation proceedings be suspended pending the termination of the criminal proceedings against the first applicant . They complained that the burden of proof had been shifted onto them in the confiscation proceedings . The first , third and fourth applicants also complained that they had not been given an opportunity to submit their arguments before the first - instance court . The first applicant additionally complained that he had been denied the right to be presumed innocent in the confiscation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s wife asserted before ORG of GPE that she and her son , the fourth applicant , were the owners of the property mentioned at ( m ) above . She explained that she was a NORP national and had sold the family house in the GPE region , with her ORG consent , to buy the property in GPE , where her NORP relatives would spend DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a third party , Mr PERSON , applied to ORG of GPE , stating that the decision of ORG concerning the property mentioned at ( a ) above was unlawful because the property had previously belonged to him and was currently the subject of a dispute between himself and the first applicant . On DATE Mr Tchitchinadze sent ORG of GPE a decision of ORG dated DATE recognising him as the owner of the property in question . He requested that his property be removed from the confiscation list submitted by the public prosecutor ( for more details , see GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the CARDINAL applicants\u2019 legal counsel contended that the case concerning the first , third and fourth applicants should be remitted for fresh examination because the CARDINAL men had not been able to participate in the proceedings at first instance . He further complained that the evidence presented by the second applicant had not been given due consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE set aside the first - instance decision only in so far as it concerned the property mentioned at ( a ) above , the house located at QUANTITY in GPE , acknowledging that the estate was the property of Mr PERSON ( for further details see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) . For the remainder , it followed the reasoning of ORG , namely that the first applicant \u2019s income was not sufficient for him and his family members to have acquired the properties in issue , whilst the other applicants\u2019 income was also insufficient . Concerning the arguments of the first applicant \u2019s wife , ORG of GPE noted that the land register named only the fourth applicant as the owner of the property mentioned at ( m ) above .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged a constitutional complaint . He argued that LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , adopted on DATE , were contrary to the following constitutional provisions LAW CARDINAL ( prohibition of discrimination ) , Article CARDINAL ( protection of property ) , Article CARDINAL ( presumption of innocence ) and Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( no criminal punishment without law and prohibition of retroactive application of criminal law ) of the LAW of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In his constitutional complaint the first applicant mostly reiterated the arguments that he had previously submitted before ORG of GPE . In particular , he complained that the confiscation of his property and that of his family members amounted to a criminal punishment being imposed on him in the absence of a final conviction establishing his guilt , and that he should not have been made to bear the burden of proving his innocence , that is , the lawfulness of the disputed property . He also complained that the confiscation of the property in such circumstances was in breach of his right to be presumed innocent of the corruption charges . The first applicant also stated that he and his family had acquired the property in question well before the amendments of CARDINAL DATE were enacted and that , consequently , the retroactive extension of those provisions to their situation was unconstitutional . For those reasons , he argued that the confiscation procedure provided for by the impugned provisions of the ORG and ORG had been arbitrary and amounted to a violation of the constitutional guarantee of protection of his private property .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , after having heard the parties\u2019 arguments and evidence from a number of legal experts and witnesses , dismissed the first applicant \u2019s complaint as ill - founded on the basis of the following reasoning .", "CARDINAL . First , drawing an analogy with LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention , ORG stated that the NORP constitutional provision protecting the right to property ( LAW ) likewise did not exclude the possibility of deprivation of property if such a measure was lawful , pursued a public interest and satisfied the proportionality test . The court then went on to emphasise that only lawfully obtained property enjoyed full constitutional protection ; in the first applicant \u2019s case there had been a legitimate suspicion as to the lawful origins of the property , a suspicion which he and his family members had been unable to refute in the course of the relevant judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further stated that the administrative confiscation proceedings provided for in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG and LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG , could in no way be equated with criminal proceedings , as no determination of a criminal charge was at stake ; on the contrary , such proceedings were a classic example of a civil dispute between the ORG , represented by the public prosecutor , and private individuals . Given the \u201c civil \u201d nature of the proceedings in question , it was acceptable that the burden of proof in the proceedings should be shifted onto the respondent , the second applicant . Referring to its own comparative legal research and the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of PERSON GPE ( CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and ORG v. GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , ORG added that such civil mechanisms , involving the forfeiture of the proceeds of crime or otherwise unlawfully obtained or unexplained property , were not unknown in a number of NORP democracies , including GPE , GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . As to the issue of the alleged retroactivity of the application of the amendment of CARDINAL DATE introducing the administrative confiscation procedure , and the second applicant \u2019s presumption of innocence , ORG ruled that since the proceedings in question had been \u201c civil \u201d and not \u201c criminal \u201d , the above - mentioned criminal - law guarantees could not apply . Furthermore , the amendment of CARDINAL DATE had not introduced any new concept but rather had regulated anew , in a more efficient manner , the existing measures aimed at the prevention and eradication of corruption in the public service . In particular , ORG referred to LAW , which had required all public officials not only to declare their own property and that of their family and close relatives , but also to show that the declared property had been acquired lawfully .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the amendments of CARDINAL DATE undoubtedly served the public interest of intensifying the fight against corruption and that the test of proportionality had also been duly satisfied during the confiscation proceedings , which had been conducted fairly before the domestic courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-2"]}
