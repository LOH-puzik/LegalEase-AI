In DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) gave an interim decision that the father was to meet his daughter for TIME every other weekend under supervision . This arrangement continued for DATE but was disrupted for some time in DATE . According to the applicant , the child was often restless and talked strangely after the meetings with her father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave another interim decision according to which the father had a right to meet with his daughter for TIME at a time without supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an oral hearing about the custody and contact rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave both parents joint custody of the child . She was to live with her mother and to meet her father DATE from DATE and during the holidays , unsupervised . The meetings were , however , temporarily discontinued for the duration of the pre - trial investigation ( see below ) . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant claimed that after the third unsupervised visit with the father in DATE , her almost DATE daughter \u2019s behaviour changed radically and she was showing strong symptoms . The child was using vulgar language and was restless and anxious . The child had told her mother about things that her father did to her . She kept repeating these issues and suffered from increasingly bad nightmares . The applicant contacted a child psychiatrist .

The ORG replied that children DATE could not be interviewed within the forensic - psychological interview framework as it was not possible to obtain reliable information on possible sexual abuse from children DATE , especially in situations involving custody disputes . Such interviews became effective only in respect of children aged DATE or more .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a physiological examination was carried out to determine whether the child showed any signs or symptoms of the alleged abuse , but no such external signs were revealed .

After having received information about the conclusion of the pretrial investigation , the applicant contacted ORG on DATE and expressed her surprise that no psychological assessment had been conducted in the matter .", "CARDINAL . In a telephone conversation of CARDINAL DATE the applicant expressed to the social worker her fear that her child continued to be at risk of being subjected to sexual abuse when meeting her father and insisted on another investigation . She was concerned that the pre - trial investigation by the police had not been complete and that the social workers would be responsible if something happened to her child while the meetings with the father were not supervised . The social worker in turn explained to the applicant that the pretrial investigation had not brought to light any somatic signs or symptoms that would suggest sexual abuse of the child . Moreover , concerning the visiting rights , the social worker explained that the decision of CARDINAL DATE by ORG was still in force and that if the applicant was not satisfied with it , she would have to appeal against it in courts of law instead of complaining about it to the child welfare authorities . However , the applicant insisted on making the second report to the child welfare authorities , claiming that she had been threatened with loss of her custody rights if she did not allow the meetings with the father . The father of the child received information about this report from the police .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant also lodged a complaint with ORG ( eduskunnan oikeusasiamies , riksdagens justitieombudsman ) , asking him to investigate why the police did not hear her child during the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to take any measures as the police investigation was still pending before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He did not have competence to give orders to the police concerning the investigation of the matter as he could not examine the actions of private individuals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the regional ORG found that there was no minimum age for hearing a child and that the DATE agelimit for child psychiatric interviews was only a recommendation . The child had only been DATE and DATE at the time of the first police investigation . No new physical examination had been carried out during the second pre - trial investigation as such an examination had been carried out on CARDINAL and DATE . The ORG decided to take no action in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the father of the child asked the police to investigate whether the applicant had defamed him as she had given false information about him to the social worker on DATE , claiming that the child was in danger of being sexually abused by her father during their upcoming meetings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He claimed that these allegations were not true and that the applicant \u2019s motive for such accusations was that she wanted to have sole custody of the child and hamper the meetings between the father and the child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG pressed charges against the applicant for having insisted on DATE that the child was in danger of being sexually abused by her father after the police had already investigated the matter and , on DATE , found no appearance of any crime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of defamation and sentenced her to CARDINAL day - fines , amounting to MONEY ( ORG ) . She was ordered to pay the father LAW in nonpecuniary compensation and his costs and expenses amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The court \u2019s reasoning was the following :", "\u201c The insinuation made by ORG and referred to in the charges can not be understood to refer to any other person than [ the father of the child ] and it was made in a situation in which GPE knew about the decision of ORG to stop investigating the suspected sexual abuse of a child , which investigation had been initiated solely on the basis of the information submitted by her . According to the decision , the investigation did not reveal any such evidence on the basis of which the threshold of \u201c reason to suspect \u201d would have been attained . The decision refers to the somatic examination of the child , requested by the police and conducted on DATE by a specialist in paediatrics at which GPE was also present . According to the medical certificate , the girl \u2019s somatic status was normal and there were no external signs of sexual abuse .", "From the medical certificate of DATE , which was admitted as written evidence , it appears that the meetings between the father and the child had been supervised until DATE and that thereafter until the filing of the police report on CARDINAL DATE and the freezing of the meetings , there had been unsupervised DATE meetings CARDINAL times , lasting TIME each . [ The father of the child ] stated that out of these few meetings CARDINAL meeting had taken place in an amusement park , which was not disputed by PERSON stated that the sexually - coloured talk of the child had started already during the supervised visits . At that time the child was DATE .", "On the sole basis of the meeting circumstances and the medical examination , GPE could not have had strong grounds to consider that her insinuation of the crime was true , even if the child had said what she was alleged to have said . Nor could the child \u2019s other , more general symptoms have given sufficient confirmation of her insinuation .", "When assessing whether one is guilty of defamation , it is irrelevant that the act has been committed by pursuing an earlier report to child welfare authorities and that it has been made to a public official who is bound by confidentiality . Even in a child welfare report one must not give untruthful and smearing information or insinuations about others . GPE must have understood that the insinuation was of such a kind that in any event it would come to the knowledge of [ the child \u2019s father ] and that its content , being almost of the worst kind , was bound to cause him suffering .", "...", "Ignorance of legal provisions does not eliminatebasis for considering that ORG \u2019s act could be regarded as manifestly excusable due to a mistake .", "On the basis of the grounds expressed above , ORG considers that GPE did not have any such reasons to make an insinuation towards [ the father of the child ] that she would have had a reasoned ground to do so without defaming him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment of ORG to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) . She claimed only to have voiced her previous concern as the child was not heard at all during the concluded pre - trial investigation . Her concerns were not directed at the father but at the fact that a danger to the child \u2019s health still existed . It had been the child welfare authorities who had qualified these concerns as relating to sexual abuse . Sexual abuse did not always leave physical marks which could be revealed by medical examination but it was a grave procedural mistake not to interview the child during the pre - trial investigation . She considered this mistake to be so substantial that the danger to her child \u2019s health still existed despite the outcome of the investigation . She also referred to the case PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG upheld the ORG judgment . The court found the following :", "\u201c On the basis of the oral hearing held , ORG has no reason to assess the evidence differently than ORG . The acts committed by GPE [ ... ] fulfil the constituent elements of defamation , criminalised by LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW . The fact that the insinuation was made to a public official who is bound by confidentiality is not relevant when assessing the constituent elements , as appears from the ORG precedent CARDINAL . GPE [ ... ] did not have sufficiently strong grounds to hold the information true in a situation where [ she ] knew that the pre - trial investigation into [ the child \u2019s father ] had terminated . Although child protection considerations have to be taken into account , a conviction in these circumstances is not in contradiction with freedom of expression which is protected as a fundamental and human right . PERSON has considered that she is free from criminal liability under LAW , section CARDINAL , of the Penal Code due to a mistake as to the unlawfulness of her act as she had mistakenly regarded her act as lawful because of a reason similar to erroneous advice given by public officials . The pretrial investigation had , however , been started solely on the basis of information given by GPE and this investigation was already terminated , GPE being aware of it , before the commission of the present act . Therefore there are no grounds to apply the provision concerning mistake as to the unlawfulness of the act . Nor is there any reason to change ORG judgment as far as the conviction is concerned . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
