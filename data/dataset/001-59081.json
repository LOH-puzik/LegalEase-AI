The facts of the case , particularly concerning events on DATE when PERSON , the applicant \u2019s son , was shot dead by police officers firing through the door of his apartment during a search operation in PERSON , were disputed by the parties . The Commission , pursuant to former LAW ( a ) of the LAW , conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties .", "The Commission heard witnesses in GPE from DATE . These included the applicant ; PERSON , his daughter - in - law and widow of his deceased son ; PERSON , his son ; PERSON , the applicant \u2019s nephew ; CARDINAL neighbours , PERSON and ORG ; PERSON , the PERSON district gendarme commander , who set up the operation on DATE ; PERSON , leader of the special operations team which opened fire ; PERSON , PERSON , ORG , ORG and PERSON , members of the team ; PERSON , PERSON police superintendant , and police officers PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who attended the scene of the incident ; PERSON and PERSON , PERSON public prosecutors involved in the investigation ; PERSON , ORG public prosecutor , who attended the autopsy ; PERSON , GPE public prosecutor involved in the criminal trial of the QUANTITY police officers who opened fire ; PERSON , gendarme lieutenant who gave an expert opinion to the court in the criminal trial ; PERSON , a police operations expert who gave an opinion in the trial ; and PERSON , the provincial governor of ORG , who authorised the operation .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s findings of fact are set out in its report of CARDINAL October DATE and summarised below ( Section A ) . The applicant accepts the ORG \u2019s findings of fact . The Government \u2019s submissions concerning the facts are summarised below ( Section B ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was a small town , of CARDINAL people , located QUANTITY from ORG in the south - east region of GPE . It was close to the LOC dam which was perceived as a possible target for the ORG ( ORG ) . A company of commandos was stationed there . There was no evidence that ORG activity was particularly prevalent in PERSON itself or that there were any significant security problems .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , a business - man and an official in the local branch of ORG , was well - known in PERSON and a respected citizen , unsuspected of any illicit activities . His son PERSON was less well - known , running a petrol station for him . There was no evidence prior to the events of DATE that he was suspected of involvement with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Major G\u00fcder , the provincial gendarme commander , received a telephone call from an informant , naming CARDINAL terrorists and indicating the addresses in PERSON where they could be found . Major PERSON informed the provincial governor PERSON at TIME . The governor authorised the search operation proposed by Major PERSON to locate the terrorists and the allocation of personnel from ORG to assist , who were to be chosen by the ORG police chief PERSON .", "CARDINAL . A meeting was held on TIME , at TIME , at the district gendarme headquarters to plan the search operation , attended by the district governor , Major PERSON the district gendarme commander , the deputy police chief of PERSON ( PERSON ) and possibly a number of other local police officers . The information given at the meeting did not clearly emerge in the evidence before the Commission - the names and code names of the terrorists who had been seen were mentioned and a number of addresses . As a large number of addresses were searched during TIME , the search was wider than the addresses originally mentioned by the informant . The basis on which those addresses were chosen was not established . PERSON had not been named as CARDINAL of the terrorists by the informant and the reason why his apartment was to be searched was not provided in any of the written or oral evidence .", "CARDINAL . TIME , a special operations team of CARDINAL officers , assigned by the LOC police chief , arrived in PERSON . The acting team leader was PERSON . The team members were briefed by their leader . Their recollection of what they were told varied considerably . It appeared however that they had been given a strong indication that ORG terrorists would be likely to be present at the address . No instructions were given to them about the use of their weapons or the tactics to be used to gain entry to the apartment if there was resistance . No details were given concerning the other people who lived in the G\u00fcl apartment block . The ORG found insufficient evidence to support the allegation of the applicant that the special operations team was assigned and instructed for the purpose of carrying out a \u201c point operation \u201d , namely , an operation in which it was planned to use lethal force against an identified target in an extra - judicial execution - type raid . The Commission commented that the lack of contemporaneous documentary evidence concerning the planning of the operation hampered its assessment of this aspect of the case .", "CARDINAL . The house searches had begun before the arrival of the special operations team . A search report indicated that by TIME CARDINAL searches had been carried out . The house of PERSON , the applicant \u2019s nephew , who lived QUANTITY from the applicant \u2019s apartment block was searched TIME by local police officers , and proceeded in a polite , unaggressive manner . Nothing was found which supported the information given by the informant earlier in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Shortly before TIME , the special operations team arrived at the applicant \u2019s apartment block with the intention of carrying out a search of PERSON flat .", "CARDINAL . The G\u00fcl apartment block had streets on CARDINAL sides and a garden on the fourth . On the ground floor , there were commercial premises ; on the first floor , PERSON and his family lived in a flat on the left - hand side while PERSON and his family lived in a flat on the right - hand side . There were stairs leading up to the first floor from both the left and right corners of the side of the house facing the garden . The applicant occupied the flat on the second floor which was reached by a flight of stairs , which descended onto the balcony outside PERSON apartment . There was a partition separating the balcony into CARDINAL areas in front of the CARDINAL flats respectively . The stairs on each level were open , with railings . The area outside the flat was described as a balcony but there were differing descriptions of its dimensions and , particularly , whether it was a closed or open space . Videotapes provided by the parties did not elucidate the matter as there had been extensive alterations to the building since the events in issue . The videotapes did show that the stairwell to the second floor was located in the area in front of PERSON front door .", "CARDINAL . The entrance to PERSON flat was an iron door , which was secured by a lock , which was turned by a key , and also by a bolt . The door opened inwards . Outside , on the left of the door , was the kitchen window . Inside , on entering the flat , a hall ran straight ahead QUANTITY to the sitting room . Leading from left of the hallway was the kitchen , then a WC and bathroom . On the right of the corridor , there was a bedroom where the children slept , then a spare bedroom and furthest from the entrance the bedroom where PERSON and his wife slept .", "CARDINAL . As the search operation at the flat commenced , QUANTITY police officers , ORG , were in position outside the house , in the street where they could see who entered and left the building . CARDINAL of the special operation team ensured the security of the house FAC , ORG , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON . None of these men were in a position in which they had a view of the first floor of the house . CARDINAL of the special operations officers ( PERSON , the team leader , PERSON , ORG , PERSON , ORG , PERSON ) went up the stairs to the first floor . The positions of these officers were obscure . Their oral and written evidence was in many instances inconsistent . It appeared that PERSON , in position near the door of PERSON flat was not able to see clearly what occurred in front of PERSON \u2019s flat . PERSON was either on the stairs leading to the second floor or the ground floor and also unable to see what occurred . PERSON claimed that he was watching up the staircase towards a window and did not see anything , as he was behind an iron partition to the right of the door . There was however general agreement that PERSON was on the left side of the door to PERSON \u2019s flat , while ORG and ORG were nearby , providing him with cover .", "CARDINAL . Many of the details surrounding what occurred next were in dispute . The ORG found considerable difficulties attaching to the evidence of the CARDINAL special team officers at the door , who alleged that , after PERSON had knocked on the door giving loud warnings to open up , the door had swung abruptly open , PERSON had fired a shot through the door with a pistol and closed the door again . They had then opened fire on the door with a view to forcing it open , accidentally inflicting multiple wounds on PERSON who was behind the door . The Commission found their testimony lacking in reliability and credibility and that it was in some respects incredible . Their account gave an impression of being embroidered to present as exculpatory a picture as possible . On the other hand , it found the evidence of PERSON and PERSON , who were immediate witnesses of events , to be on the whole consistent , credible and convincing . Their accounts were in many respects supported by the testimony of the applicant and the other non - official witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of its assessment of the evidence , the ORG found that there was no prolonged knocking on the door or any verbal warning given to those inside the flat . PERSON came to the door in answer to a light knocking . It was highly probable that the officers outside started firing through the door , as PERSON was in the process of opening the lock . It was possible that the click of the key turning sounded like a gun being cocked and that this triggered their reaction . The intensity of the firing destroyed fingers on PERSON \u2019s right hand and inflicted numerous wounds . As he turned away from the door , a bullet struck him in the back inflicting a fatal injury . He staggered back up the corridor , leaving blood stains against the wall . His wife , PERSON , collided with him in the doorway of the bedroom and he collapsed on a sofa bed in that room . Meanwhile , in the flat next door , PERSON had heard the shooting and after opening his door briefly , he realised that it was the police and came out . He was forced onto the ground with a gun to his head . When the applicant came downstairs , he saw PERSON on the ground held at gunpoint by a security officer . He also saw that the lights were out and switched the mains switch back on . The applicant and PERSON participated in the efforts to open the door by physical force as the lock had jammed under the force of the bullets and PERSON had been unable to open it from the inside . When the door was kicked open , the applicant and PERSON entered the flat to find his injured son at the same time as , or shortly after , police officers entered .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant and other members of the family carried the severely injured PERSON downstairs and carried him to the local health centre in the applicant \u2019s car . There , he was transferred to an ambulance which took him to LOC hospital . He died however prior to his arrival . His body was taken to the morgue .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , a search was carried out at PERSON \u2019s flat . An incident report , and numerous statements of police officers , recorded that CARDINAL guns were found in the flat - a PERSON cocked with a bullet in the barrel and a NORP CARDINAL rounder - and that a QUANTITY empty cartridge was found in the corridor near the front door . These documents did not identify which of the signatories in fact witnessed the finding of these objects . The oral testimonies of the officers were confused and contradictory . No one was able to say who had found the NORP CARDINAL rounder as alleged in a wardrobe . While PERSON claimed to have found the PERSON , he was unable to recall whether it was bloodstained or not . There was no evidence that any precautions were taken in handling the guns with a view to preserving any forensic evidence . The finding of the guns was not properly recorded . They were not delivered to the public prosecutor until DATE , DATE . The photograph taken of the guns shows them sitting on a desk , either at the police station or the prosecutor \u2019s office . ORG did not find it established that the guns were found in the flat as alleged by the officers .", "CARDINAL . The special operations team returned to ORG after the search . They were not required to hand in their guns for examination or to account for the bullets expended during the operation .", "CARDINAL . The body of PERSON was examined by a doctor at ORG hospital at TIME in the presence of the ORG public prosecutor PERSON . The report which was drawn up was brief . It did not number the injuries on the body , giving only a general reference to grazes , cuts and erosions . No sketch was made of the location of injuries nor were any photographs taken . His family PERSON the son and PERSON the nephew - described the body as showing numerous bullet injuries , from the waist downwards . There was no full autopsy carried out , nor any X - rays taken . The public prosecutor PERSON considered that this was unnecessary as the cause of death - the bullet injury to the right kidney - was clear . He considered it was evident from the body that there were no bullets or fragments of bullets inside and that it was not necessary to give details of the grazes as these did not contribute to the death . The ORG found the report to be seriously deficient - it failed to describe the extent of PERSON injuries and to provide any useful medical or forensic detail for the purpose of assessing the proportionality of the force used by the security forces , the necessity for which evidence should have been apparent to the public prosecutor in the case of the killing of an individual by police officers .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the lack of proper recording of the finding of the guns and cartridge at the scene of the incident ( i.e. no photographs , sketch map or record of the officers who found them ) , the procedures at the scene were deficient in a number of other respects . Although the public prosecutor noted CARDINAL bullet holes in the door , CARDINAL cartridges were found . Though the PERSON was tested to see if it had been recently fired , no testing was carried out to establish that it had been fired by PERSON , i.e. by way of fingerprinting or analysis of blood traces . If the gun had been used by PERSON as alleged , there was a high probability that blood traces would have been present ( he was right handed , his right hand was shattered by bullets and blood smears were evident throughout the apartment where he had come into contact with walls and furniture ) . The photograph of the guns showed no visible stains however . Nor were PERSON hands tested for traces of firing . Though it was alleged by prosecutor PERSON that this test was pointless , this assertion did not accord with the practices adopted in other NORP cases examined by the Commission and utilised by police forces in other member GPE . The explanations given variously for not employing these tests ( shortness of time , the desire to avoid upsetting the family ) were not convincing . While the body was buried rapidly , there was nothing to stop the prosecutor delaying the release of the body to the relatives until the necessary tests had been carried out .", "CARDINAL . Though it was alleged that PERSON had fired a shot at the officers , no steps appeared to have been taken to check for a strike mark outside the flat or to find the bullet . The evidence before the Commission including the videotapes indicated that the staircase to the second floor was at the front of the balcony and potentially in the line of fire depending on the angle . The Commission was not convinced by the explanation that , assuming the bullet was fired into an open space over the balcony or stairway , it was not worth searching the garden for it . The fact that the gathering of forensic evidence was frequently a time - consuming and painstaking task did not relieve the authorities of the responsibility to make efforts to locate and preserve such evidence .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the gathering of evidence from witnesses , the public prosecutor in PERSON took statements from the applicant , family members and neighbours shortly after the events . They maintained that there had been no warnings given and that PERSON had not fired any gun at the officers . However , no statements were taken from any of the police officers involved until DATE , DATE . No statements were taken from any gendarme officers involved , nor the other persons who might have been involved in the planning of the operation . No enquiries were made of the special operations team department as to the weapons used or number of bullets expended on the operation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the PERSON public prosecutor issued a decision of lack of jurisdiction , which indicated the applicant as complainant , the members of the special operations team as the defendants and the offence as unintentional homicide . It stated that based on intelligence that members of the ORG could be located in certain residences in PERSON , a number of searches were carried out at TIME . At TIME special team officers intended to carry out a search at PERSON house . After giving warning , \u201c Police . Open the door \u201d , they fired at the metal door to gain entry . At that moment , PERSON was behind the door . He died from the wounds received . During the search of his house , there was found an illegal QUANTITY mm NORP pistol , a NORP PERSON pistol with its hammer drawn back and a bullet in the barrel , CARDINAL bullets and a cartridge . The applicant , father of the deceased , had lodged a criminal complaint . However , as it appeared that the defendants were special team officers and the offence carried out while they were performing their duties , the public prosecutor decided that he lacked jurisdiction and sent the file to the Provincial Governor for the necessary action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG provincial governor requested the appointment of an inspector to carry out an investigation into the incident on behalf of the provincial administrative council . A police inspector , PERSON , was appointed . He took statements from the applicant and other family members , the neighbours ORG and PERSON , the local police officers involved in the search operations that night and all the members of the special operations team . All the statements , save that of PERSON taken on DATE , were taken from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the inspector issued his report . It concluded that the officers had not fired to kill but had shown lack of care , which could justify charges being brought against them for causing death from lack of care and precautions , and recommended a disciplinary sanction of CARDINAL months\u2019 suspension . However , a decision not to prosecute was endorsed by the provincial administrative council on DATE on the basis that the officers had not intended to kill anyone , that they had only fired after a shot had been fired at them and that they had given a warning . This decision was not communicated to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE , ORG quashed the decision on DATE and ordered the trial of the CARDINAL officers who had fired at the door \u2013 PERSON , ORG , ORG .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL officers were tried for causing death by lack of attention and due precaution ( Art . CARDINAL of the ORG ) . They were not represented by a lawyer during the proceedings , which lasted from DATE to CARDINAL DATE before ORG No . CARDINAL . During the trial , the CARDINAL officers appeared . They maintained their written statements , and only ORG made any additional comments . No other witnesses were heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the court appointed a gendarme lieutenant PERSON as expert . He submitted a report dated DATE . This stated that from the file it was understood that the officers had called out warnings at the house , that the deceased had come out , fired one shot and shut the door again and that the officers fired at the lock to open it . The deceased , in the line of fire , was wounded and died . A subsequent search revealed the gun which had been fired and another , both unlicensed . It was noted that the complainants and other witnesses essentially disputed the statements of the security officers . It concluded that the defendants were members of a special operations team and had received serious and strict security training . During the incident and operation , conducted on the basis of intelligence information , the deceased fired a shot and the defendants were therefore \u201c preconditioned \u201d . They were primarily concerned to open the door and also to protect themselves and their colleagues . For those reasons , they fired at the lock . The photographs indicated that the defendants\u2019 firing was concentrated round the lock to break it . Also the deceased \u2019s firing was intended to attack more than to defend . This indicated that although the defendants showed the care and attention expected from them , the incident occurred . No fault or ill - intention could be attributed to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the court decided to send the file to ORG for expert lecturers from ORG to be selected to prepare a detailed report on the use of weapons and the intention behind the use of weapons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL experts ( Chief Inspectors PERSON and PERSON and PERSON , a research fellow at the police academy ) issued a report . This stated that they had been requested to give their opinion on the fault , if any , of each accused individually based on the court file . It listed as fact that the security forces acting on intelligence about the presence of ORG members surrounded PERSON house at TIME on DATE . The officers knocked on the door , warning , \u201c Police . Open the door \u201d . The door was slightly opened from the inside , a gun was fired and the door closed . The officers fired aiming at the lock to enter . The deceased who was behind the door was injured . The opinion of gendarme officer PERSON stated that the QUANTITY hand gun found was set to fire and recently used .", "The report analysis stated that it was believed that the security forces opened fire after the deceased fired due to the stress caused by the situation in the south - east and the psychological tension of the operation . It was significant that they did not shoot wildly but concentrated on the lock of the door . The fatal bullets were in the kidney and intestinal area , the same level as the lock , showing further that there was no intention to injure or kill . It concluded that the deceased was injured by chance and that the accused could not be charged with negligent conduct .", "CARDINAL . None of the experts visited the scene or requested any further information or evidence but based themselves on the statements in the file .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , the court referring to the expert report of DATE concluded that the defendants were not at fault and acquitted the CARDINAL officers . The Commission noted that there was no indication that in any of the proceedings consideration had been given as to whether the accounts of the family were in any respect accurate or on what basis the version of events given by the security forces was to be preferred . It is not apparent that the applicant was informed of the criminal proceedings or afforded the opportunity to join as a party .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s son PERSON was killed during an armed operation intended to effect the arrest of NORP terrorists . TIME , having been informed that some ORG terrorists were being sheltered in some houses , including the applicant \u2019s house , security forces arrived at the house at TIME to arrest the terrorists believed to be inside . They knocked on the door and asked the occupants to open the door . The door suddenly opened , a gunshot was heard and the door immediately closed again . Upon this , the officers fired CARDINAL shots towards the lock of the door . After these shots , a woman \u2019s voice was heard asking for help . When she tried to open the door , she told those outside that the lock had been jammed . Since it was understood that the matter was urgent , the officers told her to move aside and fired directly on the lock . Then they opened the door , carried out a rough search and let in the applicant . The security forces assisted the applicant and his son PERSON in carrying the injured PERSON to a police car , which took him to the local health centre .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL guns were later found in PERSON apartment , as well as a QUANTITY cartridge near the door .", "CARDINAL . The death of PERSON was caused accidentally . The CARDINAL officers who shot at the door were acquitted by the criminal court on the basis that they had not acted negligently .", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) constitute criminal offences . It is also an offence for a government employee to subject CARDINAL to torture or ill - treatment ( Article CARDINAL in respect of torture and Article CARDINAL in respect of ill - treatment ) . The authorities\u2019 obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW . Offences may be reported to the authorities or the security forces as well as to public prosecutor \u2019s offices . The complaint may be made in writing or orally . If it is made orally , the authority must make a record of it ( LAW .", "If there is evidence to suggest that a death is not due to natural causes , members of the security forces who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal court judge ( Article CARDINAL ) . By Article CARDINAL of LAW , any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor \u2019s office an offence of which he has become aware in the exercise of his duty is liable to imprisonment .", "A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of alleged terrorist offences , the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of ORG prosecutors and courts established throughout GPE .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by LAW on the prosecution of civil servants , which restricts the public prosecutor \u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect \u2019s status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the ORG . If a decision not to prosecute is taken , the case is automatically referred to that court .", "CARDINAL . If the suspect is a member of the armed forces , the applicable law is determined by the nature of the offence . Thus , if it is a \u201c military offence \u201d under LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , the criminal proceedings are in principle conducted in accordance with PERSON no . CARDINAL on the establishment of courts martial and their rules of procedure . Where a member of the armed forces has been accused of an ordinary offence , it is normally the provisions of LAW which apply ( see LAW and sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL ) .", "The Military Criminal Code makes it a military offence for a member of the armed forces to endanger a person \u2019s life by disobeying an order ( LAW ) . In such cases civilian complainants may lodge their complaints with the authorities referred to in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) or with the offender \u2019s superior .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL on administrative procedure , anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may , within DATE after the alleged act was committed , claim compensation from them . If the claim is rejected in whole or in part or if no reply is received within DATE , the victim may bring administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

Under these rules , the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons .", "CARDINAL . DATE of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , the last sentence of which was inspired by the provision mentioned above ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , provides :", "\u201c No criminal , financial or legal liability may be asserted against \u2026 the governor of a state of emergency region or by provincial governors in that region in respect of decisions taken , or acts performed , by them in the exercise of the powers conferred on them by this legislative decree , and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to that end .
