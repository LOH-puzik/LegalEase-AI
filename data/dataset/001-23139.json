THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Mark Villiger;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a national of GPE , who was born in DATE . He is currently in prison in GPE , FAC . He is represented before the Court by PERSON , a solicitor practising in GPE , and by PERSON GPE and PERSON , both barristers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE an elderly man collapsed and died during a violent burglary in his home . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of murder . He was questioned CARDINAL times over DATE and CARDINAL video recordings were made of those interviews . The applicant was then released . Some time later the police conducted extensive covert surveillance operations during the course of which the applicant was heard to make incriminating remarks .", "The pathologist \u2019s report of DATE recorded that the victim had been suffering from a long term hypertensive heart disease and that a combination of his minor injuries and the fear engendered by the burglary caused his death .", "On DATE the applicant was re - arrested and on DATE he was charged with murder . He was interviewed CARDINAL times over DATE ( along with a co - accused ) during which videos from the covert surveillance were shown to him ( image only ) . The applicant \u2019s legal representative indicated during those interviews that the images on the videos were poor . Videos were also taken of those interviews .", "The applicant appeared before ORG on DATE for the first time when he was remanded in custody on the murder charge , the statutory custody time - limit of DATE to expire on DATE according to section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ( Custody Time Limits ) Regulations DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The DATE was , subject to an extension of that time - limit or the granting of a new time - limit , therefore the date foreseen for the applicant \u2019s committal on a charge of murder . As later established before ORG , on DATE , CARDINAL of the witness statements had already been prepared by the police ( out of the total CARDINAL statements eventually obtained ) .", "By letter dated DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives requested the prosecution to make full disclosure . The response , dated DATE , indicated that the police had been asked to supply the relevant extracts from the video surveillance , which constituted \u201c key \u201d prosecution evidence in the case against the applicant . On DATE the defence again requested the prosecution \u2019s disclosure .", "On DATE the police submitted its file of the evidence to the prosecution . On DATE the prosecution requested further statements to be taken by the police .", "In the meantime , the pathologist had been asked to comment specifically on the association between the burglary incident and the victim \u2019s death . On DATE the pathologist produced a report leading to the same conclusions as the report of DATE , albeit expressed more succinctly . On DATE the prosecution also received the requested statements from the police .", "DATE the prosecution served its full file on the defence which included CARDINAL TIME videos of the covert surveillance , CARDINAL interview tapes ( together with transcripts of those videos ) and CARDINAL witness statements and CARDINAL pages of documents including police interviews . The prosecution confirmed that they were ready for committal of the applicant on a charge of manslaughter , although it reserved its position on the initial charge of murder pending perusal of any evidence received post - committal . The prosecution indicated what parts of the videos and material were relevant for its case .", "The applicant \u2019s representative immediately reserved the first date available in the video room in the applicant \u2019s prison ( DATE ) to view the videos with him . On viewing the videos on that date his representative noted that further copies of the videos would have to be obtained as the images were unclear and the audio was substandard . On DATE the defence indicated that it was not ready for a committal hearing as it had insufficient time to fully consider the evidence served .", "On DATE the applicant appeared before ORG . The prosecution offered no evidence on the murder charge and formally preferred a new manslaughter charge indicating that it was ready to commit the applicant for trial on the latter charge . ORG extended the original custody time - limit ( finding that the prosecution had acted with due expedition ) , accorded a further custody time - limit in light of the new charge and adjourned committal proceedings on the manslaughter charge for DATE to allow the defence to consider the prosecution evidence .", "On DATE ORG considered and decided the applicant \u2019s appeal from ORG . In the first place , ORG found that the preferring of the new charge did indeed give rise to a new custody time - limit :", "\u201c ... the question is whether any new or amended charge is in substance a different offence , and there is no doubt that manslaughter is a different offence . . . carrying a different mens rea , and . . . significantly different consequences might flow in terms of length of sentence . . . it must follow that the time limit runs de novo from the preferment of the new offence of manslaughter . \u201d", "ORG also rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that the prosecution had demonstrated mala fides , which the applicant considered was demonstrated by the similar conclusions in the pathologist \u2019s reports of DATE and by the prosecution \u2019s reservation of the possibility of re - entering the murder charge depending on evidence later emerging . It found that the prosecution had not sought to manipulate the custody time - limit by the addition or substitution of a manslaughter charge .", "Secondly , it went on to consider the extension of the original custody time - limit , a relevant matter as any refusal of the extension would allow a bail application to be made . The prosecution argued that , although it had a good number of prosecution statements by DATE , it had considered it preferable to serve the entire prosecution file in DATE rather than do so piecemeal DATE . It considered the case was of some complexity and that there were ongoing enquiries concerning the nature of the charge ( murder or manslaughter ) to be retained against the applicant . It was of the view that the defence had sufficient time DATE and DATE to review the documents to be ready for the committal hearing on DATE . The defence accepted that it was a complex matter , but submitted that the prosecution should have served the substantial material in their possession much earlier and that it had insufficient time to consider all the material and to take instructions prior to the committal hearing , not to mention the fact that the videos eventually served were of unacceptable quality .", "The ORG judge found that the original time - limit should not have been extended since he had \u201c no hesitation in finding \u201d that the prosecution had not acted with \u201c due expedition \u201d . He found that the prosecution , having been put on notice in DATE that the videos were of poor quality , took until DATE to produce further poor quality videos which could not be viewed by the prisoner until DATE , DATE before the hearing before ORG . He concluded :", "\u201c I could go into more detail than that , but I do not think I need to for this purpose . So I find , as I say , that the Prosecution have not acted with all due expedition , and of course CARDINAL bears in mind that they had many , many of the witness statements in their possession before DATE ] , the date of [ the applicant \u2019s ] first appearance [ before ORG ] , and they decided to hold on to them until DATE before the expiry of the time - limit . It just will not do . \u201d", "The applicant was therefore entitled to apply for bail on the basis that the finding of insufficient expedition by the prosecution constituted \u201c changed circumstances \u201d within the meaning of LAW DATE ( as amended \u2013 \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) . During the bail application , the applicant \u2019s counsel clarified that a bail application had not been previously made on the applicant \u2019s behalf . However , since the applicant had previously committed a number of offences on bail and had failed to surrender to bail on CARDINAL occasions , the ORG refused bail on the basis that it was believed the applicant would fail to surrender and would commit an offence on bail .", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for leave to challenge by judicial review ORG ruling that a further custody time - limit had been created by the new manslaughter charge .", "On DATE the applicant was committed to ORG for trial by ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s leave application , Mr Justice PERSON delivering the judgment of the court . He noted that , while the Prosecution had acted with commendable speed having received the papers from the police in DATE , the period of time that had elapsed since the burglary in question was prima facie evidence that the police had not acted with \u201c all due expedition \u201d . He also noted that the substitution of the charge of manslaughter for murder was unnecessary as ORG could have been invited to commit the applicant on the manslaughter charge but that its substitution led to a new custody time - limit being created . Noting that there was no submission that the prosecution had acted in bad faith , Mr Justice PERSON found that the substitution of the manslaughter charge , although unnecessary , was :", "\u201c a thoroughly desirable course to take , because accused persons should only be charged , committed and tried for offences which are reflected in the available evidence . That thoroughly desirable course , however , at the same time may provide a passport for avoiding the statutory consequence of thoroughly dilatory preparation . \u201d", "Mr Justice PERSON did add that he considered the law to be somewhat unsatisfactory :", "\u201c The purpose of the [ DATE ] Regulations has been stated and emphasised time and again . Once the custody time limit of DATE has expired , the onus is fairly and squarely on the prosecution to seek and to justify , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the DATE Act the granting of an extension . No question of the prosecution having to make out a case for an extension arises however if another offence is charged . Providing that offence is supported by evidence , the prosecutor \u2019s position , subject to the abuse point ( which I will refer to in a moment ) , appears to be unassailable . If a charge is withdrawn and another one substituted or a further offence is charged ( as an alternative ) a new custody time limit is still created . This , quite legitimately , can happen more than once . New custody time limits could follow , one after the another , without there having been the slightest variation in size or content of the evidential canvas , but simply as a consequence of the prosecutor \u2019s decision to found a charge or a different charge or an alternative charge on a particular area of the evidential material . However dilatory the preparation , however late in DATE the late charge is preferred , the prosecution \u2019s position may thereby be protected .", "For the claim \u201c abuse of process \u201d to succeed , bad faith must be established . That is a heavy burden to discharge . It is not altogether clear on the authorities whether the charging of an offence justified on the evidence , but solely for the purpose of creating a new custody time limit , itself amounts without more to bad faith . If it does not , then it is difficult to see how there could be any effective challenge to these practices . This considerable measure of latitude which has been extended to prosecutors seems to me to be wholly inconsistent with the purpose of LAW , because , in effect , it enables the prosecution to bypass the requirement in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) [ of LAW ] that any extension of the time limit has to be justified by showing , under the amendment to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) introduced by paragraph CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( which appears not yet to be in force ) , not only all due expedition but also due diligence . \u201d", "Mr Justice PERSON certified a point of law of public importance for ORG to consider , namely :", "\u201c When in a GPE court does the charging of an offence cause a fresh custody time limit to run . \u201d", "On DATE ORG considered a new indictment including charges of manslaughter , wounding with intent and aggravated burglary . The applicant pleaded not guilty . However , at his trial on DATE he pleaded guilty to manslaughter , the other charges remaining on the file . On DATE he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . His pre - trial custody was deducted from his sentence ( Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s submissions as to the meaning and application of GPE .", "Lord PERSON of GPE noted that a mere change of the details of a charge does not mean that the time - limit begins again since the offence remains the same . Equally , where the initial and second offences are plainly distinct ( for example , burglary and rape ) , the second charge attracts its own time - limit . While the present case fell somewhere between those CARDINAL situations , it was not possible to interpret the legislation so as to exclude a further time - limit where the initial charge \u201c necessarily includes or amounts to , whether expressly or impliedly , the new offence charged \u201d as suggested by the applicant . A further time - limit would only be excluded where the constituent elements of the new offence were \u201c in substance the same as those of the original offence \u201d , which was not the case of the murder and manslaughter charges .", "It was accepted that a new time - limit would not , however , begin if the preferring of a further charge amounted to an abuse of process :", "\u201c It has been said that where the new charge is brought in bad faith or dishonestly , that would amount to an abuse of process . In my view the ambit of \u2018 abuse of PERSON is not so limited . If a new charge is brought simply to keep the accused in custody for a longer period , that is clearly contrary to the intention of the legislation and constitutes an abuse of process . As Professor PERSON said in his commentary to R v. ORG , ORG [ DATE ] Crim . LR CARDINAL , at p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u2018 Perhaps the more specific question to be asked is whether the charges of possession with intent were brought solely for the purpose of retaining the applicants in ORG", "Equally if the court is satisfied that the way in which and the time at which the new charge is added or substituted , indicates that it is not done for the genuine purpose of introducing a new charge on a revised assessment of the case , but is done primarily to keep the accused in custody on the initial charge , then this will constitute an abuse of process . Of course on the other hand if the purpose is genuinely to introduce a new charge on such a revised assessment the fact that the accused begins a new custody period does not in itself constitute an abuse of process .", "It was not contended [ in ORG ] that there was an abuse of process here and on my view of the construction of the section and the ORG such a matter does not fall for consideration on the present appeal . \u201d", "As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that this manner of proceeding was arbitrary and in violation of LAW :", "\u201c In my view , however , it has not been shown that his detention was arbitrary . No complaint can be made for DATE period : the second is justified because a new charge is brought on the basis of a very substantial body of evidence delivered to the defence shortly before the second charge was laid . It was right to change the charge to the lesser offence of manslaughter in the light of the reconsideration of the case . For the serious offences involved here , I do not consider that the periods prescribed in the ORG can be said to be unreasonable .", "Moreover there was an opportunity to challenge the laying of the second charge and the second detention period as an abuse of the process of the court . That was not done , understandably . There existed a procedure by which the decision of the Magistrate could be challenged by way of judicial review . That was done in this case . During the period when the appellant was in the custody of the GPE court , the provision of section CARDINAL ) of the Magistrates\u2019 Court Act DATE requires that a [ GPE ] \u201c court may not remand a person for a period exceeding CARDINAL clear days \u201d [ subject to certain exceptions ] . \u201d", "Lord Hope of PERSON also found that the ordinary canons of construction implied that each offence laid before ORG attracted its own custody time - limit . In his reasoning he described the inquiry of ORG under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) as follows :", "\u201c The function of the GPE court , as described in DATE of [ the DATE ] Act , is to inquire into \u2018 an offence as examining justices\u2019 : see section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and section CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) [ of LAW ] . If a GPE court is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial by jury \u2018 for any indictable offence\u2019 , the court must commit him for trial : section CARDINAL ) [ of LAW ] . The implication is that it will take that step with regard to \u2018 the offence under inquiry\u2019 : see the concluding words of the subsection . Alternatively the court may commit him for trial \u2018 for DATE if it is satisfied that all the evidence before the court consists of written statements tendered under LAW without consideration of their contents .", "...", "Thus the scope of the inquiry is determined by the information which has been laid before the GPE court . The guiding principle is that the offence should be described in the information clearly and definitely , without duplicity or uncertainty ... The court \u2019s function is to inquire into the offence charged in the information as examining justices . I do not think that there is any ambiguity about what is meant in regulation CARDINAL ) [ of LAW ] by the word \u2018 offence\u2019 in these circumstances . It means the offence with which the person is charged in the information which has been laid against him in that court .", "It is normal and proper practice for the prosecution to review the charge or charges in the information which was initially laid before the court as further inquiries are conducted into the state of the evidence . This may lead to the bringing against the accused of what are undoubtedly fresh charges , with the consequence that these new charges will attract their own custody time limit . \u201d", "As to the compatibility of that interpretation of LAW ) of LAW with LAW , he noted that the primary means for controlling the detention of a person while in the custody of ORG are found in the provisions of LAW . The function of GPE was to set maximum custody time limits . If a custody time limit expired before the completion of the stage of the proceedings in question , \u201c the accused had to be granted bail \u201d . It was also open to the justices to grant bail at any time before the expiry of the time limit , bearing in mind that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act gave a general right to bail except in certain specified circumstances ( Schedule QUANTITY ) . Furthermore the accused , if remanded in custody , had to be brought again before ORG to enable his case to be reviewed at regular intervals , as the general rule is that a ORG may not remand a person for a period exceeding CARDINAL DATE ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . His detention was thus subject to judicial control in ORG throughout the period while he is in the custody of that court . Decisions of ORG were amenable to judicial review and if that court decided to extend a custody time limit the accused could appeal against that decision to ORG ( section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) . He continued :", "\u201c The effect of these provisions can , I think , be summarised in this way . A person can only be detained in the custody of a ORG while awaiting the completion of a preliminary stage of the proceedings under a procedure which has been laid down by statute , and the effect of Regulation CARDINAL of LAW is that any such detention is subject to strictly defined custody time limits . As to the complaint that this procedure is not precise or accessible because of the possibility of the substitution of fresh custody time limits , I would reject it . The provisions of LAW DATE and of LAW , as amended , deal with the procedure for remands in custody in considerable detail with a view to ensuring that every situation is provided for . It is a procedure which is prescribed by law . Detention under this procedure is lawful under domestic law , and it complies with the general requirements of the Convention . If a fresh custody time limit is to be substituted , the procedure under which this is to be done is laid down by statute and the regulation defines the length of the substituted time limit . \u201d", "However , he found more substantial the applicant \u2019s complaint that the procedure was open to abuse as a result of arbitrary decisions of the prosecution : Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Regulation was vulnerable to abuse if it was used for improper purposes . But this , Lord Hope of PERSON considered , was a matter which was subject to judicial control by the justices or the stipendiary magistrates who could find that the new charge was simply a reproduction of the old charge with amendments which were minor or unimportant ( and , on this ground , refuse to accept that the new charge gave rise to a fresh custody time - limit ) or who could refuse to inquire into the information relating to the new charge on the basis that to do so would be an abuse of the process of the court .", "As to what constituted an abuse of process in this context he considered that the essence of abuse of process in criminal proceedings was that the prosecution had \u201c sought to take advantage of a procedural rule for a purpose which can be described as improper or as arbitrary \u201d . Difficulty had arisen because of the suggestion in previous case - law that a complaint of abuse of process had to contain an allegation of bad faith . Having reviewed the relevant authorities , he found that :", "\u201c I do not think that it can be doubted that , where dishonesty or mala fides can be established , that will be sufficient to show that there has been an abuse of process . But the concept of abuse of process is not to be confined to cases where there is proof of conscious dishonesty or of an improper motive of that kind . To the extent that the authorities to which I have referred may be taken as indicating the contrary , I would be inclined not to follow them . It seems to me that a broader and simpler test is , in this context , more appropriate . That would be more in keeping with the purpose of LAW , which is to protect the individual from arbitrariness when he is deprived of his liberty .", "The true question , as PERSON indicated in R v. PERSON and ORG , ORG DATE ) CARDINAL JP CARDINAL , is whether the new charge has been brought solely for the purpose of avoiding a custody time limit . The issue can best be tested by requiring the prosecutor to demonstrate why , on the facts of the case , the bringing of the new charge is necessary . If the necessity of bringing the new charge can be demonstrated , the substitution of a new custody time limit will follow according to the rules which regulation CARDINAL ) has laid down . But if the prosecutor is unable to satisfy this test , it will be open to the court to infer that there is an abuse of process because the charge has been brought solely for the arbitrary and improper purpose of substituting a new custody time limit . \u201d", "Lord PERSON also found that LAW allowed the substitution of a new time - limit and , further , that that was not incompatible with LAW :", "\u201c The regulation is clear , precise and accessible . There are safeguards for the accused in the recognition by both parties that the court can intervene in the event of the prosecution acting in a way which would constitute an abuse of process . The regulation prescribes relatively short periods for the completion of the relevant stage of the proceedings and the court has a discretion whether or not an extension to the period is or is not to be allowed . Moreover the accused has remedies in law , including that of judicial review . Finally the whole scheme of the regulation has to be seen in the context of LAW DATE which gives , subject to certain exceptions , a general right to bail . \u201d", "Lord PERSON of GPE dissented . He considered that the substitution of a manslaughter charge , already implicit in the murder charge , allowing the extension of the time - limit was an absurd result which could not have been intended by parliament . The power to grant bail did not address this absurdity since the individual had lost the benefit entirely of fixed time - limits extendable in limited circumstances for which parliament had provided by way of the DATE Act . The ORG \u2019s ability to prevent an abuse of process did not provide an answer since the prosecution had nonetheless exercised its powers and discharged its responsibilities \u201c properly and conscientiously \u201d .", "Lord ORG also dissented finding that , where the new charge was based on the facts on which the original charge was based and was simply a lesser charge than that originally preferred , the proposition that the preferment of the new charge attracts a new custody time - limit defeated legislative intention .", "\u201c In the present case the prosecution did not act with all due diligence and expedition . [ ORG ] so found and refused the application for an extension . It has not been suggested that [ it ] was in error . And yet , by introducing the manslaughter charge on DATE of expiry of the original custody time limit , the prosecution procured a further DATE during which the appellant could be kept in custody . It is , of course , true that it was open to the appellant on DATE to make an application for bail , and indeed he did so . But the new custody time limit defeated his absolute right to the grant of bail under section ORG ) of LAW DATE and his bail application was , in the event , refused .", "If the committal hearing had taken place on DATE , as it would have done if the prosecution had not failed to act with all due diligence and expedition , the prosecution could at the same time have substituted the manslaughter charge for the murder charge and the appellant would have been committed to ORG for trial on the manslaughter charge . If the proceedings had taken that course , the period during which he would have been in custody before the committal would not have exceeded the original DATE .", "On this appeal , the critical question for your Lordships , in my opinion , is whether there is a permissible application of LAW and regulation CARDINAL of GPE that would prevent , in a case such as this , the substituted charge from attracting a fresh DATE custody time limit . There is no doubt , I believe , that if that result can be reached it ought to be reached . \u201d", "His conclusion was fortified by the impact of the requirement to interpret the applicable law compatibly with LAW . A construction and application of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) of GPE that enabled the prosecution , by preferring a new charge , to withhold from the accused the release from custody to which he would otherwise have been entitled , in a case where there were no new facts and the new charge was and always had been comprehended within the original charge , would subject the accused to arbitrariness :", "\u201c In my opinion , it is open to your Lordships to rule that if an accused , having appeared or been brought before a GPE court on an information charging him with an offence , is then charged with a new offence of which he might , if tried on the original offence , have been convicted ( see section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) , LAW DATE ) , a new custody time limit will not be attracted by the new offence and the accused \u2019s \u2018 first appearance\u2019 in relation to the new offence will be the date on which he first appeared or was brought before the GPE court on the information or charge relating to the original offence .", "If the addition , or substitution , of the new offence has the consequence that the prosecution is not ready to proceed with the committal hearing within the original DATE custody time limit , it is always open to the prosecution to apply for an extension . Whether the prosecution would obtain an extension would depend on their showing they had acted \u201c with all due diligence and expedition \u201d . The end result would thus be in accordance with the legislative intention . \u201d", "Having so concluded , Lord ORG provided his view on the meaning of \u201c abuse of process \u201d :", "\u201c In my opinion , the requirement of dishonesty or mala fides distracts attention from the true requirements if an allegation of abuse of process is to be made out . The concept of abuse of process is no different in criminal cases from the like concept in civil cases . It involves a use of court process for a purpose other than that for which the purpose in question was intended . It is in that sense that one may speak of some procedural step being taken for an improper purpose and , therefore , constituting an abuse of process . The procedural step will often be accompanied by bad faith or dishonesty \u2014 in that a legitimate purpose , not being the true purpose , may be put forward as the true purpose . But bad faith or dishonesty are not essential . What is essential is that court process has been used for some ulterior purpose .", "There will be difficulty where the purpose is mixed . The present case may well be an example . There was every reason , it being clear that the known facts did not support a murder charge but only manslaughter , for the withdrawal of the former and the substitution of the latter as soon as practicable . But the timing of the substitution suggests very strongly , to my mind , that it was done in order to forestall the automatic release of the appellant from custody . There was no evidence at all from the prosecution as to its reasons for formally substituting manslaughter for murder on DATE . The prosecution could simply have informed the defence that the murder charge would not be proceeded with and that they would be seeking a committal on manslaughter . In my opinion , however , if a step in litigation is taken for a legitimate reason , whether or not it is also taken for an illegitimate one , the step can not be categorised as an abuse of process . The legitimate reason must , of course , be more than merely makeweight or trivial . If abuse of process can be shown , the procedural step taken should , strictly , be regarded as a nullity . ... It is , in my respectful opinion , unanswerable and obviously right . If a new charge is preferred , not with any genuine intention that the accused should be tried on that charge , but simply in order to attract a new custody time limit , the preferring of the new charge is an abuse of process and the new charge should be struck out as soon as that has become apparent .", "If there is a genuine intention that the new charge should be proceeded with to trial and it is simply the timing of the new charge that appears to be motivated by an intention to avoid the consequences of the expiry of the original custody time limit , the court can not , in my opinion , strike out the new charge as an abuse of process . But the circumstances in which the substitution of the new charge took place can , and should , in my opinion , be taken into account in considering whether the accused should be released on bail .", "...", "If I am right in the present case that the substituted charge of manslaughter should not have been treated as giving rise to a fresh custody time limit , the abuse of process point does not arise . If I am wrong , however , and I understand a majority of your Lordships to take a different view on that point , this was not a case in which the manslaughter charge could have been set aside on abuse of process grounds . However , it was a case in which , on the bail application made to [ ORG ] , the circumstances in which the substituted charge was preferred should have been taken into account . The fact that the prosecution had failed to act with all due diligence and expedition was relevant . So was the fact that there was nothing new which explained why the substitution was being made when it was made . The judge should , in my view , have inferred that a substantial reason for the change was that the prosecution wanted to avoid the custody time limit consequences of their own dilatoriness .
