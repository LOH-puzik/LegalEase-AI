He died of cancer on DATE . The second applicant , born in DATE , was the first applicant 's former wife who subsequently returned to live with him . The third applicant is the daughter of the first and second applicants . The applicants are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the second applicant , who is a teacher , requested the PERSON educational authorities to issue her a licence to run an adoption agency ( \" agencja adopcyjna \" ) . In reply , she was informed by an undated letter that centres dealing with adoption and custody matters could only be run by associations governed by LAW , whose statutory purposes so provided .", "On DATE ORG charged the first applicant with trading in children , an offence provided for by LAW of DATE , applicable at the material time . On DATE the first applicant was arrested . On DATE the applicant was examined by a psychiatrist from ORG of ORG , since at the time of his arrest he had submitted that he had been suffering from depression for DATE . The medical opinion stated that , having regard to the first applicant \u2019s state of mental health , he should be detained in the psychiatric ward of FAC .", "On DATE ORG remanded him in custody for DATE on suspicion of trading in children . On DATE the prosecutor asked FAC to place the applicant in the psychiatric ward .", "", "On DATE the applicant was examined by a physician from the detention centre hospital . The medical examination did not show any pathological changes in the applicant \u2019s thorax , skeleton , nervous system , urinary system or abdominal cavity . The physician recommended that the applicant should be seen by a psychiatrist and a specialist in internal medicine and should have an X - ray . An X - ray taken afterwards showed a shadow at the top of his right lung . On DATE therefore the X - ray was repeated . It showed a shadow of QUANTITY in his lung .", "On DATE written grounds of a decision of DATE were served on the first applicant . The prosecutor considered that there was a strong suspicion that in DATE he had contacted PERSON and PERSON and , taking advantage of their difficult financial situation , convinced them to give for adoption their child which was soon to be born . At DATE , upon discharge of the mother from the hospital where the child had been born , he had placed it with third parties . The biological parents had not had any further contact with the child . DATE before a court hearing in the adoption proceedings , the first applicant had organised a meeting at the law firm of ORG attended by PERSON and PERSON and an NORP couple , the GPE . On DATE of the hearing and after a favourable decision as to adoption by PERSON and PERSON had been rendered by the court , the first applicant had given MONEY ( PLZ ) to the ORG . and had retained PLZ CARDINAL for himself , apparently as reimbursement of costs which he had borne for the maintenance of the child . It had further been established that in DATE the first applicant had had contacts with ORG , who had been pregnant at that time . After her child had been born , he had taken it from ORG upon her discharge from hospital and had placed the child with third parties . The mother had not had any further contact with the child . From DATE to DATE the first applicant had paid to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE instalments of PLZ CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The child had apparently later been adopted by another NORP family .", "On DATE and DATE , the prosecutor consulted doctors from the detention centre hospital in order to establish whether the applicant could take part in the criminal proceedings conducted against him . They informed him that the applicant \u2019s health did not prevent him from participating in the proceedings .", "On DATE the Office of ORG registered the first applicant 's company . In accordance with the terms of the registration certificate he was allowed to run a legal advice company , providing , inter alia , legal counselling concerning adoption proceedings and \" cooperation with agencies dealing with adoption matters \" ( \" wsp\u00f3\u0142praca z agencjami adopcyjnymi \" ) .", "On DATE the first applicant was examined by a lung specialist who ordered that he should undergo a new X - ray or tomographical examination , and bronchoscopy . On DATE the detention centre established that the applicant could have a bronchoscopy at the Jan Pawe\u0142 II Hospital in GPE on DATE .", "On DATE ORG had a phone conversation with doctors from the detention centre in order to establish whether the applicant could participate in the criminal proceedings . He was informed that the applicant was undergoing diagnostic tests since suspect shadows had been found in his right lung . By a letter of the same date the prosecutor requested the prison hospital to provide information in writing about the applicant \u2019s health as soon as possible .", "The tomography of the applicant \u2019s lungs was carried out on DATE . Its interpretation , given on DATE , confirmed the presence of suspect changes in his lungs .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s defence counsel filed with ORG a request for release based on LAW , submitting that the applicant should be released as there was a suspicion that he was suffering from lung cancer .", "On DATE ORG refused to release the applicant , having regard to the fact that information obtained from the detention centre hospital regarding the applicant \u2019s health was insufficient to establish whether he was suffering from cancer .", "", "On DATE the applicant underwent a bronchoscopy .", "", "On DATE a panel of physicians of the PERSON detention centre hospital stated that the applicant should be released as he was suffering from lung cancer . The prosecutor requested that a further medical report be prepared concerning the compatibility of the applicant \u2019s health with his continued detention . On DATE CARDINAL specialists from ORG of ORG confirmed that there was a strong likelihood that the applicant was suffering from lung cancer .", "On DATE the applicant was released . A medical certificate issued on DATE of his discharge from the prison hospital stated that cytological tests had shown the presence of suspect cells in his lungs . There was a strong likelihood that he was suffering from lung cancer . An examination by a lung specialist was urgently necessary . The applicant 's condition also necessitated a tomographical examination of his lungs as well as a bronchoscopy . The applicant was also suffering from depression . While hospitalised , he had been receiving various drugs .", "On DATE the applicant was admitted to a hospital in GPE . He subsequently underwent a course of radiation therapy .", "On DATE ORG refused the public prosecutor 's request for prolongation of detention on remand of another suspect detained in the same case , PERSON , who was an advocate . The court stated that the acts with which ORG had been charged could not reasonably be qualified as trading in children within the meaning of Article PERSON of LAW . This was so because , in the assessment of what could constitute the offence of \" trading in children \" , regard had necessarily to be had to the fact that adoption was in a child 's best interest , whereas the notion of trading in human beings inherently involved acts to the detriment of the victims of such trade . Whereas it was true , the court continued , that adoption did , to a certain extent , limit the liberty of a person to be adopted , its purpose was to improve a child 's conditions of life and to enhance its prospects of well - being . Therefore , adoption in itself had to be perceived as being beneficial for a child . In the case under examination , it had not been established by the investigating authorities that the acts with which ORG had been charged had caused any harm to any children , or to other persons . The court attached importance to the fact that Section IX of the Transitional Provisions of the Criminal Code which penalised trading in human beings was to be replaced , following a proposal by a committee charged with drafting a new LAW , by a separate offence of organising adoptions for commercial purposes . It indicated , the court emphasised , that it was impossible to charge ORG with the offence defined in Section IX of the Transitional Provisions , as the offence of trading in human beings was considered by an unanimous opinion of eminent legal scholars , members of the drafting committee , to constitute an offence separate from the CARDINAL of organising adoptions for commercial purposes . The court concluded that the mere fact that ORG had acted as a lawyer and as an intermediary in numerous adoption proceedings and had received fees for it , was not sufficient for a reasonable suspicion that an offence punishable under Section ORG had been committed .", "On DATE the first applicant underwent an operation . A part of his lungs was removed . During the operation the presence of metastases in his lymph nodes was established .", "He was discharged from hospital on DATE .", "", "On DATE the applicant died of lung cancer .", "On DATE the second applicant requested that criminal proceedings be instituted concerning the causes of the first applicant 's death . She submitted that , after his admission to the prison hospital , an X - ray had showed possible symptoms of cancer . At DATE the prison medical services had accordingly notified the prosecutor and had pointed out the possibility of a quick and violent progress of the cancer . They had emphasised the necessity of the applicant 's further examination by specialists and , possibly , of an operation . The second applicant further submitted that , throughout the first applicant 's stay in the prison hospital , the prosecutor PERSON had been informed on an ongoing basis by the applicant 's lawyers of the fact that his continued detention entailed an immediate danger to his life . She had entirely disregarded this information . Likewise , she had disregarded the results of the first applicant 's medical examinations . She had also ignored the medical opinions of the prison hospital and of ORG indicating that the applicant 's condition had been incompatible with his continued detention . She had kept refusing to release him , considering that the applicant had been prevaricating . The second applicant further stated that the first applicant 's treatment after his release had been ineffective , mainly owing to the fact that the illness had already been in an advanced stage . The first applicant had received a course of radiation therapy and had subsequently undergone the operation . The second applicant stated that the evidence to prove the accuracy of her assertions was to be found in the first applicant 's medical records at the prison hospital and FAC , and in the applicant 's medical records kept by ORG .", "The second applicant asserted that the first applicant 's death had been caused by his detention from DATE and by the lack of any adequate treatment against cancer throughout that time . She submitted in particular that had the first applicant been released earlier to receive adequate treatment , he would have had a chance to be saved . The fact that during his detention he had been deprived of treatment , amounted , in the second applicant 's opinion , to manslaughter within the meaning of the relevant provisions of LAW .", "On DATE ORG ordered that the investigation of the second applicant 's allegations should be conducted by a prosecutor from a prosecutor 's office outside of GPE .", "", "On DATE ORG , in view of the first applicant 's death , discontinued the criminal proceedings against him .", "On DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings concerning the first applicant 's death .", "On DATE ORG in GPE quashed this decision and ordered that the investigations be resumed .", "On DATE the investigations were discontinued as ORG found that no criminal offence had been committed . CARDINAL copies of this decision were sent to the second applicant \u2019s addresses in PERSON and in PERSON . It is not contested that the first one was served on the applicant on DATE , and the second CARDINAL on CARDINAL DATE .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision on DATE . On DATE ORG refused to accept her appeal , considering that the DATE time - limit should have been calculated from DATE of the effective service of the decision on the second applicant , i.e. from DATE and that , therefore , the applicant had submitted her appeal out of the statutory time - limit .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "CARDINAL . Detention on remand", "", "Under LAW of LAW , as applicable at the material time , the lawfulness of ORG detention order could be challenged before a court . The authorities competent to decide in relation to detention on remand were specified in ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW Code of Criminal Procedure , which at the material time read as follows :", "Article CARDINAL :", "\" CARDINAL .

ORG in whose region the detained person had been released was competent to examine whether the conditions for awarding compensation had been met . The decision of ORG could be appealed to ORG .", "According to LAW , a request for compensation for manifestly unjustified detention on remand had to be lodged within DATE from the date on which the final decision terminating the criminal proceedings in question had become final . Therefore , in practice , a request for compensation for unjustified detention under LAW could not be lodged until the criminal proceedings against the person concerned were terminated ( see also the decision of ORG no .

They were not designed to secure release from detention but financial reparation for damage arising from unjustified detention on remand . The person concerned , by instituting such proceedings , could retrospectively seek a ruling as to whether his or her detention was justified .
