The applicant was born in DATE . When he lodged his application he was being detained in FAC , GPE . He now lives in GPE /Surami , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On TIME of DATE the applicant and an unidentified accomplice robbed PERSON and NORP , CARDINAL NORP nationals , in the women \u2019s apartment in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The perpetrators were aware that the apartment was used for prostitution and expected its CARDINAL female occupants to keep valuables and cash there . They passed by the apartment in TIME in order to make sure that no clients or a procurer were present . Shortly afterwards they returned and overpowered PERSON , who had answered the doorbell . The applicant pointed a gas pistol which resembled a real gun at both women and threatened to shoot them if they did not disclose where their money was kept . While his accomplice watched over the women , the applicant partly collected in the apartment and partly forced the women to hand over to him QUANTITY ( ORG ) and CARDINAL mobile phones .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , acting jointly with several accomplices , robbed O. and P. , CARDINAL female NORP nationals who were temporarily resident in GPE and working as prostitutes , in their apartment in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the offence , CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - accused had passed by O. and P. \u2019s apartment in PERSON together with an accomplice , NORP , an acquaintance of NORP and P. They intended to verify whether the CARDINAL women were the apartment \u2019s only occupants and whether they kept any valuables there , and discovered a safe in the kitchen .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant and a further accomplice , PERSON , gained access to O. and P. \u2019s apartment by pretending to be potential clients , while CARDINAL of their co - accused waited in a car parked close to the apartment building and another waited in front of the building . Once inside the apartment B. produced a knife that he had been carrying in his jacket . P. , in order to escape from the perpetrators , jumped from the balcony located QUANTITY off the ground and ran away . The applicant jumped after her but abandoned the chase after TIME when some passers - by appeared nearby on the street . He then called the co - accused who had been waiting in front of the women \u2019s apartment building on his mobile phone and told him that one of the women had jumped from the balcony and that he had unsuccessfully chased her . The applicant agreed on a meeting point with his co - accused where they would pick him up by car once PERSON had left the crime scene and joined them .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime inside the apartment , PERSON , after having overpowered O. , threatened to kill her with his knife if she did not disclose where the women kept their money or if she refused to open the safe for him . Fearing for her life , PERSON opened the safe , from which B. removed LAW , and also handed over the contents of her wallet , LAW . B. left the apartment at TIME , taking the money and P. \u2019s mobile telephone as well as the apartment \u2019s landline telephone with him , and joined the coaccused . The coaccused and PERSON then picked up the applicant at the agreed meeting point in their car . At TIME O. in the apartment .", "CARDINAL . O. and PERSON gave an account of the events to their neighbour E. the morning after the offence . They then left their PERSON apartment out of fear and stayed for DATE with their friend PERSON , one of the victims of the offence committed in GPE , to whom they had also described the offence in detail DATE after it occurred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE L. informed the police of the offence committed against O. and P. in PERSON . CARDINAL DATE O. and PERSON were repeatedly questioned by the police as to the events of CARDINAL and QUANTITY DATE . In those interviews they described the course of events as set out above . The police , having checked O. and P. \u2019s papers , found their residence and occupation in GPE to be in compliance with NORP immigration and trade law .", "CARDINAL . As the witnesses had explained during their police interviews that they intended to return to GPE in DATE to come , on DATE the prosecution asked the investigating judge to question the witnesses in order to obtain a true statement which could be used at the subsequent trial ( \u201c eine[r ] i m sp\u00e4teren PERSON ] wahrheitsgem\u00e4\u00dfe[n ] Aussage \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Thereupon , on DATE , O. and P. were questioned by an investigating judge and again described the course of events as set out above . At that time , the applicant had not yet been informed about the investigation proceedings initiated against him , so as not to put the investigation at risk . No warrant for his arrest had yet been issued and he was not yet represented by counsel . The investigating judge excluded the applicant from the witness hearing before him in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) since he was concerned that the witnesses , whom he had found to be considerably shocked and distressed by the offence , would be afraid of telling the truth in the applicant \u2019s presence . The witnesses confirmed at that hearing that they intended to return to GPE as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . Witnesses O. and PERSON returned to GPE shortly after that hearing . The applicant was subsequently arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The G\u00f6ttingen Regional Court summoned NORP and P. by registered mail to appear at the trial on DATE . However , both witnesses refused to attend the hearing before ORG , relying on medical certificates dated DATE which indicated that they were in an unstable , post - traumatic emotional and psychological state .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG therefore sent letters by registered mail to both witnesses informing them that the court , while not being in a position to compel them to appear at a court hearing in GPE , nonetheless wished to hear them as witnesses at the trial . The court stressed that they would receive protection in GPE and that all costs incurred in attending the hearing would be reimbursed and , proposing several options , asked in what circumstances they would be willing to testify at the trial . While an acknowledgement of receipt was returned for both letters , no response was obtained from PERSON , for her part , informed ORG in writing that she was still traumatised by the offence and would therefore neither agree to appear at the trial in person nor would she agree to testify by means of an audio - visual link . O. further stated that she had nothing to add to the statements she had made in the course of the interviews carried out by the police and the investigating judge in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG nevertheless decided to request legal assistance from the NORP authorities under LAW of DATE , as supplemented by ORG between the Member States of ORG of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , taking the view that O. and P. were obliged under NORP law to appear before a court in GPE following a request for legal assistance . It asked for the witnesses to be summoned before a court in GPE and for an audio - visual link to be set up in order for the hearing to be conducted by the presiding judge of ORG ( audiovisuelle GPE ) . It considered , by reference to LAW ( d ) of the LAW , that defence counsel and the accused , just like the judges and the prosecution , should have the right to put questions to the witnesses for the first time .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the witness hearing of O. and P. scheduled by the competent NORP court for DATE was cancelled shortly before that date by the presiding NORP judge . The latter found that the witnesses , again relying on medical certificates , had demonstrated that they were still suffering from post - traumatic disorder as a consequence of the offence and that further confrontation with the events in PERSON would risk aggravating their condition . O. had further claimed that , following threats by the accused , she feared possible acts of revenge .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE ORG , which had obtained copies of the medical certificates the witnesses had submitted to the NORP court at ORG request , informed its NORP counterpart that , according to the standards of NORP criminal procedure law , the witnesses had not sufficiently substantiated their refusal to testify . The court suggested to the competent NORP judge that the witnesses be examined by a public medical officer ( ORG ) or , alternatively , that they be compelled to attend the hearing . The letter remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , dismissing an objection to the admission of the witnesses\u2019 pre - trial statements raised by counsel for CARDINAL of the co - accused , ordered that the records of O. and PERSON \u2019s interviews by the police and the investigating judge be read out at the trial in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It considered that , as required by the said provisions , there were insurmountable obstacles which made it impossible to hear the witnesses in the foreseeable future as they were unreachable . It had not been possible to hear witnesses O. and P. in the course of the trial since they had returned to their home country , GPE , shortly after their interviews at the investigation stage , and all attempts to hear their evidence at the main hearing , which the court had no means of enforcing , had been to no avail . Pointing out that the courts were under an obligation to conduct proceedings involving deprivation of liberty expeditiously , and in view of the fact that the accused had already been in custody for a considerable period of time , the court was of the opinion that it was not justified to further delay the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG emphasised that at the investigation stage there had been no indication that O. and P. , who had testified on several occasions before the police and then before the investigating judge , would refuse to repeat their statements at a subsequent trial . It considered that , notwithstanding the resulting restrictions for the defence on account of the admission of O. and P. \u2019s pre - trial statements as evidence in the proceedings , the trial as a whole could be conducted fairly and in compliance with the requirements of LAW ( d ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE ORG , considering the facts established as described above , convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of aggravated robbery combined with aggravated extortion involving coercion , committed jointly with other perpetrators in GPE on DATE and in PERSON on DATE , respectively . It sentenced the applicant , who had been represented by counsel at the trial , to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG based its findings of fact concerning the offence committed by the applicant in GPE on the statements made at the trial by the victims L. and PERSON , who had identified the applicant without any hesitation . It further noted that their statements were supported by the statements made at the trial by the police officers who had attended the crime scene and had interviewed PERSON and NORP in the course of the preliminary investigation . In view of these elements , ORG considered that the submissions made by the applicant , who had initially claimed his innocence and had then admitted that he had been in PERSON and ORG flat but had only secretly stolen LAW , alone , after a quarrel with the women , had been refuted .", "CARDINAL . In the establishment of the facts concerning the offence in PERSON , ORG relied in particular on the pre - trial statements made by the victims O. and PERSON , whom it considered to be key witnesses for the prosecution ( ma\u00dfgebliche[n ] Belastungszeuginnen ) , in the course of their police interviews and before the investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , which ran to CARDINAL pages , ORG pointed out that it was aware of the reduced evidentiary value of the records of O. and P. \u2019s pre - trial testimonies . It further took into account the fact that neither the applicant nor counsel for the defence had been provided with an opportunity to examine the only direct witnesses to the offence in PERSON at any stage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the records of O. and P. \u2019s interviews at the investigation stage showed that they had given detailed and coherent descriptions of the circumstances of the offence . Minor contradictions in their statements could be explained by their concern not to disclose their residence and activities to the authorities and by the psychological strain to which they had been subjected during and following the incident . The witnesses had feared problems with the police and acts of revenge by the perpetrators . This explained why they had not reported the offence immediately after the events and why the police had only been informed on DATE by their friend PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG further took note of the fact that O. and P. had failed to identify the applicant when confronted with several photos of potential suspects during the police interviews . It observed that the ORG attention during the incident had been focused on the other perpetrator carrying the knife and that the applicant himself had only stayed a short period of time in the apartment . Their inability to identify the applicant also showed that , contrary to the defence \u2019s allegation , the witnesses had not testified with a view to incriminating him . The court further considered that the fact that the witnesses had failed to attend the trial could be explained by their unease at having to recall , and being questioned about , the offence and therefore did not as such affect their credibility .", "CARDINAL . In its establishment of the facts , ORG further had regard to the following additional evidence : the statements made at the trial by several witnesses to whom O. and PERSON had reported the offence shortly after it happened , namely the GPE neighbour PERSON and their friend PERSON , as well as the police officers and the investigating judge who had examined O. and PERSON at the pre - trial stage ; geographical data and information obtained by tapping the applicant \u2019s and his co - accused \u2019s mobile telephones and by means of a satellite - based global positioning system ( \u201c GPS \u201d ) receiver in the car of CARDINAL of the co - accused ; the applicant \u2019s admission in the course of the trial that he had been in the GPE apartment at the relevant time ; and the similarity in the way in which the offences in GPE and PERSON had been committed .", "CARDINAL . ORG stressed that , once witnesses PERSON and P. had proved to be unavailable , it had ensured that as many as possible of the witnesses who had been in contact with NORP and P. in relation to the events at issue were heard at the trial , in order to verify the GPE credibility .", "CARDINAL . In ORG opinion the fact that the detailed description of the events given in GPE and P. \u2019s pre - trial statements was consistent with the account they had given the TIME after the offence to their neighbour PERSON was a strong indication of their credibility and the veracity of their statements . PERSON had further testified that , on TIME of CARDINAL DATE at TIME , another neighbour , an elderly woman who became scared and angry when she saw PERSON running around in front of her window , had called on her and asked her to accompany her to the women \u2019s apartment to investigate what had happened . O. and PERSON had , however , not answered the door when the neighbours rang the doorbell .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that O. and P. \u2019s description of the events was also consistent with their friend PERSON \u2019s recollection of her conversations with NORP and PERSON after the offence .", "CARDINAL . NORP In addition , ORG noted that the CARDINAL police officers and the investigating judge who had examined O. and P. at the pre - trial stage had all testified at the trial that they had found NORP and PERSON to be credible .", "CARDINAL . ORG stressed that since neither the defence nor the court itself had had an opportunity to observe the main witnesses\u2019 demeanour at the trial or during examination by means of an audio - visual link , it had to exercise particular diligence in assessing the evaluation of the witnesses\u2019 credibility by the police officers and the investigating judge . The court further emphasised that , when taking into account the testimonies given by the ORG neighbour PERSON and their friend PERSON , it had paid special attention to the fact that their statements constituted hearsay evidence and had to be assessed particularly carefully .", "CARDINAL . In this context it had been of relevance that O. and P. \u2019s testimonies as well as the statements of the additional witnesses heard at the trial had been supported by further significant and admissible evidence such as data and information obtained by tapping the applicant \u2019s and the co - accused \u2019s mobile telephones and by means of GPS . The information in question had been gathered in the context of police surveillance measures carried out at the relevant time in the criminal investigation initiated against the accused on suspicion of racketeering and extortion on the PERSON drug scene .", "CARDINAL . It transpired from the geographical data and the recordings of CARDINAL mobile telephone conversations between CARDINAL of the co - accused and the applicant on TIME of CARDINAL DATE at TIME and TIME that the latter had been present in the GPE apartment together with PERSON , and that he had jumped from the balcony in order to chase one of the escaping victims , whom he had failed to capture , while PERSON had stayed in the apartment . Furthermore , an analysis of the GPS data showed that the car of CARDINAL of the co - accused had been parked near the crime scene from TIME to CARDINAL p.m. on TIME of CARDINAL DATE , a period that coincided with the timeframe in which the robbery in question had occurred .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , while the applicant and the co - accused had denied any participation in the robbery as such or any premeditated criminal activity , their own statements at the trial had at least confirmed that CARDINAL of the coaccused together with NORP had visited the GPE apartment in PERSON on TIME before the offence and that they had all been present in the car parked close to the GPE apartment at the time of the offence . The accused had initially stated that a different perpetrator and NORP had been in the apartment at the time of the incident the following day . The applicant had subsequently amended his submissions and claimed that it had been he and PERSON who had gone into the GPE apartment on DATE with a view to making use of the women \u2019s services as prostitutes . He had further conceded that he had followed P. when she escaped over the balcony . He explained that he had done so in order to prevent her from calling the neighbours or the police , since , in view of his criminal record , he had been afraid of getting into trouble and because of the problems he had previously encountered with prostitutes on a similar occasion in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG considered that the very similar way in which the offences had been committed against CARDINAL female victims , foreign nationals working as prostitutes in an apartment , was an additional element indicating that the applicant had also participated in the offence committed in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the body of evidence , taken together , gave a coherent and complete overall picture of events which supported the version provided by witnesses PERSON and PERSON and refuted the contradictory versions of events put forward by the applicant and his co - accused in the course of the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of ORG . He complained that he had not been able to examine the only direct and key witnesses to the offence committed in PERSON at any stage of the proceedings , in breach of LAW and CARDINAL ( d ) of the LAW . As the prosecution authorities , contrary to the case - law of ORG ( the applicant referred to a judgment dated DATE , see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL below ) , had not requested that defence counsel be appointed for him prior to NORP and P. \u2019s hearing before the investigating judge , their statements ought to have been excluded at the trial .", "CARDINAL . In written submissions dated DATE ORG General requested that the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law be dismissed by ORG as manifestly ill - founded in written proceedings , under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG argued that while it was true that the proceedings had been characterised by a \u201c complete loss \u201d of the applicant \u2019s right to examine O. and PERSON ( \u201c GPE des Fragerechts \u201d ) , they had as a whole been fair and there had been no reason to exclude the witness statements of ORG and P. as evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG General considered that ORG had assessed the content of the records of the witnesses\u2019 testimonies read out at the trial particularly carefully and critically . Furthermore , the ORG statements had been neither the sole nor the decisive basis for the applicant \u2019s conviction by ORG , as the latter had based its findings on further significant evidence . In view of the various layers of corroborating evidence the applicant had had ample opportunity to challenge the credibility of the CARDINAL prosecution witnesses and to defend himself effectively .", "CARDINAL . Endorsing ORG reasoning , ORG General further pointed out that there was nothing to demonstrate that the restrictions on the defence \u2019s right to examine witnesses O. and PERSON had been imputable to the domestic authorities . The prosecution authorities had not been obliged to appoint counsel for the applicant in order for counsel to participate in the hearing by the investigating judge . In view of the ORG consistent cooperation , the authorities had had no reason to expect that , despite their return to their home country , they would no longer be available for questioning at the trial , especially as they had been obliged under NORP law to at least participate in a hearing via video link .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE ORG , referring to LAW , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . In its decision of DATE rejecting the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning a violation of his right to be heard ( Anh\u00f6rungsr\u00fcge ) ORG pointed out that any decision dismissing an appeal on the basis of LAW necessarily entailed a reference to the reasoned application by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a constitutional complaint dated DATE against the decisions of ORG of DATE and DATE , the applicant complained , in particular , that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial and of his defence rights under LAW ( d ) of the LAW . He argued that neither he nor his counsel had had the opportunity to question O. and P. at any stage of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG , without providing reasons , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s complaint ( file no . CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
