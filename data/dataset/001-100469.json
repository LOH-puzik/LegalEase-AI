The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant took up the position of organist and choirmaster at the NORP parish church of PERSON ( \u201c the parish church \u201d ) in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of his contract of employment dated DATE stipulated , inter alia , that ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as currently in force , formed an integral part of the contract and that any serious breach of the ORG \u2019s principles constituted a material ground for termination of contract without notice , in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . After the contract had been approved by the ORG \u2019s Vicar General , the applicant took the following oath :", "\u201c I hereby undertake to discharge my professional duties and to fulfil and observe ecclesiastical obligations . \u201d", "CARDINAL . From DATE he also held the position of head musician in the deanery and was paid a gross DATE salary of MONEY ( MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant left his wife , who was the mother of his CARDINAL children . The separation was made public in DATE . Since then the applicant has been living with his new partner , who has also been his representative before the employment tribunals and the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE , after the applicant \u2019s children had told people at their kindergarten that their father was going to have another child , the PERSON of the parish discussed the matter with the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parish church dismissed the applicant with effect from DATE on the ground that he had breached his duty of loyalty under LAW ( the \u201c LAW \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the light of ORG fundamental principles enshrining the sanctity of marriage , the applicant , by having an extramarital relationship with another woman , who was expecting his child , was accused not only of committing adultery but also of bigamy .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s dismissal his wife petitioned for divorce , which was granted on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant took his case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s claim and found that the dismissal of DATE had not terminated his contract of employment . Observing the findings of ORG judgment of DATE ( see PERSON v. GPE , no . PERSON , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) , which had applied the principles set out by ORG in its leading decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it took the view that the applicant \u2019s conduct did not yet ( noch nicht ) justify his dismissal , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the ORG \u2019s view , he had not been bound by heightened duties of loyalty ( gesteigerte ORG ) because he did not perform pastoral or catechistic duties , did not have a canonical mandate ( missio canonica ) and was not a member of the managerial staff ( leitender PERSON ) within the meaning of LAW of LAW . In the ORG \u2019s view , the respondent had not proved that the applicant \u2019s duties as head musician of the deanery were equivalent to managerial office ; accordingly , pursuant to LAW , the parish church should first have summoned him for a clarification interview ( kl\u00e4rendes LOC ) or issued him with a warning ( ORG ) before having recourse to the most serious of the disciplinary measures available , his dismissal , especially on account of his length of service in the parish church ( DATE ) and the fact that he had practically no chance of finding work as an organist on the labour - market outside ORG . ORG observed that an employer could only be dispensed from the obligation to issue a warning in the first instance where the employee could not expect his or her conduct to be tolerated by the employer in view of the seriousness of the breach , or where he or she was not inclined to perform , or capable of performing , his or her professional duties .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , in so far as the parish church reproached the applicant for having fathered a child out of wedlock , such a shortcoming , after DATE of service , did not attain a level of seriousness that justified dismissal on that ground alone without prior warning . LAW expressly required consideration of the question whether a staff member opposed the precepts of ORG or , whilst recognising its precepts , had not succeeded in complying with them in practice . The ORG added that the parish church had failed to prove that the applicant had told the PERSON he did not wish to put an end to his new relationship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the parish church . It endorsed the findings of ORG , observing that the reason for dismissal had not been the applicant \u2019s paternity of a child born out of wedlock but rather his long - term extramarital relationship . The ORG pointed out that , whilst the applicant \u2019s duties in the ORG did not fall under LAW of LAW , his dismissal nevertheless remained possible under LAW , in view of the proximity between his work and the ORG \u2019s proclamatory mission . However , after formally hearing evidence from the applicant as a party to the proceedings , ORG reached the conclusion that the dismissal had been vitiated by a procedural omission , as the parish church had failed to prove that the PERSON had first sought to induce the applicant to put an end to his extramarital relationship . In view of the fundamental significance of the case , the ORG granted leave to appeal on points of law before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG . It took the view that LAW , which required a clarification interview , applied not only to dismissals decided under paragraph CARDINAL of that Article ( dismissal as the ultimate measure for a serious breach ) but also to those based on paragraph CARDINAL ( exclusion from post as a matter of principle , and possibility of waiving dismissal on an exceptional basis ) . The difference between the CARDINAL paragraphs being merely a question of degree , a clarification interview would be necessary in all cases . In the case before it , ORG took the view that considering the lack of clarity of the ecclesiastical provisions applicable to the applicant as to whether or not his functions entailed heightened duties of loyalty , it had not been clearly established that the applicant could have known with sufficient foreseeability that his dismissal would fall under LAW of LAW . If the holding of a clarification interview had been mandatory in the applicant \u2019s case , the absence of such an interview was thus capable of rendering his dismissal wrongful ( sozialwidrig ) . However , ORG observed that ORG had been mistaken in finding that no interview had been conducted with the applicant . On that point it took the view that ORG had wrongly omitted to hear evidence also from the PERSON , as a party to the proceedings , in order to establish whether or not he had attempted to induce the applicant to put an end to his extramarital relationship and that , accordingly , the judgment appealed against was to be quashed . However , since the facts had not yet been sufficiently established , ORG was not in a position to rule on the question whether the applicant \u2019s dismissal had been justified . As a result , it referred the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that , where an employing church entered into employment contracts , it used not only the freedom of contract ( PERSON ) provided for under ordinary domestic labour law , but also the institutional guarantee of autonomous management enjoyed by the Churches . Church labour law was therefore applicable in conjunction with the ordinary domestic law . The enactment of LAW , in particular Articles CARDINAL and DATE , reflected the principle of ORG autonomy , as provided for in LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The application of domestic labour law could not call into question the specificity of ecclesiastical service , which was protected by LAW . ORG was therefore entitled to base its contracts of employment on the model of a NORP service community and , in particular , to require its NORP employees to recognise and comply with the principles of NORP religious and moral precepts , as provided for in LAW . As the credibility of the ORG might depend on its employees\u2019 conduct and respect for the ecclesiastical order , including in DATE lives , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW stipulated the applicable criteria on which to assess contractual duties of loyalty and the seriousness of any breach of such duties .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that the specificity of the duties of loyalty lay in the fact that they concerned not so much occupational duties as conduct falling within secondary duties or even private life . It noted that the sanctity of marriage formed an integral part of the basic principles of ORG religious and moral precepts . The case concerned not only a relationship and a contract but also a sacrament . Even though adultery was no longer an offence since the new version of LAW of Canon Law , marriage had retained its indissoluble , perpetual and exclusive nature .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that , when employment tribunals applied ordinary labour law , they were bound by the precepts of religious denominations in so far as those precepts took account of the criteria recognised by established Churches . However , in applying those precepts the employment ORG decisions could not run counter to the fundamental principles of law , which included the concepts of \u201c morality \u201d and \u201c public order \u201d . According to the case - law of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , it was for the employment tribunals to ensure that religious denominations did not impose excessive requirements of loyalty on their employees . ORG found that the beliefs of the ORG regarding fidelity in marriage were not at odds with the fundamental principles of law . Marriage enjoyed special protection under LAW and adultery was regarded as a serious fault in a civil law context . The ORG observed that it had , moreover , already found in its judgment of DATE that adultery constituted a serious fault in the view of ORG ( see PERSON , cited above , LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that ORG had rightly considered that the applicant \u2019s conduct could be characterised as a serious personal moral fault , within the meaning of LAW , and that it therefore constituted a ground for dismissal for the purposes of LAW . It noted that the applicant \u2019s opinion that only a new marriage \u2013 which , according to ORG belief would be null and void \u2013 could be regarded as a serious breach was not substantiated by any provision of LAW or other instruments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the case had been referred back to it , ORG upheld the parish church \u2019s appeal against the judgment of ORG of DATE . After hearing evidence from the PERSON as a party to the proceedings , and with the applicant having acknowledged that he had , at his interview of DATE with the PERSON , described as permanent his new relationship with his lawyer , the ORG held that the parish church had dismissed him in accordance with LAW . According to the PERSON \u2019s statements at the hearing DATE which the ORG found more credible than those of the applicant \u2013 there had indeed been an interview between the CARDINAL parties . In view of the applicant \u2019s inflexible position as regards his new relationship , the PERSON and the parish church had rightly considered that a prior warning would be superfluous .", "CARDINAL . ORG added that it was not unaware of the consequences of the applicant \u2019s dismissal , which would most likely prevent him from exercising his profession and from paying the same amount in child maintenance . However , it admitted that the parish church could not continue to employ the applicant without losing all credibility in relation to the mandatory nature of its religious and moral precepts . In this connection it was necessary to take into account the fact that , even if the applicant was not among those members of staff that were bound by heightened duties of loyalty under LAW , his activity was closely related to the ORG \u2019s proclamatory mission . It was thus hardly conceivable vis - \u00e0 - vis the general public that the applicant and the PERSON could continue to perform the liturgy together . According to ORG , the interests of the parish church prevailed by far over those of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found inadmissible a request by the applicant to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG disallowed a constitutional complaint by the applicant ( no . DATE ) on the ground that it had insufficient chances of succeeding . In ORG opinion , the decisions appealed against did not raise any constitutional issues in the light of its DATE judgment ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been employed as choirmaster for a NORP church in GPE and he also directs CARDINAL choirs on a voluntary basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the parish church issued a second dismissal with effect from DATE . On DATE ORG rejected an application for annulment lodged by the applicant . To date those proceedings are still pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The status of Churches and religious societies is governed mainly by Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ( known as the \u201c ORG \u201d DATE ) of the Weimar Constitution of CARDINAL DATE , as incorporated into LAW . A large number of Churches and religious societies , including ORG ( CARDINAL members ) and ORG of Germany ( CARDINAL members ) , commonly known as the CARDINAL \u201c big Churches \u201d ( PERSON ) , have the status of public - law entity but are not , however , part of government . Other religious denominations have legal capacity under civil law . The status of public - law entity enables the Churches concerned , among other things , to receive ORG tax and to employ public servants .", "CARDINAL . ORG and ORG employ CARDINAL individuals , particularly in their charities , making them the second largest employer in GPE after the ORG . The CARDINAL main charities alone , ORG ( NORP ) and PERSON ( NORP ) , employ respectively CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u201c staff members \u201d . Their activities concern mainly the running of hospitals , schools , kindergartens , homes for children and the elderly and advice centres ( for HIV sufferers , migrants , victims of domestic violence ) . The NORP and Protestant Churches regard their social activities as being part of their proclamatory mission and a way of putting the \u201c love thy neighbour \u201d commandment into practice .", "CARDINAL . The law governing employment relationships between Churches and their public servants is based on civil - service law . As regards other employees , the ordinary domestic labour law will apply , but with a certain number of exceptions stemming from the Churches\u2019 right of autonomy . As a result of that right they may , among other things , impose specific duties of loyalty on their employees ( see below ) . Moreover , in terms of industrial - relations law , Churches and their institutions are not bound by the domestic right of employee participation . Considering that their activities , especially charity work , are based on the model of a NORP service community , formed by the whole body of staff , they do not accept legal structures based in principle on an opposition between employer and employee . ORG and most of the NORP denominations thus refuse to enter into collective agreements with trade unions , and the right to strike or lock - out are non - existent in their institutions . However , they have created their own systems of representation and staff participation in management .", "CARDINAL . As regards their financing , Churches and religious societies having the status of public - law entity are entitled to receive ORG tax , which constitutes a significant portion ( PERCENT ) of their total budget . Church tax is levied by the ORG tax authorities on behalf of ORG and religious societies , which in return pay ORG of their tax revenue . This is based on income tax , amounting to CARDINAL thereof . It is paid directly to the ORG by the taxpayer \u2019s employer together with income tax . In this connection municipal authorities issue \u201c wage - tax cards \u201d ( Lohnsteuerkarte ) that employees are required to give their employers . The card contains information about the employee , including the tax regime , rebates for dependent children and membership of a ORG or religious society entitled to receive ORG tax .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Basic PERSON provides that Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE form an integral part of LAW . Article CARDINAL reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) There shall be no ORG church .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP The freedom to form religious societies shall be guaranteed . ...", "( CARDINAL ) NORP societies shall regulate and administer their affairs independently within the limits of the law that applies to all . They shall confer their offices without the involvement of central government or local authorities .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP societies shall acquire legal capacity in accordance with the general provisions of civil law .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP societies shall remain entities under public law in so far as they have enjoyed that status in the past . Other religious societies shall be granted the same rights upon application , if their constitution and size of membership provide guarantees of long - term existence ...", "( CARDINAL ) NORP societies that are entities under public law shall be entitled to levy taxes on the basis of the civil taxation rolls in accordance with the law of the Land .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG whose purpose is to foster a philosophical belief in the community shall have the same status as religious societies .", "( CARDINAL) Such further regulation as may be required for the implementation of the present provisions shall be a matter for the legislature of the Land . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a leading judgment on the validity of dismissals of ORG employees on the grounds of a breach of their duty of loyalty ( ORG . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE , judgment published in the Reports of Judgments and Decisions of ORG , volume CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) . The subject matter of the constitutional complaints was , on the one hand , the dismissal of a doctor practising in a NORP hospital on account of a view he had expressed on abortion , and on the other , the dismissal of a commercial employee of a youth home run by a NORP monastic order because he had left ORG . The CARDINAL dismissed employees had been successful in proceedings before the employment tribunals and the employing Churches had then taken their cases to ORG , which allowed their complaints .", "ORG observed that the right of religious societies to manage their affairs autonomously within the limit of the general law , as enshrined in LAW of LAW , applied not only to the Churches , but also , regardless of legal form , to any institution associated with them and participating in their mission . This constitutional guarantee included the right for the Churches to choose the staff they needed for the fulfilment of their mission and , accordingly , to enter into employment contracts . When the Churches chose to exercise their freedom of contract , like everyone else , then ordinary domestic labour law became applicable . However , the applicability of labour law did not have the effect of removing employment relations from the domain of a ORG \u2019s own affairs . The constitutional guarantee of autonomy ( PERSON ) afforded to Churches affected the content of contracts of employment . A ORG could thus , in the interest of its own credibility , base its contracts of employment on the model of a NORP service community , and , accordingly , require its employees to respect the general principles of its dogmatic and moral doctrines and the basic duties applicable to all its members . That did not mean , however , that the legal status of a ORG \u2019s employee became \u201c clericalised \u201d . It merely concerned the nature and scope of duties of loyalty stemming from employment contracts . The civil - law employment relationship was not thereby transformed into an ecclesiastical status that subsumed the employee and dominated his entire private life .", "ORG further observed that the freedom of the Churches to manage their own affairs was circumscribed by the general law , including those provisions that granted protection against wrongful dismissal such as section CARDINAL of the Protection from Dismissal Act and LAW . However , those provisions did not automatically prevail over the so - called \u201c ORG \u201d of LAW . It was thus appropriate to balance the different rights , with particular weight being accorded to the Churches\u2019 interpretation of their own faith and legal order . ORG continued as follows :", "\u201c It follows that , whilst the constitutional guarantee of the Churches\u2019 right to manage their affairs autonomously permits them to base their contracts of employment on the model of a NORP service community and to lay down the basic ecclesiastical duties , such guarantee must be considered in terms of constitutional law and its scope must be stipulated when it comes to applying the provisions concerning protection against dismissal to dismissals for a breach of duties of loyalty . An application of labour law that did not take account of the duties of ORG employees to respect the fundamental principles of NORP life that the Churches are entitled to impose would be at odds with their constitutional right of autonomy .", "Consequently , in the event of a dispute , the employment tribunals must apply the criteria laid down by the Churches concerning the assessment of the contractual duties of loyalty since the LAW affords to Churches the right to decide on such matters autonomously . It is thus in principle for the established Churches ( verfasste PERSON ) to determine what is required by \u2018 the credibility of the ORG and its proclamation\u2019 , what \u2018 specific ecclesiastical ORG are , what \u2018 proximity\u2019 to the ORG means , what \u2018 the basic principles of religious and moral precepts are\u2019 and what constitutes a breach DATE a serious breach in some cases \u2013 of its precepts . Matters governed by the Churches\u2019 right of autonomy also include the question whether and how a scale of duties of loyalty must be applied to staff members working in the service of a ORG .", "In so far as such principles correspond to the criteria laid down by the established Churches , a question that must be referred by the tribunal to the ORG authorities in case of doubt , the employment tribunals will be bound by them , unless by applying them they put themselves in conflict with the fundamental principles of law , such as the general prohibition of arbitrariness , the principle of morality , and public order . It is therefore a matter for the domestic courts to ensure that ecclesiastical institutions do not impose on their staff unacceptable demands of loyalty that might , in some cases , be at odds with the very principles of the ORG ...", "If the tribunal reaches the conclusion that there has been a breach of such duties of loyalty , it must ascertain whether that breach objectively justifies dismissal under LAW and LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG ( GPE ) provides , in particular , that a dismissal is socially unjustified unless based on reasons related to the employee himself or his conduct .", "Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code allows each party to the contract to terminate the employment relationship without notice on serious grounds .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( b ) of ORG and Pay Regulations ( ORG Arbeits- und GPE ) for the Dioceses ( or Archdioceses ) of GPE , GPE , GPE ( GPE ) , PERSON ( part of GPE ) and GPE , dated DATE , as in force until DATE , required that the way of life of the employee and the members of his household be compliant with the basic principles of the religious and moral precepts of ORG .", "Article CARDINAL provided that respect , manifested in words and deeds , for the principles of ORG , and a conduct in line with that required by ecclesiastical staff members , formed part of the employee \u2019s duties .", "LAW , in the version currently in force , provides in particular that a serious ground justifying dismissal without notice is constituted by a patent breach ( gro\u00dfer \u00e4usserer GPE ) of ecclesiastical principles , for example the fact of leaving the Church ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW for ecclesiastical service in the context of ecclesiastical employment relationships ( PERSON f\u00fcr den kirchlichen ORG i m Rahmen kirchlicher GPE ) , which were adopted by ORG of NORP Bishops on DATE and which came into force in the Diocese of Essen on DATE , read in their relevant parts as follows .", "\u201c CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG sent a letter of formal notice to GPE ( procedure no . CARDINAL ) concerning the transposition of Directive CARDINAL into NORP law and concerning , among other things , \u201c dismissals not covered by anti - discrimination law \u201d . It noted that , whilst the Directive permitted a difference in treatment only if the religion or belief constituted a genuine , legitimate and justified occupational requirement , having regard to the organisation \u2019s ethos , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG also provided for different treatment when the religion or belief constituted an occupational requirement on the basis of its right of autonomy and the religious society \u2019s or association \u2019s own perception , without necessarily having regard to the nature of the activity . According to ORG , such a difference not being covered by the terms of the Directive , this manner of transposition did not fulfil the Directive \u2019s objectives . Such transposition would enable a religious society to define an occupational requirement purely on account of its right of autonomy , without the requirement undergoing a proportionality test in the light of the actual activity . In addition , whilst LAW presented the question in terms of genuine and determining occupational requirements , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW had reduced that notion to CARDINAL of justified occupational requirements , which was a weaker standard than that of the Directive . ORG further observed that , whilst an organisation \u2019s particular ethos played a role in determining the occupational requirement , it should not be the sole criterion , otherwise NORP legislation might not guarantee such a difference in treatment and , even as regards ordinary assistance activities , specific requirements related to religious affiliation might be imposed .", "On DATE ORG sent a reasoned opinion to GPE .
