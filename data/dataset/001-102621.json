The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in a psychiatric hospital in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of sexual abuse of children and gave him a cumulative suspended sentence of DATE imprisonment with probation . The applicant was found to have sexually abused a DATE girl on CARDINAL occasions in DATE . As confirmed by an expert , the applicant suffered from a pathological mental disorder such that diminished criminal responsibility ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) could not be excluded . On DATE this sentence was remitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of rape and gave him a cumulative sentence of DATE and DATE imprisonment ( DATE and DATE for each count of rape ) . ORG found that the applicant had raped DATE S. twice within DATE by use of force in DATE . It was reported by a psychiatric and a psychological expert that the applicant suffered from a continuous cerebral decomposition , due to which his criminal responsibility was diminished .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG finding of facts , the applicant had had an extra - marital relationship with PERSON 's mother NORP since DATE . Since then he had sexually abused PERSON , then aged DATE , at least once DATE . Since DATE he had had himself sexually satisfied also by P. , A. 's elder daughter , then aged DATE . These offences were time - barred when the victims reported them to the prosecution authorities . In DATE the applicant persuaded DATE P. to have sexual intercourse with him in exchange for his paying the family 's electricity bill . P. , who had initially consented , then asked the applicant to stop due to severe pain caused by the intercourse and resisted heavily , whereupon the applicant raped her by use of force . The prosecution of this offence was discontinued in view of the CARDINAL counts of rape of which the applicant was convicted .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not examine whether preventive detention was to be ordered against the applicant because the relevant LAW was not applicable to offences which , as was the case for those of which the applicant was found guilty , had been committed prior to DATE ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Introductory Law to LAW , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant served his full sentence of DATE and DATE imprisonment until DATE . CARDINAL prior to that date , on DATE , the applicant was informed by the psychologist of GPE prison that he could possibly be detained beyond DATE under LAW for the placement of particularly dangerous offenders very liable to reoffend ( \u201c NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act \u201d ) of CARDINAL January CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a chamber responsible for the execution of sentences composed of CARDINAL professional judges , having heard the applicant and his counsel as well as the representatives of GPE prison and CARDINAL medical experts , ordered the applicant 's placement in prison for an indefinite duration under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant was liable to be placed in prison under section LAW . He had served a sentence imposed following his conviction for CARDINAL counts of rape , the offences being serious enough to meet the requirements of LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG further subscribed to the views expressed by both a psychological and a psychiatric and psychotherapeutic expert , who , in their reports dated DATE and DATE respectively , had found that following the applicant 's conviction , new facts had evolved during his detention which warranted the conclusion that the applicant currently posed a serious threat to the sexual self - determination of others . It noted that the applicant had failed to participate in any therapeutic measure to address his sexual problems which had led to his offences and , by denying his offences in prison , had made any therapy pointless . Moreover , due to his organic personality disorder , which led to a continuous decomposition of his personality , the applicant was no longer able to reflect on his possibly deviant sexual behaviour and to discern limits . Statistically , his advancing age also increased his interest in children as substitutes .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that neither the applicant 's placement in a psychiatric hospital ( Article CARDINAL of LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) nor his preventive detention ( LAW see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) had been ordered ( section QUANTITY of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ) . Moreover , the applicant had not been placed in a psychiatric hospital under LAW on the Placement in an Institution of Mentally Ill Persons and Their Care of DATE ( see section QUANTITY of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act and paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In fact , ORG had refused to request the applicant 's placement in a psychiatric hospital under LAW after the applicant had served his prison sentence .", "CARDINAL . Taking into consideration the experts ' findings , ORG found that there was a high risk that the applicant might re - offend . Not least because of his limited faculties , there was a concrete danger that reactions of his victims would result in his committing very serious offences .", "CARDINAL . ORG stated that it considered the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act to be constitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal as ill - founded . Endorsing the reasons given by ORG , it found that the applicant was liable to be placed in prison pursuant to CARDINAL of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act . In particular , as had been convincingly shown by CARDINAL experts , there was a considerable risk of recidivism .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act was constitutional . It struck a fair balance between the applicant 's interest in his liberty and the public interest in security . There was no breach of the principle of legitimate trust ( GPE ) , as the applicant had been informed in writing by the prison authorities that it was necessary for him to undergo therapy . Nor did the LAW violate the prohibition on being punished twice for the same offence , as it was not his past offences , but the risk of his re - offending in the future which was decisive for his placement . Furthermore , the NORP legislature had the legislative power to pass the Act in question .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG against the decisions of ORG of DATE and ORG of DATE . He argued that his detention was illegal because the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act was unconstitutional , notably as the NORP legislature had not had the power to legislate on the subject - matter in question . Moreover , the provisions of the Act violated the prohibition of punishment without law and human dignity as they treated him as a mere \u201c disturbing object \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having held a hearing , partly allowed the applicant 's constitutional complaint PERSON ( no . DATE ) , together with that of another complainant ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , PERSON , who was the applicant in application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL before this ORG . It found unanimously that the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act , as well as another comparable Act , GPE ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act , were incompatible with LAW CARDINAL no . CARDINAL read in conjunction with Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as the L\u00e4nder did not have the power to enact the legislation in question .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the area covered by the ORG statutes regulating the placement of offenders in detention after they had served their prison sentence \u2013 so - called retrospective preventive detention ( nachtr\u00e4gliche GPE ) DATE fell within the concurrent legislative powers of the Federation as it involved criminal law within the meaning of LAW . The term \u201c criminal law \u201d in connection with the question of power to legislate covered the regulation of all , even subsequent , repressive or preventive penal responses by the ORG which used the offence as a connecting factor , which were aimed exclusively at offenders and which were factually justified by the original offence . This interpretation was compatible with the fact that measures of correction and prevention , such as preventive detention , were not to be classified as \u201c penalties \u201d to which the prohibition of retrospective punishment under LAW applied . The objective of this latter provision , laying down a fundamental right , was different from that of a provision on legislative competence such as LAW . Retrospective placement in prison under the ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Acts enacted by the ORG was very similar to preventive detention under LAW , both in relation to the applicable procedure and in relation to its nature , and had been authorised in order to complement the measures of correction and prevention under LAW by the possibility of a preventive detention which had not been ordered in the judgment of the sentencing court . The LOC therefore did not have the power to make laws on the placement of criminals in detention because the Federation exhausted its concurrent legislative power in this area . The court thus disagreed with the submissions of ORG , which had taken the view that the ORG had legislative competence to regulate the subject - matter at issue .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Constitutional Court found that placement in prison for an indefinite duration or for indefinitely renewable periods after an offender had served his full prison sentence constituted a particularly serious interference with the offender 's right to liberty as protected by LAW . It stressed that in order for the long - term deprivation of liberty ordered independently of a person 's guilt to remain proportionate , it was necessary for it to be dependent on the prior commission of a serious offence . Moreover , the courts ordering placement in detention had to make their prognosis of the offender 's dangerousness based on a comprehensive assessment of his offences and personality .", "CARDINAL . ORG , by a majority of CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL in this respect , further found that the fact that the ORG did not have power to legislate did not result in the contested statutes being void . Instead , they were merely declared incompatible with LAW and ORG ordered their continued application until DATE . Until the expiry of that transitional period , the applicant 's detention was covered by the decision of ORG , based on the ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act , which remained applicable .", "CARDINAL . The court argued that ORG did not prescribe that a statute found to be unconstitutional was void under all circumstances , pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , first sentence , of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The LAW also allowed a mere declaration of incompatibility with LAW pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ( see paragraph DATE below ) . Under ORG case - law , a mere declaration of incompatibility and a limited continued application of the unconstitutional statute was possible if the immediate invalidity of the contested law removed the basis for protection of paramount interests related to the public good , and if the result of weighing those interests against the fundamental rights affected was that the interference had to be accepted for a transitional period .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the instant case , there was a paramount interest in protecting the public against offenders who had been found by CARDINAL experts and by courts to currently pose a considerable danger to the life , physical integrity , freedom or sexual self - determination of others . In the event of the statutes being declared void , persons who were extremely dangerous would have to be released without the federal legislature having taken the decision imposed upon it \u2013 because it mistakenly assumed it had no power to do so \u2013 as to whether it was necessary to enact federal legislation . Such federal legislation on retrospective preventive detention could be compatible with LAW if it applied only in limited circumstances .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public interest in effective protection from dangerous offenders could , in exceptional circumstances , outweigh the interest of the offender concerned by the unconstitutional Act in his personal liberty as guaranteed by LAW of LAW . For the interference with the right to liberty to be proportionate , it was , however , necessary for the transitional period , during which ORG order of continued application of the unconstitutional Acts served as the basis for the detention of the offenders concerned , to be short . Moreover , the criminal courts which had ordered placements on the basis of the impugned Acts had to re - examine without delay whether the placements complied with the reasoning set out in ORG judgment . In particular , they had to base their placement decisions on a properly reasoned expert 's opinion as to the dangerousness of the offender in question , in the light of his personality and the offences committed . Furthermore , they were authorised to order that the offender 's placement be executed in a psychiatric hospital ( DATE of LAW ) if the offender 's reintegration into society could better be furthered thereby , as prescribed by Article DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the partly dissenting opinion of CARDINAL judges , the unanimous finding of the ORG that the impugned Acts were unconstitutional should have led to their being declared void . As a consequence , the complainants would have had to be released . During the transitional period , the complainants were therefore detained without a legal basis .", "CARDINAL . NORP The minority argued that by ordering the continued application of an LAW which it had found to be unconstitutional , ORG took responsibilities which , in accordance with the principle of separation of powers , were for the legislature to assume . Moreover , by ordering a continued application of the LOC statutes , it suggested that the Federal legislature authorise subsequent preventive detention , a measure which the GPE , when reforming the provisions on preventive detention in DATE and DATE , had deliberately chosen not to introduce . The minority of judges stressed that there were numerous other , less intrusive instruments available to the courts , police and social authorities to avert the dangers posed by dangerous convicts on their release .", "CARDINAL . In the minority 's submission , the court 's order that the ORG statutes continued to apply was also incompatible with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to that Article , a person 's liberty could only be restricted by virtue of a statute enacted by ORG and only in compliance with the forms prescribed therein . ORG order that the statutes continued to apply was , on the contrary , based on customary law and , being a court order , did not justify the deprivation of liberty . The minority further stressed that section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of ORG , according to which a decision of ORG had force of law , was applicable only to a declaration that a statute was void and no longer applied , and not to a declaration , based on that court 's case - law , that an unconstitutional statute continued to apply .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the minority took the view that the court 's order of continued application of the LOC statutes disregarded the prohibition on the enactment of laws with retrospective effect . After serving the sentence imposed on them by the criminal courts , offenders had a legitimate expectation of release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to suspend for DATE the applicant 's placement in prison pursuant to its order dated DATE . It instructed him to reside in an old people 's home in PERSON and not to leave the home without the permission of his custodian ( ORG ) . Having regard to the findings of a psychiatric expert , ORG found that the applicant 's placement in the psychiatric department of an old people 's home sufficiently averted the dangers he posed for the sexual self - determination of others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was again detained in GPE prison under a detention order issued under the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG revoked the suspension of the applicant 's placement in prison . It found that the applicant had repeatedly sexually harassed several old women suffering from dementia in the old people 's home where he had been living . By this behaviour , the applicant had shown that he still posed a serious threat to the sexual self - determination of others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant 's placement under the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act , read in conjunction with the judgment of ORG of DATE , was to be executed in a psychiatric hospital in order to further his reintegration into society . On DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant 's subsequent preventive detention under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) which was to be executed in a psychiatric hospital . On DATE ORG quashed that order and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having regard to the acts committed by the applicant in the old people 's home ( sexual harassment of persons incapable of resisting ) , ordered the applicant 's placement in a psychiatric hospital under LAW . In view of that decision , the prosecution then applied to discontinue the proceedings concerning the applicant 's subsequent preventive detention that were pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . Initially , the continued detention of convicted offenders who had served their sentence in order to protect the public was solely regulated in federal legislation , notably in the provisions on preventive detention ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ) , a so - called measure of correction and prevention ( GPE der Besserung und GPE ) . A comprehensive summary of the provisions of LAW and of LAW governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention , in particular preventive detention , and the making , review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders , is contained in the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . The provisions relevant to the present case will be summarised below .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , the criminal sentencing court may , at the time of the offender 's conviction , order his preventive detention under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL provides that the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to DATE imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied . Firstly , the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already , to DATE imprisonment in each case , for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence . Secondly , the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for DATE . Thirdly , a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that , owing to his propensity to commit serious offences , notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage , the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public .", "CARDINAL . Under Article DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , the court may transfer a perpetrator against whom preventive detention has been ordered to a psychiatric hospital subsequently if the perpetrator 's reintegration into society can be better promoted thereby .", "CARDINAL . NORP The provisions on preventive detention underwent a reform in DATE .", "CARDINAL . By the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other LAW ( Gesetz zur PERSON und anderen gef\u00e4hrlichen ORG CARDINAL DATE , which entered into force on ORG CARDINAL DATE , a new paragraph CARDINAL was inserted into LAW . Pursuant to that provision , preventive detention could also be ordered for certain serious offences ( including rape and sexual abuse of children ) if the perpetrator had committed CARDINAL such offences which were to be punished separately with DATE imprisonment , if he was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of DATE imprisonment for these offences and if he presented a danger to the public as prescribed in LAW , even if the perpetrator had not previously been convicted and detained as required in paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL was only applicable if the perpetrator had committed CARDINAL of the offences listed in that provision after DATE ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Introductory Law to LAW , in its version then in force ) .", "CARDINAL . However , although the issue had been raised on several occasions in the course of the legislative process ( see the judgment of ORG of DATE in the present case , A.I.CARDINAL . and CARDINAL . , pp . CARDINAL ) , the Federal legislature did not choose to introduce a legal basis for ordering an offender 's preventive detention retrospectively after a sentencing court 's judgment which had not ordered this measure ( retrospective preventive detention \u2013 nachtr\u00e4gliche GPE ) if it became apparent only after the final judgment , notably during the convict 's detention , that he was a danger to the public . Unlike several L\u00e4nder , ORG considered at the relevant time that it was the ORG parliaments , and not ORG , which had the power to enact legislation on that issue ( see , for instance , ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of the foregoing , several ORG parliaments passed Acts , based on their legislative competence for the preventive aversion of dangers ( Gefahrenabwehr ) , introducing retrospective detention of convicted offenders for preventive purposes . In doing so , the ORG were reacting to the fact that the Federation had not enacted corresponding legislation .", "CARDINAL . The Land of Bavaria , in particular , enacted LAW for the placement of particularly dangerous offenders very liable to reoffend ( Bayerisches Gesetz zur PERSON besonders r\u00fcckfallgef\u00e4hrdeten hochgef\u00e4hrlichen Straft\u00e4tern \u2013 Bavarian ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ) of DATE , which entered into force on DATE . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of that Act , ORG could order a convicted offender 's placement in prison if the latter was serving a sentence under the conditions laid down in LAW and if facts having come to light after the offender 's conviction showed that he currently posed a serious risk to life and limb or sexual self - determination of others , in particular because during the execution of his prison sentence he had persistently refused to cooperate in attaining the objective of the execution of his sentence , notably by declining or discontinuing psychotherapy or social therapy aimed at preventing recidivism . Such order was not to be made or was to be quashed if the person concerned was placed in a psychiatric hospital under LAW or in preventive detention under LAW ( LAW NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ) or if he was placed in a psychiatric hospital under LAW on the Placement in an Institution of Mentally Ill Persons and Their Care ( section QUANTITY of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act prescribed that retrospective detention for preventive purposes was to be ordered for an indefinite period unless it was to be expected that the person concerned would no longer be dangerous after a certain time .", "CARDINAL . A chamber of ORG responsible for the execution of sentences had jurisdiction to order a convicted offender 's placement in prison for preventive purposes at the request of the prison in which the person concerned was serving his sentence . ORG had to consult CARDINAL experts on the dangerousness of the person concerned before taking its decision ( see sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ) . It had to review DATE whether the placement in prison of the person concerned was still necessary and had to suspend the placement and put him on probation if it was no longer necessary ( section CARDINAL of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ) . The placement order was to be executed in a prison ; for the execution of the placement , Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW ( which contain special rules for the execution of preventive detention orders made under LAW ) applied by analogy ( section CARDINAL of the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Federal legislature enacted the Introduction of Retrospective Preventive Detention Act ( Gesetz zur Einf\u00fchrung der nachtr\u00e4glichen GPE ) , which entered into force on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the newly introduced Article CARDINAL of LAW , the court may order preventive detention retrospectively , in particular , if , prior to the end of a term of imprisonment imposed on conviction for crimes punishable with DATE imprisonment against life , limb , personal liberty or sexual self - determination or for offences listed in LAW , evidence comes to light which indicates that the convicted person presents a significant danger to the general public . An overall assessment of the convicted offender 's personality , his offences and additionally his development during detention must have shown that he was very liable to commit serious offences by which the victims would be seriously harmed ; moreover , the other conditions listed in LAW had to be met ( LAW CARDINALb ) .", "CARDINAL . The newly introduced Article CARDINAL of LAW was applicable to persons who had been placed in detention under the NORP ( Dangerous Offenders ' ) Placement Act ( section CARDINAL of the Introductory Law to LAW , as amended ) .", "CARDINAL . The detention of mentally ill persons is provided for , first of all , in LAW as a measure of correction and prevention if the detention is ordered in relation to an unlawful act committed by the person concerned . LAW provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility or with diminished criminal responsibility , the court will order his placement \u2013 without any maximum duration \u2013 in a psychiatric hospital if a comprehensive assessment of the defendant and his acts reveals that , as a result of his condition , he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore a danger to the general public .", "CARDINAL .

Such an order may only be executed as long as no measure under LAW has been taken ( LAW of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The distribution of legislative powers between the Federation and the ORG is laid down in LAW and CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . Pursuant to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL the ORG have the right to legislate in so far as LAW does not confer legislative power on the Federation . Pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL of LAW , the GPE has concurrent power to legislate ( konkurrierende PERSON ) in the domain of criminal law . In relation to subject - matter in which ORG and the ORG have concurrent power to legislate , the L\u00e4nder are authorised to legislate as long as and in so far as the GPE has not exercised its power to legislate by enacting a law ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Basic Law governs legal guarantees in the event of deprivation of liberty . Under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , personal liberty may only be restricted pursuant to a law enacted by ORG and then only in compliance with the procedures prescribed therein .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of ORG , the decision of ORG on a constitutional complaint has force of law ( ORG ) if that court declares a law to be compatible or incompatible with LAW or to be void .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG provides that if a constitutional complaint against a law is upheld , the law has to be declared void . The same applies if a constitutional complaint against a decision is upheld as the decision quashed was based on an unconstitutional law .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to ORG well - established ORG case - law , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG is , however , interpreted in a flexible manner . Instead of declaring a statute to be void ab initio , ORG may also solely declare it to be incompatible with the provisions of LAW . It proceeds in this manner notably in cases in which , by declaring a statute void , it would create a situation which would be even less compatible with LAW ( see , for example , the decisions of ORG , Collection of the decisions of ORG ) vol . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . , CARDINAL , CARDINAL et seq . , vol . CARDINAL , pp .
