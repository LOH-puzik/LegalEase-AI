GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , PERSON , of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the father of the child NORP , born out of wedlock on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant acknowledged paternity immediately after his son \u2019s birth .", "The applicant and the child \u2019s mother ( PERSON ) separated permanently in DATE . The last contact between the applicant and his son to which PERSON gave her consent took place in DATE . Following this , PERSON denied the applicant any access to his son . The applicant \u2019s frequent requests to the family courts to be granted access rights remained unsuccessful .", "On DATE PERSON married Mr PERSON", "On DATE Mr and PERSON applied to adopt the applicant \u2019s son .", "By order of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( ORG ) granted the adoption .", "On DATE , following the applicant \u2019s complaint , ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) lifted the binding effect of the adoption order of CARDINAL DATE insofar as it prevented a fresh consideration of the case ( PERSON ) and remitted the case to ORG . ORG found that the legal provision permitting adoption of a child by his mother and stepfather without the natural father \u2019s consent and without taking into account the latter \u2019s interests in the maintenance of a parental relationship violated his rights to the enjoyment of his family life as guaranteed by LAW sentence CARDINAL of LAW ) . Accordingly , the legislator was ordered to amend the legal provisions .", "On DATE new legislation entered into force , providing that a minor \u2019s adoption depended on both GPE consent . However , if the mother of a child born out of wedlock exercised sole custody , the court had to substitute the natural father \u2019s consent if the child would suffer a disproportionate disadvantage if not adopted ( section DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of the amended LAW , see relevant domestic law below ) .", "On DATE the counsel representing PERSON and PERSON filed a request to substitute the applicant \u2019s consent to the child \u2019s adoption by PERSON", "On DATE ORG , having heard the applicant , PERSON and PERSON and the child as well as expert opinion , substituted the applicant \u2019s consent to the adoption pursuant to LAW . That court found that the child \u2019s interest in being adopted by his stepfather outweighed the applicant \u2019s interest in the maintenance of the parental bonds by far . It noted that the child NORP had expressed that he felt as a full member of the PERSON family and that he strongly wished to be legally accepted as PERSON child . It further noted that the PERSON family had been considerably disturbed during DATE by numerous confrontations with the applicant . Furthermore , the court - appointed expert had clearly stated that the adoption would be in the child \u2019s interest . With regard to the applicant \u2019s interests , ORG noted that the adoption would lead to a severing of the parental bonds . It took however into consideration that the child had lived for DATE with the PERSON family and that no father - son relationship existed between the applicant and the child . Finally , ORG considered that the adoption might put an obstacle to a later reconciliation between the applicant and the child , but considered that this would not prevent the child from getting in touch with the applicant if he later on might wish to do so .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint against ORG decision .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint against the decision of ORG of DATE with ORG and a further complaint against that same decision with ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) .", "On DATE the applicant lodged his application with the ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint as inadmissible .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint . That court found that the impugned decisions did not violate the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW and under LAW . In so far as the requirements of adoption in the case of an unmarried father who had never held ( joint ) custody and had never \u201c had responsibility for the child \u201d were less than in the case of other parents , this distinction appeared factually justified in the circumstances of life that were typically found in this case . Furthermore , the lower courts had duly considered the applicant \u2019s interests . ORG added that the applicant \u2019s long lasting fight for his rights had forced the child and his new family into the defensive , which made it necessary in the child \u2019s interest to permit the adoption . It further noted that the last contact between the applicant and the child , which had taken place with the mother \u2019s consent , was in DATE when the child was merely DATE and that the applicant \u2019s further endeavours to get into touch had contributed to the child \u2019s aversions . ORG considered that the length of the proceedings \u2013 which could not be attributed to the courts \u2013 had put the child under particular pressure and had thus weakened the applicant \u2019s position .", "On DATE ORG issued an order confirming the child \u2019s adoption by PERSON ORG noted that the child had fully integrated into the PERSON family . According to the ORG previous findings , the child would suffer a disproportionate disadvantage if not adopted . ORG found that the other legal prerequisites were met and , in particular , that the child had firmly expressed that he wished to be adopted .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint as being inadmissible .", "On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional complaint against ORG decision of DATE , ORG decision of DATE and ORG decision of DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG decision of DATE . He alleged that the impugned decisions and the legal provisions they were based upon violated his right to the enjoyment of his family life under LAW and under LAW . He further complained about a violation of his right to equal treatment as guaranteed by LAW .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG informed the applicant that it had communicated his joint complaints to the Government and to several other interested parties for comments . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the court informed the applicant that \u2013 due to the high workload of the section \u2013 it could not be predicted when a decision on the admissibility of his complaint could be given .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , quashed the decisions of ORG of DATE , of ORG of DATE and of ORG of DATE and DATE and ordered the Land of Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg to reimburse the applicant the necessary expenses incurred by the proceedings before ORG .", "ORG found that the applicant \u2019s case could be adjudicated by a chamber of CARDINAL judges as the questions raised by the applicant were no longer of fundamental importance .", "The court noted in particular that ORG , in a decision given on DATE ( see relevant domestic law and practice , below ) , had issued valid guidelines which assured that section DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW was interpreted in accordance with LAW and that a father who had never held parental authority was not discriminated against as compared to a father who had .", "The Constitutional Court emphasized the fact that the adoption severed all legal bonds to the natural father , including alimony claims and rights of succession . Furthermore , it was generally not to be regarded as being in the child \u2019s best interest to exclude access rights of the natural parent . Summing up , ORG found that a child \u2019s adoption by his or her stepfather could not generally be regarded as being in the child \u2019s best interest .", "Turning to the applicant \u2019s case , ORG found that the impugned decisions violated the applicant \u2019s right to equal treatment under LAW of LAW , as they discriminated against the applicant when compared to a father who had previously held parental authority . It noted , in particular , that the lower courts had failed to take into account the applicant \u2019s submissions that he had lived for a certain period of time with the child and had thus assumed his responsibility as a parent . The lower courts had further failed to examine the reasons which had prevented the applicant from maintaining a father - child relationship . As could be established from the case - file , the child \u2019s mother had prevented the applicant \u2019s access to the child after meeting her future husband . ORG finally found that the applicant \u2019s later attempts to get in touch with the child should not be held against him .", "Having regard to these findings , ORG did not find it necessary to examine the applicant \u2019s further complaints . As a result of this judgment , the proceedings concerning the adoption of the applicant \u2019s son were terminated .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s arrest on the basis of LAW , because he had refused to reimburse court fees incurred by the adoption proceedings and in order to compel him to render an affidavit ( eidesstattliche ORG ) .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s complaint against the arrest orders .", "The applicant was arrested on DATE and released following court order of CARDINAL DATE .", "LAW ) reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection of the state .", "( CARDINAL ) The care and upbringing of children is the natural right of parents and a duty primarily incumbent upon them .
