Further , at the time of [ the adoption ] they were given recommendations concerning the mandatory follow - up of each child by the appropriate doctors , including a paediatrician .", "It can not be concluded from the fact that the [ applicants ] took their children to a neurologist , orthopaedist , and dentist , that they took due care of the children \u2019s health , since the examinations at the GPE and GPE hospitals diagnosed the children as being in need of treatment by doctors and attention from the [ applicants ] , but the [ applicants ] did not take any such measures .", "The [ applicants\u2019 family ] did not find the time to obtain medical insurance certificates in due time and only on DATE did they receive an insurance certificate in respect of P. , and on DATE in respect of PERSON This also confirms their improper attitude in respect of the children \u2019s health , and that very attitude fails in securing the protection of the children \u2019s health and poses a threat to the health and life of the children ...", "... under LAW an adoption may be revoked in cases where the adoptive parents fail to fulfil their parental obligations , abuse their parental rights , treat the adopted children cruelly , or suffer from chronic alcoholism or drug addiction .", "The court may also revoke an adoption in other cases , taking into account the interests of the child and having regard to the children \u2019s opinion .", "The court is of the view that in the present case there are grounds to revoke the adoption because the [ applicants ] had an improper attitude in respect of the health and security of the children , which posed and still poses a danger to the life and health of the children , including , among other things , failure to provide the children with the necessary medical assistance , which , it was established by the court , they need . The reckless attitude of the [ applicants ] in respect of the health and security of the children , and the strong inclination of the [ applicants ] towards self - treatment poses a danger to the life and health of the children , and therefore the revocation of the adoption is in [ the children \u2019s ] interest .", "The fact that the [ applicants ] have received positive character references , including by all witnesses questioned by the court during the examination of the case , and that they have some savings and property , even though they are unemployed , as well as the fact that they wish to continue to bring up the children , can not serve as a basis for refusing the application , since the claims have been proved and [ the application ] is made solely in the interests of the children .", "The statements of witnesses [ who all without exception gave positive character references concerning the applicants ] ... can not be taken into account by the court in order to reject the application , since those witnesses did not witness the events of DATE and these events pose a threat to the security of the children , and to their life and health , and make it impossibile for the children to remain in the [ applicants\u2019 ] family .", "Having examined the evidence presented ... and taking into account the opinion of the [ agency ] concerning the need to revoke the adoption of the children , and given the improper attitude of the [ applicants ] in respect of the health and security of the children , the court finds that the application must be granted in full , since this is in the interests of the children , who in the future will be able to find a home with another family that will take due care of them and provide them with secure conditions for their life and development , as well as take due care of their health and development ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
