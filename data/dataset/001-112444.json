It sought a judgment obliging her to sell to the co - operative a number of plots of land which had been de facto occupied by the co - operative for a long period of time .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG dismissed the claim . It held that the applicable provisions of LAW provided for an obligatory sale of land occupied de facto by housing co - operatives only where a co - operative had erected buildings thereon . In the present case , the plaintiff co - operative had built roads and parking areas on the land concerned .", "CARDINAL . NORP The plaintiff cooperative appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the appeal , quashed the first - instance judgment and remitted the case . It was of the view that the first - instance court had erred in the application of LAW of the Co - operatives Act . It had wrongly held that an obligatory sale could be ordered to the benefit of a housing co - operative only with respect to land owned by third parties on which a co - operative had had houses built . The court was of the opinion that such a sale could also be ordered when a co - operative had built infrastructures other than houses .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON sat on the bench of ORG as judge rapporteur .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s case was subsequently examined again . The Opole Regional Court allowed the plaintiff \u2019s claim and ordered the applicant to sell QUANTITY . metres of land to the co - operative . It found that the plaintiff co - operative had built a housing estate in the vicinity of the applicant \u2019s land and also partly on her land . Parking areas and roads had been built on the land belonging to the applicant . Section CARDINAL of ORG operatives LAW provided for the compulsory sale of privately owned land occupied de facto by co - operatives .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . She argued that the court had erred in applying the substantive law in her case . LAW provided for a claim for compulsory sale only where ORG had built houses on privately owned land . The legal interpretation of this provision by the court breached the principle that exceptions had to be interpreted narrowly . She further argued that the judgment ordering her to sell her land was in breach of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , endorsing the legal view expressed in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal against this judgment with ORG . She reiterated the same argument which she had already raised in her appeal and emphasised that the courts had erroneously interpreted substantive law in her case . She submitted that section CARDINAL of ORG operatives LAW allowed for a compulsory sale of privately owned land only where a co - operative had built houses on it . The court had erred in that it held that this provision should , by analogy , also be applied to roads , parking areas and similar infrastructure . This interpretation resulted from the functional interpretation of this provision according to which its purpose was to make it possible for housing co - operatives to acquire ownership of land owned by third parties . Thus , the courts had held that it would be inconsistent with that object and purpose to allow a claim for a compulsory sale order against the owner only with respect to the land on which houses had been built . The applicant argued that this approach , which disregarded the literal and clear text of the provision concerned and resorted instead to a functional interpretation , was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . She also invoked LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention and submitted that her property rights had been excessively and unlawfully restricted by the compulsory sale order .", "CARDINAL . The cassation appeal was examined by ORG sitting in camera on DATE . Judge PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , who had in the meantime been promoted to ORG , sat on the bench . The court was of the view that the gist of the cassation appeal concerned the interpretation of section CARDINAL of ORG operatives LAW and that the case turned on the interpretation to be given to this provision . It agreed with the legal view expressed on both occasions by ORG and dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Opole ORG awarded the applicant compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the use of her land by the local energy company which had in the past built installations ( a pipeline ) on her land . The company appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG quashed the first - instance judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with ORG , complaining that the electricity company had been using her property for DATE without paying any compensation .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , served on the applicant \u2019s lawyer on DATE , ORG refused to accept her cassation appeal for examination .", "CARDINAL .
