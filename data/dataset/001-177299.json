The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of a contract signed on DATE and governed by the provisions of LAW , the applicant became an employee of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG \u2019s authorised representative requested ORG ( N\u00e1rodn\u00ed bezpe\u010dnostn\u00ed \u00fa\u0159ad \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to issue the applicant with security clearance ( osv\u011bd\u010den\u00ed ) giving him access to ORG classified information in the \u201c secret \u201d category ( tajn\u00e9 ) in accordance with the duties to be carried out by him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant took up his duties as director of the ORG of administration of the ORG \u2019s property ( PERSON spr\u00e1vy majetku PERSON obrany ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued the applicant with security clearance , valid until DATE , confirming that he had access to ORG classified information in the \u201c secret \u201d category .", "CARDINAL . During DATE the applicant was appointed deputy to the first Vice - Minister of Defence ( z\u00e1stupce Prvn\u00edho n\u00e1m\u011bstka ministra obrany ) , while continuing to carry out his duties as director of ORG of the ORG property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG received confidential information from the intelligence service , classified \u201c restricted \u201d ( vyhrazen\u00e9 ) and dated DATE . It started an investigation in order to verify the information received . In the course of that investigation the intelligence service provided the ORG with other information , dated DATE , classified \u201c restricted \u201d and annexed to the security file ( bezpe\u010dnostn\u00ed spis ) under CARDINAL . On the basis of that information the ORG revoked the security clearance on DATE . There were CARDINAL unrelated reasons for that decision : firstly , the applicant had failed to indicate , as he should have done when applying for security clearance , that he held directorships in a number of companies and accounts in foreign banks ; and secondly , the applicant was considered to pose a national security risk , within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) of PERSON no . ORG . With regard to that risk , the decision did not however indicate which confidential information it was based on , as this was classified \u201c restricted \u201d and could not therefore legally be disclosed to the applicant . The decision indicated that the facts established in respect of his conduct , as documented in the information received by the ORG on DATE , cast doubt on his suitability for security clearance and his ability not to be influenced and to keep sensitive information secret , and thus indicated that he was no longer trustworthy .", "CARDINAL . On an administrative appeal ( rozklad ) by the applicant , the director of the ORG , after obtaining an opinion from the appeals board , confirmed on DATE the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE , but on partly different grounds . He dismissed as unfounded the complaint that the applicant had failed to disclose certain information prior to being issued with security clearance . However , he agreed with the ORG \u2019s conclusions regarding the existence of a security risk , which had transpired from the investigation carried out by the ORG and from the classified documents .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had asked to be discharged , for health reasons , from his duties as deputy to the first Vice - Minister of Defence , and from those of director of ORG of the ORG property . He was removed from office on DATE under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE he signed an agreement , under LAW , terminating his contract by mutual consent with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG ( m\u011bstsk\u00fd soud ) for judicial review of the decision revoking his security clearance . He and his lawyer were permitted to consult the file , but the parts classified as confidential were excluded . However , the documents containing information about the existence of a risk , including the confidential documents , had been sent by the ORG to the court , which had access to them . At the public hearing the applicant was given the opportunity to make his submissions and to state what he thought were the reasons for revoking his security clearance . He stated that he believed the information in question had been provided by a military intelligence service which had sought to take revenge on him for his refusal to accept a proposal to co - operate in a manner exceeding his statutory obligations .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court dismissed the application for judicial review . It observed that in a procedure revoking security clearance the relevant authority could only disclose reasons for revoking clearance that were based on non - classified documents and that as regards grounds based on classified documents it had to confine itself to referring to the relevant documents and their level of confidentiality . It found that the approach taken by the ORG , which had not disclosed to the applicant the contents of the information on the basis of which the security clearance had been revoked , had not been illegal as disclosure of such information was prohibited by law . It added that the applicant \u2019s rights had been sufficiently respected because the court had power to obtain knowledge of the classified information and assess whether it justified the decision taken by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG ( GPE spr\u00e1vn\u00ed soud ) dismissed an appeal on points of law ( kasa\u010dn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost ) lodged by the applicant as unfounded . It considered that the classified documents in question had shown beyond any doubt that the applicant did not satisfy the statutory conditions to be entrusted with secret information . It observed that the risk in his regard concerned his conduct , which affected his credibility and his ability to keep information secret . ORG added that disclosure of the classified information could have entailed the disclosure of the intelligence service \u2019s working methods , the revelation of its information sources or the risk of influencing possible witnesses . It explained that there was a statutory prohibition on indicating where exactly the security risk lay and on specifying the considerations underlying the conclusion that such a risk existed , the reasons and considerations underlying the ORG \u2019s decision being based exclusively on classified information . Accordingly , the reasons for the decision had to be limited to a reference to the documents on which it was based and the level of confidentiality of the information used . It went on to observe that , owing to the special nature of proceedings where classified information was concerned , not all the applicant \u2019s procedural rights could be guaranteed but that the non - disclosure of the exact reasons underlying the decision to revoke security clearance was counterbalanced by the guarantee that the administrative courts had unlimited access to the classified documents . ORG pointed out that the report on the result of the investigations carried out by the intelligence service , included in the file under no . DATE , contained specific , comprehensive and detailed information concerning the conduct and lifestyle of the applicant on the basis of which the court was satisfied in the present case as to its relevance for determining whether the applicant posed a national security risk . It observed , further , that the information did not in any way concern the applicant \u2019s refusal to co - operate with the military intelligence service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00ed soud ) , complaining of the unfairness of the proceedings . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the court dismissed his complaint as manifestly ill - founded . Referring to its earlier case - law on the subject , it observed that given the special nature and the importance of decisions adopted in respect of classified information where national security interests were manifest , it was not always possible to apply all the guarantees relating to fairness of proceedings . It considered that in the present case the NORP conduct had been duly justified and the reasoning in their decisions comprehensible and in conformity with the LAW ; that they had not departed from procedural standards and constitutional rules to an inordinate degree ; and that ORG was not therefore required to intervene in their decision - making procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution service lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant and CARDINAL other persons on charges of influencing the award of public contracts at ORG from DATE to DATE . The applicant was indicted for participation in organised crime ( \u00fa\u010dast na zlo\u010dinn\u00e9m spol\u010den\u00ed ) ; aiding and abetting abuse of public power ( pomoc k trestn\u00e9mu \u010dinu zneu\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed pravomoci ve\u0159ejn\u00e9ho \u010dinitele ) ; complicity in illegally influencing public tendering and public procurement procedures ( pomoc k trestn\u00e9mu \u010dinu pletich p\u0159i ve\u0159ejn\u00e9 sout\u011b\u017ei a ve\u0159ejn\u00e9 dra\u017eb\u011b ) ; and aiding and abetting breaches of binding rules governing economic relations ( pomoc k trestn\u00e9mu \u010dinu poru\u0161ov\u00e1n\u00ed z\u00e1vazn\u00fdch pravidel hospod\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9ho styku ) .", "In a judgment of DATE the \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice Regional Court ( krajsk\u00fd soud ) found the applicant guilty and sentenced him , inter alia , to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the Prague High Court ( Vrchn\u00ed soud ) upheld the first - instance judgment convicting the applicant , but suspended execution of his prison sentence for a DATE probationary period . That judgment became final ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
