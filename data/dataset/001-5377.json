Before the ORG the applicant is represented by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the owner of a fishing vessel . In DATE he was fishing in LOC during which he exceeded the quota limits concerning maximum catch laid down in the relevant legislation . By indictment of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was therefore charged with having exceeded the permitted fishing quotas contrary to Act No . CARDINAL of DATE concerning the regulation of certain fisheries , section CARDINAL in conjunction with section CARDINAL , pursuant to which the prosecutor requested that the applicant pay a fine . Furthermore , the prosecutor demanded confiscation of the profits stemming from the illegal catch , estimated at CARDINAL DKK .", "During the proceedings before ORG ( byretten ) of PERSON the applicant did not challenge the factual circumstances but maintained in particular that the amount to be confiscated should be reduced .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of the charges brought against him . The judgment reads in its relevant parts as follows :", "( Translation )", "kilogramme cod and as this would lead to a value which corresponds best with the real value of the illegal catch . Furthermore , the court finds it appropriate to fix the amount to be confiscated , in accordance with normal practice , without deductions of the amount paid to the crew . Finally , [ the applicant \u2019s ] lack of knowledge or misunderstanding of the quota , which appears clearly from section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , cf . \u00a7 CARDINAL , can not be taken into consideration . ...", "Pursuant to LAW of LAW an amount of CARDINAL DKK shall be confiscated from [ the applicant ] . \u201d", "The applicant was fined CARDINAL ORG .", "The applicant appealed against the judgment to ORG ) maintaining that the fine and , in particular , the amount confiscated were disproportionate to the offence committed .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . As regards the calculation of the amount confiscated ORG referred to previous caselaw of ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant leave to appeal to ORG before which the applicant maintained that the amount confiscated ought to be reduced . He did not , however , challenge the fine imposed .", "By judgment of DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . The judgment reads in its relevant parts as follows :", "( Translation )", "\u201c CARDINAL judges express the following opinion :", "The amounts confiscated from [ the applicant ] pursuant to LAW of LAW are fixed as the sales value of the illegal catch , solely with deduction of costs connected with landing and sale ( landing costs ) . This conforms with previous case - law , cf . inter alia ORG judgment of DATE ... .", "In evaluating whether there are grounds for changing this practice , account should be taken of the fact that in cases of illegal fishery , substantial consideration is to be given to the preventive function of the confiscation . In this connection , it is worthy of note that it is presupposed in the fisheries legislation that confiscation of the value of the illegal catch is a normal reaction ... .", "The accused 's assistants on the fishing trip in question were remunerated with a share of the net value of the catch and have , objectively speaking , contributed to the offences . It depends on the circumstances of the legal relation between the parties whether , in case of confiscation , [ the applicant is ] entitled to demand repayment of the wages . We find that no deduction should be allowed for expenses pertaining to wages when fixing the confiscation amounts . Apart from the costs relating to fuel and ice , which can to a certain extent be attributed to the illegal catch , the remaining costs referred to by [ the applicant ] may be characterised as general costs which should not be taken into consideration either when fixing the amounts to be confiscated .", "Thus , we do not find sufficient reasons to change previous case - law according to which the amounts to be confiscated in cases like the present are fixed - unless special circumstances prevail - as the sales value of the illegal catch with the deduction solely of landing costs . Therefore we vote for upholding ORG judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL judges voted in favour of reducing the amount confiscated by allowing the deduction of certain additional costs .", "PERSON Relevant domestic law", "The relevant parts of LAW of LAW ( straffeloven ) read as follows :", "( Translation )", "\u201c \u00a7 DATE ( CARDINAL ) The proceeds gained from any criminal act , or a sum equivalent thereto , may , either wholly or in part , be confiscated .
