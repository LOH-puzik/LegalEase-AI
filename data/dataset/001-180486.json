The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . As is apparent from the documents in the file , the applicant moved from GPE to GPE in DATE together with her parents . In DATE she obtained temporary residency status . Before the move , the applicant \u2019s father had been the deputy chair of ORG and later a member of a political movement which was critical of the domestic political regime . It appears that , because of her father \u2019s political activity , members of her family were subjected to persecution in GPE and that in DATE the applicant \u2019s aunt was tortured and murdered in prison .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started studying at a secondary school with an intensive foreign languages curriculum in DATE . Her father opened his own construction business in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP authorities charged both of the applicant \u2019s parents with aggravated embezzlement of public funds amounting to MONEY , allegedly committed DATE and DATE . The NORP prosecutor ordered their detention in relation to those charges and filed a request for their extradition with the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The following circumstances are undisputed between the parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , aged CARDINAL at the time , was alone at home . At TIME about QUANTITY police officers arrived at the family apartment . On entering the apartment the officers informed the applicant that they had come to arrest her parents . She called her parents on the telephone . It appears from the documents before the domestic courts that at that time , the parents were out shopping accompanied by their legal representative , who returned home with them . This took some time because of heavy traffic . In the meantime the officers prohibited the applicant from moving around the apartment and interrogated her in the absence of a social worker and a psychologist , despite having seen her identity document , which indicated her age .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s parents were arrested as soon as they arrived home . The record of a court hearing in the domestic proceedings for damages ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) indicates that the GPE legal representative was present during the arrest . The lawyer stated that the police officers had not allowed the parents to collect personal belongings from the flat but that , as far as he could recall , they had allowed the applicant to hand them some personal items from the flat . He did not know where the police officers had taken the applicant \u2019s parents but said that he thought that they had been taken to ORG . In any event , he had visited them DATE but could not remember exactly where . The legal representative also stated that during DATE his task had been to circulate between the CARDINAL different prisons where the applicant \u2019s parents were detained in order to organise their defence . He stated that he could not describe the state of the applicant at the time of the arrest , his task having been to defend her parents . He did not know what had happened to the applicant and had not seen her after her GPE arrest .", "CARDINAL . An order for the applicant \u2019s GPE detention for TIME was issued by the police on DATE and they were placed in police custody for that period . Upon their application for judicial review of that detention order , ORG set it aside the following day , finding it flawed as it did not indicate any legal grounds for the detention . Immediately upon their release from police custody the applicant \u2019s parents were served with a prosecutor \u2019s order for their detention for TIME in connection with the extradition request ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They were detained on the spot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at CARDINAL separate hearings , ORG extended their detention for DATE . The applicant \u2019s father was taken to FAC and her mother to ORG .", "CARDINAL . During and after the court hearings on DATE the applicant \u2019s parents were represented by the same lawyer who had been present during their arrest and was a friend and neighbour of the family .", "CARDINAL . The parties dispute what took place at the hearing when the judge enquired about the care measures in place in relation to the applicant . According to the latter , when her mother was asked by the judge through an interpreter whether there was anyone who could take care of her child , her mother replied by shaking her head . In GPE nodding one \u2019s head signifies \u201c no \u201d and shaking it means \u201c yes \u201d . According to the applicant , the judge , having interpreted the mother \u2019s response as \u201c yes \u201d , noted in the record of the hearing : \u201c The child has someone to take care of her \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government , in contrast , pointed to the record of the hearing , which indicated that the applicant \u2019s mother had replied that there was someone who could take care of her child . In their view , this was evidence of the mother \u2019s reply . In addition , they cited an excerpt of the court \u2019s record where the applicant \u2019s mother had addressed the court in the following terms : \u201c I am very surprised as I have worked as an associate professor , with a doctorate in science , for DATE , and for some reason , they want to accuse me of something that happened out there , and I \u2019ve been living here for DATE . We came here so that my children could study in GPE , in a democratic country , because GPE is a dictatorship ; a fascist regime has begun . There is someone to take care of my child . \u201d According to the court record of the hearing , the mother \u2019s statement had been preceded by an intervention by the prosecutor , who had indicated that it was necessary to comply with the requirements of LAW , so that if the family had no relatives or friends to care for the child , the municipality had to be informed with a view to placing her in a child - care centre , kindergarten or boarding facility ( \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442 ) .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant \u2019s parents , ORG lifted the detention orders in CARDINAL separate decisions on DATE . The applicant \u2019s parents were released on bail and returned home to the applicant DATE .", "CARDINAL . The request for their extradition to GPE was ultimately refused on CARDINAL DATE by ORG . During those proceedings they were represented by the same lawyer . The refusal became final on CARDINAL DATE as it had not been appealed against . The court found that the criminal proceedings against the applicants\u2019 parents were connected to the father \u2019s political activities and that the extradition request had been made with the aim of persecuting and punishing him for his political beliefs .", "CARDINAL . It is alleged that the applicant \u2019s parents were arrested so rapidly that they did not manage to leave any money for her , or to give her any instructions as to whom to turn to or how to go about caring for herself . The officers did not tell the applicant for how long they were taking her parents away , where they would be taken or for what reason . According to the applicant , they indicated that they would either lock her parents in prison or deport them to GPE . Both prospects caused the applicant anguish as she had heard that prisons were horrible both in GPE and in GPE . She also feared that her parents might be subject to the same treatment in GPE that members of her family had endured in GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , no one took care of her after her GPE arrest . She only found MONEY ( about QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) in the apartment , which she used for bus tickets to go to school and for food . The money ran out fast and during DATE of her GPE absence she did not have anything to eat . She suffered insomnia and , when she could sleep , had nightmares . Before her GPE arrest , her mother had been the one to wake her up in the TIME .", "CARDINAL . She permanently dreaded being herself sent back to GPE , where her relatives were in prison and her grandparents had been made homeless for having opposed the regime .", "CARDINAL . She alleged that she had gone several times to the police \u2019s office for foreigners , looking for her parents . She had also tried to telephone people in GPE to ask for help . Both steps proved unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had to ask people in the street how to reach her school as , before the arrest , her father had always taken her there . At some stage during her GPE detention a stray dog bit the applicant on the leg . She did not know what to do or how to seek help . Her mother took her to hospital on DATE , DATE after she was released from detention , fearing that the wound might have become infected .", "CARDINAL . The Government alleged that it had not been proven that the applicant had been left alone , without an adult carer , during the period in question . The Government stressed that the applicant \u2019s parents had been represented throughout by the same legal representative , who was , moreover , a neighbour and friend . When questioned in the context of the domestic proceedings in the applicant \u2019s case about the exchanges in court on DATE , the lawyer indicated that he had no recollection of them ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , with her GPE agreement , brought proceedings for damages under LAW before ORG . She directed her claim against the FAC regional office of ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG , and sought to establish the responsibility of the authorities that had left her unattended during her GPE detention in DATE , in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the court invited her to specify the grounds of her claim and to indicate the specific actions , the particular respondent and the type of damage caused to her . She specified that she was seeking compensation for non - pecuniary damage stemming from the authorities\u2019 failure to organise support and care for her during her GPE detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court reclassified her claim under section CARDINAL of ORG . It further invited her to specify the names of the officials against whom she had directed her claim , and to show that she had paid the court fees of CARDINAL , corresponding to PERCENT of the total amount of damages sought . The applicant lowered the value of her claim on DATE , paid the corresponding court fees in the amount of about ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and submitted additional proof to the court .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG terminated the proceedings as it found that the applicant had failed to correct the irregularities in her claim as directed by the court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on CARDINAL DATE to ORG , submitting that the respondents were the legal entities specified in her legal claim of DATE as amended , given that they had been represented by different individuals at different points in time . The appellate court upheld the lower court \u2019s decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , submitting that her claim was directed against the different institutions as legal persons , as she could not know the names of the individual officials who had failed to provide her with care . She also described her condition after her GPE detention . On DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s decision , finding that it had wrongly instructed the applicant to specify individual respondents . It remitted the case to the first - instance court , ORG , for a fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant further specified her claim before ORG , in particular describing her circumstances in the immediate aftermath of her GPE arrest and the continuing psychological trauma which she had suffered as a result . She submitted that during the hearing on DATE on the extension of her GPE detention , the judge had wrongly interpreted her mother \u2019s response to the question posed regarding her care .", "CARDINAL . A psychiatric and psychological report was prepared in the context of the court proceedings in DATE . The report established that the applicant was depressed and at times aggressive . This was attributed to the shock she had experienced in relation to her GPE detention and the ensuing uncertainty . She showed signs of accumulated tension , fear , worries , disappointment and anger towards the officials who had abandoned her to her own devices following her GPE arrest . She had no interest in her daily life or in the future and had become withdrawn as a result of her loss of confidence in the justice system . CARDINAL additional medical expert reports were prepared in DATE . They found that the applicant was suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder , which was probably the result of what she had gone through after her GPE arrest . The doctors stated in court that no improvement was likely in her case and that her condition was expected to become chronic . Another medical report ordered by the court in DATE confirmed that the applicant was suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder and that , while she had been a healthy and energetic child prior to her GPE arrest , she had experienced frequent bouts of depression thereafter and had succumbed to overwhelming feelings of self - pity , insecurity and futility of effort and engagement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s GPE lawyer , who had attended the hearings relating to their detention in DATE , testified on DATE that he did not know what had happened to the applicant during her GPE arrest ; nor could he remember anything about the circumstances relating to the question and answer in court on DATE concerning her care . On DATE , during the same proceedings , the applicant \u2019s teacher testified that she could not remember the applicant being absent from or having gone hungry at school . The girl had not complained to her about anything at the time .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim on DATE , finding that it had not been proven that she had been left alone while her parents had been detained in DATE . The court also held that , in DATE following the court hearing on DATE , the applicant \u2019s mother had not sought to have the record of the hearing rectified , even though it was legally possible to do so .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court held that on DATE ORG had accepted that the mother had replied in the affirmative to the judge \u2019s question regarding whether there had been anyone to care for the applicant . That question had been transmitted to the applicant \u2019s mother with the assistance of an interpreter . Consequently , the court concluded that it had not been incumbent on the criminal justice system to act in any other way in order to protect the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The court further accepted fully the conclusions of the psychological reports on the applicant \u2019s state of chronic post - traumatic stress disorder after the DATE events . However , it found that the only evidence supporting the applicant \u2019s claim that she had been left alone in DATE was her GPE testimony and that there were no other pieces of evidence in support of this assertion . Given that the mother had stated during the hearing on her detention that someone had been taking care of the child , the conditions set out in LAW had not been met and , therefore , the institutions involved in the criminal proceedings had not been obliged to pursue steps towards taking the applicant into care .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . She again challenged the findings of the lower court about her mother \u2019s reply during the court hearing on DATE . She also submitted that her mother had not been in a position to see the record of the hearing , given that she had been taken back immediately to the remand prison . She further asserted that the authorities had been under an obligation to verify at the time of the arrest on DATE and immediately afterwards whether care had been available to her , and that in any event they should not have waited DATE to enquire about her situation for the first time during the court hearing . She submitted that her current state of health was the direct result of the shock and stress she had endured in connection with the arrest and the lack of provision of care . She paid about ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in court fees .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court confirmed the lower court \u2019s decision on DATE . It found that , even if the applicant had been left alone after the arrest , responsibility for that could not be attributed to the police , the prosecuting authorities or the court , given that her mother had stated that there had been someone to take care of her . In addition , the post - traumatic stress disorder from which it had been established that she suffered could have been the result of additional factors not directly related to her GPE arrest .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected an appeal on points of law by the applicant in a final decision of DATE , finding no grounds for allowing the appeal to be pursued .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was granted humanitarian status on DATE and refugee status on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
