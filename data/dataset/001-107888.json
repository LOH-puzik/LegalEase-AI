The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and resides in GPE . In DATE the applicant obtained NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE she met T. and they developed a relationship . The applicant moved into ORG \u2019s apartment at DATE when she was in a late stage of her pregnancy .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant gave birth to a daughter . The birth certificate of the child does not state the name of her father and no paternity test had been carried out at the time the application was lodged with the ORG . Since the birth of the child the applicant has been entitled to benefits under a single - parent support scheme .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant \u2019s relationship with ORG deteriorated and they decided to separate . The applicant continued to share the apartment with ORG as a tenant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant left GPE with the child and went back to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant arrived in GPE , GPE submitted an application to ORG to establish his parental rights in respect of the child . To support the claim ORG testified in an affidavit before ORG that he had been in a relationship with the applicant since DATE and that the latter had always told him that he was the father of the child , even if he was not legally recognised as such . T. also stated that the mutual rent agreement was false and that he had submitted false declarations to the social security services in order to allow the applicant to receive a single - parent benefit . He asserted that the applicant had fled GPE with the child without his consent , thereby violating LAW ( \u201c LAW ) . T. alleged that the location of the applicant in GPE was unknown to him . In support of his claims T. attached to his application e - mail correspondence between the applicant and his family members .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the absence of the applicant , decided ( CARDINAL ) that both PERSON and the applicant had had joint parental responsibility for their child since DATE of her birth , and ( CARDINAL ) that the case would be reviewed after the return of the applicant and the child to GPE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG of GPE , which was ORG responsible for implementing LAW , received from ORG a request from T. concerning the return of the child to GPE under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the R\u012bga City Zemgale District Court examined the request in the presence of both the applicant and T. In the hearing the applicant contested the applicability of LAW alleging that she did not know who the father of her daughter was . She assumed that ORG had initiated the proceedings so that they would serve as a mitigating element in criminal proceedings allegedly pending against him in GPE .", "CARDINAL . A representative of ORG ) argued that the claim should be dismissed because at the time of the child \u2019s removal from GPE the applicant had been a single mother , and that the child had developed ties with GPE .", "CARDINAL . The lower court granted ORG request , stating that pursuant to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW the decision by which ORG had established ORG \u2019s parental responsibility for the child was not subject to review by the NORP courts , as they could decide only whether there had been a wrongful removal and whether the child should be returned . When applying LAW the court relied on photos and transcripts of e - mails between the applicant and ORG \u2019s relatives . It concluded that even if the applicant and T. had communication and financial problems , the latter had taken care of the child prior to her removal to GPE . The court dismissed as ill - founded the applicant \u2019s arguments that the return of the child to GPE might lead to her psychological detriment , stating that these were only assumptions .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the applicant was ordered to return the child to GPE immediately and in any event not DATE from adoption of the decision . The decision also stated that if the applicant failed to respect the time - limit set by the court , then ORG was authorised to return the child himself .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted an ancillary complaint in which she argued that she had been the sole guardian in law and in practice of the child at the time they had left GPE .", "CARDINAL . She also indicated that returning the child would expose her to psychological harm . She relied on the conclusions of a psychologist who examined the child on DATE :", "\u201c [ ... ] Although the results of the examination show that the child has developed an adequate level of knowledge and language , the girl can not , due to her minor age , define her opinion about her place of residence [ ... ] . Having regard to the child \u2019s age and close emotional ties with her mother , which is normal at this age , the emotional well - being of the child primarily depends on and is closely linked with the psychological balance of [ the applicant ] . [ ... ] the child needs the DATE presence of the mother and a permanent place of residence with [ the applicant ] . Having regard to the age of DATE and DATE immediate termination of contact between the mother and the child should be ruled out , otherwise psychological trauma might be caused to the child in that the child \u2019s sense of security and personal confidence could be impaired \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also brought the appellate court \u2019s attention to the fact that NORP was the native language of the child ; that she attended pre - school activities in GPE and that T. had ill - treated the applicant and the child . In addition , the applicant complained that the lower court had refused to request from the NORP authorities information of ORG \u2019s previous convictions and the criminal charges of corruption brought against him . She also contended that in GPE she would be unemployed and would not have resources to ensure the legal protection of herself and the child , and that the lower court had not assessed the child \u2019s social guarantees and safety if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) upheld the decision of the lower court . It also dismissed the argument of possible psychological harm to the child :", "\u201c [ The court ] dismisses ... the allegation that [ T. ] ill - treated [ the applicant ] and the child , as well as [ the allegation ] that he was facing a prison sentence concerning [ criminal charges brought against him ] as no evidence has been submitted which could , at least by implication , support the allegations .", "Neither can the conclusion of the [ psychological assessment ] of DATE serve as evidence against the return of the child to the requesting state . Although the conclusion stated that the child was in need of her mother and that immediate termination of contact between the mother and the child should be ruled out , the issue raised before this court does not concern custody rights ... . Pursuant to LAW , a decision under this convention concerning the return of a child shall not be taken to be a determination on the merits of any custody issue .", "[ The court ] considers that ... [the child] ... has not reached an age or level of maturity which would allow her to formulate an opinion concerning a return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the hearing the representative of ORG , inter alia , noted that there was no information as to the child \u2019s situation if she was returned to GPE . The appellate court noted in this respect :", "[ The court ] considers that there are no grounds to undermine the social protection and security of the child in GPE as , according to the [ affidavit ] , NORP legislation provides , inter alia , for the security of children and [ their ] protection against ill - treatment within the family \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bailiff requested the applicant to comply with the return order by DATE , which she failed to do .", "CARDINAL .

At the same time the applicant filed an application asking for suspension of the return order for a period of DATE . The court scheduled a hearing of both applications on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at ORG \u2019s request ORG asked ORG to verify the child \u2019s living conditions and inform the applicant of ORG \u2019s request to see the child .", "CARDINAL .

Following a request from ORG of GPE concerning T. \u2019s right to return the child to GPE , on DATE ORG of GPE supplied the requested information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the applicant \u2019s request , ORG instituted criminal proceedings for abduction of the child , without bringing charges against any particular suspect . ORG was informed thereof .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , referring to the problems of execution of the court order in the applicant \u2019s case , ORG set up a working group with the aim of proposing the necessary amendments to the laws concerning execution of court orders in similar cases .", "CARDINAL . In this connection the ORG noted that in the absence of specific legal regulation concerning the execution of return orders , the execution should not take place in an arbitrary and violent manner , or in the absence of representatives of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LOC District Court dismissed the applications of the bailiff and the applicant concerning the delay in the execution of the return order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE following a request submitted by the applicant \u2019s representative , the Prime Minister of GPE ordered a disciplinary investigation into the legality of the actions of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigation reached the conclusion that ORG had acted within its competence . However , it noted that in GPE there was not sufficient regulation in order to be able to avoid the violent and traumatic execution of court orders in similar cases . The investigation therefore proposed that a number of related issues be examined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG discharged all prior orders relating to the GPE rights and , inter alia , ruled that ORG was the person with sole parental responsibility for the child , and that the applicant was restrained from discussing publicly any information referring to the child or T.
