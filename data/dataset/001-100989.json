Finally , the issue is also dealt with under property legislation ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In all cases , restitution is not an absolute right and may be subject to numerous conditions and restrictions . The same is true of the right to compensation .", "CARDINAL . Either the former owners or their successors in title ( lawful heirs in GPE ) may be eligible for restitution or compensation in respect of confiscated or nationalised property . In some countries including GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , the legislation requires the claimant to be a citizen either when the property was confiscated or when the claim for restitution is made , or in some cases even both . In addition , the law in GPE and GPE requires claimants to be permanent residents both when the law entered into force and when the claim for restitution or compensation is made . In those systems where there is a rehabilitation procedure , only persons rehabilitated in accordance with the law may claim restitution of their property . This is the case in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . In these countries entitlement to restitution or compensation is wholly or partially linked to the rehabilitation of victims of political repression .", "CARDINAL . The legislation in some countries excludes several categories of properties from restitution or compensation .", "CARDINAL . In some cases the legislation excludes land and buildings the character of which has been altered ( GPE ) ; other countries exclude property which has lost its original character ( GPE ) or property which has disappeared or been destroyed , as well as properties which have passed into private ownership ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition , under NORP law , military property , cultural and social assets and property under ORG protection , as well as buildings used by the ORG or local administrative authorities , are excluded from restitution . Under the legislation in GPE plots of land , forests , perennial plantations and property confiscated on grounds unrelated to political repression are also ineligible for restitution .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and GPE properties which were nationalised in accordance with the legislation in force at the time do not qualify for restitution or compensation .", "CARDINAL . In GPE restitution is possible only in the case of residential property . The NORP legislation provides only for partial restitution of agricultural land . Finally , in GPE and GPE the restitution laws specify the properties which are covered .", "CARDINAL . Some legislation imposes temporal restrictions on the lodging of claims for restitution or compensation . This is the case in GPE and GPE , where former owners were given DATE in which to lodge a claim , and in GPE , GPE and \u201c the former GPE \u201d ( DATE from the date of entry into force of the law on rehabilitation ) .", "CARDINAL . Elsewhere , the legislation restricts restitution or compensation to properties nationalised or confiscated during a certain period . By way of example , the NORP compensation scheme is limited to properties nationalised after DATE but compensation is awarded for properties nationalised DATE in the NORP - occupied zone .", "CARDINAL . A number of countries have opted to provide compensation in the form of another property equivalent to that which was nationalised or confiscated ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and \u201c the former GPE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Where no exchange is possible the legislation allows the person concerned to be provided with a property of a different kind , a sum of money , compensation vouchers ( GPE and GPE ) , ORG securities or bonds ( GPE and \u201c the former GPE \u201d ) or shares in a public company ( GPE and GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The amount of compensation is calculated mainly by reference to the market value of the property at the time of the restitution or compensation decision ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) or at the time the property was confiscated ( \u201c the former GPE \u201d ) , or as otherwise provided by law .", "ORG . NORP Some countries take account of other considerations in addition to the market price . In GPE , when compensation is provided in the form of shares the amount is equal to the value of the property at the time of the decision or the value of the privatised public property .", "CARDINAL . Other factors may also be taken into consideration in determining the amount of compensation . In GPE , for instance , account is taken of the value of the property before expropriation , which is then multiplied by a coefficient laid down by law .", "CARDINAL . In some countries the legislation sets a cap on compensation ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) , or provides for payment in instalments ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The authorities responsible for determining restitution or compensation claims may be judicial or administrative . The most common arrangements include special restitution and compensation boards ( GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ) , administrative bodies ( GPE ) , ORG or ORG , or even the courts ( GPE ) . In all the countries surveyed an appeal lies to the administrative or civil courts against the decisions of the administrative bodies ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
