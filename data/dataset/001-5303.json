Relevant domestic law", "According to LAW negotiations regarding conditions for the renting of a flat are conducted between a landlord or a landlord and an organisation of apartment building owners on the CARDINAL side and an organisation of tenants on the other . If a lease contains a so - called negotiation clause , this means that the tenant has accepted the dispositions concerning the rent and other conditions that may follow from an agreement negotiated by the just - mentioned parties . This does not , however , entail any restrictions on the right of the tenant to request an assessment of the tenancy conditions by ORG . The size of the rent , when disputed , shall then be established at a reasonable amount . For this purpose the rent is not to be deemed fair if it is obviously higher than the rent for flats of equivalent utility value .
