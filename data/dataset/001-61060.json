The applicant gave evidence before the Delegates that he had been beaten on DATE , because of a note which he had passed to another inmate , PERSON , while he had been mopping the floor in the corridor on DATE . He had informed PERSON about a letter he had received from his parents and about its contents .

TIME , he had been called out and beaten by CARDINAL or CARDINAL masked persons with clubs in the \u201c cinema room \u201d on his back , legs and shoulders but not on his head .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that the applicant had written and had signed a statement on DATE , to the effect , inter alia , that he had been treated in an appropriate manner by the prison administration , that no physical force had been used against him and that he had nothing to complain about . It took into account the fact that before the Delegates , the applicant had denied the contents of his statement and pointed out that the practice of a prison authority to order an inmate to confirm in writing that he had been treated correctly by prison officers raised suspicions .", "CARDINAL . The Commission considered that the applicant 's account of his beating contained a number of details and elements which it would not have expected to find in a fabricated story . It noted , however , that there was no record of any occurrence relating to the ill - treatment described by the applicant . The ORG accepted the applicant 's statement that he had not complained in order not to make things worse . However , his account of the events was not supported by any oral or written evidence produced before the ORG or its Delegates . It also noted that the applicant 's examination on DATE and his subsequent medical treatment DATE had revealed no sign of physical injury from the ill - treatment he had described . There was no record of such in his medical file by the prison doctor , the prison psychiatrist or the medical assistant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was found hanging in his cell , but was resuscitated .

The prison staff had taken all necessary medical measures to save his life . After that he had been taken to hospital , from which he had returned on DATE . His mother had last seen him in DATE . The witness said that by his attempted suicide the applicant had violated prison rules , and had therefore been placed in solitary confinement for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Commission observed that the applicant 's mother 's account of the suicide attempt was not completely borne out by the applicant himself who had testified before the Delegates that he had hanged himself because of the beating by prison officers on DATE . However , he had not recalled any detail relating to the events of DATE . He had submitted that he had been in a nervous state and could not endure any longer the treatment to which he had been subjected . The Commission noted in this regard that the applicant 's account that he had attempted to commit suicide was supported by the testimony given by the prison governor , his CARDINAL assistants and by the CARDINAL warders on duty CARDINAL . The statements of these witnesses might not have been totally consistent in every detail . However , the ORG found such differences to be of a minor nature when considered against the detailed , precise and globally consistent accounts presented by them .", "CARDINAL . In this respect the Commission also attached relevance to the fact that the applicant had immediately been given external heart massage and mouth - to - DATE resuscitation which had saved his life . At the same time , the ambulance had been called and after the applicant had been examined by the ear , nose and throat specialist , he was transferred to the psycho - neurological hospital where he stayed DATE . The Commission noted that DATE after his return from hospital , the applicant had stated that he had not hanged himself at all . It considered , however , that the applicant had been then in a state of shock and of partial amnesia . Moreover , the testimony of the prison psychiatrist who had examined the applicant in detail stated that the applicant used to say that he could not see what had caused him to commit suicide and that he could not even imagine why he had done it . The Commission therefore found that it could not be considered as established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been subjected to ill - treatment in prison on DATE .", "DATE . On DATE the applicant 's mother requested the GPE - Frankivsk Regional Prosecutor , the GPE - Frankivsk Regional Directorate of ORG and the prison governor to set up an independent medical commission in order to examine the applicant 's health .

She repeated this request to the GPE - Frankivsk Regional Prosecutor on DATE , stating that she had been informed that the applicant 's state of health was in danger . On DATE the applicant 's mother was informed by Mr Kmyta , Deputy Head of ORG , that her complaint concerning the applicant 's alleged torture had been examined and found to be unsubstantiated and that the latter 's medical examination had not revealed any signs of torture .

On DATE the mother was informed by the prison governor that her request had been rejected on the grounds that there was no sign of torture or the use of any other form of physical violence against the applicant and that his health was satisfactory .

The light was on TIME a day and the central radio was switched off at TIME . The inmates were frequently observed by prison warders through a spy hole in the door of the cell which deprived them of any kind of private space .

In its ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL ) , the ORG expressed at the outset its serious concern about the conditions under which these prisoners were being held and about the regime applied to them . It was noted that prisoners sentenced to death were usually accommodated CARDINAL to a cell , the cell measuring CARDINAL - CARDINAL m\u00b2 . The cells had no access to natural light , the windows being obscured by metal plates . The artificial lighting , which was permanently on , was not always sufficiently strong with the result that some cells were dim . To ventilate the cells , prisoners could pull a cord that opened a flap ; despite this the cells were very humid and quite cold ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The equipment in the cells was described in the ORG as being rudimentary , consisting of a metal bed and/or sloping platform ( equipped with a thin mattress , sheets of dubious cleanliness and a blanket which was manifestly insufficient to keep out the cold ) , a shelf and CARDINAL narrow stools . Prisoners were supposed to be able to listen to radio programmes via a speaker built into the wall of the cell , but it had been reported to the delegation that the radio only functioned sporadically ( ibid . ) .", "All the cells had un - partitioned toilets which faced the living - area ; as a result , a prisoner using the toilet had to do so in full view of his cellmate . As regards toiletries , prisoners sentenced to death were in a similarly difficult situation as many of the other inmates ; items such as soap and toothpaste were rarities ( ibid . ) .", "It was further recorded that prisoners sentenced to death had no form of activity outside their cells , not even an hour of outdoor exercise . At best they could leave their cells once DATE to use the shower in the cell - block , and for TIME a month , if they were authorised to receive family visits . In - cell activities consisted of reading and listening to the radio when it worked . Apart from the DATE visits which some inmates received , human contact was limited essentially to the occasional visit by an NORP priest or a member of the health - care staff , who spoke to the prisoners through a grille in the cell - door ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The ORG summarised its findings in this regard as follows :", "\u201c In short , prisoners sentenced to death were locked up for TIME a day in cells which offered only a very restricted amount of living space and had no access to natural light and sometimes very meagre artificial lighting , with virtually no activities to occupy their time and very little opportunity for human contact . Most of them had been kept in such deleterious conditions for considerable periods of time ( ranging from DATE to over DATE ) . Such a situation may be fully consistent with the legal provisions in force in GPE concerning the treatment of prisoners sentenced to death . However , this does not alter the fact that , in the ORG 's opinion , it amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment . \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "It was further recorded that the delegation had received numerous complaints from prisoners sentenced to death about the fact that they lacked information with regard to their legal situation the progress of their cases , follow - up to applications for cases to be reviewed , examination of their complaints etc . ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In its Response to the DATE Report , ORG recorded that a number of organisational and practical steps had been taken to resolve the problems identified by the ORG . In particular , LAW had been introduced to guarantee to prisoners sentenced to death the right to be visited once DATE by relatives , to be visited by a lawyer to get legal assistance , to be visited by a priest and to receive and send correspondence without limitation .

A ORG delegation visited GPE from DATE in the course of which they again inspected GPE No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL in GPE where , at the time of the visit , there were detained CARDINAL prisoners who had been sentenced to death . The ORG noted that certain changes had occurred since the previous visit . In particular , the cells had natural light and were better furnished and the prisoners had an hour of exercise per day in the open air , although it was observed that there was insufficient space for real physical exercise ( paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The ORG further recorded that important progress had been made in the right of prisoners to receive visits from relatives and to correspond ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . However , the ORG noted certain unacceptable conditions of detention including the fact that prisoners continued to spend CARDINAL out of TIME a day in their cells and that opportunities for human contact remained very limited ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "A third visit to GPE took place from DATE , in the course of which the delegation inspected , inter alia , the pre - trial prison ( GPE PERSON ) in PERSON . The ORG welcomed the decision of the NORP authorities to abolish the death penalty and noted that most of the CARDINAL prisoners subject to the death sentence had had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Despite these welcome steps , the ORG recorded that the treatment of this category of prisoner was a major source of concern to ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . It was noted that , further to a provisional instruction issued in DATE and pending the establishment of CARDINAL high - security units specifically intended for life prisoners , such prisoners were subjected to a strict confinement regime ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . While living space in the cells was generally satisfactory and while work had started on refurbishing cells in all the establishments visited , there were major deficiencies in terms of access to natural light and the quality of artificial light and ventilation ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Moreover , life - sentence prisoners were confined in their cells for TIME a day with no form of organized activities and , by way of activities outside their cells , were entitled to TIME outdoor exercise , which took place in unacceptable conditions . There was virtually no human contact : since the entry into force of the DATE instruction , visits from relatives had been forbidden and prisoners were only allowed to send CARDINAL letter DATE , although there were no restrictions on receiving letters ( paragraphCARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In their Response to the Report the Ukrainian Government noted further legal amendments which ensured that life prisoners had TIME of exercise per day and CARDINAL family visits of TIME .
