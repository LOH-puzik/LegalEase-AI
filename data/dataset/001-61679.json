Tissue of the size of an egg was removed and examined but proved benign .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period the applicant sent numerous complaints in respect of the conditions of his detention to the Director of FAC , to the Director of ORG , ORG and to other institutions . His complaints concerned the food in prison , allegedly insufficient heating , allegedly lost correspondence and other matters . He received answers to only a part of his complaints . With the exception of a request to use a radio receiver and some of the requests for medical treatment , all other complaints allegedly did not bring about any improvement of his situation .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant was moved to the ORG prison .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has not visited the PERSON prison where the applicant was detained .", "CARDINAL . In DATE it visited , however , CARDINAL inmates sentenced to death and detained in the PERSON prison facilities and described the conditions of detention there as follows :", "\u201c The material conditions in the cells left a great deal to be desired : mediocre access to natural light and weak artificial lighting ; inadequate heating ; cell furnishings in a poor state of repair ; dirty bed linen , etc . As regards out - of - cell activities , they were limited to TIME for use of the sanitary facilities , TIME outdoor exercise ( which the prisoners alleged was not guaranteed DATE ) and CARDINAL visit per month . The CARDINAL prisoners were not allowed to work ( not even inside their cells ) , nor to go to the library , the cinema room or the refectory ( their food was brought to the cell ) . In short , they were subject to an impoverished regime and , more particularly , were offered very little human contact . The latter consisted essentially of the possibility to talk to each other during outdoor exercise ( which they took together ) , and occasional dealings with prison officers . Practically the only forms of useful occupation at their disposal were reading newspapers and books , and writing letters .", "The above - described situation is in accordance with the rules concerning prisoners sentenced to death , adopted after the moratorium on the execution of the death penalty ... Nevertheless , in the ORG 's view it is not acceptable .", "It is generally acknowledged that all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate mental and physical stimulation are likely , in the long term , to have damaging effects , resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and social abilities . The delegation found that the regime applied to prisoners sentenced to death in FAC did not provide such stimulation .", "The ORG recommends that the regime applied to prisoners sentenced to death held in FAC , as well as in other prisons in GPE , be revised in order to ensure that they are offered purposeful activities and appropriate human contact . Further , the ORG recommends that steps be taken to improve the material conditions in the cells occupied at FAC by prisoners sentenced to death . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In paragraphs CARDINAL of its DATE report on GPE , the ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c [ H]ealth care in NORP prisons is provided by ORG ... Prison health - care staff are recruited by and administratively subordinated to ORG , whose ORG is responsible for supervising their work . The prison health - care services apply general health guidelines and regulations issued by ORG ; further , arrangements can be made for hospitalising prisoners in need of urgent treatment in ORG establishments . However , it emerged that in ORG view , given the division of responsibilities , the issue of health care for prisoners lay outside its remit ...", "A similar situation is found in many other countries in LOC , where the provision of health care is the responsibility of the authority in charge of prison establishments . However , the ORG believes that a greater involvement of ORG in the provision of health care in the prison system would help to ensure optimum health care for prisoners , as well as implementation of the principle of the equivalence of health care in prison with that in the outside community ... This approach is clearly reflected in Recommendation No R ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL concerning the ethical and organisational aspects of health care in prison , recently adopted by ORG .", "[ I]n order to guarantee their professional independence and quality of medical work , it is important that prison health - care staff be aligned as closely as possible with the mainstream of health - care provision in the community at large ...", "The ORG also wishes to stress again that whatever institutional arrangements are made for the provision of health care in prisons , it is essential that prison doctors ' clinical decisions should be governed only by medical criteria and that the quality and effectiveness of their work should be monitored by a qualified medical authority .", "[ Some improvements since DATE were reported . ] Full - time doctors had been appointed , and posts for psychiatrists created , at all prisons , and steps were being taken to employ full - time trained nurses . Further , the shortage of medicines within the prison system had been overcome ...", "[ T]he delegation heard complaints from prisoners at [ the prisons visited , in GPE and PERSON ] about delays in gaining access to the doctor . Prisoners who wished to be medically examined announced that to the officer on duty during the morning roll - call . Such requests were meant to be entered in a special register kept on each unit and presented to the doctor every morning . Such a system is unexceptionable . However , the ORG must stress that all requests to see a doctor should be brought to the attention of the prison doctor ; it is not for prison officers to screen such requests . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Historically , most Member States of ORG approached the question of the abolition of the death penalty by suspending executions pending debate on a final abolition . States which became members of ORG during DATE were urged by ORG to introduce moratoria on executions as a first step towards the abolition of the death penalty ( see Report on the abolition of the death penalty in LOC , ORG . CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has held that \u201c in the absence of further compelling circumstances \u201d prolonged detention on death row per se does not constitute a violation of LAW ( prohibition of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ) ( see PERSON v. GPE , Views of DATE , communication no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON , ORG , communication no . CARDINAL ; and PERSON v. GPE and GPE , Views of DATE , communication no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Commission , when examining complaints by persons on death row , has found violations of LAW ( prohibiting cruel , infamous or unusual punishment of persons accused of offences ) and LAW and CARDINAL of ORG ( right to humane treatment and prohibition of torture , cruel , inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment ) mainly on the strength of facts concerning irregularities in the sentencing process , the material conditions and regime of detention and ill - treatment in prison , while also taking into account the length of the period spent on death row ( PERSON v. GPE , Case No . CARDINAL , Report No . CARDINAL , ORG / II.CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE , Case No . CARDINAL , Report CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG , examining cases from GPE , had to decide whether the execution of a person following long delay after his sentence to death could amount to inhuman punishment or treatment contrary to those GPE ' Constitutions . Initially , ORG considered that a condemned person could not complain about delay of his execution caused by his resort to appellate proceedings ( PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL , ORG v. Attorney - General of GPE and GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL W.L.R. DATE ) , or indeed about any delay , \u201c whatever the reasons \u201d , including a temporary moratorium on executions which had been lifted ( PERSON v. Attorney - General of GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , departing from its earlier decisions , ORG held that to execute the appellants , who had spent DATE on death row and had on CARDINAL occasions lived through TIME stays of execution , would be unlawful as being inhuman punishment and therefore advised that their death sentences should be commuted to life imprisonment ( PERSON and PERSON v. The Attorney General for GPE and another [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON and PERSON , part of the relevant period was taken up by a temporary moratorium on executions .", "\u201c [ P]olitical debate on the desirability of retaining the death sentence in GPE ... resulted in a resolution of the ORG on DATE to suspend all executions for DATE pending the report of a ORG of inquiry . ORG was appointed in DATE . Before the ORG reported , an execution took place on DATE which drew a protest to ORG from the Chairman of the ORG . No further executions took place before the ORG reported in DATE . On CARDINALth DATE executions were resumed \u201d ( PERSON , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The judgment in PERSON and PERSON stated , inter alia :", "\u201c There is an instinctive revulsion against the prospect of hanging a man after he has been held under sentence of death for DATE . What gives rise to this instinctive revulsion ? The answer can only be our humanity ; we regard it as an inhuman act to keep a man facing the agony of execution over a long extended period of time . But before their Lordships condemn the act of execution as ' inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment ' within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) [ of LAW ] there are a number of factors that have to be balanced in weighing the delay . If delay is due entirely to the fault of the accused such as an escape from custody or frivolous and time wasting resort to legal procedures which amount to an abuse of process the accused can not be allowed to take advantage of that delay for to do so would be to permit the accused to use illegitimate means to escape the punishment inflicted upon him in the interest of protecting society against crime ...", "In their Lordships ' view a ORG that wishes to retain capital punishment must accept the responsibility of ensuring that execution follows as swiftly as practicable after sentence , allowing a reasonable time for appeal and consideration of reprieve . It is part of the human condition that a condemned man will take every opportunity to save his life through use of the appellate procedure . If the appellate procedure enables the prisoner to prolong the appellate hearings over DATE , the fault is to be attributed to the appellate system that permits such delay and not to the prisoner who takes advantage of it . Appellate procedures that echo down DATE are not compatible with capital punishment . The death row phenomenon must not become established as a part of our jurisprudence ...", "There may of course be circumstances which will lead ORG to recommend a respite in the carrying out of a death sentence , such as a political moratorium on the death sentence , or a petition on behalf of the appellants to [ international human rights bodies ] or a constitutional appeal to ORG . But if these respites cumulatively result in delay running into DATE an execution will be likely to infringe section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and call for commutation of the death sentence to life imprisonment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Further , calculating the normal length of relevant appellate proceedings in GPE and taking into consideration the time necessary for examination of applications to ORG and ORG , ORG held that :", "\u201c in any case in which execution is to take place DATE after sentence there will be strong grounds for believing that the delay is such as to constitute inhuman or degrading punishment or ... treatment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In cases which followed ORG accepted a claim that DATE and DATE also warranted a finding in favour of the appellant ( PERSON v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) but dismissed appeals concerning shorter periods ( PERSON v. The Attorney General of the GPE of The GPE [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL ; ORG ) v. The Minister of ORG ( GPE ) [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL ; and PERSON and PERSON v. The Minister of ORG ( GPE ) [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) and held that save in exceptional circumstances , periods of pre - sentence detention should not be taken into account since , inter alia , \u201c the state of mind of the person ... during this earlier period is not the agony of mind of a man facing execution , but ... anxiety and concern of the accused\u201d(Fisher , \u00a7 DATE ) . In PERSON and PERSON , ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c If a man has been sentenced to death , it is wrong to add other cruelties to the manner of his death ... In PERSON ... the [ ORG ] held that the execution after excessive delay was an inhuman punishment because it added to the penalty of death the additional torture of a long period of alternating hope and despair . It is not the delay in itself which is a cruel and unusual punishment ... , ' it is the act of hanging the man that is rendered cruel and unusual by the lapse of time \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that execution following inordinate delay after sentence of death violated LAW which provides that \u201c no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law \u201d and that the reasons for the delay were immaterial ( PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R. CARDINAL , PERSON and Others v. the ORG of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R. CARDINAL and Smt . PERSON v. State of GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.J. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . GPE ORG has refused to accept claims that lengthy detention on death row violated the prohibition , contained in LAW to LAW , of cruel and unusual punishment , emphasising that the delay is due to the convicted person 's own decision to make use of all possibilities to appeal ( PERSON v. GPE , CARDINAL US CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has held that NORP constitutional standards did not bar extradition to GPE of a defendant facing the death penalty ( PERSON v. GPE ( Minister of ORG ) , [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R. CARDINAL ) . However , in DATE it changed its approach and held that if the person being extradited could face the death penalty , constitutional standards required that in all but exceptional cases assurances must be sought from GPE that the death penalty would not be imposed or , if imposed , would not be carried out ( GPE v.
