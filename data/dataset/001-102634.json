The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment for armed robbery by ORG in GPE . ( ORG subsequently held that the unfairness of the underlying proceedings gave rise to a violation of LAW by the NORP authorities and awarded the applicant just satisfaction : PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG ) . The end date of this sentence was DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE . On DATE ORG in GPE held that he was to serve the remainder of his sentence under a strict regime in a NORP prison ( fegyh\u00e1z ) and that he could be released on parole after serving CARDINAL of the term , i.e. on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . On DATE the Attorney ORG intervened in the case , filing a motion for remedy in support of the applicant . The ORG argued that the service of the applicant 's sentence under a strict regime constituted an undue aggravation of his penal situation , in breach of LAW , which entailed that he could be released on probation only belatedly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decisions concerning the regime of the applicant 's transferred sentence and his conditional release , holding that they were unlawful . It held that the best approximation of the NORP sentence in NORP law was to have imposed a medium regime ( b\u00f6rt\u00f6n ) on the applicant for the remainder of his prison term , release on parole then being possible after having served DATE of the sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant brought an official liability action against ORG . He claimed compensation for the fact that , because of that court 's wrong reconciliation of the NORP and NORP penitentiary rules , he had been released on parole only on DATE , whereas under the medium regime he could have already been released in DATE . He also sought damages for having erroneously spent DATE and DATE in a strict - regime prison .", "CARDINAL . After divergent decisions , on DATE ORG finally dismissed the action . Concerning the belated release , it held that , although ORG interpretation of the law had been overruled , there was no indication that it had carried out the complex task of reconciling the inconsistent NORP and NORP rules with gross negligence giving rise to tort liability . As to the period wrongly spent in a strict - regime prison , it noted that the applicant had not substantiated that he had sustained any actual damage .", "CARDINAL . DATE , criminal proceedings were conducted against the applicant in GPE for the abuse of firearms . On DATE the ORG sentenced him to DATE suspended imprisonment . The court observed that unlicensed firearms had been found in the applicant 's car and , in so doing , it relied on the testimony of several witnesses . It took into account the extreme protraction of the case since DATE as a crucial mitigating circumstance entailing a suspended sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld this judgment . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's petition for review .", "CARDINAL . The Convention on ORG ( NORP Treaty Series no . CARDINAL ) provides as follows :", "\u201c The enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering ORG and that ORG alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions . ... \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL .

It shall not aggravate , by its nature or duration , the sanction imposed in the sentencing ORG , nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering ORG . \u201d", "\u201c In the case of conversion of sentence , the procedures provided for by the law of the administering ORG apply .
