NORP In his article entitled \u201c Information Bulletin : What the president of the City Council and the City Council Board have to hide \u201d , he referred to CARDINAL municipality officials . He stated that PERSON had been so busy interfering with the employment policies of the local schools that they had not had time to administer the municipal educational funds properly . As a consequence teachers and employers of the municipal educational institutions had not received allowances ( for protective clothing ) which under relevant legal provisions they should have received . In addition , the physical education teachers had received lower salaries without a certain PERCENT allowance . In the applicant \u2019s opinion the teachers did not claim this allowance as they had been afraid to lose their jobs . When the applicant had informed the mayors - T. B. , PERSON and the president of ORG PERSON the financial irregularities , he had been dismissed from his post . He had eventually been reinstated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further claimed that the municipality had received subsidies from the ORG to provide transport for children to schools . However , the schools had been required to pay an additional contribution to the municipality . The applicant maintained that PERSON had known about this situation but had failed to take appropriate action . In addition she had not acted for the benefit of the school employees . Parties which had been organised for city council members had been wholly financed from public funds .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the applicant stated that he was not surprised that PERSON had not replied to an inquiry from ORG ( PERSON ) as the municipal budget surplus had probably been used to pay bonuses and per diem allowances for the council members .", "He concluded :", "\u201c I encourage the readers to reconsider whether DATE the city was governed by the right people ; whether these people can be offered yet another term of office in the DATE elections .", "Whether during DATE they have indeed acted honestly for the common well - being of the ORG community or in their own personal interests .", "Can these people be trusted again with the city council mandates ? \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The court held that the applicant \u2019s article concerned CARDINAL municipal officials but amongst them CARDINAL were members of the NORP group . None of them had been elected to ORG in the local elections . The court heard evidence from these persons and considered that the applicant \u2019s statements had been untrue .
