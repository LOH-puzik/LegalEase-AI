THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is an NORP citizen . At the time of lodging his application he was detained in PERSON The GPE , GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , CARDINAL , GPE , a security guard , was shot dead by CARDINAL men in FAC in the centre of GPE . The gunmen \u2019s escape was caught on video cameras positioned in the vicinity . The gunmen were wearing ORG white safety helmets , dust masks and gloves . CARDINAL of the gunmen was wearing a jacket which had a blue / grey check or plaid , the other a tan coloured jacket . They were shown on the video film retrieved from the cameras running towards FAC at the junction of FAC and LOC , not far from the scene of the killing . The gunmen \u2019s flight was subsequently taken to have occurred at CARDINAL . At the applicant \u2019s trial the judge was satisfied that the time shown on a video camera filming the gunmen \u2019s escape was TIME slow in comparison with the speaking clock . The sequence of events was not disputed at the applicant \u2019s trial .", "On DATE the police conducted a search of the house of the applicant \u2019s girlfriend where the applicant was staying . Among the items seized was a child \u2019s red coat with a black trim round the collar , which belonged to the applicant \u2019s daughter . After the search the police arrested the applicant and cautioned him , pursuant to LAW Order DATE , in the following terms :", "\u201c You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so , but I must warn you that if you fail to mention any fact which you rely on in your defence in court , your failure to take this opportunity to mention it may be treated in court as supporting any relevant evidence against you . If you do wish to say anything , what you say may be given in evidence . \u201d", "The applicant did not reply to the caution . He was taken to ORG where the police handed him a written copy of the caution together with an explanatory sheet .", "On DATE the police conducted a search of the applicant \u2019s brother \u2019s house and seized a white or cream shirt which was at that time being worn by the brother .", "The applicant was interviewed on numerous occasions DATE and DATE . A caution was administered at the start of the first interview and again before the beginning of some of the other interviews . The applicant refused to answer any questions , including questions concerning his movements on TIME CARDINAL DATE . He also refused to watch a video recording or still photographs taken from the recording showing him entering the ORG immediately after the shooting with a child in his arms .", "The police also arrested a certain PERSON who similarly refused to answer questions or react to his appearance in the video recording carrying a child in his arms .", "The applicant and S. were charged with the murder of GPE and with possession of a revolver and a quantity of ammunition with intent to endanger life . They were tried at ORG before a single judge sitting without a jury .", "At the trial , Witness A. testified that he was having a drink in FAC and saw CARDINAL men enter through FAC entrance wearing white safety helmets and face masks . They passed through the bar to the porch leading onto LOC . He saw CARDINAL of the men take off his safety helmet , gloves and jacket . He was met by a woman and a young child . He handed a package to the woman and picked up the child , whom he recalled as being blond and wearing something red . Witness A. gave a description of the men and their clothing . His evidence in respect of the clothing was found to be flawed .", "Witnesses B. and C. testified that they saw CARDINAL women at FAC entrance to FAC sometime after CARDINAL . CARDINAL men were standing inside the entrance and were removing anti - dusk masks and blue ORG overalls . The CARDINAL women then each handed a small child to each of the men . The couples walked quickly down PERSON , each man carrying a child . Witness B. last saw the couples at the end of LOC by the junction of FAC . He also stated that he saw an army landrover turning at the junction . Witness C. confirmed Witness PERSON \u2019s account . Witness PERSON said he saw the discarded clothing in LOC . CARDINAL of the discarded jackets had a blue / grey check or plaid on the outside .", "On the basis of this testimony the trial judge was satisfied that the CARDINAL men carrying children last seen by Witnesses PERSON and C. at the end of LOC and going in the direction of FAC were the gunmen who killed GPE", "The prosecution adduced video recordings in support of its case that the applicant and his co - accused , S. , were the gunmen . The court heard that LAW was filming persons crossing FAC from the end of LOC and heading towards the entrance to FAC . Camera CARDINAL was filming persons entering FAC Camera CARDINAL recorded CARDINAL men carrying children walking within QUANTITY of each other towards FAC entrance of FAC . The time was CARDINAL . Camera CARDINAL recorded CARDINAL man carrying a small child enter at CARDINAL . A second man , walking a few paces behind the first man , then entered with a small girl in his arms . The child was wearing a red coat with a black trim around the collar . The applicant \u2019s features are distinguishable from the recording of the second man . On the video film retrieved from LAW and CARDINAL an army landrover , also referred to in the testimony of Witnesses B and C , is clearly visible . It was not disputed that there was CARDINAL army landrover in the centre of GPE on TIME in question .", "The video cameras also picked out a \u201c third man \u201d carrying a small child and crossing FAC from the direction of LOC and entering FAC of FAC . The man was wearing a blue garment with a very conspicuous logo on the back and front . In the film he is first seen carrying a child wearing a red or pink coat or jacket and when in FAC he is seen holding the child \u2019s hand .", "In addition to the witness evidence and the video evidence , the prosecution relied on the following :", "\u2013 the red coat seized at the house of the applicant \u2019s girlfriend was an exact match of the coat worn by the child seen being carried by the second man in the video film , identified as the applicant .", "\u2013 forensic evidence that a blue / grey check jacket discarded by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL men who had entered the GPE bar after the killing had come into contact with the child \u2019s red coat found at the applicant \u2019s girlfriend \u2019s house . Red fibres from the coat had been found on the jacket .", "\u2013 forensic evidence that one of the white safety helmets discarded by the CARDINAL men in FAC had blood on it of the same rare type as that of the victim \u2019s .", "\u2013 forensic evidence that there were firearms residue on each of the CARDINAL jackets discarded outside the bar .", "At the close of the prosecution case , the applicant \u2019s counsel , who had accepted that the applicant was the second man filmed on LAW and CARDINAL , asked the judge to rule that there was insufficient evidence against his client to constitute a prima facie case that he was one of the gunmen .", "Without any reference to LAW Order DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the trial judge concluded that a \u201c strong prima facie case \u201d had been made out that the applicant was one of the killers . The judge had regard to the following considerations : the strong visual likeness between the man filmed on Camera DATE and the applicant ; the timing of the events as filmed ; the link between the applicant and the gunmen seen by Witnesses PERSON and C. was strengthened by the fact that both witnesses had seen the landrover turning at the end of FAC at almost the same time as the arrival of the gunmen at that spot and strong forensic evidence of contact between the discarded blue / grey jacket and the child \u2019s red coat found at the home of the applicant \u2019s girlfriend .", "In reaching this conclusion the judge had due regard to the weakness of Witness A. \u2019s recollection of the colour of the jacket worn by the first man who entered FAC , alleged to be the applicant . He also noted that Witness A. had incorrectly described the colour of the child \u2019s hair as blond . It was in fact dark . Furthermore , the judge acknowledged that Witness B. was incorrect in his recollection that he had seen QUANTITY men removing blue overalls at FAC . In the judge \u2019s opinion , these discrepancies did not detract from the weight of the prosecution case against the applicant . He observed that Witness A. \u2019s description of the nose and hair of the first man to enter the bar reasonably tallied with the applicant \u2019s . The judge did not accept the applicant \u2019s submission that the third man filmed carrying a child entering FAC could have been one of the gunmen . He considered that the video evidence and the timing of all CARDINAL men \u2019s appearances in the recordings suggested that there was DATE TIME gap between the camera sighting of the third man in FAC and the appearance of the CARDINAL gunmen . For the judge , it would have been most unlikely that there would have been such a distance between the CARDINAL gunmen who had last been seen together by Witnesses PERSON and C. at the end of LOC .", "At the end of the prosecution case , the applicant gave evidence . Answering the only question put to him by his counsel , the applicant denied any involvement in GPE \u2019s murder . In cross - examination he stated that on DATE he had taken his small daughter to GPE and had gone to ORG to allow her to throw coins into the fountain before going on an errand . The applicant accepted that he was one of the men recorded on Camera CARDINAL entering FAC carrying the girl in the red coat , at CARDINAL .", "The applicant further stated that he had refused to give this explanation when interviewed by the police because he had an unfriendly relationship with the police , and that he was angry because they had arrested his girlfriend and had caused distress to his children . The applicant denied being in the company of S. on DATE .", "Having ruled that the CARDINAL accused had a case to answer , the judge drew a very strong inference against the applicant under LAW of the DATE Order from the applicant \u2019s failure to answer the questions put to him by the police . The judge considered the following :", "\u201c Notwithstanding that [ the applicant ] has no previous convictions and the relevance of this consideration to the issue of his credibility I am satisfied that [ the applicant ] told a tissue of lies in the witness box as to the reasons why he did not tell the police when interviewed in ORG that he had entered the FAC on TIME CARDINAL DATE carrying a child , that he had nothing to do with the murder of GPE and that he had entered FAC for the innocent purpose of allowing his child to throw coins into the fountain , and as to his reasons for failing to watch the video film and to acknowledge that he was one of the men shown on it and to say that his reason for entering the centre was innocent . I am also satisfied that [ the applicant ] lied in the witness box when he said he had nothing to do with the murder of [ GPE ] and that he was in the area of FAC for an innocent purpose .", "If the account which [ the applicant ] gave in the witness box for his movements on TIME CARDINAL May were true , and if he were innocent of the murder of [ GPE ] , then notwithstanding whatever hostility he may have felt towards the police , and notwithstanding any feelings of anger and upset he may have had against the police for arresting his girlfriend PERSON , and leaving his children crying for their mother , it is quite unbelievable and completely contrary to common sense that [ the applicant ] would not have given his innocent explanation to the police in the hope that this would secure the release of his girlfriend and also his own release . \u201d", "Having regard to the very strong case against the applicant and the very strong inference drawn against him under LAW , the judge was satisfied that the applicant was one of the gunmen who murdered GPE and found him guilty on both counts of the indictment .", "The applicant appealed against conviction to ORG . He argued that , on the evidence , the trial judge had erred in finding that he had a case to answer . He also challenged the judge \u2019s decision to draw an adverse inference from his silence at ORG in application of LAW .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG found that the judge was justified in ruling on the evidence before him that there was a prima facie case against the applicant . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s suggestion that the forensic evidence linking the red coat to one of the gunmen \u2019s jackets was less than compelling . In the opinion of the court , that evidence was a very significant element in the prima facie case . The court , like the trial judge , also dismissed the applicant\u2019 submission that the fact that a \u201c third man \u201d carrying a child raised a reasonable possibility that the applicant was not CARDINAL of the gunmen . It concluded that that , according to the timings on the videos , the \u201c third man \u201d had been well clear of the junction between FAC and LOC by the time the landrover appeared . Witnesses PERSON and C. put the CARDINAL gunmen at that junction at the same time as the landrover . Even if PERSON had been mistaken about the colour of the top worn by CARDINAL of the gunmen , the judge had been entitled to hold that the uncontradicted evidence of Witnesses B. and C. on timing and the presence of the landrover was accurate . The court further observed that although the \u201c third man \u201d was wearing a top with a very conspicuous logo , neither of these witnesses had recalled this logo which \u201c would have stood out \u201d . ORG also considered that the judge was justified in regarding the difficulties in accepting the correctness of PERSON evidence as insufficient to prevent the ORG \u2019s evidence from being accepted as creating a prima facie case .", "As to the drawing of an adverse inference , ORG agreed with the trial judge \u2019s conclusion that it was \u201c quite unbelievable and contrary to commonsense \u201d for the applicant not to have advanced an innocent explanation for his movements on TIME of the murder , if there was one .", "ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that the trial judge had been wrong to draw an inference because there was a reasonable possibility that the applicant \u2019s \u201c policy \u201d of not talking to the police was the true explanation for his not having done so . In his judgment , the Lord Chief Justice stated that the assertion of such a \u201c policy \u201d could not preclude a court from drawing adverse inferences . Otherwise , in his view , LAW would be undermined and effects could be negated in every case simply by an accused claiming a \u201c policy \u201d of not talking to the police . The Lord Chief Justice concluded :", "\u201c We are quite satisfied that the judge was entitled , and indeed entirely correct , to draw an adverse inference ... . We are also satisfied that he was correct in holding that on the whole of the evidence the ORG had established that the [ applicant ] was one of the gunmen who murdered [ GPE ] . \u201d", "B.
