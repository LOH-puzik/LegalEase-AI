SLOVENIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the Court by Mr B. Mrva , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , ORG Attorney - General .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE the applicant has had a foundry in the village of GPE where she has been producing products such as ashtrays and door handles . Her and her daughter 's income depends on this business .", "CARDINAL . On the adjoining plot of land , the owner , PERSON , built extensions to his building , which had originally been built for a handicraft business . The applicant 's plot stands to the west of PERSON 's plot . As a result of the extensions , there is QUANTITY between the applicant 's and PERSON 's buildings . The extensions were in the form of CARDINAL apartments . They were built without the required building permits and several injunctions were issued prohibiting PERSON from continuing with the building work or from using the unlawfully built constructions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "The apartments were nevertheless sold and all of them are currently inhabited .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that , because of the illegally built extensions , PERSON 's land was practically all built up and there was no space left for the appertaining land . Consequently , the residents , who were mostly families , had been using the applicant 's land for parking , playing , etc . An oil - fuel tank had been placed on the terrace of PERSON 's building and was a potential fire risk to the applicant . The rainwater run - off was directed onto the applicant 's plot of land . The unlawfully built flats had no proper drainage , which resulted in an intolerable smell and the conditions were against all health and hygiene standards . The new residents were constantly complaining about the foundry 's activities , which operate TIME a day .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE PERSON obtained a site permit ( permit for use of land \u2013 lokacijsko dovoljenje ) for a large extension to his initial construction to convert part of the workshop into an apartment block and for the construction of a building for business and storage purposes . This permit was renewed by a decision of DATE . Subsequently , PERSON obtained a building permit ( gradbeno dovoljenje ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the applicant 's successful request for the matter to be reopened , ORG quashed the decisions by which the site and building permits had been granted . The applicant participated as party to these and further proceedings . As regards the site permit , an appeal by PERSON was dismissed by ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) on DATE . PERSON subsequently applied to ORG challenging the ORG 's decision . His application was rejected on DATE . He then appealed to ORG . His appeal was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the building permit , the ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered a re - examination of the application on DATE . Subsequently , on DATE , ORG again quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE , meaning that PERSON 's request for a building permit was refused . It relied on the fact that , following the above proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , PERSON was not in possession of a valid site permit which was a prerequisite for acquiring a building permit .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant instituted proceedings against PERSON in ORG seeking the demolition of the unlawfully built extensions . She claimed that the extensions had been endangering her business and having a negative effect on working conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively , ORG issued CARDINAL interim orders prohibiting PERSON from continuing with the illegal construction and selling the apartments . PERSON did not respect the orders and continued with the construction .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings , the court appointed a construction expert who prepared a report . The court refused the applicant 's request for a supplement to the report finding that the request raised issues which should be determined in the administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court , relying on the expert report , dismissed the applicant 's claim . Referring to the conditions laid down in sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of ORG and section CARDINAL of GPE , it found that the deprivation of sunlight did not exceed the statutory limit and that the behaviour of the new residents could not be considered as a source of danger which could justify demolishing the building . In respect of the smell allegedly arising from the drainage , the court found that , firstly , the applicant had not raised this issue in her claim and secondly , the drainage problems had not been caused by the newly built extensions . The applicant could therefore not expect these extensions to be demolished . Lastly , the court noted that the issue of whether PERSON 's construction complied with statutory requirements was not relevant to the civil proceedings because , even if a construction was legal , an aggrieved party could seek redress in respect of an alleged environmental nuisance ( imisije ) in civil proceedings . The question of the compliance with statutory requirements was therefore a matter which had to be decided in the administrative proceedings . Consequently , the court also revoked the interim orders of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal and on DATE ORG upheld the first - instance court 's judgment . As regards the applicant 's argument that she had been refused protection from future interferences by residents of the illegal construction , ORG noted that the potential source of damage would have to be certain and concrete , which could not be established in the present case . In addition , it noted that none of the other issues mentioned by the applicant , namely , how many parking spaces were available to the new residents and where the fuel tank and rubbish bins should be placed , justified the demolition of the extensions and would be more appropriately considered in administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal on points of law , finding that the lower courts ' conclusions were correct and stressing that the applicant 's allegations did not obviously justify the demolition of the disputed construction , which was the only claim pursued by the applicant . It added that demolition could be ordered only when there were no other means to prevent damage .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal . She disputed the lower court 's opinion that she should have used other means in order to protect her right to property . She alleged that , owing to the circumstances of the case , in particular PERSON 's non - compliance with the authorities ' orders and the lack of alternative solutions to the problems deriving from the illegal building , demolition was necessary . She submitted that the fact that PERSON 's building did not comply with the building permits should have been taken into account as the aim of such permits was also to protect the neighbours ' interests . She further submitted that the ORG could intervene only of its own motion and had been ineffective in her case . She would therefore not be able to gain effective protection of her rights in administrative proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's complaints as inadmissible since it did not find any violation of her human rights . In this connection , it found that the courts , by finding that some issues should be determined in administrative proceedings , had not referred the applicant to administrative proceedings or denied judicial protection in respect of those rights . ORG furthermore said that in any event , even when assessing a right in administrative proceedings , a party dissatisfied with the result could subsequently bring a claim before ORG . Lastly , ORG stressed that the applicant 's case had been examined by tribunals established by law which had duly considered the applicant 's claims and that the decisions issued in the case had been well reasoned . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) instituted proceedings against PERSON in respect of the construction of an exterior staircase and the illegal extension of the mansard .", "CARDINAL . According to the note from ORG concerning PERSON 's real estate , PERSON had been banned from continuing to build or sell the construction since DATE . In DATE the status of \u201c illegal construction \u201d ( \u010drna gradnja ) was entered into the registry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a decision ordering the removal of an exterior staircase , for which no permit had ever been issued and which was the only way to enter the apartments situated in the north - west and north sections of the building . By DATE this decision had become final and enforceable . On DATE the ORG also ordered the removal of an extension of MONEY QUANTITY situated in the south section , which consisted of CARDINAL floors , and of the wall which served to separate PERSON 's land from the neighbouring plots . Since administrative enforcement proceedings were not carried out in GPE DATE , which was due to the absence of any authorised operator who could carry out the enforcement , the decisions ordering the enforcement of the above decisions were adopted only on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , PERSON had been using the new extensions , in particular the CARDINAL apartments , despite the fact that he had not obtained an operating permit ( uporabno dovoljenje ) . On DATE , PERSON was banned from making use of the extensions . In DATE , several inspections were carried out of his property . As PERSON had not complied with the decision of DATE , the ORG fined him CARDINAL SIT on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . It would appear from the records concerning the execution of CARDINAL of the decisions of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that part of the above - mentioned extensions to the south section of the building and the wall were demolished in DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the exterior staircase , PERSON was ordered to remove it on DATE . Following an objection from the residents of the apartments , who had also invested in the construction of the staircase , the case was reopened in order to allow them to participate in the proceedings . On CARDINAL DATE , the ORG issued a decision again ordering the removal of the exterior staircase . It noted in its decision that no permit had ever been issued for the construction of the staircase and , furthermore , that the site and building permits for the large extension of the initial building had also been quashed by binding decisions . The case is now pending on appeal .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the LAW ( Zakon o obligacijskih razmerjih , ORG of ORG no . CARDINAL ) provided , in so far as relevant :", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( Zakon o temeljnih lastninskopravnih razmerjih , ORG of ORG no .
