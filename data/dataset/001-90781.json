The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . While working as a consultant physician in the field of rehabilitative medicine , the applicant was charged on CARDINAL counts of indecent assault on CARDINAL female patients while they were allegedly under hypnosis . CARDINAL of the complainants , ORG , committed suicide ( taken to be unrelated to the assault ) before the trial but , DATE after the alleged assault , had made a statement to the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a preliminary hearing was held to determine whether ORG 's statement should be read to the jury . The judge stated that the contents of the statement were crucial to the prosecution on count one as there was no other direct evidence of what took place ; \u201c putting it bluntly , no statement , no count one . \u201d The defence accepted that if the statement was read to the jury at trial they would be in a position to rebut it through the cross - examination of other witnesses and expose inconsistencies in their evidence . The judge considered that this represented a route by which ORG statement and/or her credibility could be challenged ; however , he went on to underline the importance of the need for the trial judge to give directions to the jury as to the status of the evidence . The judge allowed the evidence to be admitted at trial .", "CARDINAL . The jury heard evidence from a number of different witnesses and the defence were given the opportunity to cross - examine other witnesses who had produced similar fact evidence , including the second complainant who had produced supportive evidence . In his summing up , the trial judge directed the members of the jury , on CARDINAL separate occasions , as to how they should regard the read statement of the deceased complainant . The judge stated in his summing up :", "\u201c It is very important that you [ the jury ] bear in mind when considering her [ ORG 's ] evidence that you have not seen her give evidence ; you have not heard her give evidence ; and you have not heard her evidence cross - examined [ by applicant 's counsel ] , who would undoubtedly have had a number of questions to put to her . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge later stated :", "\u201c ... bear in mind ... that this evidence was read to you . The allegation is completely denied ... you must take that into account when considering her evidence . \u201d", "On CARDINAL occasions the jury asked for clarification of points raised in the read statement of GPE", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted by a unanimous verdict on both counts of indecent assault . He was sentenced to a DATE custodial sentence on the first count and a DATE custodial sentence on the second count , to run consecutively .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against his conviction to ORG . The appeal centred on the pre - trial ruling to admit ORG statement as evidence . It was also submitted that , in his summing up , the trial judge did not give adequate directions to the jury as to the consequential disadvantage of this evidence to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal was dismissed . ORG concluded on DATE that the applicant 's right to a fair trial had not been infringed . With regard to the admission in evidence of the statement of the deceased complainant , the court held that it was not necessarily incompatible with LAW ( d ) . Relying on PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL p CARDINAL , the court held that admissibility of evidence is primarily a matter of domestic law . It then found :", "\u201c Where a witness who is the sole witness of a crime has made a statement to be used in its prosecution and has since died , there may be a strong public interest in the admission of the statement in evidence so that the prosecution may proceed . That was the case here . That public interest must not be allowed to override the requirement that the defendant have a fair trial . Like the court in GPE [ see relevant domestic law below ] we do not consider that the case law of ORG the conclusion that in such circumstances the trial will be unfair . The provision in Article CARDINAL ) that a person charged shall be able to [ have ] the witnesses against him examined is CARDINAL specific aspect of a fair trial : but if the opportunity is not provided , the question is ' whether the proceedings as a whole , including the way the evidence was taken , were fair ' \u2013 PERSON , paragraph CARDINAL . This was not a case where the witness had absented himself , whether through fear or otherwise , or had required anonymity , or had exercised a right to keep silent . The reason was death , which has a finality which brings in considerations of its own , as has been indicated at the start of this paragraph . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also considered that the applicant had been able to attack the accuracy of the deceased complainant 's statement by exploring the inconsistencies between it and the evidence given by witnesses and experts . Turning to the issue of the trial judge 's summing up , the court stated :", "\u201c We consider that it would have been better if the judge had stated explicitly that the appellant was potentially disadvantaged by the absence of [ ORG ] and that in consequence of the inability to cross - examine her and of the jury to see her , her evidence should carry less weight with them . Nonetheless , in the circumstances of this case it must have been wholly clear to the jury from the directions the judge did give , that this was the purpose of his remarks . We therefore consider that the jury were given an adequate direction as to the consequences of [ ORG 's ] statement being in evidence in her absence , and that this is not a factor which might make the appellant 's trial unfair and in breach of LAW . We should also say that overall the evidence against the appellant was very strong . We were wholly unpersuaded that the verdicts were unsafe . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG refused leave to appeal to ORG but certified that a point of law of general public importance was involved in the decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant petitioned ORG on the point of law certified by ORG . On DATE ORG refused the petition .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . On DATE he was involved in a fight with S. during which it is alleged that the applicant stabbed S. CARDINAL times in the back . The applicant was charged with wounding with intent and also with attempting to pervert the course of justice by telling the police that he had seen CARDINAL black men stab PERSON When witnesses were questioned at the scene , no - one claimed to have seen the applicant stab PERSON days later , however , CARDINAL of the witnesses , PERSON , made a statement to police that he had seen the applicant stab PERSON statement to the police , it is clear that he did not see who stabbed him . Both S. and T. were members of the NORP community in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's trial began at ORG . On DATE ( DATE of trial ) the prosecution made an application for leave to read ORG 's statement pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( e ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( the \u201c ORG DATE \u201d ) . The prosecution argued under the ORG DATE that ORG was too fearful to attend trial before the jury and that he should qualify for special measures . The trial judge heard evidence from a police officer conducting the case who testified that the NORP community was close - knit and that ORG 's fear was genuine . The trial judge also heard evidence from PERSON himself who gave evidence to the judge from behind a screen . In ruling that leave should be given for the statement to be read to the jury , the trial judge stated :", "\u201c I am satisfied in those circumstances upon the criminal standard of proof that this witness is genuinely in fear ; and I base that not only on his oral testimony , but also upon my opportunity while he was in the witness box to observe him . I therefore have to look , having looked at the contents of the statement , to any risk its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings . I am satisfied that there would be an unfairness caused by its exclusion ; but I am equally satisfied that no unfairness would be caused by its admission . And in doing so , I have taken into account the words of the statute [ Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(e ) of LAW DATE , see relevant domestic law below ] ; in particular how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence . Challenge of a statement does not always come from cross - examination . Challenge of a statement can be caused by evidence given in rebuttal ; by either the defendant , if he chooses to do so , or by any other bystander \u2013 and we know that there were DATE who were on the street at that time . Consequently I am satisfied that the defendant 's evidence , if he chooses to give it , would be sufficient to rebut and to challenge the evidence that is contained in that statement . I have further considered other relevant factors , and I have also offered to the witness whilst he was in the witness box behind screens the possibility of him giving evidence with the same special measures in place . He told me his position would not change ; that he could not give evidence before a jury , and the reason that he could not was because he was in fear . Having taken all those matters into account in those circumstances , I am satisfied that this is the type of case which ORG envisaged might require a statement to be read . \u201d", "CARDINAL . T. 's witness statement was then read to the jury in his absence . The applicant also gave evidence . The judge , in his summing up , warned the jury about the danger of relying on the evidence of T. He stated :", "\u201c That evidence , as you know , was read to you under the provisions that allow a witness who is frightened , it is not a question of nerves it is a question of fright , fear , for his statement to be read to you but you must be careful as to how you treat it . It is right , as has been pointed out by the defence , that they were deprived of an opportunity to test that evidence under cross - examination . It is right also that you did not have the advantage of seeing the witness and his demeanour in Court ... You must ask yourselves ' can we rely upon this statement ? Is it a statement which we find convincing ? ' It is only if you are satisfied so that you are sure that what is in the statement has accurately depicted what happened TIME and what the witness saw , that you could rely upon it . That goes for any witness . It is only if you find that the evidence is compelling and satisfies you so that you are sure that you act upon it . So you must always ask yourselves ' is the statement he made reliable ? ' You must bear in mind also , importantly , that it is agreed and acknowledged that it is not the defendant who is responsible for putting the witness in fear . \u201d", "On DATE , the applicant was convicted by a majority verdict , principally of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm , and later sentenced to DATE imprisonment to be served concurrently with a term of DATE imprisonment for doing an act intended to pervert the course of justice .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal was referred directly before the full ORG . The applicant argued that the inability to cross - examine T. infringed his right to a fair trial . The appeal judges were satisfied that if they were to refuse leave , under the ORG DATE , to have ORG 's statement read at trial there would be unfairness to the prosecution and that , were they to grant it , there would be no unfairness to the applicant . ORG acknowledged , however , that the ORG accepted that ORG 's statement was \u201c both important and probative of a major issue in the case ... and had it not been admitted the prospect of a conviction would have receded and that of an acquittal advanced . \u201d The court upheld the reasoning at first instance , stating that there was available not only cross - examination of other prosecution witnesses but also evidence from the applicant himself and the potential for evidence from other bystanders in order to prevent unfairness . It was also stated that the trial judge had explicitly warned the jury in detail as to how they should treat this evidence and properly directed them as to how they should consider it in reaching their verdict . Although the applicant maintained that even a proper direction by the judge could not cure the unfairness , ORG held that the jury was informed of all matters necessary to its decision - making process . The applicant 's sentence was reduced to DATE imprisonment .", "Leave to appeal on conviction was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the trial judge 's ruling and the trial in Mr PERSON case , the relevant statutory provisions were to be found in sections CARDINAL of LAW DATE . LAW provides for the admission of first hand documentary hearsay in a criminal trial :", "\u201c CARDINAL.\u2014 ... a statement made by a person in a document shall be admissible in criminal proceedings as evidence of any fact of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible if\u2014", "( CARDINAL)(a ) the person who made the statement is dead or by reason of his bodily or mental condition unfit to attend as a witness ...", "CARDINAL.\u2014(CARDINAL ) NORP If , having regard to all the circumstances\u2014", "( a ) the ORG Court\u2014", "( i ) on a trial on indictment ;", "( ii ) on an appeal from a magistrates ' court ; or", "( iii ) on the hearing of an application under section CARDINAL of the [ DATE c.

The following legislative provisions of LAW DATE were drafted as a means to tackle crime by providing special measures to protect witnesses who have a genuine fear of intimidation and repercussions . The LAW entered into force in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(e ) of LAW DATE ( cases where a witness is unavailable ) states that :", "\u201c In criminal proceedings a statement not made in oral evidence in the proceedings is admissible as evidence of any matter stated if ... through fear the relevant person does not give ( or does not continue to give ) oral evidence in the proceedings , either at all or in connection with the subject matter of the statement , and the court gives leave for the statement to be given in evidence . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) states :", "\u201c Leave may be given under subsection ( DATE ) only if the court considers that the statement ought to be admitted in the interests of justice , having regard-", "( a ) to the statement 's contents ,", "( b ) to any risk that its admission or exclusion will result in unfairness to any party to the proceedings ( and in particular to how difficult it will be to challenge the statement if the relevant person does not give oral evidence ) ...", "( d ) to any other relevant circumstances . \u201d", "CARDINAL . This ORG 's judgment in PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALII was considered by ORG in NORP v. GPE and GPE [ DATE ] EWCA Crim CARDINAL , which concerned CARDINAL defendants who were alleged to have intimidated witnesses . Leave was given by the trial judge to have the witnesses ' statements read to the jury . The defendants appealed on the ground that the admission of the statements breached LAW read with CARDINAL ( d ) of the LAW . ORG dismissed the appeal . In considering the relevant case - law of this ORG , at paragraph CARDINAL of its judgment , it stated that what appeared from that case - law were the following propositions :", "\u201c i ) The admissibility of evidence is primarily for the national law ;", "ii ) Evidence must normally be produced at a public hearing and as a general rule Article CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(d ) require a defendant to be given a proper and adequate opportunity to challenge and question witnesses ;", "iii ) It is not necessarily incompatible with Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(d ) for depositions to be read and that can be so even if there has been no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the proceedings . Article CARDINAL ) is simply an illustration of matters to be taken into account in considering whether a fair trial has been held . The reasons for the court holding it necessary that statements should be read and the procedures to counterbalance any handicap to the defence will all be relevant to the issue , whether , where statements have been read , the trial was fair .", "iv ) The quality of the evidence and its inherent reliability , plus the degree of caution exercised in relation to reliance on it , will also be relevant to the question whether the trial was fair . \u201d", "ORG then stated :", "\u201c The question is whether there is a fifth proposition to the effect that where the circumstances justify the reading of the statement where the defendant has had no opportunity to question the witness at any stage of the trial process , the statement must not be allowed to be read if it is the sole or decisive evidence against the defendant . Certainly at first sight paragraph CARDINAL of PERSON seems to suggest that in whatever circumstances and whatever counterbalancing factors are present if statements are read then there will be a breach of LAW , if the statements are the sole or decisive evidence . Furthermore there is some support for that position in the previous authorities . But neither PERSON nor any of the other authorities were concerned with a case where a witness , whose identity was well - known to a defendant , was being kept away by fear , although we must accept that the reference to ORG - type organisations and the trials thereof in paragraph CARDINAL shows that the court had extreme circumstances in mind . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
