THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr D. Price , a solicitor practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their agent , Mr NORP PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At the time in question the applicant was a shareholder and sole director of a company , DATE ORG ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) which owned a DATE newspaper . On DATE the newspaper published an article written by the editor in which the complainant in a rape case was named , contrary to section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) . The applicant was charged with an offence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW ( see below ) .", "The applicant was tried , without a jury , by ORG on DATE . He pleaded \u201c not guilty \u201d and gave oral evidence . He contended that merely as director and financier of the company which owned the newspaper , with no editorial role and no pre - publication knowledge of the content of the paper , he could not be described as a \u201c publisher \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW , the applicant further asserted that he was not aware , and neither suspected nor had any reason to suspect , that the publication would identify the complainant .", "ORG found that , as effectively the only person in control of ORG , which was a company without any ORG , the applicant was a \u201c publisher \u201d for section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) purposes and that all of the requirements of section CARDINAL ) had been fulfilled . The magistrates accepted that the applicant did not read the offending newspaper article prior to its publication and that he did not know or suspect that it was to be published . They also accepted that the applicant \u2019s role at the newspaper was primarily that of a financial backer and fund - raiser . However , they rejected his defence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW since they were not satisfied that he had no reason to suspect that the article would be published . They reached this conclusion having found that the applicant had visited the newspaper \u2019s offices in GPE DATE between TIME and DATE lunchtime . They commented that the editorial content of the articles to be published the following DATE would have been available to the applicant at those DATE meetings on demand . They also found that the contents of the newspaper were vetted by a firm of solicitors DATE on the DATE before publication .", "The applicant was fined GBP CARDINAL and ordered to pay GBP CARDINAL costs . At the same trial , the editor of the newspaper was convicted and fined following a \u201c guilty \u201d plea and ORG itself , which was by that time in liquidation , was convicted and fined in its absence following a \u201c not guilty \u201d plea .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed by ORG on DATE . In delivering the judgment of the court , Mr Justice PERSON cited the following passage from The Law of Contempt by Borrie and PERSON ( Third Edition , page CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c It seems right to impose liability upon newspaper proprietors since they provide the means whereby publication is effected . The law of contempt as a deterrent instrument would be weakened if the proprietors did not have a strong incentive not only to choose a responsible editor but to take appropriate action if the editor or another member of staff began to make or allow comment which might subject the proprietors to liability . Subject to the reservation as to the proper legal basis of ORG liability , which it is submitted should be a primary responsibility , the current law seems satisfactory . \u201d", "He continued :", "\u201c Whilst it is , of course , true that those passages referred to \u201c proprietor \u201d , it seems to me to indicate the wide range of the legislation and would not exclude necessarily the role of a Managing Director as \u201c publisher \u201d . ...", "It seems to me that s CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) is deliberately widely drawn . Its aim seems to be to prevent , as far as it is possible , the damaging effect of contempt or , in this case , the damage caused by a breach of the Sexual Offences ( Amendment ) Act DATE . Its object is , in my judgment , to prevent those holding various responsibilities from sheltering behind lack of knowledge or lack of direct action in the publication of offending material .", "[ Counsel for the applicant ] submits that the Justices should have upheld the submission of no case because the only evidence before them at the end of the prosecution case was that [ the applicant ] was the Managing Director . My view of that is that his position as the Managing Director gave rise to a prima facie case that he was responsible for publications by a publishing company which he managed .", "[ Counsel for the applicant ] further submits that if [ the applicant ] is caught by s CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) then s CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) is otiose . Having considered that submission , I do not agree . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) captures both \u201c publishers \u201d and \u201c proprietors \u201d . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) can capture , for example , a secretary who may not be either a publisher or proprietor . It is clear from the legislation that the offence under s CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) may be committed by the same person either under the provisions of that section or under the provisions of s CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . ... \u201d", "The relevant part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides :", "\u201c ( ... ) ( b ) After a person is accused of a rape offence , no matter likely to lead members of the public to identify a woman or man as the complainant in relation to that accusation shall during that person \u2019s lifetime -", "( i ) be published in GPE and GPE in a written publication available ORG to the public ... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that a person accused of rape can apply to the trial judge for the restriction in section PERSON ) to be lifted .", "Section CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that if the trial judge is satisfied that the effect of section PERSON ) is to impose a substantial and unreasonable restriction upon the reporting of the trial proceedings and that it is in the public interest to remove or relax the restriction , he must direct that section PERSON ) does not apply .", "The relevant part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides :", "\u201c If any matter is published ... in contravention of subsection ( CARDINAL ) of this section , ... in the case of a publication in a newspaper ... , any proprietor , any editor and any publisher of the newspaper ... shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding [ GBP CARDINAL ] \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides , in part :", "\u201c When an offence under subsection ( CARDINAL ) of the preceding section which has been committed by a body corporate is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of , or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of , any director , manager , secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate ... , he as well as the body corporate shall be guilty of that offence ... \u201d", "The relevant part of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides :", "\u201c ... where a person is charged with [ an offence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ] it shall be a defence to prove that at the time of the alleged offence he was not aware , and neither suspected nor had reason to suspect , that the publication ... was of , or ( as the case may be ) included , such matter as is mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) of that section . \u201d", "The defendant has to prove the defence under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) on the \u201c balance of probabilities \u201d .", "There is a right of appeal to ORG against a decision of ORG in its capacity as an appellate court . In order for such an appeal to lie to ORG , ORG must certify that the appeal involves a point of law of general public importance . Following certification , permission for such an appeal may be granted by ORG itself or ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
