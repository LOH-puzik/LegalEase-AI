The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mrs Stec injured her back at work and was unable to continue working . She was awarded Reduced Earnings Allowance ( REA \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) from DATE . On DATE she reached DATE and as from DATE her award of ORG was replaced by an award of Retirement Allowance ( RA \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against this decision on the ground of sex discrimination to ORG ( SSAT ) , which allowed her appeal on DATE , and the adjudication officer subsequently appealed to the ORG Commissioner ( \u201c the Commissioner \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The Commissioner joined PERSON case to those of the other CARDINAL present applicants , and also to that of PERSON . Having heard arguments on DATE , the Commissioner decided on CARDINAL DATE to refer the following questions to ORG ( ECJ ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Does LAW permit a member ORG to impose unequal age conditions linked to the different pension ages for men and women under its statutory old - age pension scheme , on entitlement to a benefit having the characteristics of Reduced Earnings Allowance under a statutory occupational accident and disease scheme , so as to produce different DATE cash payments under that scheme for men and women in otherwise similar circumstances , in particular where the inequality :", "( a ) is not necessary for any financial reason connected with either scheme ; and", "( b ) never having been imposed before , is imposed for the first time DATE after the inception of the CARDINAL schemes and also after DATE , the latest date for the Directive to be given full effect under LAW ?", "CARDINAL . NORP If the answer to Question CARDINAL is Yes , what are the considerations that determine whether unequal age conditions such as those imposed in GPE for Reduced Earnings Allowance DATE are necessary to ensure coherence between schemes or otherwise fall within the permitted exclusion in DATE ?", "CARDINAL . NORP ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his order of reference the Commissioner observed :", "\u201c On the main issue , it is apparent from the information before me ( and the adjudication officers so concede ) that the imposition after DATE of unequal age conditions on REA for the first time was not necessary to maintain the financial equilibrium or coherence ( in so far as that word is understood in a financial sense ) of the GPE social security schemes .", "It is also apparent ( and on the information before me I so decide as a fact ) that such imposition was not necessary to enable GPE to retain the different pension ages under its old - age scheme . That difference had coexisted with the Industrial Injuries Scheme ... for DATE from DATE without it , and ORG could simply have been left as it was , or a non - discriminatory cut - off age adopted , without upsetting the pension system as it had always operated .", "The real question therefore is the more difficult CARDINAL of whether a government which considers it a costly anomaly to go on paying a benefit such as ORG to people too old to work is permitted to impose a new cut - off at unequal ages , claiming the benefit of the exclusion in LAW \u2018 possible consequences for other GPE having regard to what was said in the [ ECJ \u2019s ] judgment in PERSON , on the ground that the ages selected are the same as those for the pension , and ... the government take the view as a matter of policy that the income - replacement functions of ORG should be performed after pension age by the pension , plus the very much smaller \u2018 Retirement Allowance\u2019 instead . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ECJ gave judgment on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE the Commissioner , following the ECJ \u2019s ruling , struck out the applicants\u2019 cases where they were the appellants before him and allowed the appeals where the adjudication officers had been the appellants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON suffered a work - related injury to his right hand , as a result of which he had to stop working . From CARDINAL DATE he received Special Hardship Allowance , which was converted to ORG from DATE . On DATE he reached DATE and from DATE , when he turned DATE , he received a statutory retirement pension . On DATE an adjudication officer reviewed the award of ORG and decided that , with effect from DATE , it should be replaced by an award of ORG , paid at PERCENT of the ORG rate .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed on the ground that a woman in the same circumstances would have been treated as having retired on or before DATE and would have been entitled to a frozen rate of REA for life , a more valuable benefit . On DATE the Stockport SSAT dismissed his appeal , and PERSON appealed to the Commissioner , who referred the case to the ECJ ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON suffered a work - related injury to her neck on DATE . She was awarded Special Hardship Allowance from DATE and from DATE this was converted to an award of ORG . Her sixtieth birthday was on DATE and she received a retirement pension from DATE . It was decided on DATE , with effect from DATE , to freeze for life her award of REA at MONEY ( GBP ) DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to the Bolton SSAT on the ground that , had she been a man , she would have continued to receive unfrozen ORG . The SSAT allowed her appeal on DATE , and the adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner , who referred the case to the ECJ ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG injured his back at work and was unable to continue working . He was awarded Special Hardship Allowance from DATE , converted to ORG from DATE . He reached DATE on DATE and received a retirement pension from DATE . On DATE an adjudication officer reviewed his award of ORG and decided that with effect from DATE it should be replaced by an award of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , on the ground that a woman in his circumstances could have chosen to have been treated as retired from DATE , and so would have been entitled to frozen REA for life , a more valuable benefit than GPE . The SSAT allowed his appeal on DATE and the adjudication officer appealed to the Commissioner , who referred the case to the ECJ ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Reduced Earnings Allowance ( REA ) is an earnings - related additional benefit under the statutory occupational accident and disease scheme which was put in place in DATE . Originally the benefit was known as Special Hardship Allowance , but it was recast and renamed by LAW DATE . At the time of the introduction of these applications , the relevant legislation was Part V of ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . REA has , since DATE , been funded by general taxation rather than the ORG scheme . It is payable to employees or former employees who have suffered an accident at work or an occupational disease , with the purpose of compensating for an impairment in earning capacity . The DATE amount is based on a comparison between the claimant \u2019s earnings prior to the accident or disease and those in any actual or notional alternative employment still considered suitable despite the disability , subject to a maximum DATE award of GBP DATE . It is a non - contributory benefit , in that eligibility is not conditional on any or a certain number of contributions having been made to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under more recent legislation the benefit is being phased out altogether and no fresh right to REA can arise from an accident incurred or a disease contracted on or after DATE . In addition , a succession of legislative measures after DATE attempted to remove or reduce it for claimants no longer of working age , in respect of whom the government considered any comparison of \u201c earnings \u201d to be artificial . Before these changes , there had been a continued right to REA notwithstanding the attainment of retirement age and ORG had been payable concurrently with the ORG pension .", "CARDINAL . The method chosen to reduce eligibility was to impose cut - off or limiting conditions by reference to the ages used by the statutory old - age pension scheme , namely CARDINAL for men and CARDINAL for women until DATE , then tapering up to eventual equality at CARDINAL in DATE ( Part II of ORG DATE , as amended by LAW DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Under the new provisions ( ORG Benefits Act DATE ) , all ORG recipients who , before DATE , had reached either ( a ) DATE , if a man , or DATE , if a woman , or ( b ) the date of retirement fixed by a notice , at DATE + for a man or CARDINAL + for a woman , would receive a frozen rate of REA for life . All other ORG recipients would cease to receive ORG , and would instead receive ORG ( GPE ) either on reaching ( a ) CARDINAL , if a man , or DATE , if a woman , or ( b ) the date of retirement fixed by a notice , at DATE + for a man or CARDINAL + for a woman or on giving up employment at CARDINAL for a man or CARDINAL for a woman .", "CARDINAL . NORP State retirement pensions are funded entirely from ORG , to which all employers and the majority of the working population , whether employed or self - employed , are liable to pay compulsory contributions . The individual \u2019s liability for such contributions ceases at \u201c pensionable age \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Men and women born before DATE attain pensionable age at DATE and CARDINAL respectively ( Schedule CARDINAL to LAW DATE ) . The present pension age for women was introduced in DATE by ORG . Prior to that , State pension age was DATE for both men and women . According to the government \u2019s Green and White Papers entitled respectively \u201c Options for Equality in State Pension Age \u201d ( Cm DATE , DATE ) and \u201c ORG ( ORG , DATE ) , the lower age for women was introduced in response to a campaign by unmarried women , many of whom spent much of their lives caring for dependent relatives , and also as part of a package to enable married couples , where the wife was usually younger than the husband and financially dependent on him , to receive a pension at the couples\u2019 rate when the husband reached CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In the DATE ORG , the government pointed out that while , historically , women \u2019s entitlement to a ORG pension was frequently reduced because their traditional role of caring for the family in the home led to fragmented employment records , the number of women in employment had greatly increased in DATE : in DATE , PERCENT of employees were women , compared with PERCENT in DATE ( although the statistics did not differentiate , for example , between full- and part - time workers ) . Moreover , a home responsibilities provision , introduced in DATE , now helped those whose working life was shortened because of time spent caring for a child or sick or disabled person to build up entitlement to a basic pension , and the concession which allowed married women to pay reduced - rate ORG contributions , leaving them dependent on their husbands\u2019 contributions , was withdrawn in DATE . LAW DATE had amended LAW DATE to make it unlawful for an employer to have different retirement ages for men and women . The view of the government , expressed in the White Paper , was that the preferential pension age for women had no place in modern society and it was proposed to equalise pensionable age for men and women .", "CARDINAL . It was decided to equalise at DATE , rather than a lower age , because people were living longer and healthier lives and because the proportion of pensioners in the population was set to increase . It was estimated that any move towards paying male ORG retirement pensions DATE would cost in the order of ORG MONEY per year gross ( representing additional pension payments to men DATE and lost income from ORG contributions from these men ) or a net sum of ORG MONEY per year ( when account was taken of savings on payment of other , ORG benefits to such men ) . It was decided to introduce the change gradually to ensure that women affected by the change and their employers had ample time to adjust their expectations and arrange their financial affairs accordingly .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to bring male and female pensionable age into line with each other , therefore , section CARDINAL of the Pensions Act DATE , together with Schedule CARDINAL , provide for the pensionable age of women born between DATE and DATE to increase progressively . With effect from DATE , the pensionable age of men and women in GPE will begin to equalise , and by DATE both sexes will attain pensionable age at DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Council Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC of DATE ( \u201c the Directive \u201d ) concerns the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security . Article CARDINAL ) of the Directive prohibits all discrimination on grounds of sex , in particular as concerns the calculation of benefits . Such discrimination can be justified only under LAW , which provides that the Directive is to be without prejudice to the right of member GPE to exclude from its scope the determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old - age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences thereof for other benefits . Under LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , \u201c [ GPE shall periodically examine matters excluded under paragraph CARDINAL in order to ascertain , in the light of social developments in the matter concerned , whether there is justification for maintaining the exclusions concerned \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In case ORG The Queen v. Secretary of ORG , ex parte ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) [ DATE ] ORG Reports ( ECR ) I-CARDINAL , the ECJ found that LAW must be interpreted not only as authorising the retention of a statutory pensionable age which differed according to sex , but also forms of discrimination affecting access to certain benefits which were \u201c necessarily linked \u201d to the difference in pensionable age . Inequality between men and women , with respect to the contribution periods required in order to obtain a pension of an identical amount , constituted such discrimination where , having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context of which it appeared , it could not be disassociated from the difference in pensionable age .", "CARDINAL . NORP In case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Secretary of ORG v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , the ECJ held that the reasoning from the ORG decision extended to benefits linked to differential ORG retirement ages where \u201c such discrimination is objectively necessary in order to avoid disrupting the complex financial equilibrium of the social security system or to ensure consistency between retirement pension schemes and other benefit schemes \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the present applicants\u2019 case , C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Hepple and Others v. Adjudication Officer [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , the ECJ applied the reasoning of PERSON and Others to find , first , that \u201c removal of the discrimination at issue ... would have no effect on the financial equilibrium of the social security system of GPE as a whole \u201d ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . However , it went on to hold that it had been objectively necessary to introduce different age conditions based on sex in order to maintain coherence between the ORG retirement pension scheme and other benefit schemes , since ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE )", "\u201c ... the principal aim of the successive legislative amendments ... was to discontinue payment of REA \u2013 an allowance designed to compensate for an impairment of earning capacity following an accident at work or occupational disease DATE to persons no longer of working age by imposing conditions based on the statutory retirement age .", "Thus , as a result of those legislative amendments , there is coherence between ORG , which is designed to compensate for a decrease in earnings , and the old - age pension scheme . It follows that maintenance of the rules at issue in the main proceedings is objectively necessary to preserve such coherence .", "That conclusion is not invalidated by the fact that ORG is replaced , when the beneficiary reaches retirement age and stops working , by ORG , the rate of which is PERCENT of ORG , since ORG is designed to compensate for the reduction in pension entitlement resulting from a decrease in earnings following an accident at work or occupational disease .", "It follows that discrimination of the kind at issue in the main proceedings is objectively and necessarily linked to the difference between the retirement age for men and that for women , so that it is covered by the derogation for which LAW provides . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
