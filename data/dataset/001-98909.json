She complained , inter alia , of the unlawfulness of her arrest and the excessive use of force by the police during the arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was referred to the GPE branch of ORG by the ORG public prosecutor . The doctor who examined the applicant noted a CARDINAL x QUANTITY ecchymosis on the back of her left leg and concluded that the injury rendered the applicant unfit for work for DATE . The doctor further noted that the applicant was suffering from pain in her right shoulder and right arm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute the police officers who had been on duty at the press conference of DATE . Relying on the incident report prepared by the police officers , the public prosecutor noted that , despite warnings by the police , the demonstrators , who had gathered illegally without obtaining permission and had disturbed public order by blocking the pedestrian zone and tramway , had refused to disperse and the police had therefore been obliged to use some degree of force to disperse them and restore public order . The public prosecutor considered that the force used by the security forces had been in line with section CARDINAL of ORG and had been justified in the circumstances . In the public prosecutor 's opinion , the applicant 's injuries were the result of a proportionate use of force which did not amount to ill - treatment or abuse of authority .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against the above - mentioned decision of the public prosecutor . She claimed that on DATE police officers had beaten her during her arrest , causing injuries rendering her unfit for work for DATE , as corroborated by the medical report from the hospital .

ORG decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the ORG public prosecutor had brought charges against CARDINAL demonstrators , including the applicant , for violation of ORG . In her defence submissions before the court , the applicant claimed that , in participating in the demonstration , she had merely been exercising her democratic rights .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment dated DATE , ORG acquitted the applicant and her co - accused of the above - mentioned charges . The court held as follows :", "\u201c [ It ] was alleged that the accused had breached ORG on DATE of the incident . Having regard to the content of the case file , there is no convincing evidence indicating with sufficient certainty that the accused committed the alleged offence . It appears from the incident report that the security forces took measures following an intelligence report that ORG , PERSON and PERSON associations were to hold a demonstration in front of the post office in the GPE district . After the gathering of the group ( demonstrators ) , the chair of the association PERSON stated that they would stage a sit - in in front of the GPE post office . Following a police warning [ that the meeting was unlawful ] , the demonstrators told the police that they would make a press statement and then disperse . However , the police teams did not release the group and continued to keep them within a circle ; they then arrested them without giving a proper warning that could be heard by everyone ( no evidence was provided to substantiate the assertion that a warning was given ) . For these reasons , no evidence was adduced to indicate that the accused committed the alleged offence in contravention of the said LAW and that [ their action ] went beyond the exercise of their democratic rights . It is thus considered that the actions of the accused were merely an exercise of their democratic rights [ to freedom of assembly ] . The [ accused ] are therefore acquitted of the charges brought against them ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law can be found in the case of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( nos .
