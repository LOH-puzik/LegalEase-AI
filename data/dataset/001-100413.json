In DATE a high profile kidnapping in GPE ended in a gunfight with the security forces . The kidnapped man was released but a soldier and policeman were killed .

On DATE an internal police circular was issued stating that the applicant was wanted on serious charges connected to the kidnapping .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was arrested in the GPE . In DATE he was extradited to GPE where he resumed serving his sentence .

From DATE the applicant was granted periods of temporary release during which he visited GPE . In DATE he was released on parole from prison in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE by the NORP police under LAW , as amended ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . He was questioned and charged before ORG ( \u201c SCC \u201d ) with offences relating to the kidnapping : false imprisonment , unlawful possession of firearms and kidnapping ( a life sentence was the maximum prison term for the first and third charge ) . The SCC later noted ( prior to dismissing the charges in DATE ) that the evidence against the applicant was an admission he had made during his police interviews that he had been at the kidnap location ( which admission he had denied in evidence before the SCC ) as well as the fingerprint evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an official of ORG , ORG received a printed notice of the report of the applicant 's arrest and he made handwritten notes thereon ( \u201c memorandum of CARDINAL CARDINAL \u201d ) . The applicant submitted that those notes proved that the NORP police had been aware of his presence in GPE prior to his arrest .", "CARDINAL . He applied for bail and on DATE he was released on bail , subject to certain reporting conditions . ORG later noted that he had to sign on once a month at a police station in GPE ( a QUANTITY round trip from his home in GPE ) and that he had also to attend on CARDINAL occasions since DATE at the SCC in GPE ( a round trip of QUANTITY ) during the criminal proceedings against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Book of Evidence ( statement of the evidence on which the prosecution proposed to rely ) was served on the applicant . The Government maintained that the applicant informed the SCC on that date that he might bring judicial review proceedings to prohibit his trial on grounds of delay prior to his arrest .", "CARDINAL . Correspondence took place between the prosecution and the applicant from DATE on disclosure by the prosecution of any other relevant evidence not in the Book of Evidence : it concerned correspondence between the NORP and other authorities as regards his whereabouts prior to his arrest in DATE and matters relating to the fingerprint issue . The case was put in for mention on the SCC list CARDINAL times between DATE and DATE . On the latter date the disclosure issues were resolved with further disclosure by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . It was through this disclosure process that the applicant was made aware of the loss ( on DATE ) of the items on which the original fingerprints had allegedly been found ( \u201c the original fingerprint evidence \u201d ) . The forensic report ( including photographs of the original fingerprints ) was retained and available . The ORG submitted that the applicant was informed of this loss on DATE .", "CARDINAL . A trial date was fixed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then took expert advice as to the implications for his trial of the loss of the original fingerprint evidence . In DATE the expert advised that the fingerprint evidence could not be comprehensively evaluated from the forensic report retained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted leave to apply for judicial review and , further , a stay on the criminal proceedings against him pending the outcome of the judicial review proceedings . The relief sought by the applicant included a declaration that the delay until DATE ( mainly concerning the pre - arrest delay ) was irreparably prejudicial to a fair trial , a declaration that the loss of the original fingerprint evidence limited his ability to contest the evidence against him as well as an order prohibiting his further prosecution on these bases . The return date for this application was DATE and the trial date was vacated . The application was re - listed once DATE ( from DATE ) and on DATE the prosecution filed its ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested voluntary discovery from the prosecution . No substantive response having been received , on DATE he filed a notice of motion for such discovery . While the return date for the motion was in DATE , the parties agreed to adjourn it to the first hearing date ( DATE ) . Neither party attended on that date , due to a misunderstanding , and the motion was struck out . The applicant submitted that he then sent several letters to the prosecution to obtain its consent to re - enter the motion : the Government accepted that CARDINAL such letter from the applicant ( of CARDINAL DATE ) was on the file .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed a fresh motion for discovery on DATE and a return date was accorded ( DATE ) . On the latter date the prosecution agreed to make voluntary discovery and , on DATE , the prosecution filed an affidavit of discovery listing CARDINAL documents in its schedule . This list included the memorandum of CARDINAL DATE but the applicant did not request sight of that document at that point . On DATE the applicant 's motion for discovery was therefore struck out on a consent basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution applied to re - enter the applicant 's judicial review action and a hearing date was set for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then filed a motion for further and better discovery returnable before the Master of the High Court on DATE . The Master refused the order sought ( DATE ) as did ORG on appeal ( on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . When the prohibition action came on for hearing on DATE , a judge was not available to hear the case . It was adjourned to DATE , when it was heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered an ex tempore judgment . ORG made an order prohibiting the trial of the applicant on the basis that the loss of the original fingerprint evidence meant that there was a real or serious risk of an unfair trial . ORG rejected the applicant 's claim based on the delay : the decision to prosecute was a decision of the prosecuting authorities and depended on the sufficiency of evidence ; there were no grounds to suggest that any delay was deliberate ; and the decision to prosecute was prompted by new evidence ( the applicant 's alleged admission during questioning following his arrest in DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution appealed and the applicant lodged a cross - appeal . On DATE the prosecution lodged ORG . Since ORG judge did not formally approve his judgment until DATE , the prosecution could not file ORG ( that the appeal was ready to be heard ) until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted leave to have his crossappeal heard with the prosecution 's appeal . On DATE the appeal hearing took place before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment allowing the prosecution 's appeal and refusing the applicant 's cross - appeal . As to the lost original fingerprint evidence , there had been a forensic examination of the fingerprints before they were lost and the results of that examination were preserved so that the applicant had not been deprived of the reasonable possibility of rebutting the evidence proffered against him and he had therefore not demonstrated that there was a real risk of an unfair trial . As to the impugned pre - arrest delay , all CARDINAL judges of ORG considered that that lapse of time was not such as should give rise to a prohibition order . The court considered it legitimate for the NORP police to have waited for his release from prison to arrest him under section CARDINAL of the ORG . There was insufficient evidence to initiate a prosecution prior to his being questioned . The parameters of any questioning while he was in prison in GPE would have been entirely different from those applicable to a person arrested under section CARDINAL of the FAC . In this latter respect , he was obliged to at least listen to the questions ; the structure and duration of the questioning ( subject to the proper treatment of persons in custody ) would have been under their control and not under that of other ( NORP ) authorities or that of the applicant himself ; and , in the end , he made some statements during questioning which provided additional evidence and , consequently , a basis to initiate a prosecution . PERSON partly dissented as regards the loss of the original fingerprint evidence only : in doing so he referred to the advice on the issue of the applicant 's expert .", "CARDINAL . Following this judgment , the stay on the criminal proceedings pending the first prohibition action was lifted . On DATE the SCC fixed the applicant 's trial for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was granted leave by ORG to seek judicial review and , further , a stay on the criminal proceedings against him pending the outcome of the judicial review proceedings . He sought a declaration and a prohibition order on the basis that the delay since DATE ( namely , during his first prohibition action ) had delayed the criminal proceedings which had , inter alia , violated his constitutional right to a trial with reasonable expedition and exposed him to a real and serious risk of an unfair trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the prohibition application . It considered that , at best , the evidence demonstrated at most CARDINAL periods of unnecessary delay by the prosecution during the first judicial review action . However , any increased stress or culpable delay and impact on his right to an expeditious trial did not outweigh the community 's considerable interest in having offences of such gravity prosecuted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed by notice dated CARDINAL DATE . ORG heard the appeal on DATE . On DATE judgment was delivered dismissing the appeal unanimously . PERSON , PERSON and PERSON delivered separate judgments , with PERSON and PERSON concurring .", "CARDINAL . Fennelly J. noted that , while the applicant had included in his motion a request for \u201c any further and/or other relief as this Honourable Court deems meet and just \u201d , the only substantive relief specifically and explicitly sought by him was the prohibition of his trial on grounds of delay . Such a prohibition could only be granted if there were a real risk that his trial would be unfair , and this had been rejected in the first judicial review proceedings as regards the delay prior to the preferment of charges and was undemonstrated as regards the length of the first judicial review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . However , ORG noted that the courts had also recognised the possibility of making a prohibition order for the quite distinct reason that there had been a breach of an accused 's right to trial with \u201c reasonable expedition \u201d . Noting that the judgment of PERSON in PERSON v. PERSON ( ( DATE ) CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ) of ORG of GPE had been influential in the development of the case - law of the NORP courts on the right to reasonable expedition and the consequences of its breach , ORG stated that \u201c we have now established a consistent approach , particularly in some recent cases \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the approach of ORG in DATE v ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL I.R. CARDINAL ) and to the reiteration of that approach by PERSON in DATE v ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL ) , PERSON considered that it was necessary to consider , firstly , whether the period that it took to dispose of the first judicial review proceedings constituted a violation of the applicant 's right to a trial with due expedition and , secondly , assuming an affirmative answer to that question , whether , having regard to all the circumstances , the ORG should make an order prohibiting ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) from continuing with his prosecution .", "As to the first question , PERSON considered that the applicant might have had a legitimate complaint in respect of the delay in approving the High Court judgment ( DATE ) . However , the applicant had taken no steps to expedite the appeal , probably because of the ORG prohibition order . While this delay was significant , in the entire context of the case it did not amount to a breach of his constitutional right to an expeditious hearing of the criminal charges against him .", "As to the second question , and even assuming there had been a breach of his constitutional right to an expeditious hearing , the circumstances did not warrant a prohibition order : any delay of DATE was not significant in the trial for offences alleged to have been committed in DATE . As to his anxiety caused by delay , he was , during that period of delay , the holder of an order of ORG prohibiting his trial and he had carriage of those judicial review proceedings and could have taken steps to accelerate them . In addition , the public interest in pursuing serious crime was crucial and the seriousness of the relevant charges outweighed the added anxiety and length of bail conditions caused by unnecessary delay on judicial review .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG noted that the right to a trial within \u201c a reasonable time \u201d and to a trial \u201c with reasonable expedition \u201d were \u201c indistinguishable \u201d . However , he differentiated between this ORG 's finding of unreasonable delay under LAW with an award of just satisfaction ) , on the one hand , and the balancing exercise a domestic court had to carry out between delay and the public interest in pursuing crime in a prohibition action on grounds of delay ( the domestic proceedings ) , on the other . This ORG 's role ( and therefore the criteria used by it ) was more analogous to the decision as to whether delay violated the constitutional right to expeditious proceedings . He noted the ORG 's submission to this ORG in GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) to the effect that judicial review was an effective domestic remedy and that \u201c damages might have been available \u201d on judicial review . Having noted this ORG 's response to that argument ( paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment ) , he continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I made a similar observation in my own judgment in [ GPE v ORG ] .", "These observations are relevant to the interpretation of the judgments of ORG . That court does not engage in the balancing exercise described in the Opinion of Powell J in PERSON v PERSON and in the decisions of this Court ( such as P.M. v Malone and [ P.M. v DPP ] . That exercise is neither necessary nor relevant to the decision as to whether to award just satisfaction . Consequently , the decisions of ORG provide useful guidance on the question of whether there has been a breach of the right of an accused person to a trial within a reasonable time or with reasonable expedition . For example , in its judgment in the case of PERSON v GPE ... , the ORG restated its consistent approach to the assessment of a reasonable time as follows ( paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment ; citations omitted ) :", "' ....... On the latter point , what is at stake for the applicant in the litigation has to be taken into account . '", "CARDINAL . A further passage from the judgment of the ORG also calls for observation . It appears that the representatives of GPE had submitted to the ORG that judicial review , which was available to the applicant in that case , provided an effective remedy in domestic law and that \u201c damages might have been available as a remedy in the judicial review proceedings , if the applicant had sought them . \u201d The ORG 's response to that argument ( at paragraph [ CARDINAL ] ) was :", "' There is no evidence that such proceedings would have been capable of providing damages and the Government accepted that there was no domestic legal provision for an award of damages in following proceedings . Although the ORG argued that the common law might be flexible enough to provide such a remedy , they did not refer to CARDINAL precedent even tending to support this argument . Moreover , the judgment of ORG made it clear that Convention case - law would not cause the domestic courts to fashion any remedies that would not otherwise have been available ... . '", "DATE . ... in [ the PERSON ] case , as in the present case , no claim for damages had been made . Nor , so far as I am aware , has any such claim ever been made in such a case . In every such case , the accused person , in practice , seeks the remedy of prohibition of his trial . It is clearly not possible for this ORG , having an appellate function only , to pronounce in the abstract on whether damages would be available as a remedy , [ if they were claimed ] . Any such claim would have to be made in ORG in the first instance . The [ ORG DATE ] might be relevant .", "CARDINAL . I would also add that the ORG may have somewhat misapprehended the remarks of PERSON in the passage of his judgment in [ PERSON v ORG ] , which ... [ the ORG ] also quoted . PERSON was merely saying that a particular judgment of ORG did not have effect in domestic law . Whether these courts would \u201c fashion remedies \u201d in the light of the case - law of that ORG is a quite different matter and would have to await an appropriate case . Again the [ NORP Convention of Human Rights Act DATE ] may or may not be relevant . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON agreed in the main with ORG judgment . He explained , in addition , the various forms of delay in criminal proceedings :", "\u201c This appeal raises serious issues about the effects of delay on the entitlement of the ORG to prosecute criminal offences . It is an issue which has given rise to much anxious consideration by this ORG in DATE , particularly in the context of offences relating to the sexual abuse of children . Evaluating reasons for delay and attributing blame for delay in reporting abuse ( complainant delay or pre - charge delay ) came to be seen as a far from simple exercise in those cases . ...", "That was CARDINAL form of delay . Delay can also arise from the tardiness of the police , either in investigating an alleged crime after it has been reported , or on the part of the prosecuting authorities in bringing an alleged perpetrator before the courts and in taking the necessary steps to prepare a case for trial . The jurisprudence makes clear that this form of delay , called ' prosecutorial delay ' , may also entitle an applicant to relief in the form of prohibition in certain circumstances . This will arise because an applicant is also entitled to a trial with reasonable expedition as part of his constitutional rights under LAW .", "Delay may also arise when the ORG , by its failure to provide adequate resources or facilities for the disposal of litigation , has itself contributed to delay . ' Systemic delay ' of this nature may overlap to some degree with prosecutorial delay and run hand in hand with it . There may be prosecutorial delay within systemic delay . Equally there may be no blameworthy delay by the prosecution but there may yet be delays within the system to which an applicant has in no way contributed . There may also be judicial delay where the court fails to deliver its judgment or decision within an appropriate time frame . Where systemic delay is established it may amount to an infringement of a citizen 's constitutional right to a trial with reasonable expedition . Such forms of delay may also amount to an omission or failure on the part of the ORG to comply with its obligations under LAW , in particular LAW thereof ...", "In the present case it is claimed that there was both prosecutorial delay and delays within the system which prevented an earlier set of judicial review proceedings being disposed of within a reasonable time . There is no suggestion that there was any form of judicial delay contributing to that alleged delay ..... \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON assessed the criteria by which prosecutorial delay would be measured ( a test which he considered reflected that of this ORG ) and found those principles equally applicable to systemic delay ( described as \u201c failures of the criminal justice system \u201d ) . Prior to applying the test , he made a number of preliminary comments , notably to the effect that degrees of dilatoriness which may have been acceptable in the past could no longer be tolerated since LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) gave effect in GPE to the provisions of the Convention : both the constitutional and Convention rights to trial with reasonable expedition had to be \u201c vindicated by being given real effect \u201d .", "CARDINAL . However , that did not mean that the prohibition of a criminal trial had to be resorted to more readily and PERSON pointed to the difference between the role of this ORG under the reasonable time requirement of LAW and its award of just satisfaction and that of the domestic courts in prohibition proceedings where unreasonable expedition had to be balanced against the public interest in continuing with a prosecution . Given this added element in the domestic prohibition proceedings , prohibition should only be granted exceptionally and where there was an assessed serious breach of the rights under LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Convention . In so noting , PERSON referred to other domestic remedies as follows :", "\u201c I would accept that a distinction may require to be drawn between breaches of the right which give rise to an entitlement to obtain prohibition and lesser transgressions which may conceivably give rise to some other remedy , such as one in damages . However , any entitlement to a remedy in damages for breach of a constitutional right to an expeditious trial is a matter that will require very full and careful consideration in an appropriate case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to whether there was blameworthy delay , PERSON hesitated on the same period of delay ( noted by ORG ) in approving the High Court judgment but he did not consider that \u201c blameworthy \u201d given the absence of evidence that it deviated from the norm . Accordingly , even given the passage of time since the original alleged offence and a consequent \u201c heightened degree of urgency in advancing this prosecution \u201d , it was not considered that the applicant had established blameworthy prosecutorial or systemic delay . Even assuming he had , PERSON was satisfied that there was no demonstrated prejudice to the applicant or impairment of his other rights including the constitutional right to a trial in due course of law . As regards the motion struck out on DATE , PERSON noted that the applicant had not done anything about re - entering it for DATE and that it had taken DATE to re - enter the motion . As regards discovery by the prosecution in DATE , PERSON noted that this affidavit listed CARDINAL documents and was clearly the result of \u201c considerable effort \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Geoghegan J. broadly agreed with those judgments . He considered that no important issue of \u201c systemic delay \u201d arose in the present case and he reserved his view on its nature and relevance for a future case , though noting that the rather new concept of systemic delay was not the same thing as prosecutorial delay . He suggested that an inadequate number of judges would , if anything , be a reason to assess a longer delay as reasonable in the circumstances , although he acknowledged that that view might not accord with the Convention . The ORG 's jurisprudence in NORP cases was not sufficiently clear as to the correct approach to systemic delay and , notably , as to the blameworthiness of a ORG for systemic delay : could , for example , a ORG be blamed for diverting limited economic resources to a hospital as opposed to judicial institutions ? In any event , the present case was not the appropriate one to examine systemic delay as none of the impugned periods of delay warranted a prohibition order . As to the lapse of time in approving the High Court judgment , he found it unnecessary to consider whether this delay should be taken into account in considering whether a trial should be prohibited because he was \u201c quite satisfied that prohibition would not be appropriate in this case at any rate \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Following this judgment , the stay on the criminal proceedings pending the second prohibition action was lifted . On DATE the criminal proceedings were reinstated before the SCC when the trial date was fixed for DATE . The memorandum of CARDINAL DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) was again disclosed as additional evidence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , and following a ruling by the SCC that the principal evidence in the case ( the alleged admission of the applicant during police questioning ) was inadmissible , the prosecution indicated that they did not propose to adduce further evidence and the charges were dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant introduced a second application to this ORG in DATE in which he complained under , inter alia , Articles DATE and CARDINAL about the length of the criminal proceedings against him and about the lack of an effective domestic remedy in this regard . Referring to the general time - line of events since DATE , he mainly complained about delay during the first prohibition action . That application has not been joined to the present one .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the LAW reads as follows :", "\u201c All judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to this LAW and the law \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL ) of the LAW provides that :", "\u201c No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the LAW also provides that :", "\u201c The ORG guarantees in its laws to respect , and , as far as practicable , by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act provides that ORG shall establish and maintain a register of judgments reserved by , inter alia , the High and ORG in civil proceedings and supervise the delivery of those judgments within prescribed periods . This Act entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The background and terms of reference of ORG were outlined in its ORG as follows :", "\u201c In DATE there have been significant changes in NORP society . GPE 's population has grown from CARDINAL in DATE to MONEY in DATE . There has been an increase in economic activity and demographic diversity . Changes in social and public policy have occurred . International developments now have a greater impact on NORP affairs and the courts .", "These changes have had important implications for the NORP legal system . In particular , ORG and ORG have experienced a significant expansion in litigation .", "Despite the relative success of the courts in introducing procedures to deal with these developments , the current ORG structure was not designed to cope with developments of such a profound nature . There has been a need for some time to conduct a strategic review of the current ORG structure .", "In DATE the Government decided to set up ORG to consider the question of establishing a ORG , with the following terms of reference :", "' ( a ) to review and consider the necessity for a general ORG for the purpose of processing certain categories of appeals from ORG .", "( b ) to address and consider such legal changes as are necessary for the purposes of establishing a ORG , and", "( c ) to make such other recommendations as are appropriate for the purposes of ensuring greater efficiencies in the practices and procedures of ORG . '", "CARDINAL . The ORG recommended the establishment of a Court of Appeal in order to , inter alia , eliminate undue delay in processing appeals before ORG . The ORG described the increase in High and ORG litigation and the backlog this had created particularly at the ORG level :", "\u201c ORG has seen a significant increase in the volume and complexity of its appellate caseload . Unsurprisingly , this greater volume of cases has created a backlog of appeals in ORG . This has led to longer delays in ORG , with some cases now taking DATE to get a hearing .... A delay in determining these appeals can cause uncertainty for individuals , for businesses and for government . It can put unnecessary emotional and financial pressure on litigants . It leaves others unsure about the law , which inhibits their ability to organise and plan their affairs . In short , delays create confusion and costs and are bad for business . This situation poses serious problems for the NORP legal system and for NORP society as a whole . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Report recorded the average delays in obtaining a hearing before ORG as follows : DATE ( DATE ) , DATE ( DATE ) , DATE ( DATE ) , DATE ( DATE ) , DATE ( DATE ) and DATE ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of the ORG is entitled \u201c ORG - limits and ORG \u201d and noted that GPE had been found in breach of LAW v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALX ( extracts ) ; PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ; and PERSON v. GPE , cited above ) . It noted that a common feature of those cases was that they involved litigation in which the violations of LAW were , in large part , attributed to delays occurring as a result of a shortage of judges , relative to the caseload of the courts . This underlined the fact that any logistical difficulties encountered by the courts might result in a breach of GPE 's obligations under the ORG .", "CARDINAL . As to GPE 's efforts to comply with its Convention obligations , the ORG continued :", "\u201c The increase in judicial appointments to ORG has alleviated these difficulties at that level . As this chapter has already noted , however , the fact that the CARDINAL - division ORG is obliged to deal with all ORG civil appeals means that there is a significant risk of delays of the sort impugned in PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON occurring at appellate level .", "...", "ORG has identified delays caused by the courts themselves ( as a result of logistical pressures ) as the key factors offending the requirements of Article CARDINAL in each case . Violations have been found , as in [ Price and PERSON v. the GPE , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE ] , where the courts themselves were held to have acted reasonably in respect of the relevant proceedings . The ORG is obliged to organise its system to avoid the risk of parties unduly delaying their proceedings . It must also therefore be required to ensure that the structure of the legal system itself does not generate undue delays . The institutional bottleneck at ORG level has just such an effect on our system . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of PERSON v. the ORG , the Minister for ORG , LAW and the Attorney General ( [ DATE ] IEHC CARDINAL ) , ORG granted a prohibition order to stop a prosecution concerning events which took place in DATE . In so finding , ORG commented :", "\u201c Despite the absence of any explanation for the delays already enumerated it is clear that some part at least of this delay was caused by the overwhelming pressure on the , then , inadequate facilities of the legal system . The government had an obligation to \u201c organise [ its ] legal system so as to enable the courts to comply [ with the requirements of LAW ] ...", "... significant improvements have been made in court waiting times through better management and facilities and the systemic delays of that period are now , thankfully , a thing of the past . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an application for leave to apply for judicial review , ORG ( and on appeal , ORG ) can prohibit a prosecution on the basis of delay considered to constitute a real and serious risk of an unfair trial . This does not exclude the inherent and constitutional duty of the trial court to ensure that there was a fair trial and to stop a trial if matters arose which rendered it unfair ( ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . A trial can also be prohibited on the basis of a breach of the right of an accused to trial with \u201c reasonable expedition \u201d ( ORG ( PERSON ) v Donoghue [ DATE , PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE v. PERSON ( cited above ) PERSON reviewed recent NORP cases on the subject . He found that \u201c in determining whether the concern and anxiety caused to an accused person is such as to justify the prohibition of his trial on the ground that his constitutional right to a reasonably expeditious trial has been violated , the court , depending entirely on the circumstances of the particular case , may be entitled to take into account , not merely delay subsequent to his being charged and brought to trial , but also delay prior to the formal charge . \u201d He went on to identify as the essential issue being whether , assuming a breach of the constitutional right to a reasonably expeditious trial , the prohibition of the trial was justified . He answered that question as follows :", "\u201c Where , as here , the violation of the right has not jeopardised the right to a fair trial , but has caused unnecessary stress and anxiety to the applicant , the court must engage in a balancing process . On CARDINAL side of the scales , there is the right of the accused to be protected from stress and anxiety caused by an unnecessary and inordinate delay . On the other side , there is the public interest in the prosecution and conviction of those guilty of criminal offences . In all such cases , the court will necessarily be concerned with the nature of the offence and the extent of the delay . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterated that approach in DATE v ORG ( cited above ) . PERSON , speaking for a unanimous court , cited the above judgment of PERSON Having done so , he continued :", "\u201c I believe that the balancing exercise referred to by PERSON in DATE v. PERSON is the appropriate mechanism to be adopted by a court in determining whether blameworthy prosecutorial delay should result in an order of prohibition . It means that an applicant for such relief must put something more into the balance where prosecutorial delay arises to outweigh the public interest in having serious charges proceed to trial . In most cases , pre - trial incarceration will not be an element as an applicant will probably have obtained bail pending his trial . Secondly , while he may assert increased levels of stress and anxiety arising from prosecutorial delay , any balancing exercise will have to take into account the length of such blameworthy delay , because if it is a short delay rather than DATE , the mere fact that some blameworthy delay took place should not of itself justify the prohibition of a trial . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL IR CARDINAL ) the applicant had been charged in DATE with sexual assault alleged to have occurred in DATE . He was granted leave to seek judicial review as regards a number of issues arising from the prosecution of the case . ORG dismissed his judicial review proceedings but nevertheless granted a prohibition order on the grounds that the blameworthy delay by the prosecution in conducting the judicial review proceedings had denied the applicant his right to a criminal trial with reasonable expedition . The ORG appealed to ORG which allowed the appeal finding that , where inordinate delay did not jeopardise the applicant 's right to a fair trial but had caused unnecessary stress and anxiety , the court had to engage in a balancing process between the applicant 's right to be protected from such stress and anxiety and the public interest in the prosecution and conviction of those guilty of criminal offences . PERSON , with whom the other judges of ORG concurred , stated :", "\u201c It is important to clear up any misunderstanding concerning the import of such decisions of ORG . The ORG does not and did not , in that case , hold that the prosecution had to be stopped . It would be most surprising if a judgment of that ORG holding that the prosecuting authorities were \u201c partially or completely responsible \u201d for certain periods of delay had the automatic consequence that a prosecution had to be halted . Such a conclusion would , in any legal system , call for some consideration of the public interest in the prosecution of crime . We know , of course , from other parts of the case - law of the ORG that it does recognise the public interest in prosecuting crime ( see PERSON v GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG ; [ Doorson ] v GPE CARDINAL EHRR CARDINAL ) . Thus , the decision of the ORG leads to a monetary award . It has no consequence for the pending prosecution .", "In brief , the decision in PERSON v GPE adds nothing to the applicant 's claim to have his trial stopped . The applicant has not , at any stage , advanced a claim for damages as part of the relief sought in these proceedings . As in almost all such cases , the principal objective has been to seek to prevent his trial from proceeding . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The later case of PERSON ( [ DATE ] DATE ) concerned the accused 's application for an order prohibiting his criminal trial ( on numerous charges of sexual assaults on his nieces DATE ) on the basis of delay in the institution and prosecution of the charges . He was only partially successful before ORG and he unsuccessfully appealed to ORG . Having reviewed the pre - conditions for an order of prohibition and noted that there \u201c may be other remedies \u201d , Judge PERSON noted the above - quoted reference of PERSON ( in GPE v. ORG ) to PERSON v. GPE and , notably , the sum of money awarded in just satisfaction . PERSON also stated that :", "\u201c I do not consider that the arguments advanced on behalf of the defendant and based on the jurisprudence of ORG , has any relevance in the circumstances of this case . I wish , therefore , to reserve my opinion on the effect of that jurisprudence in a case of this sort until a case arises where this material is of direct relevance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. ORG ( [ DATE ] DATE ) the accused alleged prosecutorial delay in pursuing firearms and criminal damage charges against him . ORG ( in DATE ) granted the prohibition order and ORG ( delivering its judgment in DATE following the judgment of ORG in the present case ) allowed the ORG 's appeal .", "PERSON recalled and summarised the principles governing prosecutorial delay in NORP law ( laid down in the above - cited cases of TIME v. PERSON and DATE v. ORG ) as follows :", "\u201c ( a ) Inordinate , blameworthy or unexplained prosecutorial delay may breach an applicant 's constitutional entitlement to a trial with reasonable expedition .", "( b ) Prosecutorial delay of this nature may be of such a degree that a court will presume prejudice and uphold the right to an expeditious trial by directing prohibition .", "( c ) Where there is a period of significant blameworthy prosecutorial delay less than that envisaged at ( b ) , and no actual prejudice is demonstrated , the court will engage in a balancing exercise between the community 's entitlement to see crimes prosecuted and the applicant 's right to an expeditious trial , but will not direct prohibition unless one or more of the elements referred to in [ the above cited case of ORG v. PERSON and DATE v. ORG ] are demonstrated .", "( d ) Actual prejudice caused by delay which is such as to preclude a fair trial will always entitle an applicant to prohibition .", "...", "When applying the test , the court must , however , keep certain considerations in mind . On the one hand , the court must remember that degrees of dilatoriness which may have been acceptable in the past may no longer be tolerated since LAW DATE gave effect in this jurisdiction to the provisions of the Convention , including the right under Article CARDINAL to a trial with reasonable expedition . This right must be given real effect .", "In the context of prohibition this is not to say that an NORP court must readily or too easily resort to prohibition , whatever about other remedies , when vindicating rights under LAW . Under our jurisprudence , ... , prohibition is a remedy to be granted only in exceptional circumstances . The ORG does not adopt a punitive or disciplinary role in this context . Further , any court called upon to prohibit a trial must give due weight to the gravity and seriousness of the offence when exercising this jurisdiction . It must analyse the causes for delay with great care , weighing up and balancing the role of both the prosecution and the applicant and their respective contributions to delay . In this context not every delay is significant and not every delay warrants the description of being blameworthy to such a degree as to trigger an enquiry by the court under P.M. v. ORG or PERSON v. PERSON . In my view an applicant should ordinarily adduce and place before the court some evidence of what is the norm in terms of time taken for the particular proceedings or the identified process or processes within it which are the subject matter of complaint . This is information which is readily available from ORG with regard to various forms of proceedings . \u201d", "GPE J began her judgment noting that the case , raising issues of delay in prosecuting criminal offences , was CARDINAL of a number of cases which had been decided in ORG ( DATE ) at a time when the jurisprudence was being clarified by ORG . Finding that ORG had not applied the correct test as regards prosecutorial delay , PERSON referred to the restatement of the law in TIME v. ORG ( cited above ) :", "\u201c This test requires that in circumstances where there was blameworthy prosecutorial delay , a further step is required to be taken by ORG , this step was not taken by ORG . To prohibit a trial , in addition to the finding of blameworthy prosecutorial delay CARDINAL or more of the interests protected by the right to an expeditious trial must be shown to have been so interfered with as to entitle the applicant to relief . The bar of the test is high because this is a very significant relief - an order prohibiting the public prosecutor from prosecuting an accused .", "In this case the second step required by the test was not taken . Indeed the learned trial judge stated that the applicant did not complain of any specific prejudice , and that he did not complain that his right to a fair trial had been impaired by the delay . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. GPE and the Attorney General ( [ DATE ] IEHC CARDINAL ) ORG set aside the applicant 's conviction for rape and sexual assault on the grounds that the manner in which his trial had been conducted rendered his trial unfair . A retrial was not ordered . However , by that date the accused had served his sentence and had been released . Not being entitled to damages under section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( his conviction was not quashed on the grounds of a miscarriage of justice ) , he took proceedings against the ORG claiming essentially damages for a breach of his constitutional right to a fair trial . In dismissing the application , ORG found that the ORG could not be vicariously liable for errors which a judge may commit in the administration of justice nor could a plaintiff sue the ORG on other grounds as regards the failure by the trial judge to ensure a fair trial . In addition , ORG opined that , in any event , the immunity conferred by law on the judiciary also applied for the benefit of the ORG when an attempt was made to render the ORG liable for the wrongs of a judge . ORG stated :", "\u201c I am of the view that many of the reasons which support personal judicial immunity \u2013 the promotion of judicial independence , the desirability of finality in litigation , the existence of an appeal and other remedies as well as the public interest \u2013 can also support the argument for ORG immunity in cases such as those before this ORG . Indeed it is my view that not to extend the immunity to the ORG in the present circumstances would represent an indirect and collateral assault on judicial immunity itself .", "To make the ORG liable in such a situation would indirectly inhibit the judge in the exercise of his judicial functions and this , in turn , would undermine his independence as guaranteed by LAW . It would introduce an unrelated and collateral consideration into the judge 's thinking which could prevent him from determining the issue in a free unfettered manner . It might , for example , encourage the other organs of government to monitor the conduct of the judges in this regard , thereby resulting in \u201c a chilling effect \u201d .", "The fundamental reason for supporting this conclusion , however , is that when the judge is exercising judicial authority he is acting in an independent manner and not only is he not a servant of the ORG in these circumstances , he is not even acting on behalf of the ORG . He is not doing the ORG 's business . He is acting at the behest of the people and his mission is to administer justice . ...", "... The plaintiff 's case might be advanced to another stage by arguing that the above line of reasoning , which recognises personal immunity for judges and ORG immunity for the majority of wrongs committed by judges in the administration of justice , does not apply when the constitutional rights of the individual are at stake . I can not agree . If CARDINAL were to accept that line of argument one would have to acknowledge that the immunity given to judges personally would also have to yield in such situations . ...", "In my view , the acceptance of personal immunity for the ORG must logically extend to the ORG when sued directly for judicial error even when a fundamental right is asserted . That this immunity is not specially recognised in the LAW , is no impediment , since the ORG immunity in these circumstances is a corollary of the personal immunity conferred on the judges and the ORG immunity can be inferred from the personal immunity long since recognised by our courts , though not explicitly acknowledged in the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
