GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-4;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a NORP national born in DATE and living in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE am ORG ( ORG ) issued a warrant for the applicant 's arrest on suspicion of fraud ( FAC ) and corruption ( PERSON ) .", "According to ORG , there was a strong suspicion that , DATE , the applicant , in his position as director of ORG ( GPE ) , had regularly accepted payments by the owner of an engineering company , Mr N. , and his deputy , Mr PERSON , and that these amounts , increased by PERCENT , were subsequently included in bills for public construction works financed by ORG . Moreover , the applicant had also received a jacuzzi . Mr N. and Mr W. were the subject of separate investigations . There was an agreement between them and the applicant to the effect that the applicant ensured that contracts were regularly given to the engineering company by ORG . ORG added that the account of the facts given in the arrest warrant resulted from statements made by PERSON and PERSON as well as from the investigations ; no further details were given about their precise content .", "ORG further considered that there was a risk of collusion ( GPE ) within the meaning of LAW of LAW ( GPE ) , on the ground that if the applicant remained free he might try to contact other accomplices or witnesses , in particular officials of ORG or employees of the engineering company , with a view to coordinating their statements or changing or destroying written evidence , thereby hindering the establishment of the facts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , counsel for the applicant , requested ORG to hold an oral hearing on the applicant 's detention on remand ( GPE ) . With reference to this request , he also applied to the GPE public prosecutor ( FAC ) for leave to consult the investigation file , or at least the statements made by Mr N. and Mr PERSON , since the arrest warrant made reference to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the public prosecutor , referring to LAW , refused counsel 's request , including the request to consult only Mr N. 's and Mr PERSON 's statements , on the ground that to decide otherwise would endanger the purpose of the ongoing investigations , which formed part of very complex proceedings concerning economic offences ( Wirtschaftsstrafverfahren ) , including corruption , and involving a large number of public officials and employees . In addition , the investigation against the applicant could not be separated from the other issues with which they were concerned .", "CARDINAL . NORP In view of the hearing to be held before FAC ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , on DATE the public prosecutor forwarded to that court CARDINAL volumes of a special file relating to the applicant 's detention , which was composed of copies taken from the general investigation file relating to all the accused .", "CARDINAL . In written submissions of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant , through his counsel , commented on the charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) for a judicial review ( Antrag auf gerichtliche GPE ) of the public prosecutor 's decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , when questioned by the public prosecutor , mainly referred to his submissions of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following the applicant 's request of DATE , held a hearing for the review of his detention on remand . On questioning , the applicant clarified some statements contained in his submissions of CARDINAL DATE regarding the venue of his meetings with Mr W. He further explained his general position in relation to ORG and the circumstances in which he had contacted Mr PERSON shortly before his arrest .", "At the end of the hearing , ORG ordered the applicant 's continued detention on remand . As regards the strong suspicion against the applicant , the court confined itself to confirming in CARDINAL sentence that it still existed as stated in the arrest warrant . Furthermore , the court found that there remained a risk of collusion , having regard in particular to the applicant 's statement at the hearing that he had contacted Mr PERSON shortly before his own arrest . The court therefore considered that the applicant had already at that stage attempted to influence another suspect and to induce him to make a favourable statement if questioned by the public prosecutor 's office . In that context , particular weight was to be given to the fact that all of this had occurred before the applicant knew the concrete charges against him , the nature of the relevant evidence or the content of the statements made by witnesses or other suspects . ORG also noted that the public prosecutor 's office had made progress in the investigations , which might therefore be completed soon .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed further written comments on the charges against him on CARDINAL and DATE . On DATE he was again heard by the police in the presence of his counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed ( Beschwerde ) against the decision of DATE . As a consequence , ORG decided on DATE to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant on condition that the applicant did not change residence DATE or notified any change to the GPE public prosecutor 's office \u2013 , that he complied with any summons in the case , that he refrained from any conversation about the criminal proceedings with officials of ORG or with the employees of the engineering company concerned and that he deposited MONEY ( ORG ) as security . The applicant was released DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant 's request for judicial review of the public prosecutor 's decision of DATE inadmissible .", "The court first considered that the impugned decision was a measure of judicial administration ( Justizverwaltungsakt ) which could in principle be the subject of a judicial review under sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW to LAW ( Einf\u00fchrungsgesetz zum Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz ) . However , that remedy was of a subsidiary nature and could therefore not be used here , as other remedies were available to the applicant for the purposes of challenging the lawfulness of the decision denying him access to the investigation file .", "ORG found that it was for the trial judge to decide on the applicant 's access to the file , once the public prosecutor 's investigations had been completed . This decision would then be open to an appeal by the applicant . This kind of subsequent judicial review fulfilled the constitutional requirements regarding judicial protection , and the temporary absence of a remedy until the preliminary investigation was over had to be accepted in the interest of the efficiency of criminal justice . ORG added that the constitutional right to a court remedy ensures a right to judicial review within a reasonable time , rather than an immediate judicial review .", "Furthermore , the fact that the applicant was detained on remand could not be regarded as a special circumstance calling \u2013 as in the case of an arbitrary prosecution \u2013 for a judicial remedy before the end of the preliminary investigation . In ORG view , the applicant 's rights were sufficiently secured by the judicial review of his continued detention on remand , under LAW seq . of LAW . Of course , courts reviewing an accused 's detention on remand were prevented in principle from deciding whether or not to grant access to the file , that being a matter within the sole competence of the public prosecutor 's office . However , the absence of such immediate judicial supervision did not amount to a denial of judicial protection , since the competent court had also to examine whether the denial of access to the file to a remand prisoner was in breach of procedural safeguards such as those laid down in LAW and , if so , to order his release .", "ORG decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , noting that Mr W. had died in the meantime , applied to the public prosecutor 's office for leave to consult the statements made by him in the course of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor 's office rejected the request pursuant to LAW , on the ground that access to the file would still endanger the purpose of the investigations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint ( ORG ) against the decisions of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's counsel renewed his request for access to the file . The public prosecutor , referring to his previous decision , rejected the request on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) decided not to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint . The decision was served on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside the arrest warrant against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's counsel was granted access to the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's counsel requested the public prosecutor to discontinue the proceedings against his client , arguing that there were insufficient grounds for suspecting him . In this connection , he referred to the result of the investigations thus far and discussed in detail the statements of the co - accused , including their wording and later amendments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE public prosecutor discontinued the proceedings in respect of events prior to DATE , which had become time - barred , and issued an indictment against the applicant , charging him with CARDINAL counts of corruption .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of corruption on CARDINAL counts and imposed on him a fine of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal , which he subsequently withdrew for personal reasons .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( GPE ) concern the arrest and detention of a person on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence . According to LAW , a person may be detained on remand if there is a strong suspicion that he or she has committed a criminal offence and if there is a reason for arrest , such as the risk of absconding or the risk of collusion . LAW regulates the suspension of the execution of an arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , remand prisoners can ask at any time for judicial review of the arrest warrant . An oral hearing will be held at the request of the remand prisoner , or if the court so decides of its own motion ( LAW ) . If the arrest warrant is held to be valid following the hearing , the remand prisoner is entitled to a new oral hearing only if the detention has lasted for DATE altogether and if DATE have elapsed since the last oral hearing ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Article CARDINAL provides that an arrest warrant has to be quashed if reasons justifying the detention on remand no longer persist or if the continued detention appears disproportionate . Any prolongation of detention on remand beyond DATE is to be decided by ORG ( ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure concern the defence of a person charged with having committed a criminal offence , in particular the choice of defence counsel or appointment of official defence counsel . According to LAW , defence counsel is entitled to consult the files which have been presented to the trial court , or which would be presented to the trial court in case of an indictment , and to inspect the exhibits . LAW of this provision allows for a refusal of access to part or all of the files or to the exhibits for as long as the preliminary investigation has not been terminated , if the purpose of the investigation would otherwise be endangered . Pending the termination of the preliminary investigation , it is for the public prosecutor 's office to decide whether to grant access to the file or not ; thereafter it is for the president of the trial court ( LAW ) . By LAW amending LAW ( Strafverfahrens\u00e4nderungsgesetz , GPE , DATE , vol . I , p. CARDINAL ) with effect from DATE , the latter provision has been amended to the effect , inter alia , that an accused who is in detention is now entitled to ask for judicial review of the decision of the public prosecutor 's office denying access to the file .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure regulate the principles of criminal prosecution and the preparation of the indictment . Article CARDINAL provides that any trial has to be initiated by an indictment . According to LAW , the indictment is to be preferred by the public prosecutor 's office which is , unless otherwise provided , bound to investigate any criminal offence for which there exist sufficient grounds of suspicion .", "CARDINAL . Preliminary investigations are to be conducted by the public prosecutor 's office according to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure . On the basis of these investigations , the public prosecutor 's office decides under LAW whether to prefer an indictment or to discontinue the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW ) , every person involved in proceedings before a court is entitled to be heard by that court ( PERSON auf rechtliches PERSON ) .", "According to ORG ( Bundes - verfassungsgericht ) , this rule requires a court decision to be based only on those facts and evidential findings which could be commented upon by the parties . In cases involving arrest and detention on remand , the arrest warrant and all court decisions upholding it must be founded only on those facts and pieces of evidence of which the accused was previously aware and on which he was able to comment ( ORG , decision of DATE ( FAC juristische GPE , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) , with further references ) .", "In the aforementioned decision , ORG held that , following his arrest , an accused had to be informed of the content of the arrest warrant and promptly brought before a judge who , when questioning him , had to inform him of all relevant incriminating evidence as well as of evidence in his favour . Moreover , in the course of ensuing review proceedings , the accused must be heard and , to the extent that the investigation will not be prejudiced , the relevant results of the investigation at that stage must be given to him . In some cases , such oral information may not be sufficient . If the facts and the evidence forming the basis of a decision in detention matters can not or can no longer be communicated orally , other means of informing the accused , such as a right to consult the files ( PERSON ) , are to be used . On the other hand , statutory limitations on an accused 's access to the files until the preliminary investigation are completed are to be accepted if the efficient conduct of criminal investigations so requires . However , even while those investigations are in progress , an accused who is detained on remand has a right of access to the files through his lawyer if and to the extent that the information which they contain might affect his position in the review proceedings and oral information is not sufficient . If in such cases the prosecution refuses access to the relevant parts of the files pursuant to LAW , the reviewing court can not base its decision on those facts and evidence and , if necessary , has to set the arrest warrant aside ( ORG , op . cit . ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
