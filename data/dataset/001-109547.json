In the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG addressed the applicant \u2019s objection to the use of the statements by witnesses whom he had been unable to cross - examine in open court . It held as follows :", "\u201c The court can not agree with [ the applicant \u2019s ] and his lawyer \u2019s statement that the accusations against him are based on statements by persons with a vested interest [ in his conviction ] and who can not be trusted .", "The fact that PERSON . , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON had taken part in the criminal acts of which [ the applicant ] stands accused can not call into question the truthfulness of their statements . In exposing [ the applicant ] they , at the same time , [ admitted to their own guilt ] in [ respect of ] those crimes . In particular , PERSON and PERSON . have already been punished for that .", "As the case - file materials show ... PERSON willingly went to ORG and wrote a confession statement in which he described the robberies he had committed together with [ the applicant ] , PERSON . , PERSON , PERSON and Mr V .. At the same time , he did not play down the importance of his role in the criminal acts .", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] statement that PERSON , PERSON . and Mr O. had slandered him because PERSON had forced them to do so is wanton and unsubstantiated . The fact that PERSON . had been convicted of having slandered other persons in the course of unrelated criminal proceedings can not serve as an undisputable ground for doubting the truthfulness of his statements in the present case .", "The court can not accept [ the applicant \u2019s ] and his lawyer \u2019s argument that the court has violated the principle of direct examination of evidence at a court hearing and the defendant \u2019s right to defend himself . The statements which were read out at the court hearing are admissible evidence because interrogations and confrontations with those persons had been conducted in accordance with the requirements of LAW . The court did not have an opportunity to question those persons at the court hearing because , despite every possible measure taken , it was unable to establish their places of residence .", "However , the law allows the reading out in court of statements by defaulters . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his lawyer appealed . In particular , they argued that the conviction was exclusively based on statements by the witnesses questioned by the investigating authorities whom the applicant had been unable to confront in open court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment , endorsing the reasons given by ORG . In response to the applicant \u2019s arguments concerning the admissibility of evidence , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c The pre - trial investigation and trial were conducted thoroughly and objectively , in accordance with the requirements of the criminal procedural law and in compliance with the rights and lawful interests of the [ applicant ] and other parties to the criminal proceedings . [ The applicant \u2019s ] right to defence was not violated . Confrontations between [ the applicant ] and PERSON and between [ the applicant ] and PERSON . were conducted in accordance with the requirements of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure , [ and ] the lawyer ... protected the [ applicant \u2019s ] interests in the course of those investigative procedures .", "The court correctly established the factual circumstances and the conclusions set out in the judgment completely correspond to [ the facts ] . The judgment is based on evidence examined at the court hearing and the court gave a correct interpretation to it . The court fully and objectively examined the materials of the criminal case file ...", "At the hearing the court examined the prosecutor \u2019s motion to read out the statements by [ CARDINAL witnesses , including the CARDINAL alleged accomplices ] ; it heard the parties\u2019 opinion concerning that issue and ... it issued a decision .", "The decision taken by the court to read out the statements of the above - mentioned persons is appropriately reasoned , substantiated and correct . The court considered that the statements which were to be read out at the hearing had been collected in accordance with the requirements of the criminal procedural law , that by virtue of LAW justice is executed on the basis of equality of the parties , that by virtue of LAW [ LAW ] has supreme legal effect in GPE and other laws can not contradict its principles and rules . Mr O. ... had died before the trial commenced , PERSON absconded [ and ] his place of residence was unknown to the court , the other witnesses defaulted despite being summoned by the court , [ the applicant ] had confrontations with PERSON . and PERSON during which they entirely confirmed their statements .", "In such circumstances , the reading out of the statements by the abovementioned persons corresponded to the principle that criminal proceedings in GPE should be adversarial ; the court compared the statements to other evidence in the case and evaluated them in accordance with the requirements of the law .", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] guilt was confirmed by the statements by the [ witnesses , including those by the alleged accomplices ] and evidence contained in the written materials of the file . The court examined the arguments of the defendant and his lawyer that [ the alleged accomplices ] had slandered [ the applicant][The alleged accomplices ] , while exposing [ the applicant \u2019s ] guilt , did not play down their own involvement in the case ; PERSON . and PERSON were convicted of the crimes committed . In such circumstances the court had no reason to doubt the statements by [ those witnesses ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having studied the voluminous case file comprising material , documentary and expert evidence and having heard a substantial number of witnesses , ORG found the applicant , who was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings , guilty of unlawful possession of a weapon and forgery of documents . The applicant was also found guilty of having aided and abetted aggravated murder and was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The judgment became final on DATE when ORG of GPE upheld the conviction for murder and unlawful possession of a weapon , discontinued the criminal proceedings in respect of the charge of forgery of documents and reduced the sentence by DATE . ORG noted that ORG findings were based on a thorough and well - reasoned analysis of extensive evidence presented both by the prosecution and defence .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant immediately sent a letter to ORG explaining that he was serving a prison sentence and seeking leave to attend .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant repeated his request . No reply followed .", "CARDINAL . A prosecutor who attended the hearings before ORG sought dismissal of the action , arguing that the applicant had been unable to actively participate in his child \u2019s life for practical reasons but was interested in maintaining a relationship with the child . The prosecutor noted that the applicant \u2019s relatives regularly passed on information to him about his child .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the parties\u2019 submissions that ORG called CARDINAL witness from the applicant \u2019s witness list , his sister , having refused to call his parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the presence of the applicant \u2019s representative , upheld the action and terminated the applicant \u2019s parental rights , having considered that his absconding from the law - enforcement authorities and being on the run for a long time could not be accepted as a valid justification for his failure to fulfil his parental responsibilities . ORG stressed that the applicant and his representative had not provided it with evidence to demonstrate that the applicant had effectively carried out his parental role .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant received a copy of the judgment . He lodged an appeal , arguing that he had been unable to present his arguments before ORG due to his absence from the hearings . He further asked that his presence at the appeal hearing be ensured .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in the presence of the applicant \u2019s representative , upheld the judgment of DATE .

On several occasions ORG has dismissed as inadmissible complaints by detainees whose requests for leave to attend hearings were refused by civil courts . It has reasoned that the relevant provisions of LAW and LAW do not , as such , restrict a detainee \u2019s access to court . ORG has emphasised nonetheless that an imprisoned person should be able to make submissions to a civil court , either through a representative or in any other way provided by law . If necessary , a hearing should be held at the convict \u2019s place of detention , or the court committed to hear the civil case may instruct the court with territorial jurisdiction over the convict \u2019s place of detention to obtain his / her submissions or to take any other procedural steps ( decisions CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
