At a hearing on DATE ORG again questioned the undercover agents ORG and A.B.", "CARDINAL . In his statement ORG explained that he could not judge whether he had contacted the applicant more frequently than the applicant had contacted him .

ORG also explained that a simulated purchase operation was sometimes carried out just once and sometimes on several occasions . In the case at issue , he had been instructed by his superiors to conduct several such simulated purchases . Moreover , it was for his superior and not him to determine the ultimate aim of the simulated purchase operation . In any case , the aim of such a police operation was to eradicate currency counterfeiting . ORG was unable to recall who had initiated the meeting in GPE in DATE when he had introduced the applicant to the second undercover agent PERSON Nor could he say who had initiated the other meetings . With regard to his first meeting with the applicant , he could not say whether the applicant had had CARDINAL counterfeit note in his possession or CARDINAL . ORG answered that it was \u201c [ the applicant \u2019s ] own business \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

It found that there had been CARDINAL unsuccessful attempts on the part of the undercover agents to contact the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE ORG heard the parties\u2019 closing arguments . The applicant argued in particular that the police had abused their powers in not arresting him after the first illicit transfer of counterfeit euros and had instead incited him to commit further offences by arranging purchases of larger quantities of counterfeit euros . He also contended that there had never been a reasonable suspicion of his having committed an offence which could have justified the investigating judge \u2019s decision to authorise the use of undercover investigative measures .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It also confiscated HRK CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL from the applicant and ordered his expulsion from GPE .

With regard to the applicant \u2019s plea of entrapment , ORG observed :", "\u201c In the case at issue , examination of the audio recordings of the phone taps confirmed the circumstances surrounding the communication between the undercover agents and the accused , in particular the intensity of the telephone communications . Taking note of the recorded statements of the undercover agents during their communications [ with the applicant ] , it was established that the purpose of the communications was [ organising ] a meeting with the accused in order to effectuate a simulated purchase .", "This court considers that it can not be said that the undercover agents acted improperly in the sense that by their actions they allowed the accused to develop his criminal activity [ or ] in any manner incited him to commit an offence .", "Neither the questioning of the undercover agents nor any other [ evidence adduced ] suggests that the undercover agents incited the accused to commit an offence in the sense that they offered him some reward or brought him presents or such like .", "It is true [ as was established during the proceedings ] that , for instance , CARDINAL and DATE the undercover agent tried to contact the accused CARDINAL times on his mobile phone , but this court considers that this was not prohibited nor did it incite the accused to commit criminal acts . Those were attempts to contact the accused in the period which was \u2018 ORG by the [ investigating judge \u2019s order ] . It should be also taken into account that in the period at issue there had already been communication between the accused and the undercover agent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the first - instance judgment by lodging an appeal before ORG . He argued , in particular , that the orders for the use of special investigative measures had not been adequately reasoned , as required LAW . He also contended that there had been no reason to continue with the use of simulated purchases and the undercover GPE activities after the first illicit transfer of counterfeit MONEY in DATE . All further events had constituted entrapment intended to extend the scope of his criminal activity , which eventually resulted in a more severe sentence . The applicant claimed that such measures could have been justified by the necessity to arrest further individuals involved in the offence , but no activity in that respect had been undertaken in his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment . It held that the investigating judge \u2019s orders for the use of special investigative measures had been properly reasoned as required under LAW . With regard to the plea of entrapment , the ORG observed :", "\u201c ... [ The investigating judge ] ordered that the [ special investigative ] measures be implemented DATE and DATE , namely over a period of DATE . The investigating judge \u2019s order ... of DATE shows that the use of [ special investigative ] measures was extended for DATE from DATE to DATE . It is apparent from the order that , in response to an application by ORG , the investigating judge extended the use of [ special investigative ] measures for appropriate reasons . It [ also]probably cause to believe that the accused had uttered counterfeit CARDINAL , which suggested the commission of a serious criminal offence ( currency counterfeiting ) . Taking into account the nature of such an offence and the fact that the use of special investigative measures was producing certain results , there were relevant reasons for extending the use of [ special investigative ] measures under LAW . It can not therefore be said that the conduct of the undercover agents broadened the extent of the criminal activity of the accused .", "It should be noted that it can not be claimed that the use of special investigative measures under LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW can be considered as an incitement to commit a criminal offence . The undercover agent ORG contacted the accused only after the use of special investigative measures had been ordered and there is therefore no unlawfulness in his conduct . Furthermore , the fact that ORG first contacted the accused without telling him the reason for the contact , as was established by the first - instance court from the statement of ORG , and the fact that the first meeting took place DATE ( on DATE ) \u2012 when the undercover agent in PERSON bought MONEY counterfeit note from the accused for the amount of HRK CARDINAL \u2012 can not be considered as an incitement but was a tactical action aimed at gaining the confidence of the accused and further uttering of counterfeit TIME . The fact that the undercover agent succeeded in his task is selfevident , since the accused continued to sell him larger quantities of counterfeit MONEY for real euros until he was arrested . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request for extraordinary review of a final judgment before ORG ( PERSON ) , challenging the findings of ORG . He contended that ORG had failed to provide adequate reasoning for its findings concerning the incitement . Specifically , it had not thoroughly examined the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s first contact with the undercover agent when the first instance of incitement had occurred . Furthermore , ORG had not taken into account the fact that the majority of the contacts with the applicant had been initiated by the undercover agents , and it had not analysed the substance of their discussions , even though they had been duly recorded , as a result of the applicant \u2019s phone having been tapped . In this connection the applicant pointed out relevant parts of the transcript of the phone taps , in particular the part where the undercover agent stated : \u201c Come on , you must definitely come . Do n\u2019t you know , ok , we are serious people ... \u201d ; or where the applicant stated \u201c I will not bring [ it ] and that \u2019s it \u201d , after which the undercover agent started inciting him to a criminal act . The applicant also contended that the investigating judge \u2019s orders for the use of special investigative measures had not been properly reasoned , as required under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for extraordinary review of a final judgment , endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts concerning the applicant \u2019s plea of incitement . It found that there was nothing in the conduct of the undercover agents suggesting incitement . It also considered that there had been sufficient basis for the use of secret surveillance and that the orders of the investigating judge had been issued in accordance with the relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) reiterating the arguments he had presented before the lower courts . He pointed out in particular that the use of special investigative measures had been authorised contrary to the relevant domestic law as the investigating judge \u2019s orders had not been properly reasoned . In his view , this had infringed his right to respect for his private life and the confidentiality of his correspondence guaranteed under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . The applicant also contended that he had been incited to commit an offence by the undercover agents and that the lower courts had not properly examined his plea of entrapment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the decision of ORG concerned neither a determination of his rights and obligations nor a criminal charge against him .", "CARDINAL .
