It seeks to guarantee that recourse is had to a summons by public notice only when the court is satisfied that it is impossible to trace the person who is to be summoned . For the most part , there have been no substantial changes to the provisions . At the material time , the provisions stated that the court had power to seek information from the administrative authorities ... Nothing was stated regarding an alleged duty [ in bold in the original ] which would oblige the court to request such information from specific bodies , in particular those indicated by the [ applicant ] .", "...", "[ LAW ] required the court to be satisfied of the impossibility of tracing the defendant before ordering that he be summoned to appear by public notice ; the court had to be certain[CARDINAL ] of this impossibility and could to this end use those methods that it deemed necessary or appropriate . There was in this no gratuitous act of free will or unfettered discretion ; if a discretionary power was involved , it was limited to the court \u2019s choice of methods to be used or , more particularly , the choice of authorities to be contacted . However , once the court was certain that it was impossible to trace the defendant , the relevant provision obliged it \u2013 and indeed continues to oblige it \u2013 to pursue the proceedings by means of summons by public notice .", "...", "It is necessary to strike a balance between the various principles and interests at stake , particularly those relating to the adversarial principle and the obligatory presence of the defence and those of promptness and legal certainty , which are also protected by LAW .", "...", "Once the court has used all methods , in particular those that are found to be the most appropriate , in order to trace the defendant , and is satisfied [ that it is impossible to trace the defendant ] , it must pursue the proceedings but without allowing them to be prolonged indefinitely on account of long and exhaustive searches or allowing such searches to be repeated at any stage of the proceedings , which would have untoward consequences and might prevent justice being done .", "... \u201d", "Under LAW , in the wording in force at the material time , summons by public notice was ordered when the defendant could not be traced at the address indicated by the plaintiff . Under paragraph CARDINAL of this provision , the court had to be certain of the impossibility of locating the defendant and could , to this end , gather information from the administrative authorities and the police .", "Notices containing basic information about the proceedings in question were to be published in a newspaper . In addition , CARDINAL other notices were to be posted , CARDINAL at the court dealing with the case , CARDINAL on the door of the defendant \u2019s last known residence , and CARDINAL at the town hall of the municipality in which this residence was located . From the expiry of a given period ( DATE in the present case ) , the defendant had DATE in which to file his submissions in reply . Failing this , the proceedings would continue and the defendant would be represented by ORG .", "Article CARDINAL ( f ) of LAW provides for the possibility of requesting that the proceedings be reopened where a party has taken no part in them whatsoever .
