Firstly , he must be convicted of a crime that is punishable by imprisonment . Secondly , he may only be expelled if he is in fact sentenced to a more severe punishment than a fine and if ( CARDINAL ) it may be assumed , on account of the nature of the crime and other circumstances , that he will continue his criminal activities in GPE or ( CARDINAL ) the offence , in view of the damage , danger or violation involved for private or public interests , is so serious that he ought not to be allowed to remain in the country .", "Furthermore , under chapter CARDINAL , section QUANTITY , when considering whether or not an alien should be expelled , the court shall take into account his links to NORP society . In so doing , the court shall pay particular attention to the living conditions and family circumstances of the alien and the length of time he has resided in GPE . There must be a reasonable proportionality between the offence and the resulting consequences , and the stronger the links are between the alien and GPE the more serious the offence must be in order to justify his expulsion . Thus , an alien who has been a holder of a permanent residence permit for DATE when proceedings are initiated against him , or who at that time has been residing in GPE for DATE , may not be expelled unless there are exceptional reasons for his expulsion . As regards aliens who are considered to be refugees , special rules apply ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
