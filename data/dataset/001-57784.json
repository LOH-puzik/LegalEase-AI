In addition , the GPE police and the special drugs unit decided that a sworn officer of ORG should pass himself off as a potential purchaser of the cocaine , under the assumed name of PERSON . They acted with the authorisation of cantonal police headquarters , and notified the investigating judge at ORG of their plan .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , PERSON had attended a course on CARDINAL and DATE intended for cantonal officials with responsibility for the fight against drug trafficking , with the aim of drawing their attention to the limits to which their undercover activities were subject and the relevant provisions of the law . Shortly before acting in the present case , PERSON was reminded at a meeting with his superior officers of the limits beyond which he was not to go .", "CARDINAL . The applicant met PERSON on DATE , CARDINAL May and CARDINAL and DATE , on the latter \u2019s initiative on each occasion , as the applicant did not know his real identity , address or telephone number .", "CARDINAL . He was arrested on DATE and charged with unlawful trafficking in drugs . The investigating judge at ORG terminated the telephone interception on DATE . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE he informed the applicant that he had ordered telephone interception and that it had lasted from DATE to DATE .", "According to PERSON \u2019s reports , Mr L\u00fcdi had promised to sell him , as intermediary , QUANTITY of cocaine worth MONEY , and had borrowed MONEY from a third person for the purchase of cocaine or other narcotics .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police searched the applicant \u2019s home and found traces of cocaine and hashish on a number of objects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge at ORG ordered the applicant to be released on the ground that he had made \" extensive admissions as to the essential parts of the investigation [ and that ] there [ was ] consequently no longer any risk of collusion or flight \" .", "The GPE police , relying on the results of the preliminary investigation , filed a criminal complaint on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of CARDINAL offences against LAW and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . In order to preserve the anonymity of the undercover agent , the court declined to call him as a prosecution witness ; it considered that the records of the telephone interception and the undercover agent \u2019s reports showed clearly that , even without the agent \u2019s intervention , Mr L\u00fcdi had had the intention of acting as an intermediary in the supply of large quantities of narcotics .", "CARDINAL . Mr L\u00fcdi appealed against his conviction for CARDINAL of the CARDINAL offences , the attempted supply of cocaine to PERSON and the attempted purchase of cocaine or another drug by means of the loan he had arranged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) confirmed the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG did not call the undercover agent either .", "The court found that the evidence adduced before the trial court had in essence corroborated the content of PERSON \u2019s report , in particular with regard to the general course of events . This had clearly shown that the applicant - as had not been disputed by him - had made great efforts in order to supply PERSON with QUANTITY of cocaine , had contacted PERSON and then PERSON , travelled to GPE and GPE , and arranged meetings between PERSON and a possible supplier . After initially minimising things , he had eventually decided to admit all these facts , which also followed partly from the interception of his telephone conversations and the statements of PERSON It had to be regarded as established that Mr L\u00fcdi had been the first to speak to S. about purchasing cocaine ; besides , PERSON had confirmed this , although he had toned down his original statements on this point to some extent .", "The court then dealt with the applicant \u2019s argument that LAW subsection CARDINAL of LAW did not apply to PERSON \u2019s actions . The court said that the mere fact that the applicant had planned a significant deal in cocaine before his first contact with the undercover agent brought him within section CARDINAL of that PERSON .", "Finally , the detailed reports of the telephone interception showed very clearly that Mr L\u00fcdi had persistently ( beharrlich ) and on his own initiative attempted to carry out a drugs deal , and that he had for this purpose intended to bring PERSON in as the \" banker \" , as he himself did not have the required funds .", "CARDINAL . Mr L\u00fcdi then brought a public law appeal and an application for a declaration of nullity to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . He alleged in the former that there had been an interference with his right to respect for his private life , which had not been compatible with LAW article CARDINAL) of the Convention . He argued firstly that the monitoring of his telephone conversations had not been \" in accordance with the law \" and had not been justified under paragraph CARDINAL , as he had been suspected merely of having had the intention of committing an offence . Secondly , he complained of the intervention of an undercover agent , which he alleged had been intended to incite him to take part in drug trafficking . He further claimed that the telephone interception could not be used in evidence and that the mere reading of the agent \u2019s reports , without the agent being called as a witness , had prejudiced the exercise of the rights of the defence , in breach of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the public law appeal , for the following reasons :", "\" ...", "( a ) The public law appeal raises CARDINAL objections to the ordering of the telephone surveillance . Firstly , it is argued that at the stage of \u2018 generally investigative police enquiries\u2019 telephone interception was ordered for which there was no statutory provision at that stage ; a preliminary investigation was started only for the sake of appearances . Secondly , the appellant complains that NORP criminal procedure law permits of no preventive telephone surveillance and that the present case did not concern an investigation into an offence which had been committed , but the ascertainment of offences which were about to happen .", "( b ) Under LAW ( StrV ) an investigating judge can order surveillance of a suspect \u2019s postal , telephone and telegraph communications \u2018 if an offence whose seriousness or particular features justify the interference or an offence committed by means of the telephone is being investigated\u2019 . It is not disputed that in the present case the telephone surveillance was ordered by the competent authority and the procedural rules in LAW StrV were complied with . That telephone surveillance in the initial stage of inquiries is excluded by cantonal law does not follow from LAW , nor has it been demonstrated by the appellant . Depending on the circumstances , telephone interception is often appropriate precisely at the beginning of an investigation . From this point of view there is no indication whatever that the order complained of could have infringed the LAW or that it was made under an arbitrary interpretation of cantonal law .", "( c ) There is no need to examine here whether under the wording of Article PERSON StrV telephone surveillance and the other measures regulated thereby are to be strictly confined to investigations of offences already committed , excluding the possibility of preventive surveillance where there is a strong suspicion that offences are about to be committed . Under the sixth paragraph of section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL of LAW ( Bet\u00e4ubungsmittelgesetz ) a person who takes steps in order to participate in some manner in dealing with drugs , transporting or storing them has already committed an offence . By DATE conduct as reported from GPE , namely his search for finance for a cocaine deal , he had already taken steps as defined above , so that , that being the case , the elements of an offence were already present , and the telephone surveillance ordered related not only to the discovery of planned crimes but also to the investigation of offences which had already been committed .", "Moreover , it would not be untenable to interpret LAW by analogy as a legal basis for preventive measures too , where the interference is justified by the seriousness or particular features of the offence which is anticipated . The telephone surveillance ordered in this case on a basis of serious suspicion of a crime was certainly not an abuse of the law .", "CARDINAL . ( a ) The use of so - called undercover agents is not expressly provided for in NORP criminal procedure law , but the dominant opinion is that it is permissible in principle , in so far as the particular nature of the offences is capable of justifying the covert investigative acts and the undercover agent investigates the criminal activity in a predominantly passive manner without using his own influence to arouse willingness to commit the act and induce criminal conduct ... The federal legislature has in section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL of LAW expressly taken into account the possibility of using an undercover agent in criminal investigations in the field of drug trafficking .", "( b ) In the ... public law appeal the permissibility of covert investigation in terms of the rule of law is not denied in general and as a matter of principle , but the view is taken that the use of an undercover agent represents a serious interference with the private life and personal freedom of the person concerned and such an interference is possible in a ORG subject to the rule of law only if founded on a sufficiently precise legal basis ...", "Such a requirement of a legal basis for the use of undercover agents has not been discussed as yet in NORP case - law and legal writing , nor expressly acknowledged as a restraint from the point of view of the rule of law . This would be a continuation and extension of the legislature \u2019s reasons underlying the requirement for statutory regulation of telephone interception and similar investigative measures . While coercive measures in the course of criminal procedure ( such as arrest , house searches , etc . ) clearly interfere against the will of the person concerned with legally protected rights , and surveillance of telephone , postal and telegraph communications without the knowledge of the person concerned interferes in the interests of prosecuting crime with areas of confidentiality which are protected by law , the use of undercover agents is problematic at a somewhat different level : the personal freedom of the person concerned is not restricted , nor does he have to tolerate any other coercive measures , but he comes into contact with a partner who is unknown to him , but with whom he would not have dealings if he knew that he was working for criminal investigation . Where the undercover agent by means of his contacts merely ascertains criminal conduct which would have taken place in the same or similar fashion even without his intervention , the use of an undercover agent is no doubt unobjectionable . On the other hand , it would not be permissible if the undercover agent were to take the initiative , as it were , and provoke criminal activity which would otherwise not have come about at all ; for the prosecuting authorities must not provoke criminality in order to be able to prosecute criminals whose readiness to commit crime , possibly present but latent , would otherwise not have become manifest . If the undercover agent fosters the criminality of the person concerned without it being possible to regard him directly as initiating or inciting , but nevertheless in such a way that it must be assumed that the criminal act would have been of lesser extent and seriousness without the \u2018 participation\u2019 of the undercover agent , this is to be taken into account when passing sentence .", "ORG investigation does not encroach on a basic right protected by LAW ( or LAW ) . The person concerned is free as regards his decisions and his behaviour towards the undercover agent ; he is , however , deceived as to the identity of his negotiating partner and the latter \u2019s connection with the police . A criminal is not protected by constitutional law against being observed in the course of his illegal conduct by a police officer who is not recognisable to him as such . Nor can any protection of a criminal against covert investigation be derived from LAW ( Article CARDINAL) ( article CARDINAL) . Whether the investigative methods of undercover agents should because of certain risks of abuse be statutorily regulated , and whether a statutory rule would be likely to counteract any abuses better than is currently done by case - law , is for the legislature to decide . According to current constitutional law and statute law , the use of an undercover agent is permissible within the bounds set by the general principles of the rule of law , without it requiring an express statutory basis . There are other investigative measures too - as for example the constant surveillance of a suspect - which may seriously affect private life and lead to findings which are unwelcome for the person concerned , without it ever having been thought necessary for there to be a statutory basis for such measures .", "( c ) If , therefore , as the law stands there is no requirement of a statutory basis for the use of undercover agents , it is not necessary to examine whether section CARDINAL subsection CARDINAL of LAW could be regarded as a sufficient statutory basis in the absence of a corresponding provision in cantonal procedural law . The wording of the subsection shows that it is not an enabling provision of criminal procedure , but a rule of substantive law on the question , which need not be discussed here , as to the circumstances under which acts by an undercover agent which are objectively the elements of an offence are not liable to punishment .", "CARDINAL . The activity of undercover agent \u2018 Toni\u2019 did not go beyond the bounds , described above , of covert investigation acceptable in a ORG governed by the rule of law :", "( a ) The investigation of suspected drug offences is often , because of the nature of such offences , possible only by an undercover agent . It is precisely in this sphere that this method proves to be necessary and effective ... Once a report had been received of a definite suspicion that the appellant wished to carry out a substantial cocaine deal , it was not disproportionate to use a police officer to pose as a buyer . This did not involve an arbitrary interpretation of cantonal procedural law , nor was there a breach of a basic right or a human right protected by LAW .", "( b ) On the basis of the statements made by the various parties , and assessing the evidence in a reasonable and non - arbitrary fashion , the court below found that L\u00fcdi first mentioned a cocaine deal to ORG and then spontaneously offered \u2018 stuff\u2019 to the interested party \u2018 Toni\u2019 as well . Although subsequently it was always \u2018 Toni\u2019 who contacted PERSON to find out how things were progressing , it does not follow from this that the appellant did not commit an offence . L\u00fcdi of his own accord got in touch with possible suppliers and also tried to find money for drug dealing elsewhere . As he had no telephone number for \u2018 Toni\u2019 , he necessarily had to wait for him to ring him . The essential point is that \u2018 Toni\u2019 did not act as the instigator , but by posing as a buyer merely made it possible to investigate the appellant \u2019s activities , which were aimed at a substantial deal in cocaine .", "CARDINAL . The appeal argues at great length that no account may be taken directly or indirectly of the statements of undercover agent \u2018 Toni\u2019 , for the further reason that he was not summoned and heard as a witness ... . If it is recognised that the use of undercover agents is justified in the public interest in fighting as effectively as possible against drug dealing , it follows that the identity and the investigative methods of such agents are not lightly to be given away in criminal proceedings ; for their continued use would thereby effectively be made largely impossible . Preserving the secrecy of undercover agents does not in itself infringe principles of criminal procedure or constitutional rights . It is a matter for the court assessing the evidence to decide what weight can be attached in a particular case to the written statements of an undercover agent who has not appeared before the court , where there are legally relevant facts which are in dispute . The allegations that the appellant carried out preparatory actions which constituted criminal offences have been substantiated by the result of the telephone interception , the appellant \u2019s own statements and those of the other persons involved . If the court below attributed to the undercover agent a somewhat less active role than that alleged by the appellant in his account of the facts , that was not arbitrary but was based on a tenable assessment of the evidence .", "... \"", "( GPE de droit international , DATE , pp .
