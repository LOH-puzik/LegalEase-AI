The applicant , a NORP national , had been a retail butcher in PERSON since DATE . He died on DATE , but DATE his widow and CARDINAL daughters advised the Commission that they considered themselves to have a material and moral interest in seeing completed the proceedings he had instituted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , his shop , where he employed several persons , was the subject of a visit by Mr. PERSON , an official in ORG . This official found an infringement of LAW of DATE \" fixing the selling price to the consumer of beef and pig meat \" ( \" the Decree of CARDINAL DATE \" ) , in that Mr. PERSON had not reduced his prices of pork by MONEY as required by LAW . CARDINAL and his \" retail margin \" for that meat was CARDINAL BF in excess of the maximum - CARDINAL BF per kilogram - permitted under LAW . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "When questioned in this connection , the applicant made the following statement , according to the report drawn up DATE by the inspector ( translation from the NORP original ) :", "\" ...", "As is shown by the price - markings recorded by you , for beef I have applied the reduction provided for in the Ministerial Decree of CARDINAL DATE and my margin is CARDINAL F.", "As concerns pig meat , I have not applied the reduction and my margin is in excess of CARDINAL F.", "This is because my calculations were for category CARDINAL pig meat instead of category CARDINAL pig meat . This was a mistake on my part . I acted in good faith and , in your presence , I immediately reduced the prices in order not to exceed the margin of CARDINAL F. \"", "He added the following note , signed , like the report , by Mr. PERSON and himself :", "\" ... I buy my meat on the hoof and ... the costs listed below were not included by you in your calculations :", "( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL F commission per live kg ;", "( CARDINAL ) transport costs of CARDINAL F per animal , that is QUANTITY ;", "( CARDINAL ) slaughter costs : CARDINAL F per animal ;", "( CARDINAL ) slaughter tax : CARDINAL per animal ;", "( CARDINAL ) transport costs for each carcase : CARDINAL F per animal . \"", "The inspector did not supply a copy of the report to Mr. PERSON . He set out the foregoing facts in a formal statement , known as a \" pro - justitia \" , dated DATE ; ORG transmitted this formal statement on DATE to the procureur du Roi attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the PERSON procureur du PERSON ordered the provisional closure of the applicant \u2019s shop within TIME from notification of the decision . The decision cited the gravity of the facts , whilst noting that there was no need to request a sentence of imprisonment ; it referred to the interview report of DATE and to sections CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE to CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of ORG and Prices Act of DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) . The closure was to come to an end either on DATE after the payment of a sum of CARDINAL BF by way of friendly settlement ( minnelijke schikking ) or , at the latest , on the date on which judgment was passed on the offence ; Mr. PERSON had DATE in which to indicate whether he accepted the offer of settlement .", "DATE the procureur du PERSON wrote Mr. PERSON the following letter ( translation from the NORP original ) :", "\" ...", "You are hereby informed of the decision provisionally closing your business in pursuance of LAW par . CARDINAL of the LAW of DATE . Your attention is particularly drawn to the heavy penalties imposed by the LAW for failure to comply with this decision .", "The amount of the friendly settlement proposed is fixed at CARDINAL F.", "I should be obliged if , within DATE , you would transfer this sum to ORG Account no . ... and advise me whether you accept the offer of settlement .", "The closure of your business will be terminated DATE after you make the required payment .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a deputy superintendent of police delivered this letter to the applicant together with a copy of the decision to which it referred . Mr. PERSON replied on DATE by registered letter in the following terms ( translation from the NORP original ) :", "\" Dear Sir ,", "...", "Kindly note that I am DATE paying the sum proposed in your letter of CARDINAL DATE by way of friendly settlement ; consequently , the criminal proceedings become barred once and for all ( section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL of the Act of DATE ) and the closure of my establishment will no longer be put into effect .", "Kindly note , however , that I reserve all my rights to take action against ORG before the civil courts , in particular for the restitution of this sum plus damages .", "In point of fact :", "- I have not as yet received any copy of the report which is the basis of the penalties imposed in my respect ;", "- as far as I can recollect , the findings of those drawing up the report did not take account of the factors which are essential for calculating the prices ;", "- an application for a declaration of annulment of the Decree of CARDINAL DATE will be lodged before the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat which has already annulled CARDINAL similar Decrees ( see the judgment of DATE ) ;", "- a closure can only come into effect TIME after notification of the conviction ( section QUANTITY par . CARDINAL of the LAW refers to section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL which speaks exclusively of convictions ) .", "I have therefore paid the amount of the friendly settlement for the sole purpose of limiting the damage suffered by me ; for the prejudice resulting from the closure of my establishment as from DATE until the eventual hearing of the case before the criminal court might be far in excess of CARDINAL F and the civil court might then draw certain conclusions from the fact I had not mitigated my loss .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . Following this payment , which had in fact already been made on DATE , the applicant did not have his shop closed . He did not bring any action before the civil courts for restitution of money paid over without cause and for damages ; nor did he apply to the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat for a declaration of annulment of LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time , ORG intervention in the sphere of prices was governed in GPE by ORG and LAW ( \" LAW \" ) . LAW derived from LAW of DATE \" on repression of offences against rules relating to the country \u2019s supplies \" , as several times amended , in the last instance by an Act of DATE which had modified the original title .", "Section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE , read in conjunction with section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , empowered the Minister responsible for economic affairs to fix by Decree , for the whole or part of the territory of the GPE , price - ceilings to be respected in transactions of sale , offer for sale or purchase of products , materials , foodstuffs , goods or animals , as well as the maximum profit to be made by any vendor or intermediary .", "The investigation and the finding of offences against LAW were normally the responsibility of officials from ORG , acting on behalf of the Minister , and formed the subject of reports which were transmitted to the procureur du Roi ; these reports were deemed to be conclusive until production of proof to the contrary ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In addition to imprisonment of DATE to DATE and a fine of CARDINAL BF ( section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL ) , offenders were liable to various criminal and administrative sanctions ( sections CARDINAL par . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL par . CARDINAL to CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE bis ) . CARDINAL of the most serious of these sanctions was closure of the offender \u2019s business , which took CARDINAL forms :", "( a ) Under LAW par . CARDINAL , the Minister could direct closure on a provisional basis , for DATE at the most , in the event of refusal to comply with the instructions given by officials empowered by him ; an appeal having suspensive effect was available to the person concerned before the judge in chambers at ORG with jurisdiction in criminal matters .", "( b ) Section CARDINAL , second paragraph , allowed the Minister , even in the absence of any offence , also to close establishments whose activity he considered useless or harmful .", "( c ) Section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL enabled the courts to order closure for a period not exceeding DATE , without prejudice to any penalty of imprisonment , fine or forfeiture ( section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) .", "( d ) In the instant case , the closure decision was taken by the procureur du Roi . It was based on LAW par . CARDINAL according to which :", "\" The procureur du Roi or , where preliminary investigations have been instituted , the investigating judge may order the provisional closure of the offender \u2019s establishment . The closure may not continue beyond the date on which judgment is passed on the offence .", "... \"", "The CARDINAL/CARDINAL Act did not provide for any appeal against such a decision to which , according to LAW par . CARDINAL in fine , section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL ( b ) applied . This latter section read as follows :", "\" The closure ... shall come into effect TIME after notification of the conviction . If the decision of closure is contravened , the procureur du Roi shall take all appropriate action in order to secure compliance therewith , in particular by affixing seals ... , and the offender shall be liable to imprisonment of DATE and to a fine \"", "which , in DATE , was fixed at the amount of QUANTITY BF .", "CARDINAL . Whereas the first CARDINAL forms of closure had apparently not been used for DATE , the same was not true of the fourth form . Provisional closure of that type was ordered in the context of judicial proceedings already instituted or imminent and could thus precede a sentence of closure imposed by a court of law in pursuance of section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL . However , according to decided case - law , provisional closure constituted an administrative measure differing in character from and incapable of being offset against any such sentence ; it was not entered on the judicial records ( casier judiciaire ) or on the information extracts ( bulletins de renseignements ) and lists of convictions issued by the municipal authorities .", "CARDINAL . When he did not consider it necessary to seek a sentence of imprisonment and if proceedings for the offence had not yet been instituted before the trial court , the procureur du Roi could , under LAW par . CARDINAL , inform the offender by registered letter that it was open to him to avoid prosecution by effecting CARDINAL or more payments or services ( \" prestations \" ) . LAW listed CARDINAL such payments or services from which the procureur du Roi made his choice . The first consisted of paying over a certain sum of money which might , if appropriate , be greater than the maximum fine fixed by the LAW . The procureur du Roi called on the person concerned to advise him within a given period whether he accepted the settlement proposed ; full and punctual performance of the settlement barred criminal proceedings .", "Although often referred to as a fine by way of settlement , the payment thus made was not regarded in NORP law as a penalty . Consequently , the payment could not be taken into consideration when dealing with further offences and was not entered on the judicial records . It was nevertheless notified to the municipal authorities of the person \u2019s place of residence ; until DATE had expired , mention of it was included in the information extracts the municipalities supplied to the judicial authorities but not in the lists of convictions intended for other authorities . In that respect , settlements negotiated in accordance with LAW par . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL Act resembled those provided for under , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL and CARDINAL to QUANTITY of LAW .", "With the possible exception of CARDINAL or a few instances dating back to DATE , the closure orders issued by a procureur du Roi in pursuance of paragraph CARDINAL of LAW of LAW were always accompanied by an offer of settlement made in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL . Such was the case in CARDINAL decisions - including the CARDINAL affecting the applicant - taken in DATE with regard to butchers in the district of PERSON . On the other hand , the converse situation - an offer of settlement without there being any closure order - was a frequent occurrence .", "CARDINAL . Again , under the terms of LAW bis , a provision not applied in Mr. PERSON \u2019s case , the officials specially empowered for these purposes by the Minister could , on finding an offence , fix a sum whose voluntary payment by the offender likewise barred criminal proceedings . In such cases , the settlement was not even entered on the information extracts issued by the municipal authorities .", "CARDINAL . Since the period under consideration , section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL of LAW has been amended in CARDINAL respect by section CARDINAL of ORG of DATE , but each of the clauses quoted or summarised above , including in particular LAW , was left unchanged .", "CARDINAL . The offence established in the instant case by ORG General related to LAW DATE \" fixing the selling price to the consumer of beef and pig meat \" ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . This Decree , which was passed pursuant to LAW , came into force on DATE ; it was intended , like numerous other Decrees preceding it , to restrain rises in the cost of products constituting a major item in the consumer \u2019s budget and in the computation of the official price - index .", "Article CARDINAL dealt with pig meat . Paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL required retailers in business before DATE - such as the applicant - not to charge in excess of the prices prevailing during DATE of DATE as increased by MONEY . Paragraph CARDINAL specified that until DATE the selling prices to the consumer , inclusive of value - added tax , charged in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL , had to be marked down by MONEY . The combined effect of these CARDINAL paragraphs was to produce a price reduction of MONEY as compared with the levels current in DATE .", "Article CARDINAL , however , contained a proviso . Under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , retailers able to show that they were not obtaining a retail margin of CARDINAL BF per kilogram were , subject to not exceeding that margin , allowed to charge prices other than those following from LAW . LAW indicated what was to be understood by \" retail margin \" , namely the difference between \" the weighted average selling price not inclusive of value - added tax \" and \" the weighted average purchase price \" , these CARDINAL prices being in their turn defined in paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL did not include any provisions regarding those butchers - a minority of the order of MONEY - who , like Mr. PERSON , purchased their meat on the hoof .", "Under LAW , offences against LAW DATE were to be investigated , established , prosecuted and punished in accordance with the provisions of Parts II and III of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL Act . Section II , which was applied in Mr. PERSON \u2019s case , appeared in Part III of the latter Act .", "CARDINAL . The criminal prosecutions launched for failure to comply with the Decree of CARDINAL DATE resulted , in numerous cases , in acquittals . For the most part , the relevant courts gave as the ground for their verdict the illegality of the Decree ; in so doing they were acting in pursuance of LAW which states : \" The courts and tribunals shall not apply any general , provincial or local decrees and regulations save insofar as they are in accordance with the law . \" In the early stages , the prosecuting authorities entered appeals which , however , failed ; eventually they abandoned any attempt at appeal .", "Certain courts adopted another solution : faced with the accused pleading the incompatibility of the Decree with Community law , they requested ORG of ORG to give a preliminary ruling pursuant to LAW establishing ORG ; for reasons that were the subject of dispute before the Commission , ORG did not have the occasion to deliver any ruling .", "CARDINAL . In a case brought before it on DATE by a retail butcher and pork - butcher , the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat declared the Decree of CARDINAL DATE to be contrary to the principle of the equality of all NORP before the law ( LAW ) : the appreciable distinction drawn between retain according to the period of their establishment in business did not appear to the ORG d\u2019\u00c9tat to be justified either by any technical necessity or by imperative considerations of general economic interest . It accordingly annulled the Decree on DATE ( ORG v. ORG ) .", "CARDINAL earlier Decrees of a similar kind , dating back to DATE and DATE , had suffered the same fate on DATE ( ORG and ORG v. ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . After being amended on DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the Decree of CARDINAL DATE was repealed on DATE . The Decree which replaced it on the latter date , and which came into force on DATE , contained - as did the Decrees of DATE and CARDINAL DATE specific clauses relating to retailers who purchased their meat on the hoof ( LAW . CARDINAL , last sub - paragraph ) . LAW DATE was the subject of a request for a preliminary ruling submitted by ORG ; ORG of ORG gave its decision on the request on DATE ( Procureur du Roi v.
