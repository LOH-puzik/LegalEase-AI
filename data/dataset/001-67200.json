The applicants petitioned ORG against conviction and sentence . By letters dated DATE and DATE , their representatives were informed of the decisions ( taken by ORG ) to reject their petitions .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants applied to the single judge of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) for leave to appeal to that court against conviction and sentence . The first applicant pointed to various alleged failings by the judge advocate during the court - martial and argued that his sentence was excessive . The single judge granted leave to appeal to the full ORG . Before the full ORG , the first applicant added a new ground of appeal ( that he did not have a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of LAW , citing PERSON GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and ORG ) . The second applicant argued before the single judge that the judge advocate had erred and misdirected the court and that he had been denied a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal ( referring also to the PERSON judgment ) . The single judge granted leave to appeal to the full ORG .", "CARDINAL .

NORP In response to these appeals , affidavits were filed on behalf of ORG explaining that neither the presidents nor the members of the applicants ' courts - martial had been under the command of the convening officer and that none had been subordinate to him in the chain of command . Accordingly , the convening officer would not have reported on either the president or the members of the court - martial in their DATE confidential reports . A policy decision had been taken that , as from DATE , all courts - martial would be composed of a president and members who were not in the chain of command of the convening officer .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' appeals were rejected by detailed judgment of CARDINAL DATE . As to the \u201c GPE point \u201d , the ORG noted the change in policy as regards the constitution of courts - martial in place since DATE . It considered that there was no chain of command influence and no obvious reason why any observer knowing the constitution of the courts - martial and the full facts would suspect any lack of independence or impartiality . In any event , the ORG pointed out that the applicants ' reliance on the PERSON judgment was misconceived as the only power of the ORG was to enquire as to whether the convictions were unsafe . Where there was abundant evidence to support the conclusion of the courts - martial which had been properly convened in accordance with domestic law , the composition and behaviour of which had not been criticised , the ORG considered that there was no possible reason to intervene . It noted that the time for having regard to the provisions of the Convention had not yet been reached , but it was difficult to see , even in such circumstances , how the provisions of LAW be of any assistance to the applicants .", "CARDINAL .

DATE , Commission 's report of DATE ) , it was decided that , as and from DATE , all courts - martial would be composed of presidents and members not in the chain of command of the convening officer . Thereafter , the DATE Act was amended substantially by LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) which came into force on DATE . The new court - martial system for which the DATE Act provides is summarised in the GPE judgment ( at \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and is outlined in more detail in the case of ORG v.
