The applicants , PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) , born in DATE , and her son PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) , born in DATE , are NORP nationals . The President granted the ORG request for their identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . They were represented before the ORG by Ms S. Motz , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant fled her home country , travelling via GPE and GPE , from where she reached the island of GPE in GPE where she claimed asylum on DATE . She was assigned to a centre for asylum - seekers in GPE , GPE . After DATE there , she was recognised as a refugee . However , she was no longer entitled to stay in the asylum centre . She therefore went to GPE where her boyfriend , who had fled with her from GPE and had also been recognised as a refugee , was living . It was very difficult for the first applicant to find a place to stay and she slept in a train station in GPE and later in a squat for refugees called \u201c FAC \u201d . She claimed that the situation in that squat had been especially difficult for women . Her boyfriend had not been allowed to stay with her and she therefore had lived under the constant threat of sexual attacks from other men living there . Without knowledge of the NORP language it was furthermore impossible for her to find a job . She received food from soup kitchens run by ORG in GPE . The first applicant and her boyfriend also approached PERSON in FAC DATE , the communal accommodation office for homeless people in GPE ( \u201c the immigration office \u201d ) . The immigration office put them on a waiting list . DATE , on DATE , the first applicant was allocated a sleeping place but she was somehow not informed of this . The applicant remained in FAC for DATE . She became pregnant with the second applicant and her boyfriend left her . Owing to the unbearable living conditions in GPE she decided , when she was DATE pregnant , to apply for asylum in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she applied for asylum in GPE . On DATE she gave birth to her son , the second applicant . By a decision of DATE ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) dismissed her asylum request based on her having been granted refugee status in GPE . In DATE both applicants were removed to GPE .", "CARDINAL . During the ORG second stay in GPE , they were informed by the immigration office in GPE that they could not be provided with housing immediately , but that they would be put on a waiting list . The first applicant approached private organisations to obtain housing , without success . As she was even unable to find a place for her and her son to sleep in one of the squats in GPE , both applicants ended up sleeping in the streets and in the main train station with other homeless people . With the remainder of the money the first applicant had received from the NORP authorities she decided to travel , together with the second applicant , to GPE to apply for asylum there . She sought to claim asylum there in DATE and her asylum request was registered on DATE . CARDINAL DATE it was dismissed and in DATE they were removed from GPE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In GPE the first applicant unsuccessfully approached on several occasions the immigration office in GPE as well as private organisations in order to obtain accommodation . In relation to a residence document for her son , the immigration office informed her that she should return to Crotone since she had been registered there and the authorities there were responsible for her . In DATE the applicant therefore travelled to Crotone in order to register her son and to seek accommodation for them . The authorities there however informed her that there was no organisation which could assist her and that she should return to GPE . Upon her return to GPE , the immigration office eventually registered her on the waiting list on DATE . Since no accommodation in GPE was available , the applicants had to return to ORG . The living conditions in that squat were unacceptable , especially for a child . Owing to the precarious sanitary conditions and the lack of adequate nutrition , the second applicant suffered serious dental problems . As the first applicant could furthermore not pay the required fees for staying in FAC , she was repeatedly asked to leave the place .", "CARDINAL . Out of despair and in order to avoid sleeping in the streets of GPE in wintertime with a little child , the first applicant decided to travel to GPE again . She applied a second time for asylum in GPE on DATE . According to the immigration office in GPE , the applicants would have received a place to stay in DATE , but at this point they had already gone to GPE . On DATE the ORG dismissed the ORG request on the basis that the applicants could avail themselves of the protection of a safe third country , namely GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a qualified application for review with the ORG . The applicants claimed that the ORG had failed to take into account the various indications that the applicants had to live in inhuman conditions in GPE . By decision of QUANTITY DATE the ORG dismissed their request ruling that GPE was under an obligation under LAW to provide the applicants with accommodation and financial support . In addition , private aid organisations could also assist the applicants . The LAW also held that the removal to GPE would not violate the rights of the child under LAW on the Rights of the Child .", "CARDINAL . Upon appeal , ORG ( \u201c the FAC \u201d ) granted the applicants interim measures on DATE in order to await the outcome of the proceedings in GPE . By a decision of DATE the ORG dismissed the ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . With regard to a possible breach of LAW , the FAC established that based on the facts of the case no particular risk of illtreatment in GPE could be identified . GPE had signed all the relevant international human - rights treaties which it was obliged to respect and was bound to LAW , which provides that recognised refugees should in principle be treated like nationals regarding social assistance and health care . The FAC found that some structural deficits for refugees in GPE existed , primarily in the regions of GPE , GPE and GPE as well as in GPE and GPE . Based on the facts of the case , the FAC had no doubts that the situation for refugees and asylum - seekers in GPE was unbearable and that they were not provided with basic social assistance . Furthermore , it accepted that there was a considerable risk if returned to GPE , the applicants would be obliged to live in the streets again . Since the immigration office in GPE had already offered the applicants a place to stay in the past , it could be expected that they would also be offered CARDINAL in the future , however not immediately . Therefore , the FAC considered the risk of the applicants\u2019 living in the streets of GPE upon their return there to be considerable . However , the situation for refugees was not as bad in other regions of GPE as in GPE . As recognised refugees , the applicants had the possibility to settle in another region of GPE where the living conditions were presumably better . In this regard the FAC held that it was not comprehensible why the first applicant , who had been able to seek refuge in GPE and GPE , had not travelled to another region of GPE , in particular to the LOC , in order to look for housing there . It found that it was feasible to expect the applicants to seek and find housing in another region of GPE , as , for example , provided by ORG in GPE ( ORG ) , in GPE ( ORG of ORG ) , in GPE ( GPE polifunzionale PERSON di GPE ) as well as in different places in GPE . The ORG stated that it was more likely than not that the applicants would be able to find adequate accommodation there and would be able to live with dignity . Therefore , they were not at risk of ill - treatment if returned to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Following this ruling , ORG ( Schweizerische Fl\u00fcchtlingshilfe ) , a NORP non - governmental organisation ( \u201c NGO \u201d ) , contacted on behalf of the applicants the mentioned organisations in GPE , GPE , GPE and PERSON in order to enquire whether the applicants could be accommodated there . ORG was however informed that none of the organisations would be able to accommodate the applicants as they firstly needed to have their official residence in that municipality and secondly there were no resources for a single mother with her child . As there were very long waiting lists , it was impossible to tell how long it would take to obtain a place . In addition , the fact that the applicants had been registered in Crotone made it even more difficult for them to relocate elsewhere despite the fact that the situation in GPE was well - known for being inadequate for single mothers with children . It was also possible that the mother and the child would be separated since social services only had obligations towards the child but not towards the mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicants submitted a letter written by the teacher of the second applicant about his integration in GPE . The applicants also repeated their complaints .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW of DATE , as in force at the relevant time , read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . ORG shall identify states in which on the basis of its findings :", "a. States of origin or provenance which are safe , that is to say those in which the applicant runs no risk of persecution ;", "b. safe third countries , that is to say those in which it considers that the principle of non - refoulement , within the meaning of section ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) , is actually observed .", "CARDINAL .
