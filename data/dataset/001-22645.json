SPAIN", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE and live at ORG dels PERSON ( GPE ) . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are NORP and members of ORG in GPE , which is on the official register of religious institutions kept by ORG , and a member of ORG ( FEREDE ) .", "In their income - tax returns for DATE , the applicants were given a choice between allocating part of their income tax to financial support for ORG or for other charitable purposes .", "Since it was not legally possible for them to allot part of their income tax to financial support for their own ORG , the applicants used a remedy afforded by PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on ORG of LAW Person and lodged an administrative appeal with the GPE High of ORG challenging the PERSON on the State Budget DATE on the ground that it contravened Articles CARDINAL ( principle of equality ) and CARDINAL ( right to freedom of conscience and religion ) of the LAW . In their appeal , they sought a declaration that the system implemented through the income - tax returns for DATE was invalid , as it denied them a right enjoyed by NORP of the NORP faith .", "ORG dismissed that appeal in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , notably on the following grounds :", "\u201c CARDINAL : The issue to be resolved in the present appeal ultimately amounts to deciding whether or not the difference in tax treatment complained of is based on unjustified discrimination prohibited by the LAW that invalidates the impugned acts ...", "CARDINAL : As ORG has said many times , a finding of discrimination contrary to the principle of equality will be made only if in normative cases that are identical in substance a difference in legal treatment has no objective or reasonable justification , since it lacks a rational basis ...", "CARDINAL : In the present case , the ORG finds no violation of the principle of equality as , in accordance with LAW , any fiscal privilege concerning ORG taxes must be provided for by statute . In the instant case , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Institutional Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE on ORG , which implements the said LAW , makes legal recognition of tax privileges laid down by general legislation in favour of non - profit making associations and other charitable bodies conditional on entry into agreements or conventions that must not only abide by the principle of equality but also , by virtue of sub - paragraph CARDINAL of that Article , take religious beliefs existing in NORP society into account . That provision complies with the content of LAW .", "However , in practice the situation of ORG , which has entered into a subsisting convention with the NORP State and has the largest number of practising members and responsibility for a vast historical and cultural heritage , is different to that of ORG , which has no convention or cooperation agreement with the NORP ORG and does not satisfy the other condition .", "Naturally , under no circumstances should that be taken to mean that this ORG entertains any doubts as to the constitutionality of any agreement implementing the right sought by the appellants and , while it is not for this ORG to decide issues that are within the sole discretion of the legislature , it is obvious that it would be more consistent with the principle of religious freedom and equality for such a right to be made available ...", "CARDINAL : As to the alleged violation of the right not to reveal one \u2019s religious convictions , it is obvious that there has been no such violation in the instant case as no declaration was made in the impugned document . Furthermore , the fact that tax is allocated to the NORP faith , which in any event will in principle only be the case with NORP , does not infringe the right concerned either since , as with all fundamental rights , it is subject to limitations . In the instant case , the declaration predetermining expenditure is both justified and reasonable ... Furthermore , opting to predetermine expenditure does not necessarily mean that the taxpayer adheres to that religion , as the possibility that he or she has so opted for other reasons such , for instance , ... as the exercise of an adequate social activity , can not be excluded . \u201d", "The applicants appealed against that judgment to ORG , which declared their appeal inadmissible in a decision of DATE . The applicants lodged an amparo appeal with ORG , which on DATE ordered ORG to declare the appeal admissible and to rule on the merits . On DATE ORG examined the appeal and dismissed it on the merits , upholding the judgment appealed against .", "Relying on Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the LAW , the applicants lodged an amparo appeal with ORG , which in a decision of CARDINAL DATE , dismissed it for the following reasons :", "\u201c There has been no violation in the instant case of the constitutional rights to equality before the law without discrimination based on religion ( LAW ) , not to be required to reveal one \u2019s religion or beliefs ( Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL of LAW ) and to the effective protection of the courts ( Article CARDINAL of the LAW ) ...", "A decision by a taxpayer not to complete the section of the income - tax return for the fixed statutory percentage of tax that may be allocated to religious ends or other charitable interests in the absence of an alternative allowing an allocation in favour of the taxpayer \u2019s own ORG does not entail even an indirect violation of the constitutional guarantee of the right not to reveal one \u2019s religion or beliefs ( LAW ) .", "Furthermore , the court can not find any discrimination based on religion violating the right to equality of treatment before the law ( LAW ) , since a rational and objective basis exists for setting up a specific scheme of financial support for ORG through additional clause CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL ... and the principle that the ORG is non - denominational is supplemented by the mandate which LAW . CARDINAL of the LAW gives the public authorities to establish \u201c appropriate cooperation with ORG and the other denominations \u201d , having regard to the religious beliefs of NORP society . It is within that institutional framework that the cooperation agreements have been entered into . These include ... an agreement on financial questions entered into with ORG by which the ORG undertakes to assist with the financial support of ORG . Thus , in the absence of any similar undertaking in favour of other denominations , the proposed basis for comparison is not adequate and the difference in treatment made by the legislature is neither arbitrary nor unjustified . Furthermore , LAW does not establish any directly enforceable fundamental right to compel the public authorities to set up a system enabling the alleged right to allocate a percentage of one \u2019s income tax to the support of one \u2019s own ORG and the constitutional remedy of amparo is not the appropriate remedy for calling into question the constitutionality of the ( alleged deficiencies ) in the law .", "Lastly , the judgments appealed against provided a reasoned and legally founded answer to the issues raised by the applicants ... \u201d", "\u201c NORP nationals shall be equal before the law and may not be discriminated against in any way on account of birth , race , sex , religion , opinion or any other condition or personal or social circumstance . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . Freedom of ideology , religion and worship is guaranteed for private individuals and communities without any limitation on its expression other than as shall be necessary to maintain public order protected by law .", "CARDINAL . No one may be required to reveal their ideology , religion or beliefs .", "CARDINAL . No denomination shall be treated as the religion of the ORG . Public authorities shall take into account the religious beliefs of the NORP society and shall accordingly seek to cooperate with ORG and the other denominations . \u201d", "Under Institutional Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on ORG , the ORG may enter into cooperation agreements \u2013 providing , inter alia , tax exemptions \u2013 with Churches . The arrangements will depend on the number of members the ORG has , the extent to which it is established in NORP society and the beliefs of the majority of NORP .", "\u201c Pursuant to the provision set out in LAW entered into by the NORP State and ORG on DATE ... , from DATE onwards a percentage of the income tax paid by private individuals will be allocated to religious ends or other ends in the interest of society .", "CARDINAL . The said percentage shall be determined in each DATE budget and shall apply to the tax levied on the basis of the DATE returns made by taxpayers .", "...", "CARDINAL . Taxpayers may indicate in their tax return their wish for a percentage of their income tax to be allocated to :", "( a ) providing financial support for ORG ; or", "( b ) other ends set out in subparagraph CARDINAL of this provision .", "Anyone who does not expressly state their preference shall be deemed to have opted for the ends referred to in subparagraph ( b ) . \u201d", "The PERSON of DATE , which was published in ORG of CARDINAL DATE , governs the following matters :", "( i ) the status of ministers of the evangelical church ;", "( ii ) legal protection for places of worship ;", "( iii ) recognition under the civil law of marriages celebrated according to NORP rite ;", "( iv ) religious assistance in public centres or institutions ;", "( v ) NORP religious teaching in schools ;", "( vi ) tax privileges applicable to certain assets and activities of Churches that are members of the FEREDE .", "Further , supplemental provision no . CARDINAL of the PERSON provides that the agreement may be varied in whole or in part on the initiative of either party . Supplemental provision no . CARDINAL establishes a joint committee comprising representatives of the ORG and of the FEREDE .", "According to information provided in DATE by ORG at ORG , a meeting of the joint committee ( State - FEREDE ) was held on DATE . During the course of the committee \u2019s examination of the problem of financial cooperation with the ORG regarding certain activities of ORG , the ORG representative asked ORG for its view on the system of allocation of income tax . In reply to that question , the executive secretary of the ORG replied : \u201c after various consultations , it was discovered that the opinion of the Churches within the GPE is divided , such that a final view has yet to be reached ; it will be announced once it has been determined by negotiation \u201d . Consequently , the DATE agreement has not been amended and , to date , the ORG has not requested any amendment to it ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
