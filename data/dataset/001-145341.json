The applicant , ORG , is a stateless NORP . It appears that he was born in GPE in DATE . Currently he lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered GPE with his stepmother and CARDINAL siblings in DATE , when he was DATE . He was granted asylum in DATE , DATE his father entered GPE . The latter was granted a residence permit in DATE . The applicant \u2019s mother , CARDINAL - siblings and his paternal uncles live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that in DATE , when the applicant was DATE , he returned to GPE for DATE and worked as a painter . According to ORG , he stayed in GPE from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , but that appears to be disputed by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . He returned to GPE for DATE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In GPE , the applicant married and divorced twice . From each marriage he had a child , a son born in DATE and a daughter born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has a criminal record . Among other things , in DATE he was convicted of assault , for which he was given a suspended sentence of CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . In DATE he was convicted of making threats against witnesses and possession of a weapon , for which he was given a suspended sentenced of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . In DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment for theft and human trafficking .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and charged with drugs offences , and by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of GPE ( PERSON , henceforth \u201c the High Court \u201d ) convicted the applicant of CARDINAL counts of drugs offences relating to QUANTITY of heroin and cocaine , committed throughout DATE . ORG considered that the applicant had a leading role and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . A profit of MONEY ( ORG ) ( equal to MONEY ( ORG ) ) was confiscated . In addition , he was expelled from GPE with a ban on returning .", "CARDINAL . When issuing the expulsion order , ORG had regard , inter alia , to an opinion which had been obtained from ORG ) . The latter had held an interview with the applicant about his personal situation and ties to GPE and GPE , which included information about schooling , language skills , work , family etc . Before ORG the applicant stated that he speaks and understands LANGUAGE . He does not read or write LANGUAGE . He also stated that he speaks , reads and writes NORP well . However , an interpreter was used in connection with the interview regarding his personal circumstances which was held on DATE . ORG also considered the applicant \u2019s submission that he feared being returned to GPE because he had not sorted out the issue of compulsory military service and because he feared being punished by the NORP authorities if they found out that he had been sentenced for drugs offences in GPE . ORG referred to a consultation response of DATE from ORG , which included an expert opinion of DATE obtained by a named professor and former dean at ORG , concerning the principle of ne bis in idem set out in LAW . That provision stated that no NORP or foreigner will be charged in GPE with an offence on NORP territory , if he has been convicted and has served his sentence abroad or if the punishment has lapsed owing to the limitation legislation of the relevant country or if he has been pardoned . According to LAW , a judgment delivered abroad did not prevent prosecution for an offence falling under LAW , which applied to any NORP or foreign national who breached the law or committed a serious offence outside NORP territory harming national security or who forged Government stamps or forged or counterfeited NORP or foreign bank notes or debt instruments , which were lawful means of payment or in general circulation in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The High Court did not find that an expulsion order would contravene LAW . It stated as follows :", "\u201c When balancing the considerations mentioned in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW and the serious drugs offences committed by the applicant in the form of organizing the dealing in hard drugs of which the applicant has been found guilty , ORG takes into account on the one hand that the applicant must be deemed poorly integrated in NORP society : he never completed lower secondary school and has not at all participated in the labour market . [ The applicant ] has also previously been convicted of assault , making threats against witnesses , human trafficking and theft . ORG further emphasizes that [ the applicant ] speaks LANGUAGE and has retained certain ties with GPE , where his mother , CARDINAL - siblings and other family members are living , and [ the applicant ] has also stayed in GPE several times , including a period of DATE when he worked as a painter .", "Factors weighing against expulsion are that [ the applicant ] entered GPE at DATE and has now lawfully resided in GPE for DATE and has thus had DATE and schooling here . It must also be taken into account that [ the applicant ] is married to and cohabits with a NORP national , a former stateless NORP , with whom he has a daughter of DATE . In addition , [ the applicant ] has been married by an NORP ceremony to another woman of NORP origin living in GPE , now a NORP national , with whom he has a son of DATE . [ The applicant ] has visiting rights to his son , but in reality has only sporadic contact with his son .", "In view of the gravity of the offences committed and the sentence imposed , the High Court finds on an overall assessment that none of the considerations mentioned in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW constitutes a decisive argument against expulsion , nor can expulsion of [ the applicant ] be considered contrary to the considerations of proportionality following from LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On appeal , on DATE , the judgment was upheld by ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , referring to the reasoning by ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , by virtue of LAW , and since the applicant was nearing the end of his sentence , the police requested the relevant immigration authorities to determine whether , and in the affirmative , to which country the applicant could be returned . The applicant was interviewed and anew he objected to the expulsion . He maintained , inter alia , that although originally he had stated that he was born in GPE , where he was also registered , in reality he was born in GPE . The applicant did not wish to return to GPE , as he did not wish to perform his military service there . He also feared being returned to GPE due to his father \u2019s political past there . Moreover , he was in conflict with a NORP family , because he had had an affair with their daughter in DATE and she had subsequently falsely accused him of rape . Finally , he was afraid of being sentenced again in GPE for the drugs crime he had committed in GPE . He added that in DATE he had found a new girlfriend , who visited him in prison DATE . The applicant said that he would agree to being sent to GPE , where he had an aunt . He had CARDINAL siblings in GPE and CARDINAL in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG ( ORG ) , the former ORG , found that the applicant could be expelled to either GPE or GPE . It took into account that the applicant had maintained all along that he was born in GPE , that in the public register in GPE he was recorded as a NORP from GPE in GPE , and that he had relied on his fear of being called up for military service there . The fact that , during an interview on DATE , he had stated that he was born in GPE and produced a copy of a birth certificate , could not lead to another assessment . ORG did not find the applicant \u2019s story about the girl in GPE credible . It noted that he had not provided any information in this respect until the interview held on DATE , and found it unlikely that the girl \u2019s family would persecute him since allegedly he had ended the relationship in DATE . In addition it found that a related document produced by the applicant , allegedly issued by the NORP authorities , was not authentic . It did not find credible either the applicant \u2019s allegation that he could not return to GPE because of his father \u2019s political activities , notably since the applicant could not give any details about those activities . Finally , ORG did not find that the fact that the applicant had not performed compulsory military service in GPE or that he had been convicted for a drugs offence in GPE could bar his expulsion . With regard to the latter , it referred to the consultation response from ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( PERSON ) , before which he was represented by a lawyer , heard in person and able to submit observations . By decision of DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision , but found that the applicant could be expelled only to GPE , the country where he had lived DATE and which he had visited from DATE and again in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , in accordance with the provisions of section CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) , the applicant had instituted proceedings before ORG in ORG ( ORG ) claiming that there had been material changes in his circumstances , for which reason he requested the court to review the expulsion order . The applicant relied on LAW and referred in particular to his CARDINAL children in GPE and to his new girlfriend , who had a child from a previous relationship , born in DATE . Before ORG the latter stated that she would follow the applicant to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request as it did not find that his situation had changed to such an extent that there was any reason to revoke the expulsion order . Upon appeal , the applicant submitted that he had married his girlfriend according to NORP tradition , that she was expecting their child , and that she no longer wanted to follow him to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision and stated :", "\u201c For the reasons stated by ORG and because the [ applicant \u2019s ] present girlfriend , with whom he is married by an NORP ceremony , no longer wants to accompany him to GPE [ even though ] she has recently become pregnant and is expecting the [ applicant \u2019s ] child , the outcome can not be different . In this regard ORG has emphasised that the parties\u2019 relationship commenced after ORG judgment of DATE , for which reason the parties are considered not to have such justified expectations of being able to live together in GPE that the expulsion can be revoked . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was deported to GPE on DATE . According to a report procured by the NORP police , the applicant \u2019s father and uncle had travelled to GPE beforehand to meet the applicant upon arrival . QUANTITY police officers accompanied the applicant on the plane . They submitted the applicant \u2019s travel documents and a document translated into LANGUAGE , stating that the applicant had fully served his sentence in GPE , to the security staff on board and the immigration authorities at the airport in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Before being deported , on DATE , the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG and requested the application of an interim measure pursuant to Rule CARDINAL of ORG .", "Since he only relied on LAW and invoked his separation from his CARDINAL children , his new wife , her child from a previous marriage , and their future child , his request for a Rule CARDINAL indication was not submitted to the President for a decision , of which fact he and his representative were informed in a letter from ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG , the applicant \u2019s representative informed the ORG that upon arrival at GPE airport , the applicant had allegedly been detained and placed in different prisons , interrogated , notably about his conviction in GPE , whether he was addicted to drugs and whether there were persons involved in GPE . During this time , the applicant had regularly been subjected to torture .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , he was allegedly released in order to commence CARDINAL months\u2019 military service in GPE , but he was exempted after DATE because he suffered from heart problems .", "CARDINAL . Allegedly , he was also summoned to appear before the court in GPE to explain about his conviction in GPE . It appears that that case has been discontinued .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s wife and their child went to GPE to visit him .", "CARDINAL .
