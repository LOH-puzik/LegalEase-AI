As the applicant repaid the debt to company ORG after the auction , the proceeds from the sale of the house were used to cover his debt to ORG and the outstanding mortgage on the house were also paid from the proceeds .", "CARDINAL . Company J. is based in GPE and is the largest public water - supply company in GPE . On DATE it sent the applicant a water bill in the amount of CARDINAL ( ORG ) , which was due to be paid on DATE .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had not settled the aforementioned water bill of DATE , company J. instituted enforcement proceedings against him on CARDINAL DATE .

The officer again left a note inviting the applicant to pay the debt , now amounting to EUR CARDINAL , voluntarily .

On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection and refused to adjourn the enforcement proceedings in respect of the attachment of the applicant \u2019s house .

That decision was served on the applicant on DATE . The applicant did not appeal against it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant against the award decision issued in favour of PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , which thus became final . The court held that the applicant had been properly summoned to attend the public auction , which he had not disputed in his appeal , and that he had not given a reason why he had been unable to go to the auction . The court dismissed his allegations that he had been unable to repay the debt . It explained that the enforcement decision concerning the debt of ORG CARDINAL had become final in DATE , whereas he was relying on circumstances which had taken place in DATE . Moreover , the debt was of minor value . The court further pointed out that the applicant had been properly served with all the court documents in the proceedings but had not reacted to them , which had been entirely his choice . It also found that there was no reason to suggest that the applicant \u2019s family would end up on the street , although their standard of living might worsen as a result of the sale of their house . Lastly , the court referred to ORG decisions nos . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , stressing that the subsequent repayment of the debt could not lead to the revocation of an award decision that had already been pronounced , regardless of the amount of money to be paid .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant , now represented by a law firm , lodged an appeal against the decision concerning the transfer of title and applied for revocation of the finality of the award decision .

He stressed that at the relevant time the buyer had not yet acquired ownership of the property and therefore the revocation of the award decision would not have affected rights already acquired by the buyer . The applicant maintained that the summons for the auction had not been served on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It held that under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) there were only CARDINAL conditions to be fulfilled in order to allow the transfer of property to a buyer \u2013 a final award decision and the payment of the purchase price . Therefore , the law had been correctly applied . The court also rejected the allegation that the summons had not been served on the applicant , referring to the findings in the decision of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also rejected the applicant \u2019s assertion that the discontinuation of the enforcement proceedings should have resulted in the annulment of orders to carry out enforcement , including revocation of the award decision . The court further stated that ORG , in its decisions ORG . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL and Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , had already expressed an opinion that the revocation of the award decision would have interfered with the rights of others ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing on the distribution of the proceeds of the house sale and decided to distribute them as follows : the amounts of ORG CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL would go to the applicant \u2019s creditor , PERSON , who had joined his claims to the enforcement proceedings after the house had already been sold ; ORG CARDINAL to ORG for taxes due for the sale of the house ; and ORG CARDINAL to a bank on account of the outstanding mortgage on the house .

At the request of GPE , on DATE ORG issued a writ of execution against the applicant , ordering the eviction of the applicant \u2019s family from the house . The applicant lodged an objection and a further appeal , which were both dismissed . He referred to his constitutional appeal ( see the following paragraph ) and essentially argued that the sale should be revoked in view of the fact that he had repaid the debt before the award decision had become final . In his submission , the transfer of the title to PERSON could not therefore be taken as a valid basis for his eviction .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the meantime , on DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) . He argued that the decisions were unlawful and arbitrary and that the sale of his house resulting from a debt of ORG CARDINAL amounted to a disproportionate interference with his property rights . In particular , he argued that the court had been under no obligation to attach immovable property to the enforcement order . He also submitted that an award decision could not become final if the enforcement proceedings had been discontinued , a point he had explicitly raised in his appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s constitutional appeal by referring to section DATE ) of LAW ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL .
