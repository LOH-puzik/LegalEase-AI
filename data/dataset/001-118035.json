{"ITEMID": "001-118035", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "ITA", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2008, "DOCNAME": "ADA ROSSI AND OTHERS v. ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Fran\u00e7oise Tulkens", "TEXT": ["The applicants , whose names appear in the appended list , are CARDINAL NORP associations and CARDINAL NORP nationals . They were represented before the ORG by Mr NORP PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The applications were lodged by the guardians of persons in a vegetative state , by associations whose membership consists of , inter alia , relatives of severely disabled people , doctors , psychologists , and lawyers assisting such persons and by ORG , a human - rights defence organisation .", "In DATE ORG , a CARDINAL-year - old woman , was a victim of a road - traffic accident in which she suffered a head injury and a fractured vertebra and fell into a coma . She was subsequently diagnosed as being in a vegetative state with spastic tetraplegia and loss of all higher cognitive functions .", "In DATE ORG was placed under the guardianship of her father . In DATE her father began court proceedings , seeking authorisation to discontinue his daughter \u2019s artificial nutrition and hydration and alleging that this would have been his daughter \u2019s wish given her personality and the ideas she had expressed about life and human dignity before her accident . The authorisation was refused twice at first instance and on appeal , in DATE and DATE . In DATE ORG quashed the first decision of ORG dismissing the appeal and remitted the case for fresh consideration , observing that ORG father \u2019s request could not be granted in the absence of specific evidence as to the wishes expressed by his daughter before the accident . On DATE ORG quashed the second decision of ORG and , in its order remitting the case , stated that the judicial authority could authorise the discontinuation of artificial nutrition if the person concerned was in a persistent vegetative state and if there was evidence that such person would have opposed medical treatment if he or she had been in possession of all his or her faculties .", "In a decision of DATE ORG , after rehearing the case , granted the authorisation requested by ORG father on CARDINAL grounds , namely , that ORG vegetative state was irreversible and that there was clear , consistent and convincing evidence that the request accurately reflected the will of the represented person in so far as this could be inferred from her lifestyle , her beliefs and the views she had expressed on human dignity before becoming unconscious .", "On DATE ORG rejected applications lodged by ORG in DATE alleging a conflict between the various branches of ORG power . It found that the judges who had examined the case had not issued a legislative precedent and had not therefore usurped the prerogatives of ORG .", "Lastly , on DATE , ORG dismissed an appeal on points of law by the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office against ORG decision of DATE , on the ground that the public prosecutor did not have capacity to act in the proceedings . That decision rendered the contested judgment final ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
