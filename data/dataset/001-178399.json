The applicants , PERSON ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) and PERSON PERSON ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . The first applicant was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The second applicant was represented by PERSON , a non - lawyer . On DATE the President of the Section had decided to give PERSON leave to act as representative of the second applicant pursuant to Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , who were both retired , instituted proceedings against ORG seeking the annulment of a document signed by the second applicant during the communist regime , donating a house and its appurtenant plot of land located in the centre of GPE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the applicants\u2019 action . It held that the city of GPE , represented by its mayor , had locus standi because it was the current owner of the property . Also , given that the applicants had been forced to donate the property , the donation agreement was null and void and therefore the proceedings initiated by them were not time - barred . ORG appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed ORG appeal and quashed in part the first - instance court \u2019s judgment . It held that the city of ORG , represented by its mayor , did not have locus standi because it had not been a party to the donation agreement signed by the second applicant . The donation had been made to ORG . In accordance with the relevant domestic legislation , the ORG was legally represented by ORG . Moreover , the applicants had not proved their allegation that the city of GPE was the current owner of the donated property . The court upheld the remainder of the first - instance court \u2019s judgment . The applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that following its express request , the applicants had stated that the value of the donated immovable property was MONEY ( RON ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . Relying on the relevant domestic legislation on stamp duty , the court established that the applicants had to pay PERSON ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in stamp duty in order to have their appeal on points of law examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , referring to LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , challenged the way in which the appellate court had calculated the stamp duty . They asked the court to re - examine the amount of stamp duty due and to order the payment of a sum which represented CARDINAL of the stamp duty they had paid in order to have the case examined by the firstinstance court . They argued that the second - instance court had not calculated the amount of stamp duty due on the basis of the property \u2019s value , even though they had declared the same value for the property before that court as well . Moreover , the first - instance court had established that the stamp duty due in order to have their case examined had been that required for cases with a non - pecuniary object , and that therefore they were required to pay CARDINAL of the amount paid to the first - instance court in order to have their case examined by the last - instance court . Furthermore , they had initiated proceedings merely seeking the annulment of a donation agreement in respect of an immovable property ; the proceedings would not have resulted in an immediate return of the property to its rightful owners or in an immediate increase in the value of their estate . They also argued that the declared value of the immovable property which had formed the basis for the calculation of the stamp duty was small compared with the actual market value of the property . Given that they were both retired persons , it was impossible for them to pay such a high amount in stamp duty . Consequently , by calculating the stamp duty based on the value of the property , the court had denied them access to justice and prevented them from recovering their home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in chambers and composed of a different bench of judges from that which had examined the merits of the applicants\u2019 case , dismissed the applicants\u2019 challenge by a final interlocutory judgment . It held that given the object of the proceedings initiated by the applicants , Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was applicable in their case . Consequently , the amount of stamp duty due had to be calculated based on the value of the immovable property , since the object of the applicants\u2019 action was the annulment of a donation agreement in respect of an immovable property . Given the value of the property stated by the applicants , the amount of stamp duty payable by them had been calculated correctly .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law and upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . Having noted the ORG statement that they were unable to pay the required stamp duty , it held that they had failed to fulfil their lawful duty to pay the aforementioned fee and that their appeal on points of law could therefore not be examined .", "CARDINAL . According to the evidence submitted by the applicants to the ORG in DATE , the first applicant had a taxable DATE income of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) and the second applicant had a taxable DATE income of ORG CARDINAL ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .
