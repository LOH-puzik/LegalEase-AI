She was a journalist at the material time .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant published an article in the newspaper \u201c GPE CARDINAL \u201d ( no . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , DATE ) . This article , entitled \u201c The Head of the ' twofold ' Ministry does not know where and how much he has saved \u201d , was a continuation of a regular rubric which informed the public of the financial situation of various political figures in the light of their property declarations . The background to the rubric was the problem of corruption in the public service .", "CARDINAL . In the article , amongst other politicians and government officials , Mr PERSON , a Member of ORG at the material time , was criticized for his declared assets .", "CARDINAL . The article began on the first page of the newspaper with a blackandwhite photograph ( QUANTITY ) of the parliamentarian 's DATE house . The following comment was underneath the picture : \u201c The DATE house of the GPE exile and Member of ORG , PERSON PERSON , does not look that modest . So what ? The NORP who have lost GPE deserve to take a breather somewhere ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the article the applicant cited the words of PERSON , DATE NORP writer : \u201c the Government is a sacred phenomenon ; there is no place for blackguards there \u201d . She further continued : \u201c the main principle of the relationship between the people and the Government \u2013 justice \u2013 is breached DATE ; we obey arbitrariness ... Let 's have a look now at the financial position of the officials suspected of arbitrariness . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The passage of the article describing Mr PERSON 's assets in the light of his latest property declaration was placed on the fifth page of the newspaper :", "\u201c ... If Mr B. 's pride is his son , PERSON PERSON \u2013 Head of LAW GPE \u201d ( although , he might soon forfeit DATE is proud of his soninlaw , Mr P. , who is the Head of the President 's Security Service ( we already spoke about the latter in the previous edition ) . The son - in - law has probably given a hand to his fatherinlaw , otherwise the latter could hardly have finished for some CARDINAL,CARDINAL Laris [ ORG DATE ] the construction of the DATE house ( which , in fact , looks like a palace ) in the village of GPE on the banks of LOC .", "You all know how difficult the everyday life of the refugees from GPE is , and , as it seems , still missing the sea , they want to be close to the water \u2013 Aragvi is undoubtedly a gorgeous river .", "PERSON has also managed to purchase an apartment in GPE for the price of GEL CARDINAL [ EUR CARDINAL ] ( Mr PERSON gives such approximate , \u201c twofold \u201d prices everywhere ) . And , with due regard to the price of the Tsitelsofeli summer house , then Mr PERSON 's GPE apartment should be a truly grandiose construction . Or , maybe PERSON PERSON made a mistake and \u201c could not correctly \u201d assess the price of his riverside summer house ? !", "In the list of his real property , PERSON has also cited the house he inherited in the village of PERSON , valued at GEL MONEY [ EUR CARDINAL ] , and the family library , valued at GEL CARDINAL [ ORG CARDINAL ] . Despite the fact that , DATE , the parliamentarian 's only income was his salary amounting to GEL CARDINAL,CARDINAL [ ORG CARDINAL ] in total , his savings amount to GEL CARDINAL [ ORG CARDINAL ] . One can only wonder whether PERSON and people like him feed on air , without ever spending salaries ; how else could they manage to save so much ? ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON sued the applicant and the editor of the newspaper for defamation . He claimed that the facts mentioned in the article were untrue . They indirectly suggested that he had acquired the DATE house and the GPE apartment since becoming a parliamentarian in DATE , but in reality the origin of most of those possessions dated back to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG in GPE allowed his claim and obliged the respondents to publish a rectification , conceding that the previous publication had been the result of a superficial research of the facts and only reflected the journalist 's subjective opinion . The court also ordered each of the respondents to pay to the parliamentarian GEL CARDINAL [ ORG CARDINAL ] for non - pecuniary damage and GEL CARDINAL [ EUR CARDINAL ] for costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning , ORG acknowledged that the facts exposed in the article with regard to the parliamentarian 's assets were correct , since they were based on the official data submitted in the property declaration and were never disputed by the plaintiff . Nonetheless , the court concluded that the structure of the article , the epithets and artistic expressions were of such a sarcastic and humiliating nature that they would necessarily arouse in readers negative sentiments towards the parliamentarian . The court shared the plaintiff 's concern that the article implied that his declared assets were of illegal origin . Since the applicant failed to discharge , under LAW of LAW , the burden of proof by showing that she had not intended to accuse Mr PERSON of corruption , ORG found her liable in defamation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG quashed and replaced the judgment of DATE . The court reasoned that the journalist 's criticism was aimed at the private sphere of the parliamentarian 's life rather than the political sphere . It concluded that the applicant had failed to bring proof of such statements as \u201c the son - in - law has probably given a hand to his father - in - law , otherwise the latter could hardly have finished ... the construction of the DATE house ... \u201d and \u201c one can only wonder whether PERSON and people like him feed on air , without ever spending salaries ; how else could they manage to save so much ? ! \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered the journalist and the newspaper to retract those statements as untrue and to pay jointly GEL CARDINAL [ EUR CARDINAL ] in non - pecuniary damages . The President of ORG expressed a dissenting opinion , mostly based on the principles of the case - law of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Subsequent to the applicant 's cassation appeal , on DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and decided the case anew .", "CARDINAL . ORG recognised that the margin of criticism with regard to political figures was wider than that regarding other persons . However , considering that she had failed to prove the truthfulness of her suggestion that the impugned property had originated during the parliamentarian 's political life in DATE , the court found , on the basis of Article CARDINAL of LAW , that the applicant 's criticism was unfounded and therefore defamatory . It noted that she had indirectly called the parliamentarian a \u201c blackguard \u201d and had gratuitously accused him of \u201c arbitrariness \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG further stated that , \u201c in view of journalists ' high degree of responsibility within society , each and every one of their judgments should be based on well - investigated and well - examined facts and not on unfounded assumptions \u201d , as in the applicant 's case . The court concluded that the applicant had been negligent when writing about the parliamentarian .", "CARDINAL . ORG ordered the applicant and the editor to pay jointly GEL CARDINAL [ ORG CARDINAL ] in non - pecuniary damages . The applicant was further ordered to publish a rectification , specifically retracting the CARDINAL phrases - \u201c the son - in - law has probably given a hand to his father - in - law , otherwise the latter could hardly have finished ... the construction of the DATE house ... \u201d and \u201c one can only wonder whether PERSON and people like him feed on air , without ever spending salaries ; how else could they manage to save so much ? ! \u201d \u2013 as untrue statements .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the final judgment of CARDINAL DATE was notified to her outside the time - limit prescribed by law and did not bear the stamp or signature of the Registrar of ORG .", "Article CARDINAL guarantees freedom of thought and expression , together with the freedom of the mass media .", "Article CARDINAL provided that an individual was entitled to request in court a rectification of the \u201c information \u201d ( cnobebi ) , which was damaging to his or her honour , dignity or professional reputation , unless the person who had disseminated that information could prove its truthfulness .
