The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who entered GPE at some unspecified time DATE , held a residence permit issued for \u201c family reasons \u201d by the GPE police authority ( questura ) on DATE . This permit was due to expire on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of involvement in international terrorism ( Article CARDINAL bis of LAW ) , among other offences , and placed in pre - trial detention . He and CARDINAL others were subsequently committed for trial in ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant faced CARDINAL charges . The first of these was conspiracy to commit acts of violence ( including attacks with explosive devices ) in GPE other than GPE with the aim of spreading terror . It was alleged that DATE the applicant had been CARDINAL of the organisers and leaders of the conspiracy , had laid down its ideological doctrine and given the necessary orders for its objectives to be met . The second charge concerned falsification \u201c of a large number of documents such as passports , driving licences and residence permits \u201d . The applicant was also accused of receiving stolen goods and of attempting to aid and abet the entry into NORP territory of an unknown number of aliens in breach of the immigration legislation .", "CARDINAL . At his trial the prosecution called for the applicant to be sentenced to DATE imprisonment . The applicant \u2019s lawyer asked ORG to acquit his client of international terrorism and left determination of the other charges to the court \u2019s discretion .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG altered the legal classification of the first offence charged . It took the view that the acts of which he stood accused did not constitute international terrorism but criminal conspiracy . It sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for that offence , and for the forgery and receiving offences . It acquitted the applicant of aiding and abetting clandestine immigration , ruling that the acts he stood accused of had not been committed .", "CARDINAL . As a secondary penalty , ORG banned the applicant from exercising public office for DATE and ordered that after serving his sentence he was to be deported .", "CARDINAL . In the reasons for its judgment , which ran to CARDINAL pages , ORG observed that the evidence against the applicant included intercepts of telephone and radio communications , witness statements and numerous false documents that had been seized . Taken together , this evidence proved that the applicant had been engaged in a conspiracy to receive and falsify stolen documents , an activity from which he derived his means of subsistence . On the other hand , it had not been established that the documents in question had been used by the persons in whose names they had been falsely made out to enter NORP territory illegally .", "CARDINAL . As regards the charge of international terrorism , ORG firstly noted that a conspiracy was \u201c terrorist \u201d in nature where its aim was to commit violent acts against civilians or persons not actively participating in armed conflict with the intention of spreading terror or obliging a government or international organisation to perform or refrain from performing any act , or where the motive was political , ideological or religious in nature . In the present case it was not known whether the violent acts that the applicant and his accomplices were preparing to commit , according to the prosecution submissions , were to be part of an armed conflict or not .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the evidence taken during the investigation and trial was not capable of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had begun to put into practice their plan of committing acts of violence , or that they had provided logistical or financial support to other persons or organisations having terrorist aims . In particular , such evidence was not provided by the telephone and radio intercepts . These proved only that the applicant and his accomplices had links with persons and organisations belonging to NORP fundamentalist circles , that they were hostile to \u201c infidels \u201d ( and particularly those present in territories considered to be NORP ) and that their relational world was made up of \u201c brothers \u201d united by identical religious and ideological beliefs .", "CARDINAL . Using coded language the defendants and their correspondents had repeatedly mentioned a \u201c football match \u201d , intended to strengthen their faith in God . For ORG it was quite obvious that this was not a reference to some sporting event but to an action applying the principles of the most radical form of ORG . However , it had not been possible to ascertain what particular \u201c action \u201d was meant or where it was intended to take place .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the applicant had left GPE on DATE and , after a stopover in GPE , made his way to GPE , from where he had returned to GPE on DATE . He had also spoken of a \u201c leader of the brothers \u201d who was in GPE . Some members of the group to which the applicant belonged had travelled to \u201c training camps \u201d in GPE and had procured weapons , explosives , and observation and video - recording equipment . In the applicant \u2019s flat and those of his co - defendants , the police had seized propaganda about jihad DATE or holy war \u2013 on behalf of ORG . In addition , in telephone calls to members of his family in GPE made from the place where he was being detained in GPE , the applicant had referred to the \u201c martyrdom \u201d of his brother PERSON ; in other conversations he had mentioned his intention to take part in holy war .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , no further evidence capable of proving the existence and aim of a terrorist organisation had been found . In particular , there was no evidence that the applicant and his accomplices had decided to channel their fundamentalist faith into violent action covered by the definition of a terrorist act . Their desire to join a jihad and eliminate the enemies of NORP could very well be satisfied through acts of war in the context of an armed conflict , that is , acts not covered by the concept of \u201c terrorism \u201d . It had not been established whether the applicant \u2019s brother had really died in a suicide bombing or whether that event had been the \u201c football match \u201d which the defendants had repeatedly referred to .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the prosecution appealed . The applicant asked to be acquitted of all the charges , while the prosecution wanted him to be convicted of international terrorism and aiding and abetting clandestine immigration as well .", "CARDINAL . In the prosecution \u2019s appeal it was submitted that , according to the case - law of ORG , the constituent elements of the crime of international terrorism were made out even where no act of violence had occurred , the existence of a plan to commit such an act being sufficient . In addition , an action could be terrorist in nature even if it was intended to be carried out in the context of an armed conflict , provided that the perpetrators were not members of the \u201c armed forces of a State \u201d or an \u201c insurrectionary group \u201d . In the present case , it was apparent from the documents in the file that the applicant and his associates had procured for themselves and others false documents , weapons , explosives and money in order to commit violent acts intended to affirm the ideological values of fundamentalist ORG . In addition , the accused had maintained contacts with persons and organisations belonging to the sphere of international terrorism and had planned a violent and unlawful action , due to be carried out in DATE as part of a \u201c holy war \u201d and in a country other than GPE . Only the GPE arrest had prevented the plan from being implemented . Furthermore , at that time the armed conflict in GPE had ended and the one in GPE had not yet started .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution further submitted that the applicant \u2019s brother , Mr PERSON , had been detained in GPE ; the applicant had visited him there in either DATE or DATE . After his release Mr PERSON had settled in GPE and stayed in contact with the applicant . He had then died in a suicide bombing , a fact which was a source of pride for the applicant and the other members of his family . That was revealed by the content of the telephone conversations intercepted in the prison where the applicant was being held .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the prosecution requested leave to produce new evidence , namely letters and statements from a person suspected of terrorist activities and recordings transmitted by radio microphone from inside a mosque in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG to rule on the constitutionality of LAW . As amended by LAW . CARDINAL of DATE , that provision permitted the defence and the prosecution to appeal against acquittals only where , after the close of the first - instance proceedings , new evidence had come to light or been discovered . ORG stayed the proceedings pending a ruling by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared the relevant provisions of NORP law unconstitutional in that they did not allow the prosecution to appeal against all acquittals and because they provided that appeals lodged by the prosecuting authorities before the entry into force of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE were inadmissible . ORG observed in particular that PERSON no . DATE did not maintain the fair balance that should exist in a criminal trial between the rights of the defence and those of the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . The first hearing before ORG was set down for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , DATE after delivery of ORG judgment , a military court in GPE had sentenced the applicant in his absence to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for membership of a terrorist organisation operating abroad in time of peace and for incitement to terrorism . He was also deprived of his civil rights and made subject to administrative supervision for DATE . The applicant asserted that he had not learned of his conviction until its operative part was served on his father on DATE , when the judgment had already become final .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that his family and his lawyer were not able to obtain a copy of the judgment by which the applicant had been convicted by the GPE military court . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to the President of GPE and the NORP Minister of Justice and Human Rights , his representatives before the ORG asked to be sent a copy of the judgment in question .

CARDINAL of DATE ( entitled \u201c Urgent measures to combat international terrorism \u201d and later converted to statute law in the form of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ) . He observed that \u201c it was apparent from the documents in the file \u201d that the applicant had played an \u201c active role \u201d in an organisation responsible for providing logistical and financial support to persons belonging to fundamentalist NORP cells in GPE and abroad . Consequently , his conduct was disturbing public order and threatening national security .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister made it clear that the applicant could not return to GPE except on the basis of an ad hoc ministerial authorisation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was taken to a temporary holding centre ( centro di permanenza temporanea ) in GPE . On DATE the deportation order was confirmed by ORG justice of the peace .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested political asylum . He alleged that he had been sentenced in his absence in GPE for political reasons and that he feared he would be subjected to torture and \u201c political and religious reprisals \u201d . By a decision of QUANTITY DATE , the Head of the GPE police authority ( questore ) declared the request inadmissible on the ground that the applicant was a danger to national security .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of the non - governmental organisation ORG ( known by its NORP initials \u2013 OMCT ) wrote to the NORP Prime Minister to tell him the ORG was \u201c extremely concerned \u201d about the applicant \u2019s situation , and that it feared that , if deported to GPE , he would be tried again for the same offences he stood accused of in GPE . The ORG also pointed out that , under the terms of LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , \u201c ORG shall expel , return ( \u2018 ORG ) or extradite a person to another ORG where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the non - governmental organisation Collective of ORG in LOC appealed to the NORP government to \u201c end its policy of mass deportation of NORP immigrants [ who were ] practising adherents of religious faiths \u201d . He alleged that the NORP authorities were using inhuman methods and had grounded a number of decisions against NORP on their religious convictions . He went on to say that it was \u201c obvious \u201d that on arrival in GPE the persons concerned would be \u201c tortured and sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment , on account of the fact that the NORP authorities falsely suspect them of terrorism \u201d . The applicant \u2019s name appeared in a list of persons at imminent risk of expulsion to GPE which was appended to the letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Chief Constable \u2019s decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was served on the applicant on DATE . The applicant did not appeal . However , on DATE he had produced documents , including the ORG \u2019s letter of DATE and the reports on GPE by ORG and ORG , requesting that these be passed on to the local refugee status board . On DATE the GPE police authority informed the applicant orally that as his asylum request had been refused the documents in question could not be taken into consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pleading Rule CARDINAL of ORG , the applicant asked the ORG to suspend or annul the decision to deport him to GPE . On DATE the ORG decided to ask the Government to provide it with information , covering in particular the question whether the applicant \u2019s conviction by the GPE military court was final and also whether in NORP law there was a remedy whereby it was possible to obtain the reopening of proceedings or a retrial .", "CARDINAL . The Government \u2019s reply was received at ORG DATE . According to the NORP authorities , in the event of a conviction in the absence of the accused , NORP law gave the person convicted the right to have the proceedings reopened . The Government referred in particular to a fax of DATE from the NORP ambassador in GPE stating that , according to the information supplied by ORG at ORG , the applicant \u2019s conviction was not final since a person convicted in his absence could appeal against the relevant judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to apply Rule CARDINAL . It asked the Government to stay the applicant \u2019s expulsion until further notice .", "CARDINAL . NORP The maximum time allowed for the applicant \u2019s detention with a view to expulsion expired on DATE and he was released on that date . However , on DATE a new deportation order had been issued against him . On DATE this order was served on the applicant , who was then taken back to the GPE temporary holding centre . As the applicant had stated that he had entered GPE from GPE , the new deportation order named GPE as the receiving country , not GPE . On DATE the new deportation order was confirmed by ORG justice of the peace .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released because fresh information indicated that it was impossible to deport him to GPE .

In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant had applied for a residence permit . On DATE the GPE police authority replied that this application could not be allowed . It was explained that a residence permit could be issued \u201c in the interests of justice \u201d only at the request of the judicial authorities , where the latter considered that the presence of an alien in GPE was necessary for the proper conduct of a criminal investigation . The applicant had in any case been forbidden to leave NORP territory and was therefore obliged to stay in GPE .

Although he will be afforded a retrial before the same military court , military courts in GPE violate a number of guarantees for a fair trial . The military court is composed of a presiding judge and CARDINAL counsellors . Only the president is a civilian judge . There are restrictions on the right to a public hearing . The location of the court in a military compound effectively limits access to the public . Individuals convicted before a military court can seek review only before ORG . Civilian defendants have frequently reported that they had not been informed of their right to legal counsel or , particularly in the absence of a lawyer , have not realised that they were being questioned by an examining judge as he was in military uniform .", "Defence lawyers have restrictions placed on access to their clients\u2019 files and are obstructed by not being given information about the proceedings such as the dates of hearings . Unlike the ordinary criminal courts , military courts do not allow lawyers access to a register of pending cases .

The trial failed to respect international fair - trial standards . According to defence lawyers , most arrest dates in police reports were falsified , and in CARDINAL case the place of arrest was falsified . There were no investigations into allegations that the defendants were beaten , suspended from the ceiling and threatened with rape . The convictions rested almost entirely on confessions extracted under duress . The defendants denied all charges brought against them in court .

We consider , therefore , that PERSON would be at serious risk of torture and unfair trial if he were to be transferred to the custody of the NORP authorities . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A similar statement was issued by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its DATE report on GPE , ORG asserted that the NORP government used the threat of terrorism and religious extremism as a pretext for repression of their opponents . There were constant , credible allegations of the use of torture and ill - treatment against suspects in order to obtain confessions . It was also alleged that convicted persons were deliberately subjected to ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . Although many members of the proscribed NORP party ORG had been released from prison after an amnesty , there were CARDINAL political prisoners . There had been mass arrests of young men , who had then been prosecuted under the DATE anti - terrorism law . Released political prisoners were monitored very closely by the authorities , who refused to renew their passports and denied them access to most jobs .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , the judicial system lacked independence . Investigating judges questioned suspects without their lawyers being present , and the prosecution and judiciary turned a blind eye to allegations of torture , even when made through a lawyer . Defendants were frequently convicted on the basis of confessions made under duress or of statements by witnesses whom they had not been able to examine or have examined .", "DATE . Although ORG was continuing its programme of visits to NORP prisons , the authorities were refusing independent human rights defence organisations access to places of detention . The undertaking given in DATE to allow visits by ORG had remained a dead letter .", "CARDINAL . The DATE anti - terrorism law gave a very broad definition of \u201c terrorism \u201d , which could be used to prosecute persons merely for exercising their right to political dissent . Since DATE CARDINAL persons had been charged with planning to join jihadist movements abroad or organising terrorist activities . The arrests had been carried out by plain - clothes police and the families of those charged had been left without news of their relatives for DATE or sometimes DATE . During their trials these defendants had overwhelmingly claimed the police had extracted their statements under torture or threat of torture .

Lastly , ORG reported that on DATE ORG had adopted a resolution deploring the repression of human rights activists in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG signed an agreement with the NORP authorities on DATE giving them permission to visit prisons and assess conditions there . The agreement came DATE after the authorities\u2019 decision to permit prison visits by only ORG , an organisation \u2013 described as \u201c strictly humanitarian \u201d \u2013 which was required to maintain confidentiality about its findings .

Although there had been no politically motivated killings attributable to the NORP authorities , the report commented critically on CARDINAL cases : PERSON PERSON had died while in police custody and PERSON PERSON after being released from police custody .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the information gathered by ORG , ORG described the various forms of torture and ill - treatment inflicted by the NORP authorities in order to secure confessions . These included : electric shocks ; forcing the victim \u2019s head under water ; beatings with fists , sticks and police batons ; hanging from the cell bars until loss of consciousness ; and cigarette burns . In addition , police officers sexually assaulted the wives of NORP prisoners as a means of obtaining information or imposing a punishment .", "CARDINAL . However , these acts of torture were very difficult to prove , because the authorities refused to allow the victims access to medical treatment until the traces of ill - treatment had faded . Moreover , the police and the judicial authorities regularly refused to follow up allegations of ill - treatment , and confessions extracted under torture were regularly admitted as evidence by the courts .", "CARDINAL . Political prisoners and religious fundamentalists were the main targets of torture , which was usually inflicted while the victims were in police custody , particularly inside ORG . The report referred to a number of cases of torture complained of in DATE by non - governmental organisations , including the NORP national pour les libert\u00e9s en GPE and the ORG pour la lutte contre la torture en GPE . In spite of complaints by the victims , no investigation into these abuses had been conducted by the NORP authorities and no agent of the ORG had been prosecuted .", "CARDINAL . The conditions of incarceration in NORP prisons fell well below international standards . Prisoners were held in cramped conditions and had to share beds and toilets . The risk of catching contagious diseases was very high on account of the overcrowding and the unhygienic conditions . Prisoners did not have access to appropriate medical treatment .", "CARDINAL . Political prisoners were often transferred from CARDINAL establishment to another , which made visits by their families difficult and discouraged any investigation of their conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , after lengthy negotiations , the NORP government had signed an agreement permitting ORG to visit prisons . These visits had begun in DATE . In DATE ORG declared that the prison authorities had respected the agreement and had not placed obstacles in the way of the visits .", "CARDINAL .

By law , the maximum period allowed for detention in police custody was DATE , during which time the ORG families had to be informed . However , these rules were frequently ignored . Persons detained by the police were very often held incommunicado and the authorities extended the duration of police custody by recording a false date of arrest .", "CARDINAL . NORP The NORP government denied that there were any political prisoners , so their exact number was impossible to determine . However , ORG aux prisonniers politiques had drawn up a list of CARDINAL political prisoners , nearly all of whom were said to be religious fundamentalists belonging to proscribed opposition movements who had been arrested for belonging to illegal organisations which endangered public order .", "CARDINAL .
