The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . They entered GPE on DATE , when they were respectively CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE , and applied for asylum and residence permits DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants were heard by ORG ( Migrationsverket ) on CARDINAL and DATE and CARDINAL DATE . A language test was carried out by an analyst , who had been born and raised in GPE and came to GPE in DATE . After the initial interview , legal counsel was appointed to represent the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant submitted , among other things , that they were members of the ORG clan and that the family had lived together in a village called Hosingo in southern GPE since DATE . The first applicant had a university degree from GPE . On DATE , he explained to ORG that he had not visited GPE since DATE . On DATE he was confronted with the fact that his passport had been stamped on CARDINAL occations , in DATE and DATE in GPE , situated northwest of GPE , whereupon he explained that he had travelled via GPE to GPE and that those trips must have been after DATE . Once he had visited his brother \u2019s daughter in GPE . He did not recall the other visit . There were also stamps in his passport up to DATE from PERSON , PERSON and GPE , in GPE , but the first applicant maintained that he and his family had remained in GPE throughout that period .", "CARDINAL . PERSON took over GPE when the NORP army withdrew in DATE . On DATE , the first applicant explained to ORG that he had participated in a demonstration to protest against PERSON taking over their village , and that therefore he was on their list of persons to kill . On DATE he explained that the elders of the village decided that they would try to negotiate with ORG . The negotiation ended in disagreement and the spiritual leader of the village was killed immediately after the meeting by CARDINAL masked men . The first applicant was listed as a person to be killed and shortly thereafter CARDINAL armed and masked men came to his house and asked for him . On CARDINAL DATE he explained that the leader of the village had been killed DATE after the meeting with ORG . The applicants would not be able to move elsewhere in GPE since their clan was not domiciled anywhere else in the country and PERSON was present everywhere .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant stated initially that her mother and husband remained in DATE . Later she explained that her husband had left the village . She did not know where he was . She still had CARDINAL siblings left in GPE , plus some uncles and cousins . In DATE the family had problems with PERSON , which burned down their house . The second applicant had burn scars on her upper body from that incident . In DATE CARDINAL of the village leaders was killed and her father and husband had to flee . She was afraid of being raped by PERSON upon return .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG request for asylum . It noted at the outset that it was difficult for NORP citizens to prove their identity since there was no authority that could issue passports or other acceptable identity documents . Accordingly , the applicants\u2019 stories were decisive for determining their origin . The ORG found that the first applicant had provided detailed information about LOC village , situated in southern GPE . However , his pronunciation of some words was typical of that in northern GPE . In addition he had stamps in his passport , dated DATE , from airports in GPE . There were no entry or departure stamps from trips to or from southern GPE . Finally , he had provided contradictory statements about the crucial event in DATE , notably whether the leader was killed immediately or DATE after the negotiation with PERSON , and why he was being sought by them , and he had been vague about the situation in south and central GPE . The language analysis of the second applicant indicated that she originated from GPE . Moreover , she had not been able to give any detailed information about the village or her clan , which could be verified . In conclusion , ORG did not find it credible that the applicants had been living in GPE until their departure from GPE . It found it much more likely that the applicants\u2019 most recent home had been in northern GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the decision to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , before which an oral hearing was held on CARDINAL DATE . ORG refused to hear CARDINAL witnesses on the applicants\u2019 behalf , who allegedly could have certified that they were from GPE . However , their written testimony was allowed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . ORG did not question that the first applicant originated from LOC in southern GPE . Like ORG , however , it found that the language analysis of the first and the second applicants , and their various explanations , did not support their contention that they had had their latest domicile in southern GPE or that they should be considered refugees or otherwise in need of protection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal . Hence the deportation order became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants claimed that there were impediments to the enforcement of their deportation orders . On DATE ORG decided not to reconsider the case , finding that the applicants had failed to present new circumstances which could justify reconsideration of the case .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , the applicants again requested a reexamination of their cases , which was refused by ORG on DATE . The applicants appealed against this decision to ORG , which rejected the appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant claimed that there were impediments to the enforcement of his deportation order . On DATE ORG decided not to reconsider the case , finding that no new circumstances justifying reconsideration had been presented .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , in DATE the first and the fourth applicants claimed that there were impediments to the enforcement of the deportation orders against them , claims which were rejected by ORG on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
