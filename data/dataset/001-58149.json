Principal State Counsel 's Office at ORG does not act as a prosecuting authority before that court . Except in appeals made for the purposes of clarifying the law , it acts only as a party joined to the criminal proceedings . Its role is not to argue the prosecution \u2019s case but to ensure that the law is correctly applied ( see \u201c NORP en cassation \u201d , cited above , and PERSON , ORG , Juris - classeur proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale , DATE ) .", "PERSON , Advocate - General at ORG , thus explains that whereas the role of the prosecution consists , in principle , of law enforcement and upholding the law , the role of ORG Office at ORG is confined to the latter task . In that capacity it is required to ensure that the law is correctly applied when it is clear and correctly construed when ambiguous ( PERSON , \u201c ORG et Cour supr\u00eame \u201d , PERSON juridique , Doctrine ( DATE ) , PERSON . PERSON no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The duties of ORG in ORG are \u201c personally conferred on ORG \u201d ( Article R. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ) . Save for directions to lodge an appeal for the purposes of clarification of the law , ORG does not receive any instructions regarding the performance of his duties ( see for example the speech made on DATE by PERSON , ORG at ORG , at the formal ceremony marking the beginning of the judicial year , GPE documentation fran\u00e7aise , GPE DATE , and the \u201c ORG et Cour supr\u00eame \u201d article cited above ) .", "ORG \u201c assigns ORG and the advocates - general to the divisions in which he considers they may most usefully serve \u201d ( Article R. CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . ORG and the advocates - general \u201c speak on behalf of ORG in the divisions to which they have been appointed \u201d ( Article PERSON ) . In important cases their submissions are communicated to ORG , who , if he is not in agreement and the advocate - general refuses to amend them , may delegate another advocate - general or make submissions himself at the hearing ( Article R. CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . It appears , however , that that provision has never been applied and that in practice the advocates - general are , therefore , free to decide on the tenor of their submissions ( see the \u201c NORP en cassation \u201d article cited above ) .", "In his speech of DATE ( referred to above ) PERSON explained : \u201c [ the ] value of the work [ of the advocate - general ] , which is performed after the reporting judge has completed his task , is as a \u2018 second GPE . Either the advocate - general agrees with the report , in which eventuality the decision to be taken will be clearer , or he disagrees , and will have triggered the necessary debate . In all cases his role is somewhat \u2018 maieutic\u2019 . \u201d", "DATE . The advocate - general \u2019s submissions do not have to be in writing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The list of hearings is fixed DATE . A single advocate - general deals with all cases on the list for DATE he is on duty . He informs the relevant lawyers practising in the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG , who , if they wish to make oral submissions , must advise the president before the hearing .", "CARDINAL . DATE before the hearing a preparatory \u201c meeting \u201d is held between the president and the senior judge of the division and the advocate - general on duty for DATE ; they systematically review the cases on the list and exchange views ( see the \u201c Pourvoi en cassation \u201d and \u201c ORG et Cour supr\u00eame \u201d articles cited above and the speech given on DATE by Mr PERSON , ORG at ORG , entitled \u201c PERSON g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 la PERSON et la Convention europ\u00e9enne de sauvegarde des ORG , GPE palais , CARDINAL DATE ) . It appears to be customary after the meeting for the advocate - general to inform the lawyers acting in the case of the tenor of his submissions ( see the speech entitled \u201c PERSON g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 la PERSON et la Convention europ\u00e9enne de sauvegarde des ORG l\u2019Homme \u201d cited above ) .", "In parallel , the reporting judge \u2019s report is studied in detail by the offices of the president and the senior judge , which give a reasoned opinion in writing . Their opinion , together with the submissions of the advocate - general , are communicated to the reporting judge DATE before the hearing ( see the \u201c NORP en cassation \u201d article cited above ) .", "CARDINAL . Hearings of ORG are held in public and the procedure is the same as that in the other courts ( LAW ) .", "The procedure before ORG is nevertheless in written form ; the parties\u2019 lawyers are not required to appear at hearings . In ORG there is an oral hearing only in the ( rare ) cases where the parties\u2019 lawyers have expressly requested CARDINAL .", "At the hearing the reporting judge is the first to address the court . He reads out his report but does not disclose his recommendations . If there are to be oral submissions , counsel for the appellant addresses the court first followed by counsel for the respondent ; they may not submit any new legal argument . The advocate - general is the last to address the court ; he makes submissions that are confined to legal issues and may concern the consideration of a ground of appeal raised by the court of its own motion ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ; and see the \u201c NORP en cassation \u201d article cited above ) . It would appear that where oral submissions are made it is customary to allow the parties to reply to the advocate - general \u2019s submissions , either orally or by a note addressed to the court in deliberations ( see the speeches of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON referred to above ) .", "CARDINAL . After the public hearing , the members of the court deliberate in private . The reporting judge gives his opinion ; the other judges and the president then express their views . Following a vote on whether the recommendations of the report should be adopted , the draft judgment , which each judge will have received DATE beforehand , is then considered ( LAW ; and see also the \u201c NORP en cassation \u201d article cited above ) .", "The advocate - general generally attends the deliberations .

If it is an important case that has ( exceptionally ) been pleaded by counsel , the advocate - general leaves the courtroom at the same time as the parties and the public in order clearly to demonstrate that the judges deliberate alone . In ordinary cases , the advocate - general usually remains in his seat but does not take part in the debate . His presence results from purely practical considerations relating to the number of cases , which is often substantial , to be heard at each sitting . It has no special signification \u201d ( see also Mr PERSON \u2019s speech referred to above ) .", "CARDINAL .
