According to the Minister of ORG , who was jointly responsible for drafting the bill which became the DATE Law , this type of deportation was only to apply to CARDINAL categories of aliens : terrorists , spies and drug traffickers . Neither the Minister of the Interior nor the LOC d'Etat have adopted that position ; they have interpreted the condition much more widely . In practice section CARDINAL also covers cases concerning violent and anti - social behaviour by an alien over a long period since DATE ( PERSON d'Etat , DATE , ORG , Recueil des arr\u00eats du ORG d'Etat ( \" Rec . \" ) p.

Its substance is assessed on a case - by - case basis by the Minister , subject to review by the administrative court .", "For a long time the ORG d'Etat ruled that the question whether there was any urgency itself came within the unfettered discretion of the Minister . From DATE it interpreted the requirement so as to limit its application solely to cases where the deportation was to take place within a very short time ( PERSON d'Etat , DATE , PERSON . p. CARDINAL ) . It later found that the urgency requirement had been satisfied where the alien was due to be released shortly ( PERSON d'Etat , CARDINAL DATE , ORG v. PERSON , ORG . p. CARDINAL ) , then held that it was lawful to use the procedure against an alien who had been released from prison DATE before the deportation order was made ( ORG d'Etat , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . , tables , p. CARDINAL , and DATE , PERSON , GPE DATE ) , or who had obtained early release DATE before the issue of a deportation order ( PERSON d'Etat , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , requ\u00eate no . DATE , ORG administratif , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . It also accepted that the Minister could use the extreme urgency procedure where , in connection with a deportation initially commenced under the ordinary procedure , the board had expressed an opinion against deportation .

CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG A deportation order issued by the Minister of the ORG remains in force indefinitely . Since DATE such orders embody authority to execute and may be enforced without further order , using force if necessary .", "CARDINAL . ORG In general , deportation is carried out without delay ; however , the effects of the deportation order are not exhausted as a result of its execution .", "Thus , deported aliens are precluded from returning to NORP territory for so long as the order has not been rescinded . If they do return , they are liable to the penalties applicable to cases of avoiding or attempting to avoid the execution of a deportation order and returning to GPE without leave to enter .", "Furthermore , according to a circular issued by the Minister of the ORG on DATE concerning the application of LAW August and DATE , although the celebration of the marriage of an alien on NORP territory is not subject to any condition regarding the lawfulness of his stay , a prefect who is informed that the alien wishing to get married is in breach of the immigration rules may , before the wedding , make an order for his removal under section CARDINAL of the Ordinance of DATE and , after the ceremony , decide to expel him pursuant to that provision .

DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG As deportation orders are not subject to any special regime , an application for judicial review may be made to the administrative court having territorial jurisdiction under the ordinary rules . Such applications have no suspensive effect and may therefore be accompanied by an application for a stay of execution even where the order has been enforced and the alien is outside GPE .", "On DATE ( requ\u00eate no .

In the circumstances of the case , although it has been shown that he has committed offences for which he has been sentenced to several terms of imprisonment ( the most recent being a DATE sentence for armed robbery , burglary committed at night or with accomplices and theft ) the impugned decision has nonetheless , regard being had to the applicant 's conduct subsequent to his convictions for those offences and to the fact that he has no ties with any country other than GPE , interfered with the applicant 's rights to respect for his private and family life in a way that was disproportionate to the aims with which it was taken . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The alien concerned may , at any time , and as often as he chooses , apply for the deportation order to be rescinded .", "Where the application is submitted DATE \" after the final execution of the deportation order \" , the Minister of the ORG is not subject to any specific procedural requirements in reaching his decision . If the application is submitted \" after a period of DATE ... , it may be rejected only after the opinion of the deportation board for the d\u00e9partement has been sought ; the alien may be represented before the board \" . Consultation is required even where the deportation order was made under the procedure for cases of extreme urgency . Since the PERSON of DATE came into force , the board 's opinion is no longer binding on the Minister .", "The PERSON d'Etat had considered that a deportation order was executed on the date the alien left NORP territory and that , in consequence , even if he subsequently returned to GPE illegally , the DATE period ran from DATE ( ORG d'Etat , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . p. CARDINAL ) . However , section CARDINAL bis , added to the Ordinance of DATE by the Law of DATE , now prevents a deportation order being rescinded if the alien has not left GPE or if he has returned there illegally : \" An application ... for the rescission of a deportation order ... submitted after the expiry of the time - limit for making an application for judicial review can not be granted unless the foreign national resides outside GPE . \"", "An application to which there has been no response within DATE is deemed to have been rejected by the Minister of the ORG . Where the Minister of the ORG decides not to enforce a deportation order whilst at the same time refusing to rescind it , a compulsory residence order is made against the alien . If the alien continues to disturb public order , he may be deported . That constitutes a new decision , separable from the deportation order and in respect of which an application for judicial review may be made to the administrative court . In considering the application , the court examines the conduct of the alien during the period when his presence in GPE was tolerated . In reviewing the lawfulness of the measure the court therefore examines the position at the date of its judgment . However , a ground of appeal on the basis that the alien had mended his ways after the date of the order is ineffective ( ORG d'Etat , CARDINAL DATE , ORG . p. CARDINAL ) .", "The fact that a deportation order has been rescinded does not constitute leave to enter . If leave is sought , it may lawfully be refused .", "CARDINAL .
