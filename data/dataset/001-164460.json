The applicant had stayed behind in GPE and had not been persecuted by \u201c GPE \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , fearing ORG and the ORG , the applicant had then gone into hiding \u2013 moving around between GPE and the villages of PERSON and PERSON in the province of DATE until DATE , when NORP troops had arrived . He had been arrested on DATE by ORG , then under the leadership of General PERSON . The applicant had been tortured several times during his incarceration . Mr PERSON had been present on one of those occasions . The applicant had been told by interrogators that he had been detained because he was a NORP or a convert .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) in order for it to examine whether LAW should be applied to the applicant \u2019s asylum request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL Unit conducted a supplementary interview ( aanvullend gehoor ) with the applicant . During this interview , he declared , inter alia , that in DATE , as a member of ORG , he had participated in a purge action \u2013 ordered by ORG and ORG \u2013 aimed against persons active on behalf of PERSON and Jamiat in a specific area and that prisoners of war had been handed over to the former NORP communist security service , ORG ( ORG - e Dowlati / PERSON ) .

On DATE the Minister for ORG issued notice of her intention ( voornemen ) to reject the first applicant \u2019s asylum application and to apply LAW . The Minister found it established , given his consistent and detailed statements , that the applicant had worked for ORG and PERSON but also found that , in his account to the GPE authorities , he had in part misrepresented the facts , had sought to trivialise his activities for PERSON and had withheld important information .", "CARDINAL . The nature of the applicant \u2019s work , and the contents of an official report ( ambtsbericht ) , drawn up on DATE by ORG , entitled \u201c ORG in NORP GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG and ORG ( \u201c PERSON in communistisch GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG en WAD \u201d ; ORG ) and an official report , drawn up on DATE by ORG , on PERSON ( DPC / AM-CARDINAL ) , had given cause to consider whether LAW was applicable to the applicant \u2019s asylum claim .", "CARDINAL . In her notice of intention , the Minister analysed , on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international materials and on the prescribed and so - called \u201c knowing and personal participation \u201d test , the nature of the acts imputed to the applicant in the framework of LAW , as well as his individual responsibility under LAW . The Minister noted , inter alia , that the applicant had worked for a part of ORG , ORG , which had collaborated with the ORG and found that it was justified to conclude that the applicant had known or should have known about the criminal character of the ORG and that its crimes had formed part of a widespread or targeted attack aimed against the civilian population . Having regard to the official report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Minister further found that the cruel character of the ORG had been commonly known . The Minister further did not believe that the applicant had been ignorant of the criminal character of PERSON when he had started to work for it as this had been widely known at the material time . Relying on the official report of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Minister underlined that PERSON had been considered during the Afghan civil war to be one of the most violent groups , not only because of its militia \u2019s actions on the battle field and merciless liquidation of its political opponents , but in particular because of its militia \u2019s crimes against the civil population of GPE and for having instilled a true climate of terror in the country . The Minister lastly found it established that the applicant himself had committed acts of torture on the person of Mr S.", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW , the Minister did not find it established that the applicant , if returned to GPE , would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by this provision . In reaching this finding , the Minister took into account , inter alia , that the applicant had stayed for DATE in GPE and DATE in GPE without having sought assistance in these countries from , for instance , the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , that he had not applied for asylum when he had been apprehended by the police in GPE , and that he had not reported immediately to the immigration authorities after his arrival in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted written comments ( zienswijze ) on the Minister \u2019s intended decision . On DATE the Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum application , confirming the reasoning set out in her notice of intention of DATE and rebutting the applicant \u2019s written comments .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision was rejected on DATE by ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE , sitting in PERSON . It held in respect of the applicant \u2019s activities as a CARDINAL adolescent volunteer for ORG that , according to the applicable policy in respect of child soldiers , the Minister had not adequately reasoned her decision finding \u201c knowing participation \u201d in respect of this part of the applicant \u2019s account . However , on the basis of the other elements of the account , it accepted the decision of the Minister to deny the applicant asylum by applying LAW against him . It further held that it had not been established that the applicant \u2013 if expelled to GPE \u2013 would be exposed to a risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by LAW from the side of ORG on the basis of the general security situation in GPE , or on the basis of his NORP ethnic origin .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who from his first interview was assisted by a lawyer in these asylum proceedings , could have filed a further appeal with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , but did not do so . Consequently , the ruling of DATE became final when the DATE time - limit for filing an appeal with ORG expired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed by the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) of the intention ( voornemen ) to declare him an undesirable alien entailing the imposition of an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( e ) of LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) , following the decision to hold LAW against him in the asylum procedure .", "CARDINAL . The actual decision to impose this exclusion order on the applicant was taken on DATE by the Deputy Minister of ORG . As regards LAW , the Deputy Minister did not find it established that the applicant would be at risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to this provision in GPE or that there were any obstacles of a medical nature to his removal to GPE . Further noting that the applicant did not have any relatives or other persons in the GPE with whom he had a family life within the meaning of LAW , the Deputy Minister further found that the exclusion order did not constitute an interference with the rights guaranteed by this provision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged this decision in administrative law proceedings . The last ( for the applicant negative ) decision in these proceedings was taken on DATE by ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE . It noted that , in its ruling of DATE , which had obtained the force of res iudicata , ORG of The Hague , sitting in TIME , had concluded that there existed serious reasons for assuming that the applicant had been involved in acts referred to in LAW . As the Deputy Minister had enjoyed a discretionary power in deciding whether or not to impose an exclusion order , it had to be assessed whether in deciding to impose that order , the competing interests involved had been carefully balanced . In view of the reasons given in the impugned decision and the applicant \u2019s submissions , ORG of GPE , sitting in GPE , accepted the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision that the applicant \u2019s personal interests were outweighed by the general public \u2019s interests pursued by the exclusion order .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the applicant had invoked LAW , ORG noted that in its ruling of DATE it had already found that the applicant had not demonstrated that his expulsion to GPE would expose him to a risk of a violation of his rights under that provision . It found that also in the proceedings at hand the applicant had not submitted facts or referred to circumstances on the grounds of which it should be accepted as plausible that he would risk a violation of his rights under LAW if he were to be expelled to GPE . As regards Article CARDINAL , ORG noted that it appeared from the applicant \u2019s notice of appeal ( beroepschrift ) that it was not in dispute between the parties that the applicant could not claim a right of residence on the basis of LAW and that it was thus not necessary to consider this point any further .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who was represented by a lawyer throughout these proceedings , could have filed a further appeal with ORG , but he did not do so . Consequently , the ruling of CARDINAL DATE became final after the expiry of the DATE time - limit for filing an appeal with ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
