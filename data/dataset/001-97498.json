On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of fraud . On DATE , the Prague CARDINAL ORG ( obvodn\u00ed soud ) ordered his pre - trial detention pursuant to LAW hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The court held that , given the applicant \u2019s NORP citizenship and lack of residence in GPE , and the fact that he was likely to be sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence , there was a risk that he would abscond to avoid the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an indictment against the applicant on a charge of fraud was filed in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and DATE ORG dismissed requests for release from custody filed by the applicant . The court held that the reasons for the applicant \u2019s detention continued to apply . CARDINAL appeals by the applicant directed against the second and third of ORG decisions were dismissed by ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a constitutional appeal ( \u00fastavn\u00ed st\u00ed\u017enost ) against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , alleging a violation of his right to personal liberty under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( Listina z\u00e1kladn\u00edch pr\u00e1v a svobod ) , of his freedom of movement under LAW and of the right to judicial protection under LAW , in that the reasoning of the court decisions was insufficient . He added that LAW had also been violated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a request for release from custody filed by the applicant on DATE and decided , under LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG , that the applicant was to remain in detention . The court did not accept the applicant \u2019s written pledge .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG convicted the applicant of fraud , sentenced him to CARDINAL half GPE imprisonment and ordered his expulsion from GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant supplemented his constitutional appeal , alleging that despite his request ORG decision of DATE had not been translated into LANGUAGE , in violation of LAW ( e ) of the Convention . He also complained that in the decision of DATE ORG had decided to renew the order for his detention for the first time since the pre - trial detention had been ordered on DATE . The applicant thus regarded the period of detention after CARDINAL DATE , that is after the expiry of DATE period covered by the first detention order , as unlawful . In this respect he relied , inter alia , on LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG varied ORG judgment of DATE but the applicant \u2019s prison sentence remained unchanged . In response to the applicant \u2019s argument that the trial court had not given him the opportunity to question CARDINAL of the witnesses , the appellate court held that this witness had been heard at trial in the applicant \u2019s and his counsel \u2019s presence and that they had used this opportunity to ask him questions .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( PERSON ) held that ORG had violated the applicant \u2019s rights guaranteed under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW in that it had not decided on extension of the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention or his release within the statutory time - limit . The court stated in particular :", "\u201c It appears from the case - file that the courts decided on the applicant \u2019s requests for release and/or his complaints against the respective dismissals , but not on his remaining in custody or his release as provided for in LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG . Such a decision complying with the requirements laid down in the ORG was adopted by the GPE CARDINAL ORG on DATE , that is , DATE after the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention had been ordered . The ORG underlines that when deciding on a request for release filed by an accused , a court \u2018 ORG examines , as in the present case , whether there are still reasons for his detention . The criteria specified in LAW ORG require stricter conditions to be fulfilled for a decision to continue the accused \u2019s detention \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG did not grant the applicant \u2019s request for ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE to be quashed , the applicant having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the meantime .", "CARDINAL .
