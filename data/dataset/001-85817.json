She was represented before the ORG by Mr Atak , a lawyer practising in U\u015fak . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was the owner of a building in U\u015fak . On an unspecified date , she agreed to sell this building to GPE and in exchange she received a certain amount of cash and CARDINAL bonds dated DATE and DATE respectively . She accordingly transferred the title deed to PERSON \u2019s name . Shortly after this transaction , PERSON sold the building to a certain ORG and the title was registered in the latter \u2019s name .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed an action before ORG against GPE and ORG , arguing that PERSON had deceived the applicant during the transaction , and thus the transfer of the title deed should be annulled and the title re - registered in her name . In this respect , she claimed that PERSON had committed fraud during the purchase of the land . In the meantime , the applicant also initiated criminal proceedings against PERSON in ORG , accusing him of fraud ( case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG held its first hearing and took statements from several witnesses . The court also took note of the fact that there were CARDINAL separate criminal proceedings pending against PERSON on charges of fraud ( namely case no . CARDINAL initiated by the applicant before ORG ; case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL initiated by a certain PERSON before ORG and case no . CARDINAL before ORG ) . It therefore decided to request copies of these case files which were found to be relevant to the instant case .", "Thereafter , the civil court awaited the outcome of these criminal proceedings , each time adjourning the hearings to a later date and without taking any decision on the merits of the case .", "PERSON was subsequently acquitted of the charges against him in all CARDINAL cases and ORG received copies of the relevant case files and judgments on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s case . In taking this decision , the court based itself on the acquittal decision delivered by the criminal court in case no . CARDINAL . The court also held that there was nothing in the case file to suggest that the defendants had not acted in good faith during the transaction .", "On DATE ORG , after holding a hearing on the merits of the case , upheld the judgment of DATE .", "On DATE ORG further dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for rectification ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
