They all live in LOC and were represented by ORG , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The mine ( PERSON ) was discovered in the county of GPE in DATE by company ORG . In DATE , mining concessions ( utm\u00e5l ) were granted for iron and lead ore deposits in the mine as well as in a second mine ( PERSON no . CARDINAL ) to company ORG . In DATE , the concession area was expanded and , in DATE , mining concessions were granted to company ORG for iron ore deposits at CARDINAL more mines ( PERSON and PERSON ) . In DATE , the area was expanded further . In connection with each procedure , certain parts of the properties concerned were bought by company ORG and compensation was paid to the property owners . Certain compensation was also paid to landowners for damage to their forests and land . Extraction of minerals was in progress from DATE , and from DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE company ORG acquired all of the above mining concessions from company ORG , including the properties that company ORG had bought over DATE , and undertook mineral extraction from DATE . No mineral extraction has taken place since DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE company ORG applied to ORG of GPE ( GPE ) for an exploitation concession ( bearbetnings - koncession ) for minerals within the area . The application related to the conversion of the old permits , granted in DATE , into CARDINAL new exploitation concession in accordance with transitional provisions to the new Minerals Act ( ORG , CARDINAL ) . In its application , company ORG noted , inter alia , that the remaining minerals in the area had been examined mainly to determine whether it would be possible to exploit the minerals with profit since the ore in question had proved difficult to refine with conventional techniques . The calculations had shown good potential and studies were continuing to investigate whether saleable concentrates could be obtained and whether the circulation of processed products could work on a continuous scale .", "CARDINAL . As the applicants\u2019 land was within the defined area , they were informed about the application and given the opportunity to comment . In their submission , they stressed the impact on nature and , in particular , the negative effects that mining could have on nearby water sources which , they considered , should be examined further .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted company ORG an exploitation concession , valid for DATE . The concession conferred upon the company the right to extract and exploit copper , gold , silver , zinc and lead according to the rules of LAW within the defined area . Moreover , it was linked to a number of conditions , inter alia , relating to securing the area during exploitation and restoring the area and its nature afterwards . In reaching the decision , ORG observed that ORG ( PERSON ) of GPE did not object to the concession being granted and that extensive exploration and development work was already on - going in accordance with the old permits . It further found that no other obstacles existed to granting the concession .", "CARDINAL . In its decision , ORG further noted that any rights to landowner shares ( jord\u00e4garandelar ) or landowner rent ( jord\u00e4garavg\u00e4lder ) , from which the property owners might have benefited according to the old legislation for the permits , would cease pursuant to the transitional rules of LAW . However , it also observed that the decision did not affect any agreements that might exist between the concession holder and the landowner .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the decision to the Government , reiterating their concerns about the negative effects that mining would have on the surrounding nature and water sources . They further strongly objected to the fact that they would not receive any compensation for the minerals that would be extracted from their land . They considered this to be in violation of LAW as well as of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government rejected the appeal as it considered that no grounds had been presented to alter ORG decision . Among other authorities , ORG of GPE ( NORP Geologiska Unders\u00f6kning ) submitted its comments on the appeal to the Government and noted , inter alia , that the decision to grant the exploitation concession had been essentially an administrative measure to convert the old permits to the single new concession but that it did not alter the use of the land within the defined area or any interests .", "CARDINAL . As the applicants were not satisfied with the ORG \u2019s decision , they applied to ORG f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) for judicial review according to LAW Lagen om r\u00e4ttspr\u00f6vning av vissa f\u00f6rvaltningsbeslut , GPE ) . They relied on LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention and claimed that they had been deprived of their property rights since company ORG would be able to extract minerals from their land without compensating them . This was also contrary to the custom which had existed in GPE since time immemorial . It had been abolished for political reasons through LAW of DATE ( Gruvlagen , PERSON ) but GPE was obliged to comply with the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s decision in full . It noted that NORP law allows for various measures to control the use of an individual \u2019s land . Thus , LAW , as in force at the time of ORG decision , allowed ORG to grant physical and legal persons the right to explore and extract certain minerals enumerated in the LAW even though they did not own the land where the minerals were located . The landowner had the right to receive compensation for any damage or encroachment suffered due to these activities but not for the value of minerals extracted by someone else . The court further observed that LAW was not absolute but allowed for certain restrictions . Hence a ORG could enact such legislation as it considered necessary to regulate the use of property in accordance with the public interest . In these circumstances , the ORG \u2019s decision had not been in violation of the ORG or otherwise flawed .", "CARDINAL . Following communication of the application , the Government submitted extracts from ORG and informed ORG following ownership constellations of the properties affected by the concession and relevant to the present case :", "CARDINAL . Half of the property PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL had been bought by the first applicant , PERSON , in DATE and DATE . Thus , since DATE the first applicant has been the sole owner of this property .", "CARDINAL . The property PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL had been inherited by the second applicant , PERSON , in DATE . Thus , since this time , he has been the sole owner of the property .", "CARDINAL . The property PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL had been inherited by the third applicant , PERSON , in DATE . However , in DATE , she had given it as a gift to PERSON who , since then , has been the sole owner of the property .", "CARDINAL . The property PERSON DATE had been inherited by the fourth applicant , PERSON , in DATE . However , on DATE he sold the property to PERSON who , since DATE , has been the sole owner of the property .", "CARDINAL . The first regulations in public law in GPE concerning mineral exploration and related matters date back to DATE . During DATE , various royal decrees and statutes were in force with the effect that mines belonged to the ORG . In DATE , a royal statute entered into force establishing the mining claim system which meant that a person who discovered a deposit could be given the exclusive right to extract the deposit if certain formalities had been observed . Landowners were given a landowner share ( jord\u00e4garandel ) , namely a PERCENT share in the mineral extraction . The thinking behind it appears to have been to stop the landowner from preventing prospecting or keeping mineral deposits secret . The meaning of a landowner share was a right to participate in the extraction of the minerals corresponding to one \u2019s share , that is , financial participation was necessary in order to collect income from the share . In DATE and DATE new mining statutes were issued through which the state regulated mining in more detail .", "CARDINAL . It was with the enactment of LAW of DATE ( Gruvlagen , CARDINAL , hereafter the \u201c DATE LAW \u201d ) that an essentially comprehensive regulation entered into force . Mining concessions granted under LAW or under earlier provisions applied indefinitely . The landowner share was removed and replaced by a corresponding share of the ORG . The landowner was instead awarded a landowner rent ( jord\u00e4garavg\u00e4ld ) . The principle of this was that the landowner would receive DATE from the owner of the mine an amount equal to PERCENT of the value of the mineral extracted , but a maximum of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( later raised to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The landowner share was to be paid during DATE that the mining operations were in progress . Thus , according to the preparatory works to LAW of DATE ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) , the landowner rent was created as compensation to the property owner for the loss of the landowner share .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Mining Act ceased to apply on DATE when LAW of DATE ( Gruvlagen , PERSON , hereafter the \u201c DATE LAW \u201d ) entered into force . This LAW was also based on the mining claims system , but it had more concessional elements than previous acts . LAW abolished the landowner rent . However , in the transitional provisions to LAW , the landowner rent for mining concessions granted under LAW was retained . Still , under LAW , section CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the transitional provisions to LAW , all mining concessions granted before the entry into force of that Act would cease to apply on DATE . The rules on landowner rent would also cease to apply on this date .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) was promulgated and , on DATE , it entered into force , replacing LAW . LAW is still in force . It is essentially based on the concession system which means that the ORG , following a discretionary examination , grants individuals the right to prospect for and exploit mineral deposits . Through the LAW , the mining claims were replaced by exploration permits ( unders\u00f6kningstillst\u00e5nd ) , LAW , and mining concessions were replaced by exploitation concessions ( bearbetningskoncessioner ) , LAW . According to section CARDINAL of that chapter , exploitation concessions are granted for a period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the owner of a real property may exploit deposits of concession minerals for his own domestic use without a concession , provided that no other person holds a concession within the area .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL of the Mineral Act contains rules for when compensation may be granted to affected parties . Thus , section CARDINAL provides that damage or encroachment resulting from exploration work shall be compensated by the holder of the exploration permit or concession . Section CARDINAL states that for damage resulting from the granting of an exploitation concession , compensation shall be paid by the concession holder . In the event of exceptional detriment to any property or part thereof by reason of an exploitation concession having been granted , the concession holder shall purchase the property or part of the property suffering such detriment if the owner so requests . Section QUANTITY provides the same obligations for the concession holder , and rights for the property owner , as section CARDINAL , in case of damage or encroachment resulting from land or other space being utilised for exploitation or activities connected thereto .", "CARDINAL . When LAW was enacted it contained no right for landowners to receive any compensation for minerals extracted on their properties . However , on DATE , a new provision , section CARDINAL , was introduced in LAW ( through Act CARDINAL ) . According to this provision , for DATE that exploitation is undertaken , the concession holder shall pay mineral compensation equal to twothousandths of the calculated value of the minerals covered by the concession that are extracted and brought to the surface within the concession area during DATE . DATE of the compensation shall be paid to the landowners within the concession area and CARDINAL to the ORG . If there is CARDINAL property within the area , the compensation payable to the landowners shall be determined according to each property \u2019s share of the area . This provision does not have retroactive effect and thus does not apply to exploitation concessions granted prior to DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the preparatory works to this amendment to LAW ) , the Government noted that the landowner rent had been abolished through LAW because the Government at the time had considered that there were no reasonable grounds for a landowner , without contributing personally , to receive compensation from the concession holder for minerals extracted ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL [ with reference to Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ] ) . However , the Government observed that , during DATE , opposition against planned mining activities had become evident and it had led to the mineral legislation as a whole being considered unfair and outdated ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL ) . Thus , the Government considered that there was a strong general interest to create LAW which would provide a good framework for entrepreneurial initiatives and investments . It also had to be adapted to global changes and assure a balance between the interests of the landowners and the mining companies ( ibid . , p. CARDINAL ) . In this respect , the Government noted that the issue of ownership of discovered minerals was unclear in GPE . They observed that the boundaries of a property in depth and height were contentious and that there was neither any existing legislation nor any preparatory works or literature to clarify the matter . Since the question was complicated and concerned fundamental property legislation , the Government found that there were not enough reasons , in the instant case , to take a stance on the matter ( ibid . , pp . DATE ) . They then noted that NORP rights were in various ways limited and controlled by authorities and by others\u2019 rights and that , for a long time , this had been the situation for landowners in relation to concession minerals . However , since landowners previously had received some sort of compensation , and a reintroduction of compensation could contribute to a wider acceptance of the mining industry in GPE , the Government found that when making an overall assessment , there were now predominant reasons to re - introduce a special system for compensation for minerals extracted ( ibid . , pp . DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
