{"ITEMID": "001-60808", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "DEU", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF HOPPE v. GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 6-1;No violation of Art. 14+8", "JUDGES": "Ireneu Cabral Barreto", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . In DATE a daughter , PERSON , was born to the applicant and his wife . In DATE the applicant and his wife separated . PERSON stayed with her mother . In DATE the applicant 's wife instituted divorce proceedings before ORG ( ORG ) . She requested that parental authority over PERSON be granted to her . The applicant applied for joint parental authority . Furthermore , the applicant requested that his right of access to PERSON be determined by a decision of the court . In these and the related proceedings , both spouses were represented by counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following hearings on DATE and DATE , decided that , pursuant to LAW ( ORG ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant was entitled to see PERSON every second DATE as well as on GPE DATE , GPE DATE and Whit Monday .", "CARDINAL . ORG reaffirmed the principle that to maintain personal relations between a father and his child , subject to the best interests of the child , was a decisive factor when determining the right of access . Against this background , ORG considered that the applicant 's previous and extensive rights of access had , at least for the time being , to be reduced to visits once per fortnight . All the experts heard in the proceedings , i.e. the psychological expert ( report of DATE ) , the therapeutic pedagogue and a social worker of ORG ( Diakonisches Werk ) , gave evidence that the DATE child was exposed to a conflict of loyalty , which she experienced as a strong pressure , and that she could not cope with this situation . While it was true that PERSON was fond of the applicant and would be in a position to see him without fear if her parents managed to create an atmosphere which took the pressure off her , they had not been able to do so . The frequency of visits requested by the applicant could not , for the time being , be handled by PERSON . Although the applicant was aware of his daughter 's problems , he was incapable of accepting restrictions on access and did not show concern for the child 's psychological health . PERSON 's mother had not yet managed to give ORG such a feeling of security as to permit her to visit the applicant without feelings of fear . PERSON therefore needed the intervals of DATE as times of rest in her mother 's household .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the parties of its intention to decide in a written procedure . The applicant stated his preference for an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after having granted the parties legal aid , amended ORG decision , increasing the applicant 's right of access by ruling that every first visiting DATE the applicant was entitled to see PERSON from DATE TIME until TIME . The remainder of his appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG confirmed the findings of ORG according to which a regular visit DATE best suited the child 's welfare . In so deciding , ORG had particular regard to the impact of the parents ' difficult relations which were in conflict with the best interests of the child ; the parents were not yet in a position to have a calm and objective discussion on questions relating to the right of access . On DATE an attempt at organising a dialogue between the parents at ORG ( Elternberatungsstelle ) of the local ORG ( DATE ) had failed . As long as there was no agreement between the parents , any visit was an emotional strain for the child . The applicant 's right of access had therefore to be assessed in the context of the continuing conflict between the parents .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal further found that the regular visits decided upon by ORG best suited both the applicant 's wishes and the child 's welfare . The exercise of the right of access had functioned well since DATE . In particular , the child had calmed down and her sleep was no longer troubled . ORG , in agreement with the parties , further considered the report , dated DATE , of a social worker of ORG which had been obtained in the context of parallel proceedings concerning the exercise of parental authority . According to this report , no abnormality in PERSON 's behaviour had been observed . ORG found that this encouraging development did not yet permit a significant extension of the applicant 's right of access . However , taking a cautious approach , the visit on DATE could be extended to include TIME stay . Having regard to the psychological expert 's opinion of DATE , the objections previously raised by PERSON 's mother were no longer valid . Should PERSON experience any problems , her mother would have to see to it that the child would consider the visits with an TIME stay as a usual matter . Any further contacts , such as overnight stays DATE , routine telephone conversations and common holidays , were not yet possible , but could be envisaged in case the decision on access would prove successful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant referred the case to ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of that ORG refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant 's complaint did not raise any issue of fundamental importance . In accordance with the case - law of that ORG , both the right of access of a parent not entitled to parental authority and the right to exercise parental authority granted to the other parent were protected by the right to respect for family life under LAW ) . The possibility , pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to limit or exclude the right of access , if it was necessary for the child 's welfare , guaranteed an adequate protection of the child 's constitutional rights and ensured that the courts ' decisions in the matter were governed by the child 's best interests .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG found that the decision of ORG did not disclose any fundamentally flawed views on parental rights . Thus , ORG had considered the child 's welfare . The reasoned decision that the visits could only gradually be extended could not be objected to from a constitutional point of view . Furthermore , there was no indication that the procedural requirements were not met . In particular , the applicant had not shown that , following the failure of a conversation between the former spouses at ORG , ORG was prevented from reaching the conclusion that a fresh hearing would not permit any new findings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant , at his request , an increased right of access in that he was now entitled to see his daughter every second weekend TIME and DATE TIME and also for a period of DATE . ORG observed that the right of access such as that presently granted to the applicant enabled him to be sufficiently informed about PERSON 's well - being and to have contacts with her , and also satisfied his daughter 's need to be with her father .", "On the appeal of the child 's mother , ORG amended this decision on DATE . It revoked the arrangement concerning DATE but extended the applicant 's visiting DATE , after having heard the then DATE PERSON , her parents and a representative of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , following an oral hearing on DATE , granted the parents ' divorce on the ground of the breakdown of the marriage and awarded the mother , pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , parental authority over PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the issue of parental authority had been determined on the basis of what was in the best interest of the child . Having regard to the statements of the psychological expert in the proceedings concerning the applicant 's right of access , ORG noted that PERSON 's mother educated and looked after her daughter in an atmosphere of love and understanding and took an intense interest in ensuring her well - being . According to ORG , the conditions for the joint exercise of parental authority , requested by the applicant , were not met . In particular , the parents ' relations with each other regarding PERSON , as well as their relations with PERSON , were not free of conflict . The applicant was not ready to accept that PERSON 's living situation had changed following her parents ' separation . As a DATE child , she needed a stable life without being torn between different apartments and different styles of education . The ORG noted that , notwithstanding the applicant 's interest in PERSON 's well - being , he failed to see that his wishes obstructed PERSON 's psychological development .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested PERSON 's mother as well as the competent ORG to comment on the applicant 's submissions on appeal . On DATE ORG , upon the instructions of the competent ORG , submitted a report . The report contained arguments in favour of granting the applicant increased access rights . The parties were given the opportunity to comment upon that report in writing . The applicant stated his preference for an oral hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant free legal aid and dismissed his appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the mutual willingness of the parents to co - operate , namely to continue of their own will to bear common responsibility for their child , was an essential condition for a reasonable joint exercise of parental authority . It was obvious that the joint exercise of parental authority by disagreeing parents would be a source of ongoing litigation which , as experience had shown , was detrimental to the child . In the present case the parents , in particular the child 's mother , did not accept a sharing of responsibilities . In the proceedings regarding the applicant 's right of access , which had been pending since DATE , the parents had continuously had major disagreements , and the attempt at a dialogue in the framework of ORG had finally failed in DATE . Therefore , if parental authority could solely be exercised by CARDINAL of the parents , it had to be awarded to the child 's mother for the reasons set out in ORG judgment . The applicant had not raised any serious objections to the reasoning set out in that judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered that an oral hearing with the parties was not necessary , the relevant facts resulting clearly from the case - file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges of ORG refused to entertain the applicant 's constitutional complaint .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant 's complaint did not raise any issue of fundamental importance . It recalled that when courts had to decide on the attribution of parental authority following the parents ' divorce , they had to balance the positions of both parents without encroaching upon the parental priority in educational matters . In such cases , the courts were not , therefore , subject to the strict conditions in respect of interfering with parental rights . The legislator and , in application of the relevant legal provisions , the courts were entitled to transfer the main responsibility for the education of a child to CARDINAL parent if the conditions for the joint exercise of parental authority were not met . Furthermore , according to ORG , ORG view that the conditions for ordering the joint exercise of parental authority were not met in the instant case could not be objected to from a constitutional point of view . Moreover , there was nothing to show that ORG should have conducted further inquiries .", "CARDINAL . Before the entry into force of the amended Law on Family Matters , the relevant provision of the Civil Code concerning custody and access for a child born in wedlock was worded as follows ( ORG 's translation ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . A parent not having custody has the right to personal contact with the child . The parent not having custody and the person having custody must not do anything that would harm the child 's relationship with others or seriously interfere with the child 's upbringing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The family court can determine the scope of that right and can prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties ; as long as no decision is made , the right , under LAW , of the parent not having custody may be exercised throughout the period of contact . The family court can restrict or suspend that right if such a measure is necessary for the child 's welfare .", "CARDINAL . A parent not having custody who has a legitimate interest in obtaining information about the child 's personal circumstances may request such information from the person having custody in so far as this is in keeping with the child 's interests . The guardianship court shall rule on any dispute over the right to information .", "CARDINAL .
