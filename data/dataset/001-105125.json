The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE . When the facts that gave rise to the complaint occurred , the first applicant was the editor of the newspaper \u201c The ORG of Malta \u201d , the second applicant was a court reporter for the said newspaper and the third applicant was the registered newspaper \u2019s printer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a bigamy case , in which the accused was represented by PERSON , was to be heard before ORG . PERSON was called a number of times but he failed to appear . The accused explained that there had been trouble between them in view of requests for excessive fees which he was unable to pay . According to the second applicant , the presiding magistrate repeatedly expressed his intention in open court to find PERSON in contempt of court . Indeed , in the chaotic atmosphere in the courtroom , the second applicant heard the magistrate find PERSON to be in contempt of court . According to the second applicant , she subsequently attempted to verify this fact through the records of the proceedings , but both the magistrate and the court deputy registrar had already left their chambers . She therefore verified what she had heard with another reporter present in the courtroom . He confirmed her version .", "CARDINAL . A decision of DATE in the relevant bigamy proceedings referred to the fact that PERSON client \u2019s request to replace his lawyer at that stage of the proceedings verged on contempt of court . However , in view of the circumstances as explained to the court , the case was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG of GPE newspaper published a report entitled \u2018 Lawyer found in Contempt of ORG . It reported , inter alia , that PERSON had been found guilty of contempt of court for failing to appear before a magistrate hearing the final stages of a bigamy case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE called the second applicant and protested vigorously about the article . Subsequently , the second applicant proceeded to verify the information by checking the record of the proceedings . However , the relevant information was not registered therein . In consequence on DATE the newspaper published a report entitled \u2018 Lawyer Not Found in Contempt of Court\u2019 which reproduced the relevant record of the proceedings and stated that \u201c any inconvenience caused to PERSON is regretted \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Nonetheless , on DATE , PERSON brought civil proceedings for defamation under Part III of LAW ( actions arising from press offences ) . The applicants pleaded , inter alia , that the publication was privileged under LAW ( d ) of LAW ( see Relevant domestic law below ) , that it was not libellous , that mitigation in accordance with LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW should be applied in view of the apology published on DATE and that the third applicant had not read the report prior to its publication ( see Relevant domestic law ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , the court , while acknowledging that the record of the case did not cover the entire proceedings , allowed the applicants to present evidence . On DATE , in his testimony , the prosecutor in the bigamy case explained that PERSON had not appeared at the hearing . The prosecutor related that he had tried to keep the magistrate calm and was nearly found guilty of contempt himself because he was playing defence lawyer . The prosecutor stated that , at that moment , the magistrate dictated a minute , which he thought was directed towards him , that if he opened his mouth he would himself be found in contempt of court . He had also understood , at that moment , that the magistrate found PERSON to be in contempt of court because he did not appear . The prosecutor reiterated that , at that moment , the magistrate was very angry and that he understood that he had found PERSON guilty of contempt . When asked whether the impugned article reflected what really went on in the court room , the prosecutor replied \u201c effectively it reflects what happened in court in short \u201d . He continued to say that while much more was said in the court room , at that time , the phrase in the article \u201c the magistrate found PERSON to be in contempt of court \u201d reflected the impression he had had as to what effectively happened at that moment in time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found against the applicants . It rejected the ORG first CARDINAL above - mentioned defence pleas . In its presentation of the facts the court recalled the above mentioned evidence . It , however , found that the article did not coincide properly with what had happened , in particular in its heading , since , as appeared clearly from TIME of the hearing , it was not true that the plaintiff was found guilty of contempt of court . Thus , the publication was not a fair report of the proceedings . Consequently , it could not be considered privileged . The court went on to note that the defendants tried to diminish their blame for their incorrect reporting by proving that the hearing had been chaotic . It was for this reason that the journalist misunderstood what had happened . The defendants had further shown that the prosecutor too had misunderstood what had happened , as he had also understood that the plaintiff had been found guilty of contempt . In the court \u2019s view , however , this merely highlighted the need for the reporter to verify her information . The reporter \u2019s interest in publishing information was legitimate . However , it could not be more important than someone \u2019s reputation . The statement that PERSON had been found to be in contempt of court surely harmed his reputation as it incited the supposition that he had not fulfilled his duties as a lawyer . Thus , it found the statement in question to be defamatory and taking account of the fact that they had published an apology and that the printer had not read the report at issue , it ordered the applicants to pay , in solidum , MONEY ( MTL \u2013 approximately QUANTITY ( ORG ) ) in damages with interest and costs , but limiting the third applicant \u2019s responsibility to MTL CARDINAL ( approximately FAC ) plus interest .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed and PERSON appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected both appeals , reiterating that the statement had not reflected the truth and adding that when the statement was in itself injurious , mischievous intent ( \u201c animus injurandi \u201d ) was presumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought constitutional redress proceedings , claiming that they had published a faithful version of what went on in the courtroom and that the above - mentioned judgments breached their right to freedom of expression . Despite the applicants\u2019 opposition , Dr A. was allowed to intervene in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( FAC ) found against the applicants .", "CARDINAL . While extensively reiterating the principles derived from the ORG \u2019s case - law , ORG noted that during the defamation proceedings it was established that the fact reported had not been true , and that the applicants had a duty to verify the relevant information . Upon examination of the record of the defamation proceedings , ORG in its constitutional jurisdiction concluded that the domestic courts\u2019 conclusions had not been unreasonable . The fact that the applicants had published an apology was of little relevance , if any , if the information published in the first place was false . In such circumstances it was not unreasonable for the courts to protect PERSON reputation and limit the applicants\u2019 right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG appeal . It held that a journalist had to assume responsibility for what he or she decided to publish . If an item was presented as fact then the journalist must be able to prove it . Even if acting in good faith , the press may only publish facts and not what appears to it to be fact . Had the second applicant verified the record of the proceedings she could have avoided misinforming the public . Citing the ORG \u2019s case - law , ORG held that , while it was not for them to establish the veracity of the facts at issue , the domestic courts\u2019 judgments in favour of PERSON had not infringed the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW . The public had a duty to be informed of true and verified facts , in good faith , as was to be expected from professional journalism .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW , LAW , relates to damages for defamatory libel . LAW , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c In any case to which this article applies , the defendant may , in mitigation of damages , prove that he made or offered to make an apology to the plaintiff for such defamation before the commencement of the action for damages or , as soon afterwards as he had an opportunity of doing so where the action commenced before there was an opportunity of making or offering such apology :", "Provided that the defendant shall not be allowed to adduce such proof in mitigation of damages if he has raised a plea of justification in terms of section CARDINAL . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
