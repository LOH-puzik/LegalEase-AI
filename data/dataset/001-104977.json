The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG DATE newspaper published an article about the quality of the water in the ORG area , entitled \u201c Taps full of bacteria \u201d ( GPE pune bakterija ) . The article stated that all of the current water sources contained various bacteria . These assertions were based on a report produced by ORG NORP za zdravlje PERSON ) , which had been requested by the Chief ORG ( PERSON republi\u010dki vodoprivredni inspektor , hereinafter \u201c the Chief Inspector \u201d ) , apparently with a view to exploring the possibility of connecting additional sources to the water - supply grid . The same article also included a statement by the applicant , at that time the Director of a public corporation called \u201c The Water Supply and ORG \u201d ( PERSON i GPE , hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) and a member of ORG ( SNP ) , that he was not familiar with the analysis at issue , but that the water was regularly tested and always filtered before being pumped into the system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant held a press conference in response to the above - mentioned article . The applicant stated that , firstly , all tap water was filtered before being pumped into the water - supply system and was thus safe for use by the public . Secondly , ORG had been promoting the interests of the CARDINAL private companies which had already been granted licences to develop additional water sources and , lastly , ORG had been directed to do so by ORG of Socialists ( DPS ) and the companies in question had themselves obtained their licences unlawfully . The statement was published in DATE newspapers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Inspector lodged a private criminal action ( privatna krivi\u010dna tu\u017eba ) against the applicant for defamation ( kleveta ) , claiming that the latter \u2019s statements were untrue and , therefore , harmful to his honour and reputation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) in GPE held the main hearing , during which the applicant said that his statement was not defamatory , but that \u201c it was a value judgment , which he could prove \u201d . He stated that he had been informed about the results of the water analysis DATE after the press conference , and the analysis clearly stated that the water from the water - supply system was of the necessary quality and was not a danger to health . He explained that there were obviously CARDINAL reports , CARDINAL concerning the water sources and CARDINAL concerning the filtered water . He did not dispute the right of ORG to ask for a water analysis , as it was his duty to do so , but the applicant did not think that the analysis of unfiltered water should have been published , but rather the analysis of the filtered water . Finally , he proposed that the court should read the article \u201c Taps full of bacteria \u201d to understand the context in which the impugned statement had been made , and that it should obtain the files concerning other proceedings ongoing at the time between ORG and the CARDINAL private companies in question .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing the court also heard the Chief Inspector . He stated that he had always worked professionally and that he did not work under anybody \u2019s orders , he himself having filed a criminal complaint against CARDINAL of the CARDINAL companies . He stated that he had ordered the analysis at issue after consulting his Minister , who had \u201c supported \u201d him ( \u201c koji [ me ] je podr\u017eao u tome \u201d ) . He emphasised that the title of the newspaper article had had nothing to do with him , as newspapers wrote what they deemed appropriate ( \u201c novine pi\u0161u [ ... ] po sopstvenom naho\u0111enju \u201d ) , although they were contacting him to obtain data . However , he was not interested in what the newspapers had written on this particular issue or why they had not published the analysis of the filtered water ( \u201c nije me interesovalo za\u0161to nijesu objavljivali o analizi tretirane vode ... \u201d ) , his main concern being to prove that a particular water source was of adequate quality and that it could be used .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . This sentence , however , was suspended and was not to be enforced unless the applicant committed another crime within DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the operative part of the judgment only the following statement was found to amount to defamation , that is , to be \u201c untrue \u201d and \u201c harmful to the honour and reputation of the private prosecutor \u201d :", "\u201c The Inspector [ ... ] works in the interest and at the request of [ the CARDINAL companies ] , as directed by the DPS \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning the court stated that the statement made by the applicant was not supported by facts and rejected the applicant \u2019s defence that it was merely a value judgment . In the court \u2019s view the applicant had been aware that he might harm the honour and reputation of the private prosecutor and thus had had a defamatory intention ( klevetni\u010dka namjera ) . The court refused to read the newspaper article or to request the files of the proceedings referred to by the applicant as that would only have delayed the proceedings and , in any event , neither was relevant for the proceedings at issue .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date thereafter the applicant lodged an appeal . He stated that , firstly , ORG had sought the said analysis in order to examine the possibility of connecting water sources administered by the CARDINAL private companies to the water - supply grid . Secondly , there were CARDINAL water analyses , before and after it had been filtered , but ORG had provided the newspapers only with the analysis of the unfiltered water . Thirdly , the Chief Inspector himself had not responded to the misleading title of the article stating that the taps were full of bacteria , because he was \u201c not interested \u201d in it . Fourthly , the court had refused to read the newspaper article , without which it was impossible to conclude that his intention had been to defame the private prosecutor . Finally , he did not think it was defamatory to say that a \u201c government official worked as directed by the ruling party \u201d , or that his response to such an article could be considered to amount to defamation of the private prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment of DATE was upheld by ORG ( ORG ) in GPE , which fully endorsed the reasons given by ORG .
