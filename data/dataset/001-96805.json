The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was involved in a major traffic accident in GPE . Her car was destroyed in a head - on collision with an inter - city bus while the applicant and her family members all sustained serious injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a compensation claim against a NORP insurance company with ORG in ORG ( Op\u0161tinski sud u ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Following CARDINAL remittals , both of which took place before GPE ratified the Convention , on DATE the parties in the domestic proceedings informed ORG that they were willing to consider a friendly settlement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG suspended the proceedings , stating that they would be continued should the parties fail to reach a settlement .", "CARDINAL . Since the friendly settlement negotiations were unsuccessful , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant urged ORG to resume the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Following CARDINAL scheduled hearings and the receipt of an expert 's report , on DATE ORG ultimately ruled partly in favour of the applicant . On an unspecified date thereafter this judgment became final since neither party filed an appeal against it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained under LAW that the length of the proceedings in question had been incompatible with the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement which reads as follows :", "\u201c In the determination of his civil rights and obligations ... everyone is entitled to a ... hearing within a reasonable time by [ a ] ... tribunal ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government contested that argument .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that the proceedings in question ended by DATE . Since the respondent ORG ratified LAW , they have thus been within the ORG 's competence ratione temporis for a period of DATE and DATE at CARDINAL level of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also recalls that , in order to determine the reasonableness of the delay at issue , regard must be had to the state of the case on the date of ratification ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE ) and notes that on DATE the impugned proceedings had already been pending for DATE in all .", "CARDINAL . The Government raised various objections to the admissibility of the applicant 's complaint . However , the ORG has rejected similar objections in many previous cases ( see , for example , PERSON , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE , DATE ; PERSON , no . GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ; V.A.M. v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) . It finds no particular circumstances in the instant case which would require a departure from this jurisprudence . It therefore declares this complaint admissible .", "CARDINAL . The Government further stated that there had been no violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Frydlender v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVII ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has frequently found violations of LAW in cases raising issues similar to the one in the present case .", "CARDINAL . Having examined all the material submitted to it , the ORG considers that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case . In view of its case - law on the subject , the ORG therefore considers that the length of the impugned proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement . There has accordingly been a breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further complained under LAW that the proceedings at issue had been unfair .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the applicant did not avail herself of the opportunity to file an appeal against ORG judgment of DATE . It follows that this part of the application is inadmissible for non - exhaustion of domestic remedies , pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed CARDINAL ( ORG ) and LAW in respect of the non - pecuniary and pecuniary damages suffered , respectively .", "CARDINAL . As regards the former , tapplicant ORG CARDINAL under this head .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , however , does not discern a causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage sought . It therefore rejects the applicant 's claim in this regard .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not make any claim for costs and expenses . Accordingly , the ORG is not required to make an award under this head .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers it appropriate that the default interest should be based on the marginal lending rate of ORG , to which should be added CARDINAL percentage points ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
