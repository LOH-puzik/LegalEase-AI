NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a former business partner sued the applicant for a sum of money in the context of the dissolution of their partnership . On DATE the applicant filed a counterclaim .", "CARDINAL . The case was dealt with by courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed both parties\u2019 claims . It found the claim lodged by the applicant to have lapsed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected an appeal by the applicant as having been lodged out of time .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicant by ORG several times owing to difficulties in obtaining a certificate of service . Thus , in a letter of DATE a judge stated that the above impediment had prevented ORG from indicating DATE when the decision in issue took effect . On DATE , following the receipt of the relevant document and the return of the case file , ORG put a stamp on the decision indicating that it had become final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE the applicant unsuccessfully applied to ORG for the lodging of an extraordinary appeal on points of law on his behalf . He argued that he had appealed within the statutory time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant posted a complaint to ORG . He alleged a breach of his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time in the proceedings before the ordinary courts . The applicant affirmed that the complaint had been lodged within DATE of CARDINAL DATE , when he had been notified that his application to ORG had been dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant noted that the copy of ORG judgment enclosed with his constitutional complaint had no stamp indicating the date of final effect . This was due to the fact that such indication had to be made first in the original decision , and that had been possible only after the case file had been returned to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint as having been lodged outside the statutory time - limit of DATE . It held that the applicant should have lodged his complaint within DATE of the service of ORG decision . ORG admitted that the exact date of service of that decision was unknown . However , it found that decision to have been served not later than on DATE , the date of the applicant \u2019s application to ORG . The applicant had posted his constitutional complaint DATE thereafter , namely on DATE . His application to ORG could not affect the position as it concerned an extraordinary remedy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a reply to the applicant \u2019s complaint , the vicepresident of ORG indicated , with reference to the case file , that the decision in the applicant \u2019s case had become final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative asked ORG to review its decision .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE a judge of ORG , after examining the file , replied that ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE had actually become final on DATE . It had been served on the applicant on that date ; he had been the last person on the list of those on whom it had to be served . The indication of CARDINAL DATE as the date of final effect of the decision by ORG had been an error , but it could not affect the legal position because it was of a merely declaratory nature . Finally , the letter stated that the applicant \u2019s complaint was in any event inadmissible on account of his failure to seek redress by means of an appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a certified true copy of a judgment is to be served on the parties or their representatives in person .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a judgment which has been served and which can no longer be challenged by means of an appeal is final .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE provides that a complaint to ORG may be lodged within DATE of the date on which the decision in question becomes final and binding or on which a measure is notified or notice of some other interference with the complainant \u2019s interests is given .

DATE , a court \u2019s legal secretary is obliged , as soon as the date of final effect of a decision has been established , to indicate the same on the cover page of the original of the court \u2019s decision . Under section CARDINAL of that Regulation , upon request courts are to confirm , by means of a stamp on the cover page of a true and certified copy , the date when the decision acquired final effect and became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . As regards complaints about ordinary courts\u2019 decisions in the context of civil proceedings , ORG has held , in a number of cases , that the above time - limit of DATE starts running on DATE when the contested decisions become final ( see , for example , decisions II . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; IV . \u00daS CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ; III . \u00daS CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ; or II . \u00daS CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In the context of complaints about judicial proceedings ORG has consistently considered irrelevant , when determining compliance with the time - limit of DATE under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , the dismissal of GPE request for an extra - ordinary appeal to be filed on their behalf . It held the date of final effect of the contested judicial decisions to be relevant in that context ( see , for example , decision file no .
