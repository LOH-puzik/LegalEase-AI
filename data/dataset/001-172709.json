On an unspecified date ORG issued a new passport in the applicant \u2019s name at her request .", "CARDINAL . She returned to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought civil proceedings against ORG , seeking CARDINAL NORP Lei ( RON \u2013 MONEY ( ORG ) ) in pecuniary and non - pecuniary damages for the restriction on her freedom of movement . She relied on LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . She argued , inter alia , that the measure taken against her had been unlawful and had prevented her from returning to GPE for DATE . As a result , she had been forced to stay in GPE alone , separated from her husband who had had to return to GPE in order not to lose his job . Furthermore , she had lost her salary rights for DATE in question . In addition , she and her husband had been pressured by the border police to admit that she had replaced the CARDINAL pages of her passport , as she had been held ( \u021binut\u0103 ) for TIME at the customs office without being allowed to contact her parents in order for them to instruct a legal representative on her behalf .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It held that she had not been convicted by a final judgment . Furthermore , the measure to place her in the custody of the border police had been necessary given that the border guards had noticed that CARDINAL pages of her passport had been replaced and she herself had admitted as much . In addition , the applicant \u2019s right to use her passport had been suspended following her return from GPE on the basis of the readmission agreement between the CARDINAL countries and LAW \u00a7 CARDINALe of Government Ordinance no .

On DATE the court dismissed the request on the grounds that the evidence in question was not relevant to the case .", "CARDINAL . It also dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE . It held that the suspension of her right to use her passport had been necessary pending the outcome of the criminal investigation opened against her , as it was uncontested that CARDINAL pages of her passport had been replaced . The applicant had to bear the natural consequences of the finding of such an irregularity , namely the criminal investigation . The passport was one of a person \u2019s most important identity documents and was used mainly abroad . Each passport holder was therefore responsible for preserving the document \u2019s integrity . The measure taken against the applicant had thus been necessary because a person could not use a document which had been guaranteed by the ORG and which no longer met the lawful conditions it had had from the moment it had been issued . The measure taken against the applicant seemed even more justified , given that she had initially admitted altering the passport and had not proven that she had been coerced to admit that .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law ( recurs ) against the judgment . She argued , inter alia , that the lower courts\u2019 decision to dismiss her request for additional evidence had been unjust . The evidence in question was relevant to the case since the reasons ORG had relied on in order to take the measure against her had no legal basis as , as could be seen from the evidence , she had been lawfully residing and working in GPE . Furthermore , there was no distinction between her situation and that of arrest or detention , given that she had been prevented from leaving the country even though she had been living and working in GPE with her husband . Consequently , the domestic courts had to find a way to compensate her for the damage sustained following the arbitrary measure taken against her by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG allowed the applicant\u2019Article CARDINAL of the ORG had been met . In spite of the available contradictory evidence , the lower courts had not clarified what had been the legal basis of the measure taken against the applicant . In particular , they had not established whether the measure had been taken in the context of the criminal proceedings opened against her \u2013 it was well known that in such cases a passport was material evidence DATE or had been taken based on either LAW CARDINALe of Government Ordinance no . PERCENT on Government Ordinance no . ORG on GPE \u2019s borders by the head of the customs clearance point the applicant had crossed following the interruption of her travels . Moreover , the lower courts had not established the lawful review procedure for the measure imposed on the applicant or whether she had challenged the measure lawfully . Furthermore , they had not established the grounds for cancelling the measure taken against her or for issuing her with a new passport . If the measure had been taken against the applicant within the context of the criminal proceedings , the lower courts had to establish whether the conditions set out in LAW ORG had been met and whether the ORG could be held liable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s action and awarded her ORG CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in pecuniary damages and RON CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in nonpecuniary damages . It noted that following the reopening of the case and in line with ORG and ORG \u2019s instructions the parties had been allowed to adduce written and testimonial evidence to the file . In this connection , the court noted that the judicial and nonjudicial authorities had been asked to submit the documents concerning the criminal investigation opened against the applicant and those justifying the measure taken against her . It also noted that it had heard CARDINAL witness testimonies .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court established , based on the available evidence , that on DATE the NORP border authorities had placed the applicant in custody because CARDINAL of the pages of her passport had been replaced and because she had been pressured by the representatives of the border police to admit that she had replaced them . The applicant had subsequently withdrawn her statement because she had not actually known how the pages had come to be replaced . A criminal investigation had been opened against her . Consequently , at the request of the FAC border police , ORG had decided to suspend the applicant \u2019s right to use her passport and restricted her freedom of movement for DATE on the basis of Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL . The criminal investigation against the applicant had subsequently been discontinued and therefore ORG attached to ORG had cancelled the measure taken against her and she had been able to return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The court also held that , given the criminal investigation opened against her and the measure taken , the applicant had sustained pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage since she had been unable to return to work in GPE and had been forced to remain in GPE alone and separated from her husband . The applicant had clearly proven the pecuniary damage sustained by her and , under the joint provisions of LAW of LAW , LAW ORG and LAW of LAW , the ORG was liable for the non - pecuniary damage caused by legal errors .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court held that a person \u2019s freedom of movement was guaranteed both by LAW . Consequently , it could be restricted only in circumstances provided for in the domestic legislation and if the restrictive measure was necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the ORG \u2019s appeal , quashed the judgment of DATE and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action . It held that in DATE ORG had established that LAW ORG was constitutional only in so far as the situations in which the ORG \u2019s financial liability could be engaged for damage caused by legal errors during criminal proceedings was not limited to the circumstances given in that provision . Subsequently , in DATE ORG held that LAW of the ORG was constitutional only in so far as a person \u2019s right to be compensated if he or she had been acquitted or the criminal investigation opened against him or her had been discontinued after a preventive measure had been taken against him or her were not restricted to the circumstances given in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court also held that under LAW ORG , the preventive measures that could justify proceedings based on LAW were placement in police custody , detention pending trial and the obligation not to leave town , all measures ordered during criminal proceedings . The right provided by LAW ORG fell within the area of rights guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court held that according to the available evidence , none of the aforementioned preventive measures which could justify proceedings under LAW had been taken against the applicant during the criminal investigation initiated against her . No measures restricting her liberty for the purposes of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG taken together with LAW had been taken against her .", "CARDINAL . The only measure that had been taken had been one restricting her freedom of movement , as guaranteed by LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . It had been taken based on LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and she had failed to challenge the measure as permitted by LAW same ordinance .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the applicant had admitted during the preliminary stages of the criminal investigation that she had replaced the CARDINAL pages of her passport . After she had been informed of the criminal charges against her and of her right to a legal representative , she had intentionally or very negligently obstructed or had attempted to obstruct the investigation . Consequently , the provisions of LAW of the ORG were applicable in the instant case . However , the provisions of LAW could not be applied to her case , given that there had been a reasonable suspicion that she had committed an offence .", "CARDINAL . The court lastly held that the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of movement was not absolute . The right could be restricted in certain circumstances provided for by law \u2013 those provided for by Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL were proportionate to the aim pursued , necessary , accessible and foreseeable .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , the ORG \u2019s potential civil liability in tort could not be engaged as the provisions of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention had not been breached .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . By a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG and Justice ( ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . It held that her freedom of movement had not been restricted as a result of the preventive measure taken during the criminal investigation opened against her by the judicial authorities , but as a result of the measure to suspend her right to use her passport . That measure had been ordered by the police because the passport used by her to cross the border had presented elements of forgery . That fact was undisputed .", "CARDINAL . The court also held that the measure taken against the applicant was provided for by law . Furthermore , it had been justified given that the document had presented elements of forgery and she had been responsible for the integrity of the document . In addition , it had been necessary in order to ensure public safety within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The court also held that under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the applicant could have challenged the measure before the domestic non - judicial authorities and then before the administrative court . She had successfully challenged the measure before ORG and a new passport had been issued for her .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court \u2019s decision had thus been lawful given that the applicant had not proven that the domestic authorities had taken the measure against her unjustly and unlawfully , and it had not been proven that a legal error for the purposes of LAW ORG had been committed during the criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted an article from an unidentified newspaper which had reported on a criminal investigation initiated by ORG against a border guard for allegedly receiving a bribe from the applicant in order to help her with her passport problems . The article referred to a statement by the applicant , in which she claimed that the border guard who had checked her passport had suggested she admit to the unlawful act because the problem was not serious and could be solved . The applicant also claimed that once she had written the confession , the border guard had told her that she should pay some money for the situation to remain uncomplicated . The applicant also stated that even though she and her husband had paid ORG CARDINAL , the border guard had been displeased with the amount and had started searching their luggage and unlawfully confiscating champagne , sweets and coffee . She stated that she had realised afterwards that her problems would not be solved and that she had become the subject of a criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . The article also quoted a local senior police officer who had stated that the applicant \u2019s allegation of bribe taking was being investigated by the relevant authorities and that the investigation into the incident had been referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL .
