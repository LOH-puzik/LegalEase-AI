Initially the ORG had also joined the application , but it subsequently withdrew .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG struck the application out in so far as it concerned the ORG and declared the application inadmissible on grounds of non - exhaustion in respect of the applicant children ( for which reason , the term \u201c applicants \u201d used elsewhere in the present judgment refers to the applicant parents ) . The ORG moreover observed that , while the applicant parents had complained under the LAW in particular about the absence of a right to full exemption from the ORG subject ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , they had also challenged before the ORG the limited possibilities and the modalities for obtaining partial exemption . However , as can be seen from ORG judgment , the applicant GPE lawsuit and appeal to ORG had been directed against the ORG subject and its implementation generally . ORG found no ground for determining whether the teaching of the NORP children had occurred in a manner which violated the relevant human rights treaties . In the light of the foregoing , the ORG found that the applicant parents had failed to exhaust domestic remedies as required by LAW in respect of their complaint about the possibilities and modalities for obtaining partial exemption from the ORG subject and declared this part of the GPE application inadmissible .", "In its subsequent decision on admissibility of DATE , the ORG held that , in its examination of the issue regarding full exemption , the above limitations on the scope of the case that followed from the decision of CARDINAL DATE did not prevent it from considering the general aspects of the partial - exemption arrangement , notably in the context of the GPE complaint under LAW .", "CARDINAL .

In connection with the enactment of the former LAW DATE ( lov om grunnskolen , CARDINAL DATE , no .

In DATE ORG decided to bring the school starting age forward from DATE it extended compulsory school attendance from DATE . A new curriculum was presented to ORG . The majority of ORG , ORG and ORG proposed that NORP , other religions and philosophy be taught together . It emphasised the importance of ensuring an open and inclusive school environment , irrespective of the ORG social background , religious creed , nationality , sex , ethnic group or functional ability . School should be a meeting place for all views . Pupils having different religious and philosophical convictions should meet others and gain knowledge about each other \u2019s thoughts and traditions . School should not be an arena for preaching or missionary activities . It was noted that since DATE teaching of the NORP faith had been dissociated from ORG baptismal instruction . The subject should give knowledge and insight but should not be a tool for religious preaching . The ORG \u2019s majority further considered that guidelines for exemptions should be worked out in order to achieve a uniform practice and that minority groups should be consulted . Exemptions should be limited to parts of the subject , especially material of a confessional character and participation in rituals .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , a white paper ( St.meld . nr . CARDINAL for DATE ) on NORP , religion and philosophy ( kristendomskunnskap med religions- og livssynsorientering , hereafter referred to as \u201c the ORG subject \u201d ) was presented , in which ORG , ORG and ORG ( Kirke- , utdannings- og forskningsdepartementet ; as from DATE ORG ( Utdannings- og forskningsdepartementet ) \u2013 hereafter \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) indicated the following guidelines for making exemptions :", "\u201c No pupil should feel that being exempted is unpleasant or a stigma ;", "No pupil should be pressurised to stand out as a representative of a specific philosophy of life and the school should therefore display great caution in class or at the school in its handling of a request for exemption ;", "It should not be automatic for certain pupils to be exempted from certain parts of the syllabus ;", "If the circumstances lend themselves to it and the parents / pupil so wish , the background and reasons for an exemption can be taken up in the lessons .", "An exemption does not mean a freedom to be ignorant ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The majority of the above - mentioned parliamentary committee endorsed the curriculum in the main and pointed out that NORP should form the central part of the ORG subject ( Innst.s.nr CARDINAL for DATE ) . It further stated :", "\u201c The majority would also underline that the teaching should not be value - neutral . The aim that the teaching should not be preaching should never be interpreted to mean that it should occur in a religious / ethical vacuum . All teaching and education in our primary schools shall take the school \u2019s object clause as a starting point and , within this subject , NORP , other religions and philosophy shall be presented according to their own special features . The subject should place emphasis on the teaching of NORP . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A minority of CARDINAL proposed that , for all primary - school pupils , there should be a right to full exemption from the ORG subject and to alternative teaching .", "CARDINAL . In the course of preparing the amendments to the law , the ORG commissioned PERSON , then a ORG Judge , to make an assessment of compulsory education in the ORG subject from the angle of GPE \u2019s obligations under public international law . In his report of DATE , he concluded :", "\u201c The object clause of LAW , whether taken alone or together with LAW and other special rules on the ORG and schools , does not provide a basis for establishing that the teaching of NORP under the new syllabus will of legal necessity become preaching , educative or influential in favour of ORG . The legislature may choose to make provision for education in the form of preaching to pupils who are of this creed , but not to others . That would be inconsistent with our international obligations and LAW on the protection of human rights .", "What emerges , from a legal point of view , from the somewhat unclear concept of \u2018 confessional basis\u2019 , is that a natural consequence of the ORG system is that the legislator lets instruction in religion or philosophy include ORG thoughts , not other forms of NORP . The law on the new subject , which includes a part on NORP , has opted for this . ... The solution has been opted for because the majority of the population in GPE is affiliated to this creed . It is evidently motivated by objective reasons . It can not be ruled out by human rights treaties , provided that the teaching is otherwise pluralistic , neutral and objective . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the issue of exemption from the ORG subject , PERSON stated :", "\u201c In the situation as it emerges I find that a general right of exemption would be the safest option . This would mean that international review bodies would not undertake a closer examination of thorny questions that compulsory education raises . However , I can not say that a partial exemption would violate the conventions , provided that the operation of the system falls within the framework of the relevant treaty obligations . A lot would depend on the further legislative process and the manner of implementation of the subject . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE Act were amended by LAW of DATE ( no . DATE ) , which came into effect on DATE . The new provisions , plus an object clause similar to section CARDINAL of the former GPE , were subsequently included in sections DATE and CARDINAL - CARDINAL respectively of LAW ( PERSON om grunnskolen og den videreg\u00e5ende oppl\u00e6ring av CARDINAL .

This may concern , inter alia , religious activities within or outside the classroom . In the event of a parental note requesting exemption , the school shall as far as possible seek to find solutions by facilitating differentiated teaching within the school curriculum . \u201d", "CARDINAL . From the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires it can be seen that the expression \u201c religious activities \u201d was meant to cover , for example , prayers , psalms , the learning of religious texts by heart and the participation in plays of a religious nature .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with a circular by ORG ( ORG ) , a parental note to the school requesting exemption should contain reasons setting out what they considered amounted to practice of another religion or adherence to another philosophy of life . The pupil should be granted an exemption after the parents had specified the reasons . If the request was rejected , the parents had a right of appeal to ORG in the county concerned . The appeal was sent via the school , which then had an opportunity to alter its decision .", "CARDINAL . The requirement of giving reasons was further specified in a ministerial circular of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG ) , according to which no reasons were required for making an exemption from clearly religious activities . Beyond that , with regard to matters falling outside the main rule for making exemptions , stricter requirements applied in respect of reasons .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the preparation of the ORG subject , associations representing minority convictions expressed strong objections , notably that the subject was dominated by ORG NORP and contained elements of preaching . ORG commented , inter alia , that the subject had a confessional basis ( konfesjonsforankring ) and that the possibility foreseen for obtaining exemption from only parts of the subject was inadequate . At its national congress in DATE the ORG decided to invite ORG to reject the government \u2019s proposal to limit the right of exemption .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the ORG subject was gradually introduced into the primary - school curriculum , replacing the subject of NORP and philosophy of life . During DATE , the subject was introduced at all levels .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG issued a press release about the completion of CARDINAL evaluation reports on the ORG subject , one entitled \u201c GPE , ORG and ORG experiences with the ORG subject \u201d ( Foreldres , elevers og l\u00e6reres erfaringer med GPE - faget ) , provided by PERSON , the other entitled \u201c A subject for every taste ? An evaluation of the GPE subject \u201d ( Et fag for enhever smak ? En evaluering av GPE - faget ) by the PERSON i ORG and PERSON . ORG had requested that a survey of the implementation of the exemption rules be prepared after a DATE period . Both reports concluded that the partial - exemption arrangement was not working as intended and should therefore be thoroughly reviewed . The second report listed the following \u201c Main conclusions \u201d :", "\u201c In this part of our report we have discussed whether there is concordance between ORG \u2019s intentions , principles and exemption schemes on the one hand and its practical implementation in schools nationwide on the other , and whether parental rights can be said to be ensured when the teaching and exemption scheme are organised the way they are . The perspective of parental rights , which is central to the project \u2019s mandate , has made it necessary to focus especially on the experiences various groups of parents have had with the subject and with the exemption scheme .", "All things considered it should be said that the great majority of the parents we have been in contact with , who belong to ORG , are satisfied with the subject or have no strong opinions about it . However we have found powerful resistance to important aspects of the subject among other groups of parents . The lasting antipathy to the subject from parents belonging to religious / faith minorities means that ORG can hardly be said to integrate and include as intended .", "The principal and empirical surveys provide grounds for the following main conclusions :", "CARDINAL . There is broad agreement among parents that it is important to have some common teaching in the subject concerning different religions and beliefs , but there is no agreement about", "\u2022 what the contents and objectives of the common teaching should be ;", "\u2022 in DATE the pupils should be taught about religions other than their own .", "CARDINAL . NORP In practice some of the subject \u2019s intentions are ensured at all surveyed schools , but at none of them are all the fundamental intentions ensured . Deficient implementation of the central intentions underlying the subject can be explained by", "\u2022 tensions in the subject description itself and between the various intentions underlying the subject , making it difficult to implement ;", "\u2022 lack of resources and problems with implementation presuppose changes at schools .", "CARDINAL . NORP The current exemption scheme does not work so that parental rights are ensured in practice . This is due to the following reasons among others :", "\u2022 the information schools give about the exemption scheme is in many ways not suited to safeguarding the possibility of exemption ;", "\u2022 the information given about ORG classes is of too general a nature for parents to be able to notify their intention regarding an exemption . For example , information about working methods is hardly ever given . Besides , the lesson plans generally come too late for parents to have a practical opportunity of asking for an exemption ;", "\u2022 schools interpret LAW too strictly compared with the clarifications given both by ORG and ORG . For instance , an exemption is often granted only in respect of those activities which are \u2018 clearly religious GPE . Furthermore several schools report attitudes which give the impression that it is practically impossible to be granted an exemption ;", "\u2022 schools offer very little differentiated teaching to pupils who are to be exempted from parts of the subject , and pupils with an exemption mostly sit passively in the classroom ;", "\u2022 in addition , a number of parents from minority - language backgrounds do not have the language competence necessary to exercise their rights even though they would like an exemption . In many cases this causes distrust in school / home relations . A considerable number of parents from minority backgrounds say they want full exemption but will not apply because they are afraid of a conflict with the school that may harm their children ;", "\u2022 the integration of themes and subjects helps ORG become invisible in the timetable so that in practice it is very difficult to ask for an exemption .", "CARDINAL . Changes should be made which still ensure some teaching for the whole class , while ensuring parental rights in practice . This only seems possible under certain conditions .", "\u2022 Arrangements should be made in order to facilitate teaching about the different religions and beliefs and promote dialogue and mutual respect in some tuition for the whole class . Efforts should probably be made to have flexible models that can be adjusted to the special conditions prevailing for lower primary , upper primary and lower secondary levels respectively in different parts of the country and for different groups of pupils ;", "\u2022 Considering the problems we can now see at several schools , it should be possible to provide for full exemption . This would be the safest solution in respect of international conventions and probably also the one that in the long run would be best suited to ensuring support and legitimacy for a subject that is focused on religion and belief .", "We have established that the variations we have found in teaching in different parts of the country , at some schools and in different classes , give us reason to ask if ORG is one or CARDINAL new subject . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG , together with CARDINAL sets of parents who were members of the ORG and whose children went to primary school , brought proceedings before ORG ( byrett ) on account of administrative refusals of the GPE applications for full exemption from the teaching of the ORG subject . They claimed that the refusal of full exemption violated the GPE and the children \u2019s rights under LAW No . CARDINAL , taken on their own or in conjunction with LAW . They also relied on , amongst other provisions , Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the DATE United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the ORG \u2019s objection that the ORG lacked a legal interest and hence did not have legal standing . However , on the substantive issues ORG found for the ORG and rejected the claim .", "CARDINAL . The ORG and the parents appealed to ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , which by a judgment of DATE upheld ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . On a further appeal by the applicants , ORG ( PERSON ) , by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , unanimously dismissed the appeal in so far as it concerned the ORG on the ground that it lacked a legal interest sufficient to have standing in the case . In so far as it concerned the other appellants , it unanimously dismissed their appeal and upheld ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . In his reasoning , approved in the main by the other four Justices sitting in the case , the first voting judge , Mr Justice PERSON , stated from the outset that \u201c [ the ] case concerns the validity of the administrative decisions rejecting the GPE applications for full exemption for their children from the primary and secondary school ( GPE ) subject \u201d . He defined the issue to be determined as being \u201c whether instruction in the [ GPE ] subject with a limited right to exemption [ was ] contrary to GPE \u2019s international legal obligations to protect , inter alia , freedom of religion and belief \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , Mr Justice PERSON undertook an extensive analysis of the legislative history and the position under international human rights law , notably the relevant provisions and case - law of ORG and the DATE LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . Dealing in turn with each of the relevant provisions of LAW DATE , Mr Justice PERSON made the following observations about the NORP object clause in section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "\u201c The object clause applies to all teaching in primary and lower secondary schools . The provision is a general one , and its scope may be difficult to determine . It may raise questions relating to the ORG provisions regarding freedom of religion and parental rights ; see Judge PERSON , pages CARDINAL et seq . of Proposition No . DATE ) to the PERSON [ the larger division of ORG ] . As far as the ORG subject is concerned , the provision must be viewed in conjunction with section LOC ) , which establishes that this subject is an ordinary school subject for all pupils , and that instruction in the subject shall not involve preaching . The object clause must be interpreted and applied in such a way that it does not conflict with the conventions that have been incorporated pursuant to section CARDINAL ( see also section CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "As a result of changes and amendments in subject syllabuses and national standard curricula over time , the expression \u2018 NORP and moral NORP must be interpreted as meaning that NORP and humanist values are to be viewed in conjunction with each other . Both the NORP and the humanist traditions underscore the importance of truth , human dignity , charity , democracy and human rights . These are values common to almost everyone in GPE , regardless of religion or philosophy of life . The conventions do not require that teaching in schools must be value neutral ; see the judgment of ORG in the case of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL ) .", "The object clause establishes that all school education shall take place in cooperation and agreement with the home . Any effort by primary and lower secondary school teachers to help give pupils a NORP upbringing can only be made with the GPE consent and in cooperation with the home . Interpreted in this way , the provision is not incompatible with LAW ORG regarding freedom of thought , conscience and religion or with LAW No . CARDINAL to LAW and LAW ORG regarding parents . The reference to the object clause in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) which prescribes that teachers of the ORG subject shall take the NORP object clause of the primary and lower secondary school as their point of departure thus has no independent significance for the issue of whether there is a violation of the conventions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) to ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , Mr Justice PERSON stated as follows .", "\u201c The appellants have emphasised that the LAW requires the teaching to give pupils a thorough knowledge of the Bible and of NORP in the form of cultural heritage and ORG Faith , while it merely requires knowledge of other world religions , beliefs and ethical and philosophical topics .", "I refer to the fact that it may be inferred from the practice of ORG that the GPE Parties themselves decide the scope and content of teaching ; see PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and NORP v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINALVI . Thus , LAW ORG and LAW No . CARDINAL do not preclude compulsory instruction in the content of various religions and beliefs and in the history of religions and ethics , provided that such instruction is given in an objective , critical and pluralistic manner . In this respect , I refer to my earlier review and summary of the decisions and comments of the convention bodies . The compulsory instruction must cover different religions and beliefs . The greater emphasis placed in section DATE ) on knowledge of NORP than on knowledge of other religions and beliefs is , in my opinion , within the limit of the discretion accorded by the conventions to GPE Parties . The requirement that compulsory instruction must be objective , critical and pluralistic can not be interpreted as meaning that there must be a specific , proportional division of instruction between different religions and different philosophies of life . In the light of the history , culture and traditions of the individual ORG , it must be acceptable for certain religions or beliefs to be more dominant than others .", "Indoctrination or other preaching of a specific religion or a specific philosophy of life will be contrary to LAW and the ORG ; see PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and point CARDINAL of the comment of ORG of DATE . Accordingly , section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW prescribes that instruction in the GPE subject shall not involve preaching .", "The appellants , supported , inter alia , by Judge PERSON \u2019s report ( page CARDINAL of Proposition no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to the PERSON ) , have argued that instruction that communicates a specific religious view in a way that is liable to influence pupils to adopt a specific faith is also a violation of the convention provisions regarding freedom of religion and parental rights . I agree that such communication might involve a violation . However , the expression \u2018 liable to\u2019 may be interpreted in such a way as to give it greater scope than that which it derives from the decisions of ORG . I shall therefore keep to the criteria that have been developed in the ORG \u2019s practice . In connection with the introduction of the ORG subject , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires show that the Ministry and the majority of ORG were extremely concerned to emphasise that the subject was to be an ordinary school subject for all pupils . This has been expressly stated in the wording of the LAW ; see section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , first sentence . The legislator has also stated that the ORG subject shall be a subject designed to provide knowledge ; see , for instance , page CARDINAL , second column , and page CARDINAL of Proposition no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to the PERSON . Section DATE ) provides that NORP , other religions and philosophies of life shall be presented on the basis of their distinctive characteristics . On the other hand , ORG stated that instruction shall not be value neutral ; see page CARDINAL of Recommendation no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to ORG . This in itself can not be contrary to the conventions since , as I have established earlier , neither the ORG nor the ORG is interpreted as meaning that instruction shall be neutral as regards values . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to section CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , Mr Justice PERSON held that , if interpreted against the background of the relevant provisions of the LAW and the ORG and CARDINAL of LAW , it must be understood to the effect that pupils had a right to be exempted and that their parents had no obligation to let their children follow lessons on religion and philosophy regarded as preaching or indoctrinating in the sense of those treaties . The children could therefore be absent from such classes . The question as to how large a part of the syllabus would be affected in this way would have to be decided in each concrete case depending on how the teaching was planned and implemented . In the view of Mr Justice PERSON , the provision on exemption was not contrary to any requirements pertaining to religious freedom and parental rights . The Convention requirement that the teaching should be objective , critical and pluralistic did not preclude compulsory education in the content of the different religions and philosophies of life or giving a particular religion or philosophy , in view of ORG history , culture and traditions , a more prominent place than others . As already mentioned , LAW DATE provided that the subject should be an ordinary school subject . According to the preparatory documents , it was to be a knowledge - based subject . The LAW required that the teaching be neutral and not preaching . Therefore it did not appear that the provisions in section CARDINAL regarding the contents of the teaching were contrary to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON further considered the parts of the school curriculum ( the Ten - Year Compulsory Schooling Curriculum , issued by ORG in DATE , referred to below as \u201c the Curriculum \u201d ) that , in the appellants\u2019 submission , gave preference to the NORP faith and influenced pupils to opt for NORP . In relation to GPE \u2019s international obligations , the ORG , which had its legal basis in sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW DATE and the relevant regulation of DATE , had the same legal status as other regulations . However , he observed , what mattered was that pupils gained understanding of the plurality of convictions and thoughts , and that the teaching did not present one faith as being superior to others . It ought to be acceptable , in the light of a Contracting ORG \u2019s history , culture and traditions , that one or more religions or philosophies of life be given a more prominent place than others .", "CARDINAL . As to the appellants\u2019 objections to influencing pupils through the use of pictures , songs , drama , music and stories from the Bible and religious texts , PERSON Justice PERSON found that it ought to be possible to impart neutrally to pupils the traditions and \u201c means of transmitting knowledge \u201d ( m\u00e5te \u00e5 formidle p\u00e5 ) of the various religions without running counter to international human rights law . The ORG placed emphasis on openness , insight , respect and dialogue and on the promotion of understanding and tolerance in discussion of religious and moral issues and forbade preaching . Within the framework of the ORG , the teaching of the ORG subject could be carried out without any conflict with the relevant provisions of international human rights law .", "CARDINAL . As to the appellants\u2019 argument that the school manuals , notably volumes CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of PERSON , amounted to preaching and were capable of influencing the pupils , Mr Justice PERSON observed that , while several definitions of problems and formulations used in PERSON could be understood as if the NORP faith provided the answer to ethical and moral questions , no further information had been submitted to ORG as to how the teaching in relation to this material had been planned and implemented .", "CARDINAL . In this context Mr Justice PERSON noted that the appellants\u2019 lawsuit and appeal to ORG had been directed against the ORG subject and its implementation generally . The arguments and evidence adduced in relation to each decision to refuse full exemption had been aimed at highlighting how the subject functioned in general . The appellants had not gone deeply into the validity of the individual decision . Because of the way the case had been presented , there was no ground for determining whether the teaching of the NORP children had occurred in a manner which violated the relevant human rights treaties . The case concerned the validity of the decisions refusing full exemption from the ORG subject . The appellants had not shown it to be probable that the teaching had been planned and carried out in a manner that , in accordance with these conventions , warranted exemption from all teaching of the subject in question .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Mr Justice PERSON went on to review the argument of discrimination .", "\u201c Pursuant to section DATE of LAW , parents must send written notification in order for their child to be exempted from parts of the instruction at the individual school . Even if applications for exemption are most likely to concern parts of the GPE subject , a limited right to exemption applies to all subjects and activities . The LAW does not stipulate that grounds must be given for the application . Practice as regards requiring grounds has varied to date .", "The ORG has argued that instruction in primary and lower secondary schools is to a considerable extent divided up into topics that cut across subject boundaries . In so far as parts of the ORG subject are integrated with other subjects , full exemption from instruction in the ORG subject will not be sufficient . It is also the view of the ORG that the ORG subject covers many topics which do not give grounds for exemption , pursuant either to the conventions or to section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . The exemption system is designed and practised in such a way that the content of the instruction is the decisive factor . In the ORG \u2019s view , therefore , the prohibition against discrimination imposed by conventions can not apply to requirements regarding the provision of grounds for applications for exemption .", "The ORG has explained the requirement as regards grounds and the guidelines for exemption in CARDINAL circulars . In Circular F-CARDINAL - CARDINAL dated DATE , page CARDINAL , the ORG stated :", "\u2018 When parents request an exemption , written notification to this effect shall be sent to the school . The notification must contain grounds supporting what they perceive to be the practice of another religion or adherence to another philosophy of life in the instruction .", "If the parents apply for an exemption from parts of the instruction which they perceive to be the practice of another religion or adherence to another philosophy of life , the pupils shall be granted exemption after the parents have explained what it is they consider to have such an effect in the instruction . Parents whose notification to the school regarding exemption is not upheld are entitled to appeal against the municipal administrative decision to ORG in the county concerned . The appeal shall be sent through the school , which is thereby given the opportunity to reverse its administrative decision.\u2019", "The Ministry enlarged on the requirement of grounds in Circular F-CARDINAL - CARDINAL dated DATE , page CARDINAL :", "\u2018 The ORG \u2019s basic rule is that when parents apply for an exemption from activities that are clearly religious , exemption ( partial exemption ) shall be granted . In such cases , the parents are not required to give any grounds . In the case of applications for exemption from activities that are not clearly religious , more must be required as regards the GPE grounds . Such cases are not covered by the main rule as to what exemptions may be applied for . Moreover , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires make provision for an assessment of whether there are reasonable grounds on which to request an exemption . Reference is made to Recommendation no . CARDINAL ( DATE ) to the Lagting [ smaller division of ORG ] in which it is stated : \u201c The majority is of the opinion that pupils shall be exempted from such parts of the instruction at the individual school as , on the basis of their own religion or own philosophy of life , it is reasonable to perceive as the practice of another religion or adherence to another philosophy of life . \u201d However , account must be taken of the fact that many parents consider issues relating to faith and philosophies of life to lie within the realm of private life . The right to private life is also protected by international conventions.\u2019", "The ORG then reviews examples of areas from which pupils may be exempted and states on page CARDINAL :", "\u2018 The religious and philosophical convictions of parents shall be respected in the entire ORG provided by the school . This means that the rules for exemption apply to all compulsory education . In general , the issue that must be assessed by the school is whether the ORG in practice is liable to influence pupils to adopt a specific faith or philosophy of life , or may otherwise be perceived as participation in religious activity or adherence to a philosophy of life .", "In specific terms , this may , for instance , have significance with regard to dance classes organised as part of ORG ; dancing with a partner is incompatible with the faith of some persons , while movement to music is acceptable . In the Arts and Handicraft subject , it will be necessary to exercise caution as regards illustrations of God and the prophets ; see the discussion of \u201c Illustrations \u2013 ban on images \u201d in the Guide to the ORG subject ( p. CARDINAL", "I will add that in connection with the evaluation of the ORG subject , the Ministry emphasised the importance of changing the content , methodology and organisation of the subject to ensure that as many children and young people as possible could participate in the whole subject . The reason the Ministry nevertheless decided to maintain the limited right of exemption was to be certain that the rights of parents and freedom of religion were safeguarded satisfactorily , and that they were exercised in a way that found understanding ; see page CARDINAL , first column , of Report no . DATE ) to ORG .", "I note that the right to exemption from all or parts of the compulsory Curriculum in the ORG subject in primary and lower secondary schools will result in a difference between parents in relation to the school system . Parents and pupils who wish to apply for an exemption must follow the ORG closely and apply for an exemption when they consider exemption to be necessary in order to safeguard the rights of the child and their own rights . The school initially decides whether to grant an exemption . The question is whether this difference in treatment is in pursuit of a legitimate aim and whether the aim is proportionate to the means employed .", "According to the practice of ORG , as mentioned earlier , LAW , second sentence , of LAW No . CARDINAL has been interpreted as meaning that the convictions must attain a certain level of cogency , seriousness , cohesion and importance ( see the ORG \u2019s judgments in ORG and NORP v. GPE ( DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and Valsamis [ ( cited above ] , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) ) . The statements in these judgments support the requirement by the GPE Parties that parents provide somewhat more detailed grounds when the activity from which they are applying for an exemption does not immediately appear to be practice of a specific religion or adherence to a different philosophy of life .", "If an applicant must give detailed information about his or her own religion or philosophy of life , however , this may be a violation of LAW ORG regarding the right to respect for private life and possibly also LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG regarding freedom of religion . I underscore that differential treatment on the ground of religion and political or other opinions is the core of the prohibition against discrimination .", "As I have explained , the basic reason for introducing compulsory lessons in the ORG subject was that the government and a majority of ORG considered it to be significant for the communication of a common foundation of knowledge , values and culture in primary and lower secondary school . The importance of an open , inclusive school environment was emphasised . Implementation of compulsory primary and lower secondary education must include a right to notify a desire to exercise the right to exemption , and in any event the application must state in general terms the parts of the ORG from which exemption is desired . It is clear to me that the common curriculum in the ORG subject and the requirement of a written application to exercise the right to an exemption are means of pursuing legitimate aims , and that it is not a disproportionate measure to require that parents who wish to apply for an exemption from parts of the subject must follow the ORG and give notification when they desire an exemption . I will add that this is contingent on the school authorities taking the necessary steps to enable parents to follow the Curriculum . The common , compulsory ORG requires that parents be kept well informed about the ORG subject and the programme and methods of the Curriculum at all times , and if appropriate be informed of other activities with a religious content .", "The parties have not gone into detail concerning the specific requirements regarding grounds and the grounds that are given in the various applications for exemption from the ORG subject . I shall therefore confine myself to declaring that there is no ground for assuming that a possible violation of the prohibition against discrimination in this case may have the consequence of invalidating the administrative decisions to deny full exemption from lessons in the ORG subject . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant parents and children lodged their application under the Convention with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE , CARDINAL other sets of parents who had also been parties to the above - mentioned domestic proceedings lodged together with their respective children a communication ( no . CARDINAL ) with ORG under LAW to the DATE LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the respondent ORG \u2019s objection that , as CARDINAL other sets of parents had lodged a similar complaint before the ORG , \u201c the same matter \u201d was already being examined by the latter . The ORG declared the communication admissible in so far as it concerned issues raised under Articles CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW . As to the merits , the ORG expressed the view that the present framework of the ORG subject , including the regime of exemptions , as it had been implemented in respect of the complainants ( \u201c authors \u201d ) , constituted a violation of LAW . The ORG reasoned as follows .", "\u201c CARDINAL . The main issue before the ORG is whether the compulsory instruction of the CKREE [ ] subject in NORP schools , with only limited possibility of exemption , violates the ORG right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion under LAW and more specifically the right of parents to secure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions , pursuant to LAW , paragraph CARDINAL . The scope of Article CARDINAL covers not only protection of traditional religions , but also philosophies of life , such as those held by the authors . Instruction in religion and ethics may in the ORG \u2019s view be in compliance with LAW , if carried out under the terms expressed in the ORG \u2019s General Comment No . CARDINAL on LAW \u2018 [ A]rticle CARDINAL permits public school instruction in subjects such as the general history of religions and ethics if it is given in a neutral and objective way\u2019 , and \u2018 public education that includes instruction in a particular religion or belief is inconsistent with Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , unless provision is made for non - discriminatory exemptions or alternatives that would accommodate the wishes of parents or GPE . ORG also recalls its Views in PERSON . v. GPE , where it concluded that instruction in a religious context should respect the convictions of parents and guardians who do not believe in any religion . It is within this legal context that the ORG will examine the claim .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , the ORG will examine the question of whether or not the instruction of the ORG subject is imparted in a neutral and objective way . On this issue , LAW , section DATE , stipulates that : \u2018 Teaching on the subject shall not involve preaching . Teachers of ORG and Religious and Ethical Education shall take as their point of departure the object clause of the primary and lower secondary school laid down in section CARDINAL - CARDINAL , and present NORP , other religions and philosophies of life on the basis of their distinctive characteristics . Teaching of the different topics shall be founded on the same educational PERSON In the object clause in question it is prescribed that the object of primary and lower secondary education shall be \u2018 in agreement and cooperation with the home , to help to give pupils a NORP and moral PERSON . Some of the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of the LAW referred to above make it clear that the subject gives priority to tenets of NORP over other religions and philosophies of life . In that context , ORG concluded , in its majority , that : the tuition was not neutral in value , and that the main emphasis of the subject was instruction on NORP . ORG acknowledges that the subject has elements that may be perceived as being of a religious nature , these being the activities exemption from which is granted without the parents having to give reasons . Indeed , at least some of the activities in question involve , on their face , not just education in religious knowledge , but the actual practice of a particular religion ( see para . CARDINAL ) . It also transpires from the research results invoked by the authors , and from their personal experience , that the subject has elements that are not perceived by them as being imparted in a neutral and objective way . The ORG concludes that the teaching of ORG can not be said to meet the requirement of being delivered in a neutral and objective way , unless the system of exemption in fact leads to a situation where the teaching provided to those children and families opting for such exemption will be neutral and objective .", "CARDINAL . The second question to be examined thus is whether the partial - exemption arrangements and other avenues provide \u2018 for non - discriminatory exemptions or alternatives that would accommodate the wishes of parents or GPE . ORG notes the ORG contention that the partial - exemption arrangements do not satisfy their needs , since teaching of the ORG subject leans too heavily towards religious instruction , and that partial exemption is impossible to implement in practice . Furthermore , the ORG notes that the NORP LAW provides that \u2018 on the basis of written notification from parents , pupils shall be exempted from attending those parts of the teaching at the individual school that they , on the basis of their own religion or philosophy of life , perceive as being the practice of another religion or adherence to another philosophy of life\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the existing normative framework related to the teaching of the ORG subject contains internal tensions or even contradictions . On the one hand , the LAW and the object clause in LAW contain a clear preference for NORP as compared to the role of other religions and worldviews in the educational system . On the other hand , the specific clause on exemptions in section CARDINAL of LAW is formulated in a way that in theory appears to give a full right of exemption from any part of the ORG subject that individual pupils or parents perceive as being the practice of another religion or adherence to another philosophy of life . If this clause could be implemented in a way that addresses the preference reflected in the LAW and the object clause of LAW , this could arguably be considered as complying with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers , however , that even in the abstract , the present system of partial exemption imposes a considerable burden on persons in the position of the authors , in so far as it requires them to acquaint themselves with those aspects of the subject which are clearly of a religious nature , as well as with other aspects , with a view to determining which of the other aspects they may feel a need to seek DATE and justify \u2013 exemption from . Nor would it be implausible to expect that such persons would be deterred from exercising that right , in so far as a regime of partial exemption could create problems for children which are different from those that may be present in a total exemption scheme . Indeed as the experience of the authors demonstrates , the system of exemptions does not currently protect the liberty of parents to ensure that the religious and moral education of their children is in conformity with their own convictions . In this respect , the ORG notes that the ORG subject combines education on religious knowledge with practising a particular religious belief , e.g. learning by heart of prayers , singing religious hymns or attendance at religious services ( para . CARDINAL ) . While it is true that in these cases parents may claim exemption from these activities by ticking a box on a form , the ORG scheme does not ensure that education of religious knowledge and religious practice are separated in a way that makes the exemption scheme practicable .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the difficulties encountered by the authors , in particular the fact that PERSON and PERSON had to recite religious texts in the context of a DATE celebration although they were enrolled in the exemption scheme , as well as the loyalty conflicts experienced by the children , amply illustrate these difficulties . Furthermore , the requirement to give reasons for exempting children from lessons focusing on imparting religious knowledge and the absence of clear indications as to what kind of reasons would be accepted creates a further obstacle for parents who seek to ensure that their children are not exposed to certain religious ideas . In the ORG \u2019s view , the present framework of ORG , including the current regime of exemptions , as it has been implemented in respect of the authors , constitutes a violation of LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW in their respect . \u201d", "In view of this finding , the ORG was of the opinion that no additional issue arose under other parts of LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . It gave the respondent ORG DATE within which to provide \u201c information about the measures taken to give effect to the ORG \u2019s Views \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the light of ORG \u201c Views \u201d , the NORP government decided to take measures to modify the ORG subject , and notably to propose changes to LAW and the Curriculum . According to Circular F-CARDINAL - CARDINAL , this included the following elements .", "( i ) Deleting in section DATE ) the reference to the NORP object clause in CARDINAL .", "( ii ) Giving the various religions and philosophies of life the same qualitative description in the aims of the subject , while maintaining the current proportions of various religions and philosophies of life in the central teaching material .", "( iii ) Making the provision on partial exemption in current section DATE ) the subject of a separate provision , ensuring that the exemption arrangement take sufficient account of the GPE rights and the need to protect minorities ; simplifying the provisions on applications for exemption ; specifying in the LAW the obligation of schools to provide information and circulating information to schools about the practice of the exemption arrangement .", "( iv ) Drawing up a new curriculum making a clear division between those elements that could be viewed as the practice of religions and those elements that could not , while maintaining the distribution between the different parts of the subject .", "( v ) PERSON the choice of working methods in the introduction to the Curriculum and in the guidelines for the subject , in order to limit the possibility that parts of the teaching could be experienced as the practice of a religion .", "Varied and engaging working methods should contribute to the dissemination of all aspects of the subject . It was emphasised that working methods that could be perceived as being close to the practice of a religion required special care on the part of teachers , including the provision of adapted teaching .", "( vi ) The proposed changes would be implemented from DATE . The introduction of the measures from DATE generated the need for strengthening the skills and competence of the teachers . The government would commence the work of developing skills and competence as soon as a new curriculum had been finalised .", "( vii ) A high degree of flexibility should be displayed in relation to GPE wishes for adapted teaching for their child / children . If necessary , the option of full exemption on a temporary basis should be available for those parents who so wished pending implementation of the proposed permanent arrangements .", "On the basis of the government \u2019s decision , the ORG started reviewing the necessary changes . Following proposals by ORG on DATE , endorsed by the government on DATE ( Ot.prp.nr.CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) , on DATE ORG adopted certain amendments and additions to LAW DATE which came into force with immediate effect . As a result , a few adjustments were made to section DATE ) ( notably , the word \u201c faith \u201d was replaced by \u201c understanding of NORP \u201d ; the requirement of thoroughness was extended to knowledge of other NORP communities ) and the reference in section DATE ) to the object clause in section CARDINAL - CARDINAL was deleted ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Moreover , the provisions on partial exemption in section CARDINAL ) were moved to a new and separate section CARDINAL - CARDINALA , with some clarifying additions and changes . This included , inter alia , replacing the expression \u201c religious activities \u201d ( in former section DATE ) ) with the word \u201c activities \u201d and extending the ground for partial exemption to cover also activities that the parents , from the point of view of their own religion or philosophy of life , perceived as being offensive or insulting ( in addition to those that they perceived as amounting to the practice of another religion or adherence to another philosophy of life ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW DATE are cited above .", "CARDINAL .

The reasons for the statute state that the differentiated teaching shall be provided according to the same curriculum , and is not to be differentiation of knowledge but differentiation of activities . Since there is no exemption from knowledge of the subject , pupils with an exemption shall receive instruction within the framework of the curriculum .", "In cases to which partial exemption applies , the alternative is not another subject or another curriculum , but other activities and other ways of working with the ORG syllabus . The school must convey the knowledge in question to the pupils by means of a different methodological approach . Exemption can nevertheless be granted from certain main topics which entail specific activities . An example is the main topic in which pupils are required to learn the CARDINAL Commandments by heart ( NORP faith and ethics , sixth grade ) . One can not , however , be exempted from knowing about the CARDINAL Commandments .", "The differentiated course of instruction must have regard for the pupils\u2019 religious or philosophical background , and help as far as possible to ensure that all pupils have worked with the same areas of knowledge in the grade in question , but using adjusted working methods .", "How great the need for differentiation is depends locally on", "\u2013 which religious or philosophical groups the parents belong to , and", "\u2013 what kinds of activity they request exemption from .", "...", "CARDINAL .

Hymns can be incorporated into song periods , when they are placed in their musical context and seen as an important part of our sung cultural heritage .", "Pupils who have been granted an exemption for hymn singing must be given other ways of working with hymns , as the case may be in separate groups . They can for instance listen to a hymn and be given such assignments as what is the hymn text about ? Can you relate the content of the hymn to a particular festival , and if so , why ? Why is this hymn important within the NORP tradition ? Another possibility would be to use hymns and songs as a theme for project work , involving looking more closely at songs , hymns and music and their functions in the different religions .", "See also the Guide to the ORG subject , p.

When the plan is presented to the parents , it gives them the opportunity to consider the need , if any , for exemption from particular activities .", "To request partial exemption , parents must send written notification to the school . They must state which activities in the school \u2019s teaching they perceive as the exercise of another religion or adherence to another philosophy of life . Parents should then decide whether to opt for the general offer of differentiation , if the school has made such an offer , or , in addition , if appropriate , ask for a more individually adapted offer of differentiation .
