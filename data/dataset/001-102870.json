In DATE in the context of a much wider criminal investigation involving many suspects \u2013 a preliminary judicial investigation ( gerechtelijk vooronderzoek ) was opened against the applicant , who was suspected of participation in a criminal organisation . On DATE the investigating judge ( rechter - commissaris ) of ORG ( rechtbank ) authorised the PERSON public prosecutor to issue a garnishee order ( conservatoir beslag ) against the applicant in the context of this investigation , the scope of which had been extended to offences under LAW ( PERSON ) . Also in this context , a house in GPE owned by the applicant 's daughter was searched on DATE , during which the front door , the alarm installation and bedroom furniture were damaged . This search took place under the direction of the GPE investigating judge and on the basis of an authorisation issued by ORG . A number of objects found during this search were seized under the garnishee order , including CARDINAL cars : a ORG and a ORG . The ORG was returned to the lease company that owned it on DATE . The applicant was charged with various offences under LAW and LAW ( LOC en GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant of various charges brought against him and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and payment of a fine of MONEY ( \u201c NLG \u201d ) . The applicant lodged an appeal .", "CARDINAL . The Mercedes car seized on DATE was sold at a public auction on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE accepted the appeal filed by the applicant , quashed the judgment of DATE and acquitted the applicant of all charges , finding that they had not been lawfully and convincingly proven ( niet wettig en overtuigend bewezen ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant lodged a claim with ORG under LAW of LAW ( PERSON ) , seeking the reimbursement of an amount of more than NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for costs and expenses incurred by him in the course of the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG The GPE awarded the applicant LAW for costs and expenses incurred , and rejected his claim under LAW for the remainder . No further appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the proceeds of the sale of the Mercedes car plus accrued statutory interest were paid to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , considering that the criminal proceedings taken against him had not only entailed the incurring of legal costs and expenses but had also caused him and his daughter pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage , the applicant and his daughter brought civil proceedings against ORG before ORG of GPE . Alleging a wrongful act ( onrechtmatige daad ) within the meaning of Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of the Civil Code ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) , the applicant and his daughter claimed that a body for whose acts the ORG was liable had acted in a wrongful manner towards them by having brought criminal proceedings against the applicant , and by using criminal investigation tools ( search and seizure ) on the basis of a suspicion that had been unfounded from the outset .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed compensation in the amount of NLG CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage and NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL for pecuniary damage ( loss of profits , extra accountants ' and financing costs , costs incurred in relation to the CARDINAL cars seized ) . The applicant 's daughter claimed compensation of NLG CARDINAL for non - pecuniary damage and NLG CARDINAL for pecuniary damage caused to her house and furniture in the course of the search of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's claims . It considered that , according to the relevant case - law under Article CARDINAL:CARDINAL of LAW , the institution of criminal proceedings or use of criminal investigation tools could only be regarded as wrongful when such proceedings had been brought or such tools used in breach of the law or with disregard of fundamental requirements ( in strijd met PERSON met verontachtzaming van fundamentele vereisten ) , or where it appeared retrospectively from the criminal investigation \u2013 either from the final decision or otherwise \u2013 that the suspicion on the basis of which the criminal proceedings had been brought or the criminal investigation tool used had been unjustified ( dat de verdenking CARDINAL onrechte heeft bestaan ) . It held that the first situation did not arise in the applicant 's case as , during the preliminary judicial investigation against the applicant , the investigating judges of GPE and GPE and ORG had given an affirmative answer to the question whether there was a reasonable suspicion against the applicant and that consequently it had to be assumed that a reasonable suspicion had existed at the time . Furthermore , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG had found that the criminal investigation methods used in the applicant 's case had not been illicit . ORG found that the second situation did not arise in the applicant 's case either , as it did not follow from the applicant 's acquittal or from the contents of the criminal case - file as made available to the court that the applicant had not carried out the acts of which he had been suspected . Consequently , and absent an automatic right to compensation for lawful acts on the part of the ORG in the context of the criminal investigation against him , the only possibility for the applicant to obtain compensation in connection with the criminal proceedings brought against him and the use of criminal investigation methods in this investigation was to avail himself of the possibilities provided under LAW , DATE , CARDINAL and FAC of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant 's daughter , ORG found no indication that there had ever been any suspicion of her involvement in the facts on which the charges brought against the applicant were based . Consequently , it found that the damage suffered by her \u2013 caused by criminal investigation methods directed against her father \u2013 should not be borne by her . On the basis of the elements before it , ORG assessed this damage at NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ordered GPE to pay this amount to the applicant 's daughter . It rejected the remainder of both plaintiffs ' claims .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant and his daughter lodged an appeal with ORG . ORG lodged a crossappeal ( incidenteel beroep ) .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG quashed the ruling of DATE but only in respect of the compensation award to the applicant 's daughter , which it reduced to MONEY , rejecting the remainder of her claim for lack of substantiation . It upheld the impugned ruling for the remainder . Referring to the constant case - law of ORG ( PERSON ) , ORG held , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c DATE . ... ORG has rightly declined to consider the acquittal by the criminal court to be of decisive importance but instead considered whether the criminal investigation \u2013 the final judgment or otherwise \u2013 demonstrated that [ the applicant ] had not committed the crimes with which he had been charged . According to the consistent case - law of ORG this does not contravene the presumption of innocence of LAW . The LAW case - law cited by [ the plaintiffs ] , which does not substantially differ from the LAW case - law taken into account by ORG in its consistent case - law , does not shed any different light on the case . Nor can allegation that the criminal case file is inaccessible , if correct , can not lead to the conclusion that the cited criterion is applicable .", "CARDINAL . To the extent that [ the plaintiffs ] also wish to argue that [ the applicant ] has been prosecuted without justification because , as they state , no reasonable suspicion of guilt of a criminal offence in his respect existed , ORG notes the following . For the search and the garnishee order permission was granted by ORG and the investigating judge , respectively . In the present proceedings it can not be successfully argued that these judicial authorities in so doing took an incorrect decision . That would , after all , imply that it was for the civil court to examine whether the criminal court had taken a correct decision and this is incompatible with the closed system of legal remedies ( gesloten system van rechtsmiddelen ) [ in the GPE legal order ] . It has not been argued , nor is it apparent , that there are special circumstances which might justify making an exception to this principle .", "CARDINAL . NORP The argument that [ the applicant ] has been prosecuted without justification because a reasonable suspicion of guilt was lacking has hardly at all been substantiated by [ the applicant ] , whereas in the case at hand the onus of proof lies with [ the applicant ] and not the State . [ The applicant ] has only submitted that the suspicion in this case rested solely on the fact that [ the applicant ] knew the co - suspect F. and on some meaningless taps . This is however insufficient , given the contents of the [ items of evidence set out in the judgment of DATE by ORG as submitted by the defendant in response to the plaintiffs ' summons in the present proceedings ] which could give rise to the suspicion that PERSON and F. were involved in trafficking hashish ... and that [ the applicant ] had regular \u2013 business \u2013 contacts with ORG", "CARDINAL . ORG agrees with ORG that the criminal investigation \u2013 the final judgment or otherwise \u2013 does not show that [ the applicant ] was innocent ( onschuldig ) of the crimes charged . ORG notes that such a conclusion can only be drawn if the suspect 's innocence is reasonably obvious ( de onschuld van de verdachte met enige evidentie QUANTITY ) . This is not the case here given \u2013 on the CARDINAL hand \u2013 the items of evidence [ as set out in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ] and \u2013 on the other \u2013 the absence from the criminal case file , in so far as made available [ in the present proceedings ] , of convincing disculpatory material ( overtuigend ontlastend materiaal ) . There is no need to consider , as ORG did , whether the evidence relied on points in a different direction [ i.e. to the applicant 's guilt ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his daughter lodged an appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) DATE limited to points of law and procedural conformity \u2013 with ORG . On DATE , referring to LAW ( Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie ) and without stating any further reasons , ORG rejected this appeal in cassation as not prompting a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity and legal development .", "CARDINAL .

This PERSON proposes to introduce CARDINAL specific and simple procedure for examining such compensation claims filed by different categories of claimants ( not only former suspects but also non - suspect victims , for instance bystanders hit by a ricocheted bullet fired by a police officer ) . The pertaining Explanatory Memorandum explains the current situation under GPE civil law in respect of former suspects as follows :", "\u201c As the law currently stands , a former suspect can only claim compensation for damages for lawful government action in criminal proceedings when it concerns ' wrongfulness ex post ' . This means that a former suspect is entitled to compensation when , in retrospect , the government action is wrongful on the basis of this suspect 's demonstrated innocence ( gebleken onschuld ) . However , there is only demonstrated innocence when ' it is demonstrated by the ruling of the criminal court or otherwise by the documents relating to the criminal procedure that has not ended with a finding that the charges have been proven ( bewezenverklaring ) that the suspect is innocent and that the suspicion on which the action of the police or justice authorities was based was unfounded ' ( ORG , DATE , ...

PERSON ) . This applies also for those cases in which the accused has been acquitted , because an acquittal does not always mean that an accused was innocent . In some cases it is no longer possible to find out during the criminal proceedings what exactly did happen . For instance because witnesses give conflicting evidence on essential points and the accused 's denial is supported by other statements .
