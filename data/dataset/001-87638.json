According to the record of the applicant \u2019s body search undertaken on the spot , certified by CARDINAL ORG signatures , a gun was found tucked in the belt of his trousers . After the search , the applicant was immediately conveyed to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s version of events , however , he was never searched and nor were the reasons for his arrest explained to him at the time . The record of the search was allegedly drawn up ex post facto and presented to him only at the ORG , TIME after his arrest in the street . He refused to sign the record of arrest , claiming that it had been fabricated .", "CARDINAL . At the same time the applicant contended that he had first learnt about the nature of the charges against him when glancing at the television in the room of the ORG used for questioning . The TIME news of DATE reported , quoting the investigator in charge of the case , that the applicant , \u201c PERSON . the \u2018 Elephant of ORG , a well - known criminal and ... recidivist ... had been arrested for the unlawful transport and storage of arms in large quantities . \u201d Only later was the applicant presented with the investigator \u2019s decision , dated TIME DATE , opening a criminal case and declaring him a suspect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , without the applicant \u2019s knowledge , the police conducted a search of his home in the presence of his family members .

The applicant \u2019s wife refused to sign the record of the search , claiming that the police had planted firearms in their home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG in GPE validated the results of the CARDINAL above - mentioned searches .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with the unlawful transportation and storage of firearms and ammunition . He pleaded \u201c not guilty \u201d but promised to cooperate with the investigation . On DATE the prosecutor requested that the applicant be remanded in custody , arguing as follows :", "\u2019s ] guilt . He is not sincere in his dealings with the investigators . There exists a suspicion that he might interfere with the establishment of the truth . The possibility that he will abscond can not be ruled out . A number of investigative actions have to be undertaken ... \u201d", "No were relied on , or specific explanations put forward , in support of the above assertions .", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE , the applicant denounced the unfounded nature of the charges and stated that his family , job and fixed place of residence were guarantees of his appearance for trial . He reaffirmed his readiness to cooperate with the investigation and stated that he was suffering from diabetes . The FAC ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention for DATE in the following terms :", "\u201c ... Having examined [ various pieces of evidence ] ... [ the court ] has come to the conclusion that the collected evidence discloses a substantiated suspicion that the accused committed the offence in question . The evidence has been collected in conformity with the procedural norms .", "\u201c [ In the court \u2019s ] opinion , the prosecutor \u2019s request is substantiated , and granting it would be lawful since the accused has been charged with an offence carrying PERCENT DATE imprisonment . The seized gun has to be identified ; it remains to be seen whether it has been the subject of suspicion in any other crimes . The suspicion that the accused , if released , might interfere with the establishment of the truth or , in view of the prospect of punishment , abscond is substantiated . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , requesting his release on the same grounds as had previously been put to ORG . He submitted that the prosecution had not proved that there existed grounds for a reasonable suspicion that he might either abscond or negatively influence the investigation pending trial . The applicant also referred to his diabetes as an argument for release . The prosecutor replied that the appeal was unsubstantiated . A number of investigative measures had to be undertaken , and the applicant \u2019s release might conflict with the interests of the investigation . The prosecution noted that no medical certificate proving the applicant \u2019s disease had been submitted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG upheld the detention order of DATE . It noted that the applicant should remain in custody on the basis of the circumstances \u201c well argued in the prosecutor \u2019s submissions \u201d .

Both the initial detention order of DATE and the appeal decision of DATE endorsed the fact that firearms and ammunition had been discovered on the applicant \u2019s body and at his home on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer requested an official expert medical opinion on the applicant \u2019s condition .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer requested the prosecution to include in the criminal case file the written statements of CARDINAL persons whom he had questioned himself . Some of those persons , having been eyewitnesses to the applicant \u2019s arrest in the street on DATE , stated that the applicant had not been searched on the spot . Others , being witnesses to the search of the applicant \u2019s home , testified that the police had planted the firearms there . The lawyer also requested that those witnesses be interviewed by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator in charge of the applicant \u2019s case refused to include the above - mentioned statements as evidence in the file or to interview their authors . He reasoned that , since all of the witnesses who had allegedly been eyewitnesses to the applicant \u2019s arrest were women , they would have been uninterested in what had been happening in the street and their testimonies , being moreover \u201c superficial , incomprehensive and unsubstantiated \u201d , were not trustworthy . The investigator suggested that those female witnesses might have been influenced and recalled that , in any case , the search on the spot had already been confirmed by other ORG signatures . As to the witnesses to the search of the applicant \u2019s home , the investigator considered that , as they were his neighbours , they were not impartial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s lawyer challenged that decision before the prosecutor , complaining , inter alia , that the investigator had discriminated against the female witnesses . The prosecutor dismissed the appeal on DATE and instead ordered that the police officers who had been involved in the applicant \u2019s arrest and in the search of his house be questioned .", "CARDINAL . An alternative expert medical opinion of DATE confirmed that the applicant was suffering from a progressive type of diabetes and needed intensive insulin treatment .

On DATE the investigation was terminated and the case sent to the NORP - Saburtalo ORG . During the trial , which opened on DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer complained of the prosecution \u2019s refusal to admit to the file the above - mentioned CARDINAL testimonies ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He also referred to the fact that the witnesses for the prosecution , whose signatures certified the record of the applicant \u2019s search , had changed their testimony in favour of the latter . In fact , when interviewed by ORG , those persons said that they had not witnessed the actual process by which the gun on the applicant \u2019s body had been revealed .", "CARDINAL . In its verdict of CARDINAL DATE , the NORP - Saburtalo ORG convicted the applicant of the unlawful transportation and storage of firearms and ammunition . In its opening part , the verdict referred to the applicant as an unemployed person . The court did not accept the prosecution witnesses\u2019 altered testimonies , considering that they had been influenced by the applicant \u2019s authority as a criminal ringleader . As disclosed by the record of the hearing , the prosecutor submitted DATE subsequently endorsed by the court \u2013 that the applicant \u2019s \u201c donation \u201d of CARDINAL NORP laris ( ORG CARDINAL ) to ORG of the Law - Enforcement Agencies \u201d should be considered as a mitigating factor . The facts that the applicant had had no prior convictions and was suffering from diabetes were also endorsed as mitigating circumstances . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , suspended , and was immediately released from the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the verdict before ORG , seeking an acquittal . However , on DATE he informed ORG that he had lost interest in the proceedings and withdrew his appeal .
