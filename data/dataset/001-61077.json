The territory of the GPE includes the estuaries of the LOC , PERSON and PERSON , all of which flow into LOC at or near the town of GPE . These rivers have long been used for the transport of merchandise to and from a large part of the north - western and central NORP hinterland , and in particular the vast industrial area situated along LOC in GPE . Over DATE this geographical situation has allowed the GPE to become one of LOC \u2019s major transport hubs , with GPE harbour and FAC , near GPE , developing into important transit points for goods .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE worldwide economic growth , the opening of the borders between the ORG countries and the opening up to foreign trade of central and east NORP countries have led to an increase in the quantity of merchandise transported through the GPE and , consequently , in the volume of traffic .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the volume of transport by inland waterways , rail and pipelines has largely remained stable . It is essentially road transport which has absorbed the increase . This is due to various factors , such as the greater availability and convenience of roads as compared to railways and waterways and the increased tendency of industry to have raw and unfinished materials delivered as and when needed instead of keeping stocks .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the government decided on a policy of maintaining and further improving the competitiveness of GPE harbour as LOC \u2019s main entry and exit port , as compared to its major rivals , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . At the same time it was considered important to prevent , and if possible reduce , congestion of the roads and damage to the environment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with section CARDINAL of ORG ( Wet op de Raad van State ) and upon a proposal of the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Verkeer en Waterstaat ) and the Minister for ORG , PERSON en Milieubeheer ) , the Queen transmitted ORG ( PERSON ) to ORG for an advisory opinion .", "CARDINAL . The Transport Infrastructure Planning Bill was intended to provide a legislative framework for the supra - regional planning of new major transport infrastructure ( roads , railways , canals ) and major modifications to existing transport infrastructure with a view to simplifying procedures for securing the cooperation of the provincial , regional and local authorities whose territories might be affected . An additional effect was intended to be the concentration of legal remedies in such a way that CARDINAL single appeal could be lodged with ORG against a decision of central government and all related decisions of subordinate authorities , obviating the need for a plurality of appeals before both the ordinary courts and ORG against decisions and plans of local authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG transmitted its advisory opinion to the government on DATE . Its opening paragraph reads :", "\u201c ORG fully acknowledges the problems that the signatories to ORG wish to resolve . It often concerns large , technically complex and expensive infrastructure projects . These must not only be balanced against diverse and weighty interests relating to traffic and transport , road safety , town and country planning and the environment , but in addition it is desirable to have the widest possible public support for these projects . The current decision - making procedure \u2013 entailing a non - statutory routing determination following which final decisions are only made in accordance with the town and country planning procedure , against which an appeal may be lodged with a judge DATE can take much time . Furthermore , where a number of provincial and municipal bodies are involved , the decision - making process is diffused over several regional and local zoning plans . ORG therefore shares the government \u2019s concern about the outlined problems . It will examine hereafter whether , in its opinion , the proposals made will in practice sufficiently resolve the problems and whether the concomitant disadvantages are acceptable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its opinion ORG noted , among other things , the absence of any binding time - limits for the administrative authorities . It expressed doubts as to whether the procedure under the new bill , if enacted , would be any shorter than the aggregate of separate procedures necessary hitherto . It also considered that the new bill created uncertainty at the lower levels of government ( the provinces , the regional surface waterboards ( waterschappen ) and the municipalities ) by bypassing the planning structures of those lower bodies ; in addition , insufficient weight was given to the justifiable interests of individuals . It found that the considerable limitation of legal protection constituted an important objection to the new bill .", "CARDINAL . Point CARDINAL of the advisory opinion reads :", "\u201c Having reached the end of the examination of the legal protection in the framework of this bill , from which it can be seen that ORG has serious objections to the removal of a routing determination [ trac\u00e9vaststelling ] from general town and country planning considerations , it nevertheless wishes to point out that , when ORG leaves aside here the problem dealt with under point CARDINAL ( length of the decision - making process under the bill ) , those serious objections would be less weighty if the bill only related to routing determinations of such exceptional ( supra)national importance that it must be clear to anyone that in the case in question the provincial , regional and local interests should yield to them . In that case , the routing plans [ trac\u00e9s ] referred to in section DATE should be explicitly mentioned in the bill . It would be preferable to reconsider the bill in this sense . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG made a number of suggestions for improving the drafting of the bill before it was transmitted to ORG . Its final conclusion reads :", "\u201c ORG advises you not to send this bill to ORG of ORG until the above observations have been taken into account . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In their reply of CARDINAL DATE the Minister for ORG and the Minister for ORG noted DATE as regards the doubts expressed by ORG as to whether the new procedure would be appreciably shorter than the former DATE among other things that it might take a very long time to obtain the cooperation of the local authorities . It was also stated that the local authorities were involved in all stages of the procedure , being informed and consulted as the need arose ; if it was necessary to compel their cooperation , this was done at the final stage , that of the routing decision . Legal protection of the justified interests of individuals was sufficiently guaranteed in the form of a single appeal , on legal grounds , against a routing decision .", "CARDINAL . As to the remarks made under point CARDINAL of the advisory opinion of ORG , the ministerial response reads as follows :", "\u201c With the approval of ORG ( decision of DATE ) , we decided to include in the bill a separate regulation for large projects of national importance . In line with this , the transitory arrangement referred to in section FAC will be concentrated on the high - speed railway and the \u2018 Betuweroute\u2019 [ railway ] . The original section DATE was included exclusively in view of these projects and can now be dropped , as a provision will be devoted to these projects . Since , with the inclusion of the special procedure for large projects and the above - indicated transitional arrangement , the bill will be further amended , we find it desirable to consult ORG on this . The amendments to the bill will therefore be submitted for advice to ORG in the form of a ministerial memorandum of amendments . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister for Transport and Communications made a number of changes to the bill in the light of ORG criticism . The amendments were submitted to ORG for advice on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its advisory opinion of CARDINAL DATE , ORG considered , inter alia :", "\u201c ... it desirable to indicate in section CARDINAL g that the notions \u2018 high - speed GPE and \u2018 Betuweroute\u2019 railway relate to specific [ railway ] connections between specifically named places . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ministerial reply of CARDINAL DATE to this recommendation states :", "\u201c This advice has been followed . It is now indicated in section CARDINAL g that the high - speed railway relates to FAC border route , and the \u2018 Betuweroute\u2019 [ railway ] to FAC route . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The government then submitted the bill to ORG ( ORG ) of ORG , together with ORG advisory opinion and the ORG comments . ORG eventually entered into force on DATE . It contains no specific mention of the high - speed railway or FAC , but does provide for a special procedure for projects of national importance .", "CARDINAL . An existing railway through the LAW region ( the area circumscribed by the rivers GPE , PERSON and GPE ) DATE known as the \u201c Betuwe line \u201d ( GPE ) DATE links the city of GPE to the town of PERSON . It was , and still is , mainly used for passenger traffic and is operated at a loss . As early as DATE a government committee suggested converting it for use solely for the transport of goods , extending it as far as the town of GPE and connecting it to the NORP railway system . A study commissioned by ORG ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) and published in DATE concluded that the environmental impact would be unacceptable and that the capacity of such a railway line would be insufficient .", "CARDINAL . This led the government to reject that idea . Instead , the government decided to investigate the possibility of building a new railway through the Betuwe , to be known as the \u201c LAW \u201d , along the LOC motorway . The ORG was required to prepare an environmental impact report ( milieu - effectrapportage ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for ORG together presented the first draft of the outline planning decision ( PERSON ) within the meaning of section CARDINAL of ORG ( Wet op de Ruimtelijke Ordening ) , which later became known as \u201c Outline Planning Decision \u2013 Part CARDINAL \u201d . The environmental impact report prepared by the PERSON was appended to this document . Pursuant to the then applicable section CARDINAL of ORG , it was laid open for public inspection , notice of its publication being given through ORG ) and the media . Anyone interested could then make his or her views known . The time - limit for doing so was DATE . CARDINAL reactions were received .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE Minister for ORG signed an agreement with his NORP counterpart , the Federal Minister for Transport , for increased cooperation in the matter of cross - border railway communication . The agreement provided \u2013 subject to the conclusion of procedures prescribed by national law \u2013 for , inter alia , the building of a new railway from GPE to the NORP border via Zevenaar . There were to be CARDINAL border crossings , one at ORG and the other at FAC . The agreement also provided for corresponding measures to be taken on the NORP side and for a time frame .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the government published a document entitled \u201c Reacties op de Ontwerp Planologische Kernbeslissing Betuweroute \u201d ( Reactions to the Betuweroute Outline Planning Decision ) . It contained an overview of the reactions to LAW sent in by individuals and the results of further consultations and discussions with local government bodies , that is provinces , municipalities and regional surface waterboards . Advice obtained from ORG ( Nederlands - Duitse Commissie voor de Ruimtelijke Ordening ) , ORG ( GPE milieu - effectrapportage ) , ORG ( PERSON ) and ORG ( Overlegorgaan Verkeersinfrastructuur ) was also included in this document , which became known as LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the government published their views on the PERSON project and transmitted it to ORG of ORG for approval . This document became known as LAW . After deliberations , ORG of ORG sent ORG \u2013 Part CARDINAL back to the government with its comments .", "CARDINAL . The government made certain modifications . The resulting document , which became known as LAW , was submitted to ORG of ORG on DATE for approval .", "CARDINAL . Outline Planning Decision \u2013 Part CARDINAL was approved by ORG of ORG on DATE and , on DATE , by ORG ( PERSON ) of ORG . It became known thereafter as LAW and came into force after its publication in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Outline Planning Decision \u2013 Part CARDINAL contained an explanatory memorandum setting out the need for the PERSON , as perceived by the government , and giving reasons for the choices made . It was stated that GPE , the Netherlands\u2019 main port , and FAC , now served most of the NORP continent and that the increase in the volume of transport could not be absorbed by inland waterway traffic alone . Moreover , much of the NORP hinterland could not be reached by water . Road traffic could not be the only alternative , as it was relatively expensive , uneconomical over long distances and environmentally unfriendly . Furthermore , in much of eastern LOC the railway infrastructure was better developed and in a better state of repair than the roads .", "CARDINAL . Other NORP countries , including GPE , GPE and the NORP countries , were investing heavily in railways in order to relieve the roads . GPE had undertaken to connect its railway system to the PERSON , and would give effect to this undertaking as soon as the decision to build the PERSON was taken . The transport policies developed by ORG also provided for the development of new railways .", "CARDINAL . The explanatory memorandum contained summaries of studies \u2013 additional to that undertaken by the ORG in DATE that had been commissioned by the government , namely a study on the macro - economic and social effects by PERSON and a micro - economic analysis by ORG . Both studies concluded that the PERSON would be profitable . They were scrutinised by ORG ( ORG ) . The results of this appraisal were also rendered in summary form . The government considered that although the conclusions of ORG were rather more guarded , they too indicated that the project was viable .", "CARDINAL . Other alternatives were taken into consideration . These included increasing the capacity of an existing railway running from GPE through the southern province of GPE to GPE and from there into GPE ( the \u201c GPE \u201d ) , used mainly for passenger traffic , and making it more suitable for the transport of goods . This alternative was rejected on the ground that it would require building CARDINAL extra tracks . Moreover , the urban density along the PERSON route being CARDINAL times as high as that along the projected PERSON , this would cause severe and unacceptable problems .", "CARDINAL . Alternatives not involving railways , which had been suggested after LAW Part CARDINAL had been laid open for public inspection , were discarded in view of the need to connect to the existing railway infrastructure in the rest of LOC . The importance of inland navigation was nonetheless recognised , and it was stated that in both the GPE and GPE inland port facilities were undergoing further development .", "CARDINAL . Alternative methods of constructing the railway had been suggested in the wake of ORG . Many of those who had stated their views on the matter had expressed a preference for an underground tunnel or for open tracks sunk below ground level . These were considered , but rejected as the cost would be prohibitive . A traditional construction was chosen consisting of rail tracks resting on a sand base and located mostly at ground level , a raised or lowered track being envisaged only for locations where such was called for by considerations of safety or environmental impact . Similarly , conventional rather than innovative technology was chosen .", "CARDINAL . Outline Planning Decision \u2013 Part CARDINAL provided for a twin - track railway . Its location was fixed as far as possible within a horizontal band of QUANTITY Within this band limited adjustment to local conditions would be possible , it being understood that any additional features such as drainage ditches or other traffic infrastructure might have to be located outside it . The actual route was set out in sketch plans , with reasons being given for the choices made and for the rejection of alternatives .", "CARDINAL . Consideration was given to possible harmful effects . Thus , although under the legislation in force ( LAW geluidhinder spoorwegen ) the maximum permissible noise level was QUANTITY ampere ( dBA ) on the outside walls of residential buildings , a \u201c preferential noise level \u201d of CARDINAL dBA would be applied in anticipation of stricter standards which were expected to come into force in DATE . Where it appeared in practice that this could not be achieved , noise levels would be reduced by means of screens . Exceptionally , noise levels of CARDINAL dBA might be tolerated at specific locations , but even there they were not to exceed CARDINAL dBA inside residential buildings with the windows closed and ventilation apertures open . Although there might be an accumulation of noise from the NORP motorway and FAC , it was considered that the railway would contribute less noise than the louder motorway traffic , so that it would be possible , by screening and other measures , to reduce the combined noise levels to CARDINAL dBA .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL residential buildings were found to be located within QUANTITY of the projected railway track . It was estimated that DATE of these were so close to the projected track that noise levels would compel the termination of their residential function . Studies had also been conducted regarding the vibration likely to be caused and the standards to be applied on this point . Further studies would be undertaken with a view to taking constructive measures aimed at reducing vibration levels .", "CARDINAL . The danger that might be result from the operation of the Betuweroute railway was also considered , although not in detail . It was intended to build the railway so that the \u201c individual risk \u201d would be no greater than CARDINAL near residential areas . The \u201c group risks \u201d would be kept \u201c as low as reasonably achievable \u201d . Specific measures would be set out in the routing decision .", "CARDINAL . There had been an audit of the costs of the project as proposed by the government , which , as was estimated at DATE cost levels , would amount to a total of MONEY ( NLG ) . Of this sum a portion of NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL would be paid out of the ORG budget . The remaining NLG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL would be raised from other sources , such as the financial markets , windfall profits from the sale of natural gas and funds supplied by the ORG . The total figure included a sum of NLG CARDINAL occasioned by changes imposed by ORG of ORG and NLG CARDINAL required to meet objections and special requests made by individuals and local authorities .", "CARDINAL . A new government took office on CARDINAL DATE , which in pursuance of agreements reached between the coalition parties reconsidered the PERSON plan in its entirety . After obtaining the views of a parliamentary committee ( the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the new government decided that the plan should go ahead . Its views were made public in a letter sent by ORG and ORG to ORG of ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG of ORG endorsed the government \u2019s views .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the procedure for projects of national importance under LAW which had come into force on DATE , a preliminary draft of the routing decision \u2013 containing the determination of the exact routing of the planned railway \u2013 was laid open for public inspection in DATE , together with an addition to the environmental impact report and a survey of expected noise levels . CARDINAL reactions were received from individuals , nongovernmental organisations and local - government bodies . These led to modifications , which were incorporated into the draft routing decision .", "CARDINAL . The draft routing decision was published on DATE and laid open for public inspection until DATE . CARDINAL reactions were received from individuals and local - government bodies . Changes were considered , and eventually incorporated into the final routing decision , in so far as they did not affect the projected route , did not require additional expenditure and did not affect the interests of other parties . Changes made included , for certain locations , noise - reduction measures in addition to those foreseen in LAW .", "CARDINAL . The routing decision was finalised on DATE by the Minister for Transport and Communications in agreement with the Minister for ORG . It covered most of the projected track of the new FAC , with the exception of a number of locations \u2013 not concerned by the present case \u2013 for which further planning was required .", "CARDINAL . NORP The routing decision comprises CARDINAL Articles , creating a legal framework for the measures required , and a set of detailed maps with explanations . In its published form it is accompanied by an extensive explanatory part setting out the outline of the choices made .", "CARDINAL . A series of tests had been carried out from which it appeared that goods trains made rather more noise than had initially been estimated . It was stated that a reduction of noise levels was expected from modifications to the rolling stock ( reduction at source ) . However , in case these should not be sufficient , screens would be erected where necessary regardless of the expected reductions at source . Further reductions were expected from the use of modern concrete sleepers instead of the conventional wooden ones on which the initial noise level assessments had been based . Finally , if the noise levels still turned out to be too high in practice , other measures would be considered , such as further modifications to rolling stock , avoiding operations at TIME and lowering maximum speeds . The standards to be applied , including those with regard to the accumulation of noise caused by the new railway and the NORP motorway , were those set out in FAC CARDINAL . Stricter standards would be applied in the vicinity of sensitive locations such as hospitals and schools and certain designated rural areas ( stiltegebieden DATE \u201c silent areas \u201d ) . The residential function of buildings where the noise levels would be excessive would have to be terminated . A detailed report setting out the noise levels for each municipality was appended to the routing decision .", "CARDINAL . Compensating measures for the preservation of the environment and the existing landscape were to include , among other things , the provision of culverts ( to enable wildlife and cattle to cross underneath the railway ) and of appropriate vegetation . Special measures were also envisaged for the protection of any known archaeological sites .", "CARDINAL . Consideration was also given to special measures required by the nature of the subsoil , which provided less support in the western part of the country than in the east ; hence the need for additional supporting shoulders in certain areas . The need , at some locations , for cleaning polluted soil was noted .", "CARDINAL . Indications were given of how noise reduction screens , bridges and viaducts were to be built , and of how the railway would be sunk below ground level where this was unavoidable , an important objective being to limit the railway \u2019s visual and environmental impact while maintaining its visual unity and continuity . Where the PERSON crossed existing traffic infrastructure \u2013 roads , existing railways , cycle paths \u2013 safety was the main consideration . Changes to existing ditches and waterways were unavoidable . Construction details of the electrical installations would , however , depend on the final decision on the electrical system to be used , which would be taken at DATE .", "CARDINAL . A total of CARDINAL appeals against ORG CARDINAL were lodged with ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG , many jointly by a plurality of appellants . With the exception of the applicants PERSON and PERSON ( no . MONEY ) , who only raised objections of a general nature to LAW , all applicants in the present case submitted specific complaints about the proposed route of the railway in so far as their respective interests would be affected .", "CARDINAL . The bench of ORG dealing with the appeals was composed of CARDINAL ordinary councillors ( PERSON ) of ORG , namely PERSON ( President ) , PERSON and PERSON PERSON ( members ) . Mr PERSON had been appointed ORG in DATE . Mr PERSON and PERSON had been appointed ordinary councillors in DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after CARDINAL hearings held DATE , ORG delivered its decision . It rejected all the complaints of a general nature .", "CARDINAL . As to the specific complaints , it noted that LAW was not yet final as regards the definitive route of the railway . It therefore limited the scope of its review , for each separate location , to the question whether the government could reasonably have set the band as it had and , if so , whether it could reasonably have considered that an acceptable route was possible within the band specified or that , in view of possible measures to be taken , the interests of the affected appellants had been adequately taken into account . It reserved its opinion on the definitive location of the railway , which was to be the subject of the routing decision .", "CARDINAL . One group of general complaints addressed , inter alia , the assessment made by the government of the need for a new railway . These were rejected with reference to government policy aimed at maintaining and strengthening the position of the GPE as a NORP hub for transport and distribution . ORG concluded that the government \u2019s assessment of the need to construct the railway did not appear incorrect or unreasonable .", "CARDINAL . Another group of general complaints challenged the government \u2019s estimates of the railway \u2019s macro - economic effects and its profitability and the financial calculations underlying the government \u2019s plans . These were rejected on the ground that the said estimates did not appear incorrect or unreasonable in view of the expert reports which the government had commissioned .", "CARDINAL . A further group of general complaints challenged the government \u2019s failure to choose the most environmentally friendly alternative . ORG held that the government could reasonably have come to the decision \u2013 having weighed alternatives and decided to give priority to human interests \u2013 to choose the most cost - effective solution and to use only proven technology . Where specific problems were alleged to arise , these would be dealt with separately . General complaints concerning expected noise and vibration levels , risk assessments , deprivation of property and the likelihood of damage were rejected as being either unfounded on the facts or premature given that these problems would be addressed for specific locations in the routing decision .", "CARDINAL . Specific complaints of CARDINAL appellants were accepted as being well - founded , which led to parts of ORG CARDINALA ( and therefore LAW ) being annulled . None of those CARDINAL appellants are applicants in the present case .", "DATE . As regards the specific complaints which were rejected , ORG held either that it could not be established in advance of the routing decision that the railway could not be located within the band in such a way as to meet the objections , or that the ORG objections could not be met in another way , for instance by relocating business LOC or offering financial compensation .", "CARDINAL . The decision ran to CARDINAL pages , to which maps were appended indicating locations in respect of which parts of ORG CARDINALA were annulled .", "CARDINAL . NORP In total CARDINAL appeals were lodged with ORG against ORG . Many of these appeals were introduced by a plurality of appellants , including the applicants in the present case . As was the case in the appeals against LAW , a large number of appellants made complaints of a general nature dealing with such matters as the procedure followed . Some challenged the government \u2019s refusal to consider modifications of the routing decision unless the objections put forward were of a very serious nature . Others questioned the need or desirability for building the railway at all or objected to the procedure for assessing expected noise levels .", "CARDINAL . The composition of the bench of ORG dealing with the appeals against the routing decision was the same as the bench that had determined the appeals against LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It commenced its examination of the appeals on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of a public hearing held on DATE , PERSON and PERSON challenged the entire membership of ORG and , in the alternative , all the councillors of that ORG with the exception of the extraordinary councillors ( PERSON in buitengewone dienst ) , and in the further alternative , the councillors sitting on the case , on the ground of lack of impartiality . They argued that , since ORG ) was involved in advising the government on proposed legislation , it was inconsistent with LAW that members of that body should subsequently decide in a judicial capacity on the application of legislation once it had been adopted .", "CARDINAL . A hearing on this challenge was held on DATE before a special ORG of CARDINAL members of ORG who were not involved in hearing the appeal , that is Mr E. ORG ( President ) , Mr PERSON and PERSON ( members ) , all of whom were extraordinary councillors of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr and PERSON cited ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in GPE v. GPE ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) . They noted similarities between the organisation and functioning of ORG and the GPE ORG d\u2019Etat and quoted several comments published in the legal press by learned authors .", "CARDINAL . Given that ORG advice on the introduction of ORG had been worded \u201c in generally positive terms \u201d and therefore conflicted with these applicants\u2019 own interest in maintaining the status quo , they considered that that advice had been contrary to their own position in their appeal . ORG was therefore not an \u201c impartial tribunal \u201d . These applicants therefore asked the special ORG to rule that ORG should decline to make any decision in the case .", "DATE . On DATE the special ORG gave its decision . It held that , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( PERSON ) , a challenge could only be directed against judges who were dealing with the case of the party concerned . As to the challenge of the entire membership of ORG , it was pointed out that if LAW had provided otherwise , no member of such a tribunal would in fact be in a position to entertain the challenge . Consequently , in so far as the applicants\u2019 challenge was directed against members of ORG who were not involved in hearing the applicants\u2019 appeal , it was inadmissible . The challenge directed against the members who were so involved was rejected in the following terms :", "\u201c The ORG considers that under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW each of the members who decide a case can be removed from it [ gewraakt ] on the application of a party on the grounds of facts or circumstances by which judicial impartiality might be impaired . The ORG deduces therefrom that only a lack of impartiality on the part of a judge can lead to his removal from a case . Neither the wording nor the drafting history of that provision offers support for the contention that a lack of independence of the tribunal to which a judge belongs can constitute grounds for that judge \u2019s removal from a case . For this reason alone the NORP submissions at the hearing can not lead to their application being granted .", "As to the appellants\u2019 reliance on PERSON , the ORG considers that the appeal lodged by the appellants with the ORG does not raise questions on which ORG has , in advisory opinions on the legislation that is at issue in this appeal , expressed itself in a way contrary to the position taken by the appellants in their appeal . There is therefore no reason to fear that the members of ORG who are charged with deciding the appeal will consider themselves bound by any position adopted by ORG in the relevant advisory opinions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The hearing on the merits was resumed on DATE and , on CARDINAL DATE , ORG delivered its decision , which ran to CARDINAL pages .", "CARDINAL . General complaints relating to the refusal of the government to consider modifications to the routing decision unless the objections put forward were of a very serious nature were dismissed on the ground that this was not unreasonable per se ; it was more appropriate to consider the objections in question individually . General complaints relating to the necessity or desirability of building the railway at DATE including complaints about the environmental impact report DATE were also dismissed . These had already been considered as part of the appeals against LAW The question was no longer whether the building of the PERSON was acceptable , but only whether , in coming to the routing decision , the government could reasonably have decided as it had .", "CARDINAL . The complaint made by several appellants that the routing decision was taken before the appeals against the outline planning decision had been determined was rejected by ORG . It held that , under section PERSON ) of ORG , the period for lodging an appeal against decisions taken in an outline planning decision and against the routing decision based thereon started to run simultaneously and that , therefore , it was normal that a routing decision was already taken before the outline planning decision had become final . It further considered that it did not follow from LAW that where , like in the present case , a separate appeal lay against an outline planning decision , no routing decision could be taken before the outline planning decision had become final . The mere fact that the time - limits for appealing started to run independently did not , according to ORG , alter the tenor of section PERSON ) of ORG that no final outline planning decision was required for a routing decision to be taken on the basis of that decision .", "CARDINAL . As to noise levels , the various complaints were to be considered individually . General complaints concerning the determination of acceptable noise levels could not be entertained . Reasonable standards had been set by law , and actual noise would be monitored once the railway was in use . The safety studies were not held to have been insufficient . It was noted that there had been an additional study made in respect of areas where the concentration of the population , and therefore the group risk , was greatest . Moreover , the government had specified additional safety measures for these areas in its statement of defence , as well as specific ways of operating the railway so as to minimise the dangers attending the transport of dangerous goods . As to the individual risk , the routing decision provided that new development which would increase it within QUANTITY from the centre line of the track would be prevented ; this made it unlikely that the individual risk would be increased further away from the track . Other objections relating to safety considerations would be dealt with on an individual basis .", "CARDINAL . As to vibration levels , ORG held that the government could not be found to have acted unreasonably by basing its assessments on an industrial standard ( ORG ) rather than a different standard suggested by certain appellants . Nor was the assessment of the likely nuisance caused by vibration unreasonable per se . Moreover , the government had undertaken to provide active monitoring ( that is , to measure vibration levels of its own motion ) in all residential buildings located within QUANTITY of the railway once it was in use , and passive monitoring ( that is , to measure vibration levels after complaints were received ) in residential buildings located QUANTITY from the railway . The government would then deal with unacceptable nuisance on a case - by - case basis . Specific problems raised by appellants would be dealt with individually .", "CARDINAL . With regard to general complaints about the arrangements for compensating damage , ORG referred generally to the relevant provisions of the routing decision . It further noted that legal remedies were available against any specific decisions taken in this regard . It could therefore not yet be assumed at this stage that acceptable arrangements in respect of damage were not possible .", "CARDINAL . As to the appeal lodged by ORG ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , whose extremely accurate device for calibrating scales was stated to be particularly sensitive to vibration , ORG noted that studies were still ongoing as to whether the vibration likely to be caused by the railway would unduly interfere with that company \u2019s business . That being so , ORG claims could not be dismissed as unfounded ; to that extent , the appeal was allowed .", "CARDINAL . Sterk Technisch Adviesbureau B.V. ( no . CARDINAL ) , whose premises would have to be relocated , complained that no sufficient clarity had been provided as to whether a new location of equivalent quality would be made available . ORG held this complaint to be well - founded . This made it unnecessary to go into other specific complaints made by this applicant .", "CARDINAL . With regard to a complaint submitted jointly by Mr PERSON ( no . ORG ) and ORG Financierings- en ORG , ORG , ORG , PERSON and PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) in respect of the restaurant \u201c FAC \u201d which they owned and the flat inhabited by Mr PERSON , ORG found that no investigation had been undertaken as to whether it would be possible for these to continue in use . To that extent the complaint was therefore well - founded . The remainder of their appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . As regards the appeal lodged by Mr PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG rejected the objections to a possible expropriation , holding that such objections could be raised in the specific procedure set out in LAW ( Onteigeningswet ) . As to his complaint about nuisance from noise in a particular area , it was held that this element had been insufficiently examined . To that extent , his appeal was well - founded . The remainder was rejected .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the appeals lodged by the other individual applicants and applicant companies .", "CARDINAL . In so far as the appeals were considered well - founded , ORG annulled the routing decision and made an award in respect of costs .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to ORG of ORG of CARDINAL DATE the Minister for ORG , writing also on behalf of the Minister for ORG , observed that the decision of ORG left PERCENT of the routing decision intact . It was therefore not necessary either to undertake a radical review of the project or to interrupt the building work . It was expected that the PERSON railway would be operational by DATE .", "CARDINAL . In so far as minor parts of the routing decision had been annulled , the reason therefor had merely been that insufficient information had been obtained as to whether the interests of the appellants could be safeguarded . In so far as relevant to the present case , the minister expected that in all but CARDINAL or CARDINAL cases changes to the original routing decision would prove unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . New partial routing decisions were taken in the course of DATE . An appeal lodged by ORG was declared inadmissible by ORG on DATE . The appeal lodged by ORG was dismissed by ORG on DATE .

Mr Witvliet apparently did not lodge an appeal against any of the DATE routing decisions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to suggestions made in the media to reconsider the PERSON project , the Minister for Transport and Communications sent a note ( PERSON ) to ORG of ORG on DATE . In this note the minister restated the considerations which had led to the decision of DATE to allow the project to go ahead .

In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to revise its decisions . It found that the information in question was not of such a nature as to justify reopening the proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

Developments subsequent to the reconsideration of DATE were taken into account .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that in the initial stages an adequate analysis of the problems to be solved had not been made . The decision - making process had related one - sidedly to the solution chosen , namely the construction of the Betuweroute railway , it having been decided at the outset that that was beneficial for the national economy and the environment ; an expert analysis of the information on which the outline planning decision was based had not been sought .", "CARDINAL . Predictions concerning the expected volume of transport through the GPE were considered imprecise and unreliable . The predictions eventually relied on appeared overly optimistic ; also , in some cases , it was not clear on what considerations the preference for particular predictions over others was based . Uncertainty remained , inter alia , as to the capacity of the NORP railway system to absorb the increased volume of goods traffic . The increasing competitiveness of inland navigation had not been considered , nor had the slow progress in some NORP countries ( for example , GPE and GPE ) of the liberalisation of rail transport . Nor had account been taken of the possible effects of levies on road transport as against the passing on of the costs of railway infrastructure to shippers , the latter possibility being envisaged in a policy proposal of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Alternatives to the PERSON had not been sufficiently explored . ORG criticised the way in which the use of the existing railway infrastructure in the GPE and waterborne inland and coastal transport had been considered in isolation rather than in combination . A thorough analysis of the possibilities of optimising existing east - west transport , including existing railway infrastructure , was lacking . Possible future developments in inland waterway traffic , which already accounted for a greater volume of transport than GPE railways , had not been looked into .", "CARDINAL . The assumed environmental benefit had also been misstated . The information concerning the environmental impact of alternatives to the Betuweroute railway had been inadequate and had been used in a selective way . Attention had been focused on the immediate reduction of energy use and noxious emissions without taking into account technical developments such as the increased use of cleaner and more economical engines in alternative transport ; insufficient information had been provided concerning such matters as nuisance levels , external safety or soil and groundwater pollution attending alternative choices .", "CARDINAL . A positive feature of the process , given especially the public discussion which had arisen , was that the project had been reconsidered in its entirety in DATE and that the arguments in favour had been presented anew in DATE ( LAW \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

The procedure opted for in this connection , and about which the Ministers for ORG and of the ORG have already made announcements to ORG ( ORG parliamentary documents DATE , QUANTITY , no .

For this are in any event eligible the extraordinary councillors , who are not involved in the advisory function , and those ordinary councillors appointed after the giving of the advice and those ordinary councillors in respect of whom it is objectively certain that they have not participated in the adoption of the advice in ORG . In such a situation , this will \u2013 thanks to this way of proceeding in the Division \u2013 therefore prevent appellants as far as possible from relying on PERSON in a challenge or otherwise . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In the case - law developed by ORG in relation to challenges based on ORG combined advisory and judicial functions in the light of LAW , decisive importance is attached to the question whether or not the challenged councillor was involved in advising on the disputed legislation and whether the substance of the appeal concerns a point that was explicitly addressed in the advisory opinion given by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG initially took as one of its criteria the degree to which members of the bench hearing the appeal had contributed to the advisory opinion . This criterion was dropped in later caselaw , as this information is not accessible to the general public and therefore the parties . The key questions remain whether the challenged member of the bench belonged to ORG at the time when the advisory opinion was given and whether any position was adopted in the advisory opinion that is opposed by the party that has lodged the challenge . Only in cases where these questions can be answered in the affirmative is it accepted that a party has justified grounds to fear that the councillor concerned is biased in respect of the subject of the dispute ( see ORG , case no .

NORP In an appeal in cassation lodged with ORG ( PERSON ) against a judgment of CARDINAL DATE of ORG ( ORG ) in expropriation proceedings in connection with the construction of FAC , the appellant argued that ORG , by confining itself to referring to the administrative procedures already pursued before ORG , had neglected to rule on the legality and necessity of the expropriation and , in particular , that ORG had failed to investigate technical alternatives such as tunnelling , which would make expropriation unnecessary . In this connection , referring to the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON ( cited above ) , he argued that ORG \u201c structural impartiality \u201d was in doubt and that it followed from this that he was entitled to have these issues reviewed by the ordinary courts .", "CARDINAL .

NORP However , the argument overlooks the point that the mere fact that advice was heard from ORG , in accordance with the statutory provisions concerned , about the bill that eventually led to ORG does not warrant the conclusion that fears as to the impartiality of ORG of ORG , which had to judicially determine objections against the routing decision , are objectively justified .
