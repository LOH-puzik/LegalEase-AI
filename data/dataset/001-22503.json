On her return in DATE the car was no longer to be found in the warehouse and she was informed that it had already been released .", "The applicant \u2019s petitions to the then GPE ORG ( piiritullikamari , distriktstullkammaren ) and the harbour authorities of DATE and DATE were fruitless . By registered letter of CARDINAL DATE addressed to \u201c the ORG \u201d she then filed an action against \u201c ORG of the western harbour of GPE \u201d .

The ORG registered the letter on DATE . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE it informed the applicant that the customs authorities were not responsible for the operation and maintenance of bonded warehouses . This was a matter for the GPE harbour authorities , i.e. GPE . It was the duty of the warehouse keeper to ensure that the vehicle was returned to its rightful owner .

The car had then been transferred to the PERSON checkpoint at the NORP - Russian border , where it had been handed over to that person following a second verification of the passport . ORG advised the applicant to contact the bonded warehouse in order to find out whether her car had been handed over to the wrong person .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( kielilaki , spr\u00e5klagen DATE ) , the languages to be used before NORP courts and other ORG authorities are the national languages NORP and NORP .
