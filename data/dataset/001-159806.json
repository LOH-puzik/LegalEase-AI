The applicant is of NORP origin , was born in DATE and has been in the GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant entered the GPE on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE applied for asylum , submitting the following account in his interviews with immigration officials held on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . After completing his elementary education in DATE , the applicant had attended the military academy in GPE . He had graduated in DATE and had started working in DATE with the rank of second lieutenant at an administrative department of CARDINAL of the directorates of the NORP security service ORG ( \u201c ORG - e Dowlati / PERSON GPE ) during the former communist regime in GPE . He had become head of this department DATE which was responsible for handling confidential documents DATE , which function he had continued to hold until the fall of the ruling communist ORG of GPE ( \u201c PDPA \u201d ) in DATE . In DATE he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant - colonel .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s directorate had been assigned the task of negotiating and concluding agreements with groups that opposed and fought ORG , namely the mujahideen . These agreements entailed remunerated cooperation with the ruling ORG . The applicant had attended meetings between thus \u201c employed \u201d mujahideen commanders and executives of the directorate . During these meetings the performance of such commanders was assessed and decisions were taken on whether or not they should continue to be paid . The applicant had taken TIME at those meetings . He believed that the mujahideen were holding him personally responsible for the discontinuation of their pay where decisions to that effect had been taken . In addition , these mujahideen commanders had never admitted to cooperating with the ORG and were very keen on keeping this a secret , for which reason they were interested in eliminating the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after the fall of GPE , these mujahideen commanders had come looking for the applicant . They were said to have come to his office and asked for him . The applicant had been informed of this by the president of the directorate he had worked for , who had maintained good relations with the mujahideen and hence had remained in post there .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his family had fled to GPE , where they had led a quiet life until DATE , when various mujahideen groups had come to the city , including those mujahideen feared by the applicant . He had gone into hiding , during which period his house had been searched by the mujahideen . The applicant and his family had then fled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a person - specific official report ( individueel ambtsbericht ) not concerning the applicant was drawn up by ORG ( Ministerie PERSON ) . According to this report , torture was systemic in PERSON interrogation centres and within the ORG the loyalty of its staff was carefully controlled . It was considered impossible that persons belonging to the higher management of the ORG had not been involved in the implementation of the above methods . This report was taken into account in the applicant \u2019s asylum procedure .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s asylum claim was also examined in the light of an official report , drawn up on DATE by ORG , on \u201c ORG in NORP GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG and ORG ( \u201c PERSON in communistisch GPE ( DATE ) , AGSA , ORG , ORG en WAD \u201d ) and concerning in particular the question whether and , if so , which former employees of those services should be regarded as implicated in human rights violations ( see ORG v. the GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE the Deputy Minister of ORG ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum claim . The Deputy Minister held , inter alia , that serious reasons had been found for believing that the applicant had committed acts referred to in LAW DATE LAW ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the official report of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Deputy Minister emphasised the widely known cruel character of the LAW , its lawless methods , the grave crimes it had committed such as torture and other human rights violations and the \u201c climate of terror \u201d which it had spread throughout the whole of NORP society , including the army . The Deputy Minister underlined the vague definition of \u201c enemy of the communist regime \u201d used by the ORG , how it found those enemies through an extensive network of spies , and how all of this led to widespread and often random arrests of suspects . It was also noted that the ORG was considered to be an elite unit of the communist regime , and that only those whose loyalty was beyond doubt were eligible for recruitment to the service . Furthermore , new recruits were initially assigned to ORG sections actively engaged in tracking down \u201c elements that posed a threat to the ORG \u201d , where DATE in order to prove their loyalty unequivocally DATE they were directly involved in the human rights violations the ORG was associated with . In this regard the Deputy Minister emphasised that every promoted officer had been involved in arrests , interrogations , torture and even executions .", "CARDINAL . Having established , on the basis of elaborate argumentation based on various international documents , that those involved in the ORG were likely to fall within the scope of LAW , the Deputy Minister proceeded to an analysis of the applicant \u2019s individual responsibility under LAW . In the light of the above , the applicant \u2019s plea that he had never been involved in any human rights violations and had worked his whole career for CARDINAL department only was dismissed . In view of the applicant \u2019s career and several promotions , the Deputy Minister excluded the possibility of the applicant not having been involved in human rights violations committed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister underlined that the application of LAW did not require proof that the applicant had personally committed the alleged crimes ; it sufficed that serious reasons existed to consider that the applicant had , or should have had , knowledge of those crimes and that he bore responsibility for them , which responsibility he had voluntarily assumed . In this context the Deputy Minister referred , inter alia , to CARDINAL and CARDINAL of \u201c The Exclusion Clauses : Guidelines on their LAW ( ORG , DATE ) , stating :", "\u201c persons who are found to have performed , engaged in , participated in orchestrating , planning and/or implementing , or condoned or acquiesced in the carrying out of any specified criminal acts by subordinates , should rightly be excluded . ... voluntary continued membership of a part of a government engaged in criminal activities may constitute grounds for exclusion where the member can not rebut the presumptions of knowledge and personal implication . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister further referred to a letter of CARDINAL DATE sent by the Deputy Minister of ORG to the President of ORG of ORG ( ORG ) stating that LAW was also applicable when the person concerned had not himself committed any acts referred to in this provision but had been an active and conscious member of an organisation known for committing war crimes and crimes against humanity . As the applicant had not in any way distanced himself from or resisted the crimes committed by the ORG , the Deputy Minister concluded that LAW was applicable to the applicant \u2019s case . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s asylum request was rejected and LAW held against him .", "CARDINAL . The Deputy Minister further found no grounds on the basis of which the applicant would be eligible for a residence permit on compelling humanitarian grounds ( klemmende redenen van humanitaire aard ) . As regards the applicant \u2019s plea under LAW the Deputy Minister held that , even assuming that a real risk existed of the applicant being subjected to treatment contrary to that provision in GPE , Article CARDINAL did not guarantee a right to residence . The Deputy Minister considered in this context that granting residence to the applicant would conflict with the ORG \u2019s interest in terms of its credibility on the international stage , particularly regarding its responsibility towards other GPE . In the Deputy Minister \u2019s view , a situation in which the GPE was forced to become a host ORG for individuals who had elsewhere shocked public and international legal order with acts considered to constitute grave crimes under both NORP and international law was to be avoided .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) to this decision was rejected , after he had been heard on it on DATE before an official board of enquiry ( ambtelijke commissie ) , on DATE by the Minister of ORG ( Minister PERSON Integratie ) , the successor to the Deputy Minister of ORG . The Minister endorsed the Deputy Minister \u2019s impugned decision and proceeded , in addition thereto , to an analysis of the applicant \u2019s individual responsibility under LAW on the basis of the prescribed and so - called \u201c personal and knowing participation test \u201d and held LAW against him .", "CARDINAL . As regards the \u201c knowing \u201d element , the Minister \u2013 having regard to the official report of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) DATE found that the applicant had known or should have known about the criminal character of the ORG . The Minister did not attach any credence to the applicant \u2019s submissions that he had not known about the human rights violations committed by the ORG . Basing herself on ORG official report of CARDINAL DATE , the Minister held that the commission of human rights violations by the ORG under the ORG rule was a fact of common knowledge and that , therefore , it was unthinkable that the applicant would have been ignorant of those acts . The Minister emphasised in this regard the high rank the applicant had held , the long period he had worked for the ORG and the fact that he had attended meetings with the executives of the ORG in which he had been employed . The Minister concluded that the applicant had knowingly participated in torture and executions .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s personal participation in human rights violations attributed to the ORG , the Minister found , basing herself to a large extent on the same factual information as the Deputy Minister had done in his previous decision , that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had not committed such violations himself or that his conduct , or lack thereof , had prevented these violations from being committed . The Minister held , therefore , that the applicant had personally participated in the commission of acts referred to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Minister did not attach credence to the applicant \u2019s rebuttal , which amounted to his case having to be distinguished from the general situation with regard to the ORG and its officers as described in the official report of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant had claimed that he had obtained a desk job not by proving his loyalty to the ORG in sinister ways \u2013 as the official report stated \u2013 but rather through bribes . The Minister held that , based on the applicant \u2019s position and description of his tasks ( including the processing of high - level classified information ) , he had attempted to trivialise his activities and had greatly impaired his credibility in consequence . On this point , the Minister relied , inter alia , on ORG \u201c Reports of torture and long - term detention without trial \u201d of DATE , according to which the ORG in which the applicant had been employed was engaged in systematic torture .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister further identified several inconsistencies in the applicant \u2019s declarations and rebuttals , from which it was concluded that his declarations concerning certain of the tasks he stated he had performed were highly implausible . As regards the applicant \u2019s various rebuttals , it was found , in the relevant part , that the burden of proof in terms of LAW was less stringent than in a criminal prosecution ( \u201c serious reasons for considering \u201d that the applicant might have been guilty of human rights violations sufficed to render this provision applicable ) . Taking into account that the applicant had never sought to leave the ORG or the ORG , for which he had worked for DATE , in which his last held rank was that of lieutenant - colonel , and in which he had been promoted to head of his department , the Minister concluded that there were no indications that the applicant had been forced or had involuntarily worked for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s claim that the official report of CARDINAL DATE of ORG was not accurate and was based on unreliable sources and that , therefore , it was too general in scope and could not be applied to his case , the Minister held that this report was founded on several acclaimed sources , such as the United Nations Special Rapporteur , ORG , numerous ORG reports , and a variety of ORG publications .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister went on to analyse , of her own motion , the applicant \u2019s eligibility for a residence permit for reasons not related to asylum . It was held that no such permit could be issued , since the application of LAW gave rise to \u201c contraindications \u201d against the applicant in terms of his eligibility for other types of residence permit . However , while reiterating that LAW did not guarantee a right to residence , the Minister considered that it could not be ruled out that the applicant , in the present circumstances , would run a real risk of treatment contrary to that provision if expelled to GPE , for which reason the applicant was not to be expelled .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection against the refusal by the Minister to grant him a residence permit for reasons not related to asylum . This objection was rejected by the Minister on DATE , confirming her impugned refusal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the Minister \u2019s decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE before ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE , arguing , inter alia , that the factual underpinning of ORG official report of CARDINAL DATE contained errors , which had led the Minister to draw incorrect conclusions as to the applicant \u2019s personal and knowing participation in the crimes referred to in LAW .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE held that the official reports issued by ORG , which lay to a great extent at the basis of the Minister \u2019s decisions , had been drafted in an unbiased manner , were accurate and objective , and provided the required insight in the relevant information , and that therefore , the Minister had been entitled to rely on them . In addition , ORG noted that the evaluation of the credibility of facts adduced by asylum seekers fell to a large extent within the Minister \u2019s discretion and could , therefore , only be evaluated marginally by the court . ORG agreed with the Minister on all points as to the latter \u2019s decision to hold LAW against the applicant and , consequently , to refuse him an asylum - based residence permit . As regards the Minister \u2019s separate decision of DATE , refusing the applicant a residence permit for reasons not related to asylum , ORG adopted a different reasoning , but reached the same conclusion .", "CARDINAL . In respect of LAW , ORG held , with reference to case - law of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) , that the Minister should , wherever possible , avoid creating a situation in which an asylum seeker is refused a residence permit but can not be expelled to his / her country of origin for reasons based on LAW . For that reason , the decision should demonstrate that the Minister had examined whether LAW would lastingly ( duurzaam ) stand in the way of expulsion to the country of origin and of the possible consequences for the residence situation of the person concerned . This , ORG found , the Minister had failed to do in the present case , for which reason it quashed the Minister \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE and remitted the case back to the Minister for a fresh decision .", "CARDINAL . After the applicant had once more been heard on DATE before an official board of enquiry , the Minister rejected the asylum request anew in a fresh decision of CARDINAL DATE . In this fresh decision , the Minister limited herself to LAW . She dismissed the applicant \u2019s fear of returning to GPE as a ( former ) member of the ORG and former officer of ORG , referring to an official report issued by ORG in DATE and holding that the sole fact that an asylum seeker had been a ORG member was not enough in itself to render LAW applicable in the eventuality of expulsion . The Minister further noted that the mere fact that the applicant had a different political conviction from those currently in power in GPE similarly did not suffice to render LAW applicable . The Minister further took into account that the applicant had stated that he was not a known person in GPE . The applicant had no concrete indication that he would be searched for by any group or person . In addition , relatives of the applicant \u2013 including his father and brother \u2013 were still living in GPE without ever having encountered any problem .", "CARDINAL . The Minister further addressed the applicant \u2019s claim that he had reason to fear certain named mujahideen commanders , who would identify him as the ORG officer who had not paid them , or paid them less than agreed upon . The applicant had submitted that he had attended meetings \u2013 where he had TIME DATE in the course of which cooperation agreements had been reached between the ORG and a mujahideen commander . In addition , the applicant had alleged that these mujahideen commanders were keen on ensuring that nobody in DATE GPE would find out that they had cooperated with ORG in the past , for which reason they were interested in eliminating the applicant . On this point , the Minister held that the applicant had failed to establish these ORG whereabouts and current influence in NORP society . The Minister noted that according to the applicant \u2019s own statements , he did not believe that these individuals occupied high positions in DATE \u2019s GPE . Furthermore , the Minister considered that the mujahideen commanders were aware of the applicant \u2019s role in those meetings as well as of the identity of the person taking the decisions as regards financial support of the mujahideen , and that it was therefore implausible that they would be after the applicant . Finally , it was underlined that the applicant had been able to stay in GPE until DATE without any problems . For these reasons , the applicant \u2019s claim that he was being sought by the mujahideen was dismissed as founded on nothing but suspicion and speculation . The claim based on LAW was consequently rejected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed anew to ORG of The Hague , arguing , inter alia , that the Minister had erred in finding him guilty of participation in torture under the auspices of the ORG . In his view , the Minister had disregarded the fact that the applicant had held an administrative position in ORG which was only concerned with maintaining contacts with the mujahideen and reaching agreements with them . Furthermore , the Minister had been inconsistent in finding , on the one hand , that the applicant had participated in human rights violations , but , on the other hand , that the applicant had not held an important position within the PDPA party . The applicant submitted that it was likely that he was well known enough for his former adversaries , who were now those in power in GPE , to find him and subject him to treatment contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on DATE . It noted that , according to a general official report on GPE of DATE by ORG , that some former military officials , members of the police and the ORG / WAD security services possibly risk falling victim to human rights violations \u2013 not only by the authorities but also by the population ( GPE relatives ) , unless they maintained relations with influential NORP and political parties or tribes . According to the court , this did not mean that every former ORG officer ran a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW , and the applicant was thus required to establish the existence of such a risk in the particular circumstances of his case . ORG agreed with the Minister that the applicant had failed to do so , as his claims were found to be merely based on unsubstantiated expectations , including his claimed fear of persecution by the mujahideen commanders who had been paid by the ORG . No further appeal lay against this ruling ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
