On DATE the public prosecutor ( officier van justitie ) sought the prolongation by ORG ( rechtbank ) of PERSON detention on remand , surrender having not yet taken place .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held DATE . PERSON , represented by counsel , argued that \u201c special circumstances \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( PERSON ) justifying the prolongation requested did not exist . He took the view that if the NORP authorities did not come to fetch PERSON , then the GPE authorities should effect the transfer to GPE themselves . In his submission , an extension of the time - limits set out in LAW of DATE on the NORP arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between ORG Member GPE was permitted only if both the issuing and the executing Member GPE were prevented by force majeure from effecting the surrender . Should ORG be hesitant to follow this view , he asked ORG to put a preliminary question to ORG of ORG ( CJEU ) under LAW on the Functioning of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision DATE . It ordered Mr PERSON to be taken into extended detention on remand ( gevangenhouding ) for a further ten days from DATE and declined to put any preliminary question to the ORG . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c The public prosecutor has argued that the lack of any earlier transport from GPE constitutes force majeure for him and that he is not under any obligation to take the requested person to GPE .", "ORG takes the view that the public prosecutor is tasked with the actual surrender . For the actual surrender he is dependent on the NORP authorities as regards transport . The issuing state , being the party with an interest in the surrender , is responsible for the actual transport . If the actual transport can not take place within the time - limit set by law , then this constitutes force majeure for the public prosecutor . The public prosecutor is under no obligation to take a requested person to the country that issued the NORP arrest warrant .", "The time - limits in LAW covering actual surrender are intended to increase the efficiency and speed of the surrender procedure . This is in the first place an interest of the authorities concerned and additionally an interest of the requested person himself . The interest of the authorities concerned is not harmed since this has come into being by mutual agreement [ sic ] .", "The interest of the requested person is harmed . The extent of the harm is however limited since actual surrender can actually take place in short order , namely on DATE , and can be justified by what has been considered above .", "In view of the reasons outlined above ORG sees no reason to put any preliminary questions . \u201d", "No appeal was possible against this decision .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was surrendered to the NORP authorities at GPE ( GPE ) Airport on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Milkovics was provisionally arrested on the basis of an alert entered in ORG by GPE for the purpose of his arrest for surrender . He was taken into police custody for DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The public prosecutor received the relevant NORP arrest warrant on DATE . The following day , CARDINAL DATE , he ordered the extension of the police custody until such time as ORG would give a decision concerning detention on remand . At the same time , however , he ordered the conditional suspension ( schorsing ) of the police custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision ordering PERSON extended detention on remand , which at the same time it conditionally suspended until the date of its eventual decision on the permissibility of surrender .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision finding Mr Milkovics \u2019s surrender to GPE permissible . Mr Milkovics was taken into detention on remand DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave a decision extending Mr Milkovics \u2019s detention on remand by a further DATE starting on DATE . The decision noted that actual surrender had not yet taken place because of \u201c special circumstances \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Milkovics lodged a request for the suspension of his detention on remand . He stated that he wished to be surrendered to GPE as soon as possible so as to prove his innocence ; at all events , even in the event of a conviction the sentence would be unlikely to be more than a suspended prison sentence or a community service order given his clean criminal record and the ( in his submission ) relatively minor nature of the charges against him . Should ORG be minded not to accede to this request , he suggested that a preliminary question be put to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision on DATE after having held a hearing . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for suspension of his detention on remand . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c Section CARDINAL of LAW allows the suspension of detention on remand for the purpose of surrender until the moment at which ORG has permitted the surrender . Only in exceptional circumstances does ORG consider itself empowered to order the suspension of the detention on remand for the purpose of surrender after that decision ; an example is the situation in which continued detention would lead to a violation of LAW . ORG takes the view that no exceptional circumstances are apparent that ought to lead to the suspension of the detention on remand for the purpose of surrender of the requested person . In so finding , ORG notes that the requested person has spent DATE in detention and that actual surrender to the NORP authorities is expected to take place very soon , no later than DATE . ORG therefore can not see that continuing the detention in remand for the purpose of surrender constitutes a violation of LAW already now .", "Nor does ORG see any need to consider the request for suspension of the detention according to the standards applicable to the situation in which ORG has not yet given its decision . Unlike counsel , ORG does not consider the limitation of the possibility of suspension for the purpose of surrender to the period preceding the decision , as laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW , to run counter to LAW DATE on the NORP arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member GPE . That LAW provides that the person requested may be released provisionally at any time in conformity with the domestic law of the executing Member ORG , provided that the competent authority of the said Member ORG takes all the measures it deems necessary to prevent the person absconding [ emphasis in the original ] . Clearly the GPE legislature has considered the restriction of the possibilities of suspension referred to above necessary to prevent the requested person absconding . Nor is it the case that LAW rules out the possibility of releasing the requested person from the decision until actual surrender takes place . It is , after all , within the power of the public prosecutor to release the requested person at any time if there should be occasion to do so . Likewise , if the public prosecutor does not seek the prolongation of the detention on remand for the purpose of surrender or if ORG dismisses a request for its prolongation , then the requested person will be released provisionally until actual surrender takes place .", "There is accordingly no necessity to construe [ section CARDINAL of LAW ] in the light of LAW , nor is there a need for any preliminary questions [ to the CJEU ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Milkovics lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG ( gerechtshof ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Milkovics was surrendered to the NORP authorities at FAC on DATE , having remained in detention until then .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing in the case on DATE . Mr Milkovics was represented by his counsel . Relying on NORP v. the GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG DATE , his counsel asked that the appeal be declared admissible despite Mr Milkovics \u2019s surrender DATE . He challenged the decision of ORG , arguing that LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW acted to override section CARDINAL ) of LAW and introduce a subsidiarity test . Pointing out that no appeal lay to the decision of ORG , he again asked for a preliminary question to be put to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed PERSON appeal on DATE . Its reasoning included the following :", "\u201c Given section CARDINAL of the LAW suspension of detention on remand for surrender purposes is possible only as long as no judicial decision has been taken about allowing surrender . This rule admits of exceptions only if there is an exceptional situation , in which there is a danger that the rights guaranteed by LAW may be violated . There is no such situation in the present case , considering also the brief period that the requested person has spent in detention for surrender purposes in the GPE .", "The system of LAW and [ LAW DATE on the NORP arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member GPE ] is based on the assumption that the orders of the judicial authorities of the Member GPE of ORG are to be trusted as if they were decisions of the requested Member ORG itself .", "The requested person can exercise his rights based on the ORG and related arrangements without limitation in GPE and will have to approach the NORP authorities for that purpose . There is no point to any further assessment by the GPE courts in the given circumstances .", "In view of the above , there is no need to put any preliminary questions . \u201d", "No appeal was possible against this decision .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG gave a decision giving permission for Mr ORG \u2019s surrender to GPE in respect of CARDINAL charge but refusing such permission in respect of a plurality of other charges . Mr ORG was taken back into detention on remand DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor sought the prolongation by ORG of Mr ORG \u2019s detention on remand , surrender having not yet taken place .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held DATE . Mr ORG , represented by counsel , argued that on the same grounds as in the case of PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that \u201c special circumstances \u201d within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW justifying the prolongation requested did not exist and asked ORG to put a preliminary question to the ORG under LAW . In the alternative , he argued that there was no danger of his absconding since only one charge remained for him to face in GPE , a minor one at that , and he had built a stable existence in the GPE with his family .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave its decision DATE . It ordered the prolongation of Mr ORG \u2019s detention on remand for DATE from DATE and declined to put any preliminary question to the ORG .

In its judgment of DATE in Case CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( GPE CILFIT and ORG ) , ORG of ORG ( hereafter ECJ ) responded to a request from ORG for a ruling as to whether the third paragraph of LAW ( now LAW ) laid down an obligation to refer a matter which precluded the national court from determining whether the question raised was justified or whether it made that obligation conditional on the prior finding of a reasonable interpretative doubt . In this connection , the ECJ found it necessary to define the meaning , for purposes of Community law , of the expression \u201c where any such question is raised \u201d in order to determine the circumstances in which a national court or tribunal against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law is obliged to bring a matter before it . The ECJ observed the following :", "\u201c ... it must in the first place be pointed out that Article CARDINAL does not constitute a means of redress available to the parties to a case pending before a national court or tribunal . Therefore the mere fact that a party contends that the dispute gives rise to a question concerning the interpretation of Community law does not mean that the court or tribunal concerned is compelled to consider that a question has been raised within the meaning of Article CARDINAL .", "Secondly , it follows from the relationship between the second and third paragraphs of Article CARDINAL that the courts or tribunals referred to in the third paragraph have the same discretion as any other national court or tribunal to ascertain whether a decision on a question of community law is necessary to enable them to give judgment . Accordingly , those courts or tribunals are not obliged to refer to the court of justice a question concerning the interpretation of community law raised before them if that question is not relevant , that is to say , if the answer to that question , regardless of what it may be , can in no way affect the outcome of the case . \u201d", "and gave the following interpretation of LAW :", "\u201c The third paragraph of LAW must be interpreted as meaning that a court or tribunal against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law is required , where a question of Community law is raised before it , to comply with its obligation to bring the matter before ORG , unless it has established that the question raised is irrelevant or that the Community provision in question has already been interpreted by ORG or that the correct application of Community law is so obvious as to leave no scope for any reasonable doubt . The existence of such a possibility must be assessed in the light of the specific characteristics of Community law , the particular difficulties to which its interpretation gives rise and the risk of divergences in judicial decisions within the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
