In DATE , the island of GPE , an autonomous part of ORG in LOC with a population of some CARDINAL residents , enacted a new electoral system .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are CARDINAL NORP nationals , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , who were born respectively in DATE , DATE and DATE . They are residents of LOC and , although they bring this application in their individual capacities , they have formed an unincorporated association called \u201c FAC \u201d , which seeks reform of the island \u2019s new electoral system . Their principal complaint to the ORG is that the system does not comply with the requirements of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW , the right to free elections .", "CARDINAL . Sark \u2019s constitutional position , the history of the reforms which led to the new electoral system , and the conduct of recent elections under that system are summarised at paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below . That summary is taken from the facts as submitted by the applicants and from CARDINAL judgments of ORG of the GPE concerning PERSON : R ( FAC ) v. Lord Chancellor and Secretary of ORG for ORG ( \u201c Barclay ( no . CARDINAL ) \u201d ) and R ( FAC ) v. Secretary of ORG for ORG ( \u201c Barclay ( no . CARDINAL ) \u201d ) ( see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The LOC consist of ORG and GPE . ORG are ORG . The ORG consists of the island GPE itself , the islands of GPE and GPE , and several smaller islands . GPE and GPE are autonomous from GPE .", "CARDINAL . GPE is responsible for the Bailiwick of GPE \u2019s international obligations and has extended the application of LAW No . CARDINAL to it through declarations under LAW No . CARDINAL . That responsibility is exercised primarily through ORG .", "CARDINAL . Sark \u2019s constitutional position can be traced back to the NORP - French wars of CARDINAL - CARDINAL , when it came under the jurisdiction of the NORP Crown . Throughout its history ORG has , like the rest of LOC , retained its own customs , laws , courts and legislature .", "CARDINAL . Sark \u2019s present constitutional position derives from letters patent issued by Queen PERSON I in DATE which granted a perpetual lease of island to its first \u201c ORG \u201d . The lease has passed , either by sale or inheritance , down to the island \u2019s current PERSON , who still plays a role in the government of the island .", "CARDINAL . GPE , GPE and GPE all have their own legislatures and , in general , the CARDINAL islands legislate for themselves .", "CARDINAL . Sark \u2019s legislature is called the Chief Pleas . The Chief Pleas legislates by CARDINAL methods , Laws and Ordinances . In respect of Laws , after the Chief Pleas passes a PERSON , it is remitted as a Projet de Loi to officials in ORG , GPE . It is then remitted to ORG ( \u201c the Committee \u201d ) . ORG includes the Secretary of ORG for ORG , the member of the GPE cabinet responsible for ORG . If the ORG recommends that ORG be granted , the Projet de Loi is presented to ORG so that it may become law . ORG will then be given through an Order in Council . The Projet de Loi will not be presented to ORG if the ORG decides not to recommend it for Royal Assent ( see ORG judgment in FAC ( no . CARDINAL ) at paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In considering whether or not to recommend approval , ORG will in general respect the decision of the Chief Pleas , and there would tend to be a presumption in favour of recommending ORG . But consideration is given to the ORG \u2019s responsibilities , so that if a PERSON violates the ORG \u2019s international obligations or any fundamental constitutional principle or if it is clearly not in the public interest for it to become law , then a recommendation may be made to withhold ORG ( see the FAC ( no . CARDINAL ) judgment at paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Historically , PERSON was divided into CARDINAL plots of land or \u201c tenements \u201d . Anyone who owned CARDINAL of the tenements ( \u201c a tenant \u201d ) was entitled to a seat in the Chief Pleas . In DATE the tenants were joined in the Chief Pleas by CARDINAL elected members .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the Chief Pleas voted for a reform which would have provided for a legislature to consist of CARDINAL tenants elected by the tenants and CARDINAL deputies elected by the rest of the population . In DATE the Chief Pleas withdrew its support for the reform , a position supported by the Secretary of ORG for ORG , who wrote to the ORG stating that he \u201c would not have been able to recommend for LAW legislation about which there are serious or substantial ORG compliance issues \u201d ( quoted in ORG ( no . CARDINAL ) at paragraph CARDINAL ) . He continued :", "\u201c [ a]ny option which falls short of a wholly democratic process would cause me serious difficulties . ... I am concerned that ORG should give itself , and the GPE , the best protection it can from ORG challenge and its possible consequences ... [ PERSON is the GPE which is vulnerable to an ORG challenge . The GPE can not stand by and give that situation its tacit approval by doing nothing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the Chief Pleas approved another version of a new law which would still reserve seats in the Chief Pleas for tenants , but with those tenants elected by universal suffrage . The Secretary of ORG decided not to submit that proposal to ORG over doubts as to whether it complied with GPE international obligations ( FAC ( no . CARDINAL ) at paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the Chief Pleas then passed a PERSON which proposed removing tenants from the Chief Pleas and replacing them with twentyeight elected members or \u201c conseillers \u201d . The PERSON was to be an ex officio member of Chief Pleas , with a voice but no vote . The PERSON did not have the right to veto Laws passed by the Chief Pleas ( and this is would not change in the Projet de Loi ) . He would , however , retain the right to veto an GPE . In that case , the GPE would be placed again before the Chief Pleas within DATE for its decision on whether to override the veto . The Projet de Loi also provided that the ORG could not sit on executive committees of the Chief Pleas , the main means through which the executive government of the island is conducted .", "CARDINAL . The DATE PERSON created the following electoral system for the island . All persons who had been resident on the island for DATE could vote . ORG would serve DATE terms , but those terms would be staggered so that , subject to special rules governing by - elections and unforeseen vacancies , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL conseillers would be elected at any CARDINAL general election ( save for the first general election at which all CARDINAL seats would be contested ) .", "CARDINAL . For any election , the island would be a single constituency with all eligible voters able to vote for all candidates . A voter would receive a number of votes equal to the number of vacancies being contested at the election ( normally CARDINAL vacancies unless there were additional vacancies ) . The CARDINAL candidates gaining the most votes would be elected .", "CARDINAL . ORG recommended that LAW should receive ORG , concluding that it would not violate any of GPE international obligations . ORG was accordingly given on DATE and the Projet de Loi entered into force as the ORG ( Sark ) Law CARDINAL ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Once Royal Assent was given to LAW , PERSON \u2019s first general election on took place on DATE . Since then there have been CARDINAL further general elections and CARDINAL by - elections . The applicants have provided the following summary of the results for those elections :", "CARDINAL . Traditionally , sessions of the Chief Pleas were chaired by the island \u2019s \u201c Seneschal \u201d who also serves as the island \u2019s resident judge . Subsequent reforms have separated the Seneschal \u2019s judicial and legislative functions : he now holds purely judicial office , his presiding role in Chief Pleas has been taken by a President of Chief Pleas .", "CARDINAL . Sark \u2019s court of first instance is the court of the Seneschal . His court has unlimited jurisdiction in civil matters and shares jurisdiction in criminal matters with ORG . When civil and criminal matters are decided at first instance by the court of the Seneschal , there is a right of appeal to ORG then to ORG for GPE and , finally , ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Sark \u2019s laws can , under certain circumstances be challenged in the GPE courts . This arises because , under the law of GPE and GPE , there is the possibility of bringing a legal challenge to the making of an Order in Council . This is done by way of judicial review in ORG and GPE and , on appeal , to ORG and , finally , ORG of GPE . Given that FAC to legislation from FAC is given by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , it is , therefore , possible to challenge GPE legislation in ORG through judicial review proceedings . This is , however , a limited jurisdiction , which ORG has made clear should not always be exercised : see PERSON ( no . CARDINAL ) at paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below .", "CARDINAL . The Human Rights ( Bailiwick of Guernsey ) Law CARDINAL , a PERSON modelled on ORG DATE , applies throughout the GPE , including LOC . In summary , like LAW , the PERSON constrains public authorities in the islands from acting contrary to Convention rights and requires the courts of the islands to take account of the case - law of the LAW bodies . It also requires the courts , so far as it is possible to do so , to read and give effect to primary legislation and subordinate legislation in a way which is compatible with the LAW rights . When it is not possible for them to do so , the LOC courts , like their counterparts in GPE , may make a declaration that the legislation is not compatible with LAW ( a declaration of incompatibility ) .", "CARDINAL . In GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) certain aspects of LAW were challenged by way of judicial review in ORG and GPE , including whether the continued presence of the PERSON and ( at that time , the Seneschal ) in the Chief Pleas was compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP That judicial review challenge ultimately reached ORG , which gave judgment on DATE dismissing the challenge : [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON gave the lead judgment for the unanimous court . After reviewing the general principles which emerged from this ORG \u2019s case law on LAW ( including the need to consider electoral rules in the round and in the light of historical and political factors ) , Lord PERSON observed that there was no breach of LAW No CARDINAL arising from the PERSON and PERSON \u2019s continued membership of Chief Pleas . He observed ( at paragraph CARDINAL of the judgment ) :", "\u201c The starting point is that only ORG are entitled to vote in the Chief Pleas , and therefore it is only ORG who determine whether legislation is to be enacted . The electorate of PERSON consists of CARDINAL voters , who choose CARDINAL elected ORG by a process of casting CARDINAL votes each and electing the CARDINAL candidates with the largest number of votes . There is therefore one GPE for every CARDINAL persons in the electorate . It is not easy to envisage , in the words of LAW , conditions which are more likely to ensure the expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON went on to find that there was nothing in the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of the LAW or the case - law of this ORG which established that all members of the legislature should be elected , irrespective of their powers and irrespective of the circumstances . Indeed , to the contrary , the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires indicated that LAW No . CARDINAL had been drafted to recognise that , in some GPE , part of the legislature was not elected .", "CARDINAL . Instead , the effect of this ORG \u2019s case - law under LAW No . CARDINAL was that all circumstances had to be considered . The presence of the Seigneur ( and , at that time , the Seneschal ) in the Chief Pleas did not contravene that Article . Even if their membership in the Chief Pleas was to be regarded as a limitation on the people \u2019s right to choose the legislature , in light of the constitutional history and the political factors relevant to PERSON , that limitation fell well within the margin of appreciation allowed by LAW , not least given the long history of both positions and the difficulties that had occurred since DATE in reforming the Chief Pleas ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the ORG , his right to speak but not vote could not reasonably be said to frustrate the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature . Nor was that conclusion affected by the PERSON \u2019s other powers and responsibilities on the island . For instance , the present ORG had never exercised his right of temporary veto over Ordinances and he had stated that he only envisaged using it in very limited circumstances . The remainder of the ORG \u2019s other powers , such as the limited power to appointment certain of the island \u2019s executive officials , did not affect the democratic process .", "CARDINAL . Finally , Article CARDINAL could not assist the claimants in the case : their complaint under LAW was essentially the same as that made LAW .", "CARDINAL . In FAC ( no . CARDINAL ) , the same claimants challenged Reform ( GPE ) ( LAW ) ( No . CARDINAL ) Law DATE , which removed the Seneschal from the Chief Pleas and made new provisions for his or her appointment , removal , renewal and remuneration . They did so by way of judicial review proceedings , commenced in ORG and GPE , alleging that the provisions were incompatible with LAW and thus that the decision of ORG to recommend that Royal Assent be given to the PERSON through an Order in Council was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the challenges to provisions on appointment , removal and renewal of the Seneschal . It found , however , that the power of the Chief Pleas to reduce the Seneschal \u2019s remuneration was incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The latter part of the judgment was appealed to ORG , which allowed the appeal : [ CARDINAL ] ORG CARDINAL . ORG found that , although ORG had jurisdiction to hear such a challenge , it should not have exercised its discretion to hear it . For the courts of GPE and GPE to entertain challenges to the compatibility of LOC legislation with the Convention would be to subvert the LOC own human rights legislation ( see , for instance , the Human Rights ( Bailiwick of Guernsey ) Law CARDINAL , set out at paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The courts of ORG were infinitely better placed to assess the issues involved in human rights cases and there was the ultimate safeguard of an appeal to ORG of ORG . Unlike the courts of GPE and GPE , ORG had the inestimable benefit of the considered judgment of the courts of first instance and appeal in the island jurisdictions , and the island authorities would have every opportunity to take part in the case . The courts of the FAC were the appropriate forum in which challenges to island legislation on grounds of incompatibility with the LAW should be heard ( PERSON at DATE and CARDINAL of ORG judgment ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
