The applicant was born in DATE in GPE ( GPE ) and currently lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant flew from GPE to GPE . At the airport , NORP officials discovered QUANTITY of cocaine on CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s travelling companions , on the basis of which the applicant and her companions were arrested . On DATE the GPE am ORG ( PERSON ) convicted the applicant of participation in the deliberate importation of QUANTITY of cocaine and sentenced her to DATE and DATE imprisonment . The applicant did not appeal the judgment . She was granted early release on DATE and , on DATE , was expelled from GPE to GPE . The NORP authorities did not impose an exclusion order on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant travelled as a tourist to the GPE where she met and started a relationship with a GPE national , Mr T. On DATE , a request for advice on her eligibility for a provisional residence visa ( machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf ) for the purpose of stay with NORP partner was filed on behalf of the applicant . Such a visa entitles the holder to enter the GPE in order to apply for a residence permit for a stay exceeding DATE . An application for a provisional residence visa is in principle assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit . On DATE , a positive advice was issued .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently returned to GPE where she applied for a provisional residence visa at the GPE mission . According to the applicant , the question whether she had ever been convicted of a criminal offence was not raised in the procedure on her request for a provisional residence visa and , being unaware that this would be relevant , she had not volunteered this information either .", "CARDINAL . Following the transmission of a positive advice of ORG ( ORG ) to the GPE mission in GPE , in which the latter were requested to inform the applicant that , in order to quality for a residence permit , she would be required to sign a formal statement to the effect that she had never been the subject of criminal proceedings and/or a criminal conviction ( antecedentenverklaring ; hereinafter \u201c declaration on criminal antecedents \u201d ) , the applicant was provided on DATE with a provisional residence visa by the GPE Minister of ORG . According to the applicant , the information about the declaration on criminal antecedents was not given to her when she received the provisional residence visa at the GPE mission in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant returned to the GPE where , to date , she has been cohabiting with Mr T.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a request for a temporary regular residence permit ( verblijfsvergunning regulier voor bepaalde tijd ) for the purpose of stay with her GPE partner Mr T. When she was confronted with the prescribed declaration on criminal antecedents , she refused to sign it and her conviction in GPE came to light .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was informed of the Minister \u2019s intention ( voornemen ) to declare her an undesirable alien entailing the imposition of an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) . The applicant was given the opportunity to react to this intention in the course of an interview conducted by ORG ( vreemdelingenpolitie ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecution department at ORG ( arrondissementsparket ) was requested to consider whether the facts of which the applicant had been convicted in GPE constituted a criminal offence under NORP law and whether the sentence imposed was comparable to the sentence that would be imposed by a GPE judge if the offence had been committed in the GPE . In its reply of DATE , the prosecution department stated that participation in the deliberate importation of cocaine constituted a serious criminal offence ( misdrijf ) under NORP law , attracting a prison sentence of PERCENT . It further stated that the applicant , if she were convicted in the GPE , would probably be sentenced to CARDINAL to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment on the understanding that a judicial examination and determination of sentence obviously depended on the specific circumstances of each individual case .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( ORG ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request for a residence permit . The Deputy Minister further declared the applicant an undesirable alien entailing the imposition of a DATE exclusion order , as it had appeared that the applicant had been convicted on DATE by the GPE am ORG of participation in the deliberate importation of cocaine for which she had been sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . Having noted the contents of the letter of DATE of the prosecution department at ORG , the Deputy Minister found that the judgment of the GPE am ORG did not substantially differ from the judgment that would have been passed by a GPE court . While acknowledging that the exclusion order constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s right to respect for her family life , the Minister considered that this was justified in the interests of public safety ( openbare orde ) and the prevention of crime , and that the general interests of the ORG thus outweighed those of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) against the decision . She argued that , as she had been granted a provisional residence visa , she had a legitimate expectation that she would be granted a residence permit as well . She further argued that a NORP court would have passed a much more lenient sentence than the NORP court had done and that forcing her to leave would constitute an unjustified interference with her right to respect for family life now that she had been legally residing in the GPE since DATE .", "CARDINAL . As a decision to impose an exclusion order is immediately enforceable and an appeal against such a decision does not enjoy automatic suspensive effect , the applicant applied on DATE to ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) in order to stay her expulsion pending the objection proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her partner married in GPE on DATE . On DATE a son was born of this marriage . The applicant had decided that , in view of her age , it would be unwise to wait too long before conceiving a child , despite her uncertain residence status .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant was heard on her objection lodged on DATE before an official board of enquiry ( ambtelijke commissie ) . This board also put questions to her husband who attended the hearing , who stated inter alia that he had a reasonable command of NORP but that he did not wish to settle in GPE given the bad economic situation there . The applicant stated inter alia that she was in contact with her mother and CARDINAL brothers who were living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for ORG ( Minister PERSON ; the successor to the Deputy Minister of ORG ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection on the grounds that the applicant could not claim a legitimate expectation to be granted a residence permit on the basis of the provisional residence visa and that a NORP court would have imposed a sentence approaching the sentence handed down by the NORP court . Furthermore , the Minister held that the interference with the applicant \u2019s family life was justified in order to protect public safety ( openbare orde ) and to prevent crime in view of the applicant \u2019s drug - related conviction , and that there were no objective obstacles standing in the way of the applicant \u2019s husband and child following her to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE \u2013 unaware of the fact that the applicant \u2019s objection had been determined on DATE granted the provisional measure that she had requested on DATE . As its requests of CARDINAL DATE and DATE to the Minister for information about the state of affairs in the objection proceedings had remained unanswered , it concluded that apparently the Minister did not attach great weight to the applicant \u2019s speedy removal from the GPE and therefore granted the provisional measure .", "CARDINAL . By DATE the applicant had already filed an appeal with ORG of The GPE against the dismissal of her objection , raising largely the same grounds and elaborating her claim that she was unlikely to have been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment had she been tried by a NORP court . She based this assertion on a document containing indicative guidelines for the determination of sentences for drug couriers , in use by judges in the GPE . A sentence of DATE in the applicant \u2019s case would have meant , according to the regulations in force , that she would have been eligible for a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after a hearing held on DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE denied the applicant \u2019s appeal . The court agreed with the Minister that there was no question of a legitimate expectation . It further found that , based on the advice of the public prosecution department , the Minister had correctly estimated the length of the sentence that a NORP court would have handed down . As regards LAW , the court held that the interference with the applicant \u2019s family life was justified in order to protect public safety and to prevent crime and that there were no objective obstacles to the applicant and her family continuing their family life in GPE . In this context it considered that the conviction concerned a narcotics offence , that DATE although DATE had elapsed since this conviction whereas the applicant had not reoffended since DATE this did not affect the serious nature of this offence and that \u2013 unlike the situation in the case of GPE v. GPE , ( no . CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALIX ) \u2013 the applicant had never held a residence permit . It further took into account that the applicant \u2019s marriage and the birth of her child were posterior to the decision to impose an exclusion order and found that there were no objective obstacles for the applicant and her family to continue their family life in GPE . It therefore concluded that the public interest outweighed the personal interests of the applicant and her family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed the judgment of ORG to ORG of ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak PERSON ; \u201c the NORP \u201d ) on largely the same grounds . The applicant also argued that ORG had merely carried out a marginal assessment ( marginale toetsing ) by examining the reasonableness of the decision of the Minister to deny the applicant \u2019s claim under LAW , whereas the matter should have been considered on the merits as well . The applicant further claimed that ORG had misinterpreted the principle of objective obstacles to the family starting anew in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant also petitioned the President of ORG for a provisional measure on DATE . The President denied the request as there were no grounds on which to assume that the impugned decision would be overturned on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the further appeal , holding :", "\u201c What has been raised in the grievances does not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling ( kan niet tot vernietiging van de aangevallen uitspraak leiden ) . Having regard to LAW , no further reasoning is called for , since the arguments submitted do not raise questions which require determination in the interest of legal uniformity , legal development or legal protection in the general sense . \u201d", "No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . The applicant currently still resides in the GPE and has never reoffended .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( Vreemdelingenwet DATE ) . Further rules were laid down in LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW ( Vreemdelingencirculaire ) . LAW ( PERSON ) applied to proceedings under LAW DATE , unless indicated otherwise in this Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , LAW DATE was replaced by LAW . On DATE , LAW , the Regulation on Aliens and LAW were replaced by new versions based on LAW . Unless indicated otherwise in LAW , LAW continued to apply to proceedings on requests by aliens for admission and residence .", "CARDINAL . According to the transitional rules , set out in LAW of LAW , an application for a residence permit which was being processed at the time this LAW entered into force was to be considered as an application under the provisions of LAW . Because no transitional rules were set for the substantive provisions of the GPE law , the substantive provisions under LAW took effect immediately .", "CARDINAL . The Netherlands Government pursue a restrictive immigration policy due to the population and employment situation in the GPE . Aliens are eligible for admission only on the basis of international agreements , or if their presence serves an essential NORP interest , or for compelling reasons of a humanitarian reason ( article CARDINAL of LAW ) . Respect for family life as guaranteed by LAW constitutes an obligation under an international agreement .", "CARDINAL . As a rule , anyone wishing to apply for a residence permit in the GPE must first apply from his or her country of origin to the GPE Minister of ORG for a provisional residence visa . Only once such a visa has been issued abroad may the holder travel to the GPE and apply for a residence permit for the GPE . An application for a provisional residence visa is in principle assessed on the basis of the same criteria as a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The admission policy for family formation ( gezinsvorming ) and family reunion ( gezinshereniging ) purposes is laid down in LAW of LAW DATE . A partner or spouse of a GPE national is in principle eligible for admission , if certain further conditions relating to matters such as public policy and means of subsistence are met .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to article CARDINAL of LAW , a residence permit for the purposes of family reunion or family formation can be refused if the alien constitutes a threat to public order or national security . In this respect , article LAW CARDINAL(c ) of LAW reads in its relevant part that a threat to public order exists when :", "\u201c c. the alien has been convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to either a non - suspended prison sentence or custodial measure , a community service order or non - suspended financial penalty , or if , in relation to a criminal offence , the alien has accepted an out - of - court settlement or if a punishment order has been issued against him by a public prosecutor . \u201d", "LAW CARDINAL of LAW provides that , in applying LAW CARDINAL(c ) , also violations of public order committed outside of the GPE are taken into account , provided that they constitute a serious criminal offence ( misdrijf ) under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . A past criminal conviction is not permanently held against the person concerned . Like the delays that apply to a request to lift an exclusion order , a past conviction is no longer held against a petitioner for a residence permit once a period of CARDINAL ( for drugs or violent offences ) or CARDINAL ( for other offences ) DATE has elapsed , provided that the petitioner has not reoffended .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that a foreign national may be declared an undesirable alien , entailing the imposition of an exclusion order , on the ground , inter alia , that he or she has been convicted of a serious offence carrying a prison sentence of DATE or more , or poses a danger to public order . An exclusion order entails a ban on residing in or visiting the GPE . An exclusion order is immediately enforceable and the person on whom it is imposed is informed at the time of notification of this decision that he or she is obliged to leave the GPE immediately , that is within TIME .", "CARDINAL . An exclusion order can be challenged in administrative law appeal proceedings under the terms of LAW . Such appeal proceedings do not have automatic suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c If ORG of ORG finds that a complaint raised does not provide grounds for overturning [ the impugned ruling ] , it may , in giving reasons for its decision , limit itself to that finding . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) provides that an alien who stays in the GPE while he or she knows that an exclusion order has been imposed on him or her commits a criminal offence punishable by CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of MONEY .", "CARDINAL . An exclusion order may be revoked , upon request , if the alien concerned has been residing outside the GPE for an uninterrupted period of DATE ( article DATE of LAW ) .
