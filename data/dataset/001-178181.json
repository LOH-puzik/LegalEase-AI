The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He had been a professional truck driver until he became unable to work due to epilepsy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was certified as having a \u201c category III work - related disability \u201d as a result of his condition . He was found to have a right to be reassigned to a suitable position of employment where he and others would not be at risk because of his condition , with ( retroactive ) effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Celje regional unit of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the regional ORG \u201d ) granted the applicant a so - called \u201c allowance for the period of waiting to be reassigned to or employed in a different appropriate position of employment \u201d ( hereinafter \u201c waiting period allowance \u201d ) from DATE . Though the sums appear to be lower during DATE , he had been subsequently receiving around QUANTITY ( ORG ) per month in waiting period allowance . The regional ORG relied on section CARDINAL of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) and section CARDINAL of the new ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d \u2013 see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . It noted that the applicant had been registered as unemployed on DATE and had been a beneficiary under LAW from DATE to CARDINAL October CARDINAL . Thus , once his unemployment allowance had come to an end he had become entitled to a waiting period allowance under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The regional ORG also noted that , under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , beneficiaries were entitled to a waiting period allowance until they fulfilled the conditions for retirement ( ibid . ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s doctor informed the regional ORG about a shoulder injury the applicant had sustained and requested a reassessment of his level of disability .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of , inter alia , information provided by the applicant \u2019s doctor , the regional ORG , on DATE , decided that the applicant had a right to be reassigned to another position of employment with several limitations , such as not to work at unprotected heights or drive category C and E vehicles , with effect from DATE . Subsequently , on DATE it adopted a decision granting him a disability allowance ( nadomestilo za invalidnost ) from DATE . The regional ORG relied on the DATE Act , which had introduced certain new disability benefits ( the term \u201c disability benefit \u201d is used to cover any type of allowance that arises from a disability ) and discontinued some of those provided for under the DATE LAW , including the waiting period allowance . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW stipulated that a right to a disability allowance applied as from DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The regional ORG noted in its decision that the applicant had not been insured under the compulsory insurance scheme at the onset of his disability , but had been registered as unemployed on DATE within DATE of the final decision on his disability , as required by section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act . It was established that his capacity to work had in fact further reduced , even though the category ( III ) of his disability remained unchanged . The regional ORG found that , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , he should receive a benefit in the form of disability allowance , which in his case amounted to ORG . It drew the applicant \u2019s attention to section CARDINAL of the DATE Act , which required beneficiaries to inform the ORG of any change in circumstances which could affect their rights under that LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the above decision , arguing that in determining the amount of his disability benefit , the regional ORG should have respected the principle of acquired rights . He pointed out that his benefit had reduced considerably , even though his disability had in fact worsened , and claimed that such a decision was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the central ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the central ORG \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , confirming that the regional ORG had properly applied the law and correctly calculated the amount of his disability allowance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim with ORG challenging the above decisions . He reiterated that the disability allowance granted to him under LAW violated his acquired rights and that instead of increasing his benefit it reduced it by CARDINAL , which was unlawful and unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Celje Labour and ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It explained that while recipients of disability - related rights under LAW retained their acquired rights after the date set out in section CARDINAL of LAW , in the applicant \u2019s case a reassessment of his disability had been carried out on DATE due to a worsening of his condition ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , which had resulted in further workplace limitations and his rights being consequently determined anew . In cases where a fresh assessment was made LAW was to be applied . The court concluded that LAW did not contain the right to a waiting period allowance . Instead , under LAW , it provided for the disability allowance ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) which had been correctly granted to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the judgment , repeating the complaints he had made before the first - instance court and alleging that he ought to have been informed of the consequences of a request for a reassessment of his disability . If that had been the case , he would have \u201c forbidden \u201d his doctor from making such a request . Lastly , he reiterated that the decision of the regional ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was unlawful and unconstitutional , as it violated his right to social security ; he pointed out that he was unable to survive on the newly determined disability allowance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Higher Labour and ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , confirming the position of the lower court that the applicant \u2019s case concerned a change in the level of disability , which had required a fresh determination of his disability benefit . In such a situation , section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act provided that the applicant acquired rights under LAW . Also , since the applicant \u2019s rights had been determined anew , ORG concluded that there had been no violation of his acquired rights related to social security , and thus no violation of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law before ORG , arguing that he could not have legitimately expected that the worsening of his disability would result in a severe reduction of his disability benefit . In that connection , he alleged that ORG view that the reduction did not interfere with his acquired rights or constitute a violation of his constitutional right to social security was arbitrary , as the court had provided no reasoning for that conclusion . The applicant further alleged that the newly determined amount of disability benefit interfered with his constitutional right to property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , finding that the Higher Labour and ORG had sufficiently explained that the change in his level of disability had required a fresh determination of his benefit in accordance with the DATE Act .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against ORG judgment , alleging a violation of his constitutional rights to property and social security . He argued that the reduction in the disability benefit had put his subsistence at risk and failed the test of proportionality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to accept the applicant \u2019s complaint for consideration on the merits , referring to section DATE ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE , the applicant fulfilled the conditions for a retirement pension in the amount of ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL and his disability allowance was discontinued from DATE . He thus received the disability allowance for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Data concerning the applicant \u2019s income provided by the NORP tax authorities shows that he received ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE in pension and disability insurance and , after the impugned change in his allowance , ORG CARDINAL in DATE and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
