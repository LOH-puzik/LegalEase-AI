The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the trial court \u201d ) ordered an indefinite security measure against the applicant , who was a deaf mute , of \u201c compulsory psychiatric treatment and confinement in a medical institution of a closed type \u201d ( \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0458\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0438 \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d \u0442\u0438\u043f ) ( \u201c the confinement order \u201d ) for causing \u201c serious bodily injury \u201d and \u201c endangering another with a dangerous implement in a fight or quarrel \u201d . The court established that on DATE an incident had taken place in the court building between PERSON , the applicant 's father , and PERSON , as parties summoned to attend a hearing scheduled for DATE . The applicant intervened in the quarrel and knocked Mr D. down . Mr D. sustained severe head injuries and a brain haemorrhage as a result of DATE and died DATE . The applicant also hit a judge several times . He was subsequently prevented from assaulting a third person . The court found that the applicant was \u201c slightly mentally retarded \u201d and considered aggressive and a danger to the public , in particular villagers whom he had allegedly often assaulted . CARDINAL medical reports drawn up by CARDINAL psychiatric experts confirmed that the applicant was mentally ill , and needed medical treatment in a specialised psychiatric hospital .", "CARDINAL . The confinement order was enforced immediately . The applicant was placed in ORG ( hereafter \u201c the hospital \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital requested the trial court to amend the confinement order and release the applicant on condition that he undergoes compulsory psychiatric treatment . It based its proposal on the applicant 's good behaviour in the past , the good relations he had established with the staff and other patients and the absence of any neurotic or psychiatric disorder since his confinement . The hospital noted that the applicant was mentally ill , which was a permanent state that could not be regarded as a disease . The public prosecutor supported the hospital 's proposal .", "CARDINAL . In submissions of DATE , the applicant 's sister requested that the trial court decide on the hospital 's proposal . A petition signed by over QUANTITY villagers , indicating that the applicant had been never dangerous and had been accepted in the village , was also attached to the request .", "CARDINAL . The trial court , in a decision confirmed on appeal , dismissed the hospital 's proposal relying on a notification by police , according to which the applicant had left the hospital several times and his visits to the village had been perceived as a threat and a danger by the local inhabitants . The police also referred to an incident of DATE involving the applicant and PERSON son . In a court decision of DATE , confirmed on appeal , PERSON son was acquitted , as having acted in self - defence , of causing grievous bodily injury to the applicant . The court also referred to another petition signed by many villagers , which allegedly had been attached to the notification .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital lodged with the trial court a fresh proposal for the applicant 's conditional release , which was based on similar grounds to those of the previous review : good relations with the staff and other patients ; no disturbance of order ; mild drug therapy . The proposal was made with the stated aim of a faster and more efficient re - socialisation and reintegration of the applicant . The applicant was transferred to an open ward of the hospital . The public prosecutor supported the hospital 's proposal .", "CARDINAL . In submissions of DATE , the applicant , who was represented by PERSON , informed the court that his father intended to change residence and had consequently bought an apartment elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court requested the police to make an inquiry into whether the applicant had caused problems during his stay in the village and whether he had been a danger to the local inhabitants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court dismissed the hospital 's proposal , relying on a police report of CARDINAL DATE . It stated , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... the applicant left the hospital several times and went to stay with his father ... the last visit was in DATE ... after his arrival in the village , he started shouting out some indistinct words ... although he was noticed by the inhabitants , there were no attacks on other persons ... during the DATE stay in the village , he was always with his father . His presence in the village frightened , in particular , the immediate neighbours , who protected themselves by shutting up their houses and barring them from inside . Many inhabitants said that the applicant was under the psychological influence of his father , who DATE when intoxicated \u2013 had often provoked him by telling lies about the death of his mother and had thus made him aggressive towards some people . Local inhabitants therefore still feared the applicant 's aggression ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant left the hospital without consent and remained at large until DATE , when the police returned him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained that the trial court had not based its decision on relevant facts , arguing that the expert opinions of the hospital and the responsible medical officer who had treated him were the only evidence relevant for the court . He maintained that in case of misgivings as to the validity of the hospital 's opinion , the court should have obtained an alternative medical expertise . In submissions of DATE , the public prosecutor supported the applicant 's appeal and his request that the case be remitted for fresh consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal and stated that the hospital 's proposal was irrelevant since it was not binding on the court . It ruled that on the basis of the results of the medical treatment it was free to decide whether the applicant was fit to be discharged from the hospital and treated on release . Lastly , it concluded that the applicant had escaped from the hospital several times and had presented a threat to the public . It was therefore too early to consider him fit for release .", "CARDINAL . No further DATE reviews were carried out until the hospital 's fresh proposal of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the applicant has been placed in a semi - open ward of the hospital , where he is responsible for the maintenance and hygiene of the ward . He can not leave the hospital at will , unless authorised by a doctor . His last unauthorised leave from the hospital dates back to CARDINAL DATE . The police returned him after DATE . After that incident , a decision was taken that the applicant be allowed to leave the hospital . DATE the applicant was given leave on CARDINAL occasions , each time lasting not DATE . During this so - called \u201c therapy probationary leave \u201d , the applicant received the prescribed therapy and his father took care of him . His mental health was stable and required no special supervision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hospital unsuccessfully applied for replacement of the confinement order with the applicant 's conditional release , which was now to be accompanied by removal of his legal capacity and appointment of a guardian ( \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b ) . The latter was based on the hospital 's view that the applicant 's father was unfit to take proper care of him . At a public hearing held on DATE , and after consulting CARDINAL doctors from the hospital and a ORG representative , the trial court found no one suitable to be appointed as the applicant 's guardian , if released . No information was provided as to whether the applicant appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL .
