Their actions do not contravene LAW On Operational and Search Activity \u201d .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants maintained that it was beyond reasonable doubt that the men who had abducted Mr PERSON were ORG agents . In support of their complaint , they referred to the following facts . Mr PERSON was suspected by the authorities of membership of illegal armed groups ( see paragraphs DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) ; TIME prior to the abduction CARDINAL officers from the Sovetskiy ROVD visited the first applicant \u2019s house in GPE and showed the ORG warrant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE above ) . Then , in GPE , TIME , CARDINAL of the abductors identified himself as a police officer and shortly after the abduction the police arrived at the scene and removed the spent cartridges to cover the ORG tracks . The perpetrators were violent and opened fire without hesitation , in the presence of a number of witnesses . The applicants further stated that since Mr NORP had been missing for DATE at the time of the submission of their observations to the ORG , he could be presumed dead . That presumption was further supported by the circumstances in which he had been abducted , which should be recognised as life - threatening .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicants\u2019 relative had been abducted by unidentified men and that neither the ORG behaviour nor their vehicles provided for any firm evidence that they were ORG agents . The Government further contended that there was no evidence that Mr NORP was dead .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes that in its extensive case - law it has developed a number of general principles relating to the establishment of matters in dispute , in particular when faced with allegations of violations of fundamental rights ( for a most recent summary of these , see PERSON v. \u201c the former GPE \u201d [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . More specifically , the ORG has adjudicated a series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances in the NORP LOC . Applying the above - mentioned principles , it has concluded that it would be sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction of the missing persons by ORG agents , thus falling within the control of the authorities , and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof , either by disclosing the documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred ( see , for example , concerning abductions in ORG , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE , and GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . If the Government failed to rebut this presumption , that would entail a violation of LAW in its substantive part . Conversely , where the applicants failed to make a prima facie case , the burden of proof could not be reversed ( see , for example , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In view of the parties\u2019 submission concerning the circumstances of the abduction ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , the ORG concludes that the materials in its possession demonstrate the validity of the ORG allegation , for the following reasons . Firstly , the abductors , who arrived in a civilian vehicle , acted as an organised group and did not hesitate to open fire and perpetrate the abduction in the street , in daylight and in the presence of witnesses . CARDINAL of them told the second applicant that they were from the police . Secondly , a group of local police officers arrived at the crime scene shortly after the incident and collected the cartridge cases left by the abductors . Thirdly , the police officers\u2019 visit to the first applicant \u2019s house in GPE looking for Mr NORP on suspicion of his involvement in terrorist activities , TIME prior to his abduction in Kaspiysk , provides grounds to believe that these CARDINAL events were interconnected . Further , the investigators took no meaningful steps to check whether the abduction could have been perpetrated for other reasons , such as a blood feud , ransom , drugs or hostility . No serious steps were taken to verify those hypotheses and no information was obtained that the abductors could have been other than ORG agents ( see , by contrast , PERSON v. GPE , no . GPE , \u00a7 MONEY , DATE ) . Lastly , the procrastination of the authorities in the investigation into the matter , along with the ORG consistent allegations that law - enforcement officers were involved in the incident ( see , for example , paragraph CARDINAL above ) , provide the ORG with the grounds to conclude that the applicants have made a prima facie case that their relative Mr PERSON was abducted by ORG agents . The Government \u2019s statement that the investigators found no evidence that members of lawenforcement authorities were involved in PERSON GPE disappearance is insufficient to discharge them from the above - mentioned burden of proof . Having examined the documents submitted by the parties and drawing inferences from the Government \u2019s failure to provide another plausible explanation for the events in question , the ORG finds that Mr Abdurakhman Abdurakhmanov was apprehended on DATE by ORG agents ( see , for a similar situation , PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . There has been no reliable news of Mr PERSON since his arrest . The Government have not submitted any explanation as to what happened to him afterwards .", "DATE . The ORG finds that , in a situation where a person is detained by unidentified police officers without any subsequent acknowledgment of the detention and is then missing for DATE , that situation can be regarded as life - threatening . The absence of Mr PERSON or of any news of him for DATE supports this assumption .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the ORG finds that the evidence available permits it to establish to the requisite standard of proof that Mr PERSON must be presumed dead following his unacknowledged detention by ORG agents ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "2", "3", "5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1", "5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
