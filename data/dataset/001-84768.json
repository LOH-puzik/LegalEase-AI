TURKEY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He had been granted legal aid and was represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) did not designate an Agent for the LAW proceedings .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant bought a plot of arable land from a fellow villager . The seller had held the land in his possession for DATE without a title deed . The transaction took place unofficially and the parties did not execute a written sale agreement .", "In DATE the authorities conducted regional cadastral works in the area . As a result , the plot in question was registered in the land register as CARDINAL separate parcels , numbered CARDINAL and CARDINAL . Parcel no . CARDINAL was registered in the name of the applicant as an arable field based on witness statements confirming that he had had taken it over from its previous possessor and had been exploiting it without interruption ever since . Parcel no . CARDINAL however was classified as part of an adjacent forest . As the legislation permitted no private ownership of forest land , this parcel was registered in the name of the ORG as a ORG property .", "According to the applicant , he was uninformed about this registration and continued to cultivate not only parcel no . CARDINAL but no . CARDINAL . He only became aware of the situation in DATE , when the authorities discovered the cultivation and fined him for illegal utilisation of ORG property .", "On DATE the applicant initiated civil proceedings before ORG , requesting parcel no . CARDINAL to be registered in his name . A court - appointed expert conducted an inspection and concluded that parcel no . CARDINAL could not be characterised as forest land .", "Agreeing with the expert , ORG ruled in favour of the applicant on DATE . The court also established that the applicant had been holding the parcel in his uncontested and uninterrupted possession for long enough to entitle him to claim title under the applicable legislation . Accordingly , the court recognised him as the lawful owner of the parcel .", "On DATE , however , ORG quashed this judgment . It established that older land inventories proved that the disputed parcel was on the outer limits of a neighbouring forest . The court reasoned that DATE of intensive cultivation must have removed the natural flora . Despite such a transformation , the court considered that the land should be considered as despoiled forest which had never belonged to the applicant . Accordingly , it directed the civil court to re - examine the facts of the case and pass judgment accordingly .", "On DATE ORG adhered to this ruling . It held that the revision of the local plan served the general interest given that parcel no . CARDINAL was a forest area and that the applicant had illegally occupied it by expanding the boundaries of his lawfully possessed land , i.e. plot no . CARDINAL .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "On DATE the ORG sold the plot of land in question to a third party as an arable field .", "Article CARDINAL of ORG provides that , persons who hold in their possession an unregistered immovable property without interruption or legal challenge for a minimum period of DATE , are entitled to request its registration in their names ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
