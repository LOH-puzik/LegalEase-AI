On DATE , at an auction organised by ORG , the applicants , who were the only participants in the bid , purchased real property owned by ORG for MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting on behalf of ORG and relying on the DATE PERSON on unjustified enrichment at the expense of ORG , sued the applicants in a civil court , seeking payment in the amount of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The prosecuting authorities referred to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and invoked their powers as the guardians of the legal order . They submitted that the applicants had purchased the property concerned under a compensatory scheme for persons who had abandoned their property on territories beyond LOC that had belonged to GPE before the Second World War . Under this scheme , governed chiefly by the provisions of ORG DATE ( \u201c LAW \u201d \u2013 see paragraphs DATE below ) , the applicants had a \u201c right to credit \u201d , that is , the right to count the price of the abandoned property towards the price of the property to be purchased from ORG .", "CARDINAL . The prosecuting authorities further argued that the purchase price , which partly comprised compensation for the property left by the applicants\u2019 legal predecessors in ORG , in the former NORP territories beyond LOC , had been calculated wrongly . They averred in that respect that the value of the property , as assessed by expert ORG , amounted to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . DATE before the contract was concluded , the same expert had assessed the value of the same property at ORG MONEY . The prosecuting authorities , harbouring certain doubts as to the soundness of the estimates , had instituted investigations and appointed a new expert , who had estimated the value of the abandoned property at MONEY . Consequently , as the value of the house that the applicants\u2019 legal predecessors had abandoned in ORG was much lower than the price the applicants had paid for the property in GPE , the ORG had sold them the latter property at a considerable loss . The plaintiff prosecuting authority further argued that the first expert , ORG , had had regard to the market value of the ORG property , whereas under the relevant legislation he should have taken the technical value of the property into account . As the applicants had refused to comply with ORG demand to pay ORG MONEY , the prosecuting authorities claimed that the applicants should repay that amount to them .", "CARDINAL . The applicants argued in their pleadings that ORG , which had sold them the property in GPE under the provisions of LAW , had had the expert estimates at its disposal and had not put forward any objections at that time . They submitted that the estimate relied on by the prosecuting authorities in their statement of claim was based on the assumption that the property in ORG was in a rural location , which was incorrect as it was situated in a town .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s claim against the applicants , considering it to be unfounded .", "CARDINAL . The court first observed that the applicants had bought the property at a public auction organised by ORG under the compensation scheme for former owners of properties in the former NORP territories . For the purposes of the auction they had submitted to the authorities CARDINAL successive expert opinions concerning the value of the property owned by their legal predecessors in ORG , prepared by expert PERSON He had estimated the value of the property abandoned in ORG at ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL . As the value of the property they had purchased from GPE amounted to ORG MONEY , the applicants had not been obliged to pay anything to the municipality .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the crux of the legal issue it had to resolve lay in the determination of the methods and criteria to be used when assessing the value of properties abandoned in the pre - war NORP territory . It referred to LAW , applicable to the compensatory scheme at that time , and to the ORG \u2019s ordinance issued on the basis of LAW of said LAW . Under section CARDINAL of the ordinance , the value of the abandoned land was to be assessed with reference to the current market price of land , and the value of houses with reference to their so - called reconstruction value .", "CARDINAL . The court further observed that the relevant legislation did not lay down any other criteria for the valuation of the properties concerned . The properties therefore had to be valued on a case - by - case basis , with reference to all the factors relevant to a particular case . In such circumstances , the court had to make a choice relying on the conclusions of the experts commissioned to submit their reports to the court .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , the court took account of expert opinions prepared by experts PERSON and TIME for the purposes of the investigations conducted by the prosecuting authorities in connection with the purchase of the property . It also had regard to the findings and estimates made for the purpose of the civil proceedings by experts GPE , PERSON and ORG , who had been assigned to the case by the court . The court further noted the conclusions of an opinion prepared at the applicants\u2019 request by expert ORG", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that , in the light of the various arguments advanced by the experts , the price paid by the applicants in DATE corresponded to the value of the property abandoned in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court had regard to the fact that the applicants had , in the meantime , sold the property in question and obtained ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for it . This , in the court \u2019s view , confirmed its finding that the price for the property , fixed by ORG in DATE at PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL , had been excessive .", "CARDINAL . The court further ordered ORG of ORG to repay to the applicants the litigation costs they had borne in the proceedings , in the amount of ORG . The court referred to LAW , taken in conjunction with Article CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecuting authorities appealed , claiming that ORG , in estimating the value of the properties concerned , had failed to take into account all the relevant expert opinions . In addition , ORG decision to award the legal costs borne by the defendants had been ill - founded . They argued that , since the plaintiff in the case had been the prosecutor , the general principle whereby the unsuccessful party in a civil case bore the litigation costs , enshrined in LAW , was not applicable .", "CARDINAL . The applicants , in reply to the appeal , submitted that the assessment of the value of the abandoned property had been thorough and had been based on CARDINAL expert opinions prepared by CARDINAL experts .", "CARDINAL . As to the litigation costs , they argued that the prosecuting authorities , while acting on behalf of ORG , had in fact been seeking to protect the financial interests of ORG rather than to act as the guardian of the legal order . Hence , the prosecution had not been acting under LAW , that is , to protect the rule of law or ORG rights , or in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . In such a situation , had the prosecution been exempted from operation of the general principle of responsibility of the unsuccessful party for the litigation costs , they would have been placed at an unfair advantage vis - \u00e0 - vis the other party .", "CARDINAL . Hence , LAW should be applied to their case in the manner advanced by ORG , which had stated that the term \u201c ORG \u201d used in DATE Procedure should by no means imply that an award of costs for or against ORG was ruled out in situations in which the prosecuting authorities acted in a civil case representing the financial interests of ORG ( decision of DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the prosecutor \u2019s appeal in so far as it related to the price of the property concerned . The court noted that the first - instance court had had regard to expert opinions prepared by CARDINAL experts . It had carefully examined their conclusions and explained convincingly , with reference to the detailed findings of their reports , why it had found the price paid by the applicants for the property to be correct .", "CARDINAL . The court also partly amended the first - instance judgment by refusing to award the applicants their legal costs . The court considered that the situation of a prosecutor bringing a civil action on behalf of a third party represented a special case . He or she could not be regarded as a mere party to civil proceedings . This singular nature of the prosecutor \u2019s role in a civil case was reflected in the rule on costs contained in DATE . Under that provision , the participation of the prosecutor in a civil case did not entail for the other party a right to reimbursement of the litigation costs . Article CARDINALTherefore , and in view of the fact that ORG had not joined the proceedings as a plaintiff , all litigation costs , including the costs borne in connection with the appellate proceedings , had to be borne by the defendants .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under NORP law all persons , with the exception of public authorities and institutions , are obliged to pay a court fee when lodging a statement of claim with the competent civil court . As the case proceeds , a party is obliged to pay additional court fees when lodging any further appeals .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the costs of litigation necessary for the effective conduct of a case are borne by the unsuccessful party to the proceedings . The costs of litigation comprise the court fees referred to above , legal fees paid to professional legal representatives and various other items of expenditure incurred in connection with the proceedings , such as transport costs and loss of salary as a result of participation in the hearings .", "CARDINAL . An exception to this general principle is provided for in LAW . Pursuant to this provision , the court may not order the losing defendant to pay the costs of litigation if he or she did not cause the proceedings to be instituted and acknowledged the claim at a first hearing .", "CARDINAL . The scope of operation of the general principle whereby the unsuccessful party bears the litigation costs , referred to above , is also mitigated by LAW . This provision enshrines the principle of equity in respect of litigation costs and stipulates that the court may order the losing party to pay only a part of the litigation costs , or may exempt it altogether from the obligation to pay these costs , where the", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the public prosecutor may participate in civil proceedings whenever it is necessary to protect the rule of law or ORG rights , or in the public interest . Pursuant to LAW , the prosecuting authorities are obliged to indicate the person or institution on behalf of which they have instituted the proceedings . Under LAW , the prosecuting authorities are exempt from the general obligation to pay court fees .", "CARDINAL . The court serves of its own motion the statement of claim on this person or institution , which is authorised to join the proceedings as a plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code reads :", "\u201c The participation of the prosecutor in a civil case shall not give rise to reimbursement of litigation costs either to or from ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the case - law of ORG , Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure is applicable only if the prosecutor joined a party in the course of the proceedings and not if he instituted them himself ( decision of PERCENT , I Cz CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG further held :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL of the Code is applicable only to cases in which the prosecutor participates in civil proceedings for the purposes indicated in DATE , that is , to protect the rule of law or ORG rights , or in the public interest . The term \u2018 ORG used in DATE Procedure in no sense implies that an award of costs for or against ORG is ruled out in situations in which the prosecuting authorities act in a civil case representing the financial interests of ORG in connection with its acts . \u201d ( decision of DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL )", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG , examining the compatibility with the LAW of certain provisions of civil procedure applicable in competition proceedings , observed :", "\u201c ... exemption from the obligation to pay court costs , in particular costs other than the court fees , can not be automatic in nature , that is to say , it can not create a situation in which the successful party would not have any claim to have his or her costs reimbursed . In the ORG \u2019s view , the particular circumstances of CARDINAL of the parties or the particular character of the case may be such that the creation by law of a mechanism allowing for such a situation can not be ruled out from the outset ... nevertheless , it may not result in a state of affairs in which a successful private party is obliged to bear the full financial cost of his or her participation in the proceedings . In some situations such an outcome might even lead to the economic benefit deriving from the ruling in the party \u2019s favour being cancelled out .", "If the legislature , having regard to circumstances militating in favour of such a solution , adopts an approach which allows the losing party to be completely exempted from the obligation to pay costs , it should at the same time create a separate legal mechanism enabling the successful party to obtain reimbursement of the costs it incurred from another source . ... Exemption of the losing party from any obligation to pay costs , without the successful party having any possibility of having his or her costs compensated , amounts to a restriction of the right of access to a court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( P/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG observed that the principle of equality before the law which manifested itself in , among other things , the right of equal access to the courts and the right to a fair hearing , was also applicable to issues concerning litigation costs . Hence , the principle that the successful party should have its costs reimbursed , and the unsuccessful party bear the financial cost of the proceedings , must be regarded as consistent with the principles of equality and equity .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE NORP law has provided that persons repatriated from the territories beyond LOC which belonged to GPE before the Second World War are entitled to have the value of the property abandoned as a result of the Second World War deducted either from the fee for the right of \u201c perpetual use \u201d or from the price of immovable property purchased from ORG .", "CARDINAL . These provisions were repeated in several successive statutes . At the material time , LAW governed the legal situation of persons entitled to such compensation .", "CARDINAL . NORP The obligation to compensate repatriated persons was laid down in LAW of the LAW , the relevant parts of which provided that persons who , in connection with the war that began DATE , abandoned real property in territories not at present belonging to the NORP State and who , by virtue of international treaties concluded by GPE , were to obtain equivalent compensation for the property abandoned abroad , would have the value of the abandoned real property offset against the fee for the right of perpetual use of land or against the price of a building plot and the ORG - owned buildings or LOC situated thereon .", "CARDINAL . At the material time in the present case , the procedure for implementation of LAW of LAW was laid down in the ORG \u2019s Ordinance of DATE on the principles applicable in connection with offsetting the value of real property abandoned abroad against the price of a title to real property or against the fee for perpetual use .", "CARDINAL . Rules concerning the determination of the value of the abandoned property were set out in the ORG \u2019s Ordinance of DATE ( as amended ) on the offsetting of the value of real property abandoned abroad against the fee for perpetual use or against the price of a building plot and buildings situated thereon ( ORG PERSON w sprawie zaliczania warto\u015bci mienia nieruchomego pozostawionego za granic\u0105 na poczet op\u0142at za u\u017cytkowanie wieczyste lub na pokrycie ceny sprzeda\u017cy dzia\u0142ki budowlanej i po\u0142o\u017conych na niej budynk\u00f3w \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of the DATE Ordinance provided , in its relevant parts , as follows :", "\u201c If the value of the property [ abandoned abroad ] exceeds the price of the real property that has been sold ... , the outstanding amount can be offset against the fee for the right of perpetual use , or against the price of an industrial or commercial plot of land and any commercial or small - business establishments , buildings designated for use as workshops or ateliers , holiday homes or garages situated thereon . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL provided that a first - instance body of the local ORG administration competent to deal with town and country planning should issue the decisions on offsetting the value of property abandoned abroad .
