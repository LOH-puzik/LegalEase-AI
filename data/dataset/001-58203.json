It also issued warrants for their arrest .", "The court held , inter alia , that the offence of laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking had been made out by the fact that the accused were unable to give convincing explanations regarding the source of the family \u2019s considerable income . The expert had noted the existence of CARDINAL bank accounts containing a total of MONEY , whose origin could not be explained solely by the activity of the trading or property companies owned by the accused , notwithstanding their assertion during the investigation that they had accumulated the money by not declaring their earnings to the inland revenue .", "CARDINAL .

It can not be otherwise unless evidence has been supplied of circumstances making it absolutely impossible for him to surrender to custody at the appropriate time . As no such evidence has been supplied by the CARDINAL appellants , against whom arrest warrants were issued after they had appeared in court for the hearing , their appeal , which has been lodged by an attorney practising in ORG , must be declared inadmissible . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The suspensive effect of an appeal on points of law is derived from statute and may therefore likewise be restricted by statute , particularly in the interests of speedier and more effective punishment .
