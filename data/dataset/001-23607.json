SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr. PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "It appears that the applicant was detained on remand for DATE between DATE . He was later charged with aggravated fraud ( grovt bedr\u00e4geri ) and complicity in aggravated fraudulent behaviour towards creditors ( grov oredlighet mot borgen\u00e4rer ) . The indictment was brought by the chief prosecutor at ORG ( ekobrottsmyndigheten ) in GPE .", "ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE heard the case , which also involved charges against CARDINAL co - accused , during DATE between DATE and DATE . The court heard CARDINAL witnesses and the parties submitted a considerable amount of written evidence . In hearing the case , ORG was composed of CARDINAL professional judge and CARDINAL lay assessors ( n\u00e4mndem\u00e4n ) .", "Delivery of judgment was delayed on several occasions due to illness or a heavy workload . Eventually , by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found the applicant guilty of attempted aggravated fraud and complicity in aggravated fraudulent behaviour towards creditors and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . However , the prosecutor \u2019s request that the applicant be prohibited from running a consulting business ( f\u00f6rbud att bedriva r\u00e5dgivningsverksamhet ) was rejected .", "Upon appeal , ORG ( hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE and PERSON heard the case during DATE CARDINAL DATE . On DATE of the hearing , the applicant joined the objection made by CARDINAL of the co - accused that the hearing should be suspended as a person suspected of complicity in the crimes in question was absent and thus could not be heard by ORG . By a decision of DATE , the appellate court decided that the absence of this person did not constitute an obstacle to the continuation of the hearing . It took into account that there had been no contact with this person for a long time and that , despite the efforts to find him , his whereabouts were still unknown . It considered therefore that there was no reason to believe that he would be found in the foreseeable future .", "On DATE ORG rendered its judgment . It upheld the conviction for aggravated fraudulent behaviour towards creditors but acquitted the applicant of the charge of aggravated fraud . The prison sentence remained unchanged . Moreover , ORG decided to prohibit the applicant from running a consulting business for DATE . It had regard to the oral and written evidence presented to it and did not base any part of its assessment on statements made by the person who could not be heard during the hearing .", "On DATE ORG ( H\u00f6gsta domstolen ) refused leave to appeal .", "The criminal proceedings against the applicant and the co - accused attracted interest from the media , and the public prosecutor and the applicant \u2019s lawyer made statements to the press in regard to the proceedings .", "As from DATE a criminal investigation , lead by ORG in GPE , was carried out concerning ORG judge who had presided in the applicant \u2019s case . Due to the investigation , the judge was suspended from his work in DATE . He later resigned from his duties at ORG . On DATE ORG convicted him of breach of trust ( trol\u00f6shet mot huvudman ) , consisting of embezzlement of assets belonging to his aunt during the period of DATE . He was given a suspended sentence .", "The applicant subsequently filed complaints with the police and the Chancellor of ORG ( NORP ) , claiming that ORG judge should not have dealt with his case since the judge had been involved in criminal activities . In the applicant \u2019s view , this had affected his trial by , for instance , delaying the delivery of ORG judgment . By decisions of DATE , respectively , neither the Chancellor of ORG nor ORG ( Riks\u00e5klagaren ) found reason to take action in the matter ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
