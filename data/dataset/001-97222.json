All the applicants are NORP nationals living in LOC . They are all holders of ORG bonds .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the General Secretary of ORG PERSON presented his \u201c basic theses \u201d , which laid the political foundation for economic reform heralding the transition to a market economy . Several laws were enacted which opened up the ORG - dominated planned economy to private enterprise . However , the ORG preferred to keep control over consumer prices rather than leaving them to be determined by the free market .", "CARDINAL . By DATE Government spending increased sharply as a growing number of unprofitable enterprises required State support , whereas more resources were diverted to subsidise consumer prices . At the same time , the elimination of central control over production decisions , especially in the consumer - goods sector , led to a breakdown in traditional supply - demand relationships . This resulted in pervasive shortages of food and basic consumer goods . The Government reacted by introducing ration stamps for food and certain hygiene articles .", "CARDINAL . In addition to ration stamps , the Government of the NORP Socialist GPE ( RSFSR ) put into circulation several types of so - called \u201c commodity bonds \u201d ( \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u0438 ) which gave their bearers the right to purchase consumer goods , such as refrigerators , washing machines , tape recorders and passenger cars . The Urozhay-CARDINAL ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) bonds were CARDINAL of many types of bonds ; they were distributed among agricultural workers and companies which had sold grain and other agricultural produce to the ORG in DATE and DATE . Those bonds were designed to encourage agricultural workers to sell produce to the ORG in exchange for the right to priority purchasing of goods in high demand ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The ORG paid workers for the produce at fixed prices and also gave them bonds in amounts proportionate to the value of the produce sold .", "CARDINAL . The ORG bonds were not legal tender , but they had a certain nominal value indicated on their face . That value determined the maximum purchase price of consumer goods which could be sold on production of the bonds . The bonds were not intended for payment but merely for certification of the right to purchase specific goods ; the sale of goods was conditional on payment of the full purchase price by the bond - holder and production of the bonds for the same amount . The bonds were not registered in the person 's name or otherwise personalised and ORG did not prevent them from being transferred among individuals and legal entities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to put an end to the regulation of retail prices . Shops began to fill up with merchandise but prices increased at a staggering speed ( the inflation rate in DATE was PERCENT ) . In DATE , the Government established that goods available under the bonds would be sold at the prices fixed before DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government introduced the possibility of buying out the bonds with a coefficient of CARDINAL . In DATE , the coefficient was raised to CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . It appears that a significant number of bonds were bought out by the ORG before the buyout operations were stopped in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the status of the commodity bonds was codified in LAW passed by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Its text was very laconic , shorter than CARDINAL page , but it purported to cover every type of commodities bonds issued in DATE . LAW recognised the commodity bonds as part of the internal debt of GPE ; section CARDINAL fixed at DATE the limitation period for the obligations arising out of commodity bonds ( the starting date was not specified ) ; section CARDINAL required the Government to adopt a programme for settlement of the internal debt .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government presented the programme for settlement of the internal debt ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It covered every type of commodity bond , save for the ORG bonds . DATE before LAW was amended so as to provide that the settlement of the debt under the ORG bonds would be regulated by a special federal law ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . DATE the application of section CARDINAL of LAW was suspended in the part concerning the ORG bonds , in accordance with the laws on the federal budget for DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .
