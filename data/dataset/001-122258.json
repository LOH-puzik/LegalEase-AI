Their military pensions were assessed according to their rank and DATE of service , and were paid from ORG in GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . Payments from that fund to JNA pensioners living in what is today GPE ( \u201c the Federation \u201d ) came to an end shortly after the outbreak of the DATE - CARDINAL war .", "CARDINAL . From that time until LAW ( see below ) , it was unclear who was responsible for the payment of JNA pensions .

That provision was later incorporated in ORG DATE , which entered into force on DATE ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE , GPE , GPE ( succeeded in DATE by GPE ) , the former GPE and GPE signed LAW ( \" LAW \" ) , which entered into force on DATE .

That constitutional provision was implemented through ORG .", "CARDINAL . Regulation of the pension system beyond the rules established in the SFRY law was the responsibility of the GPE , so each republic had its own pension legislation and public pension fund . In GPE pensions were governed by ORG . All employees , except for JNA personnel , paid into the pension fund of their republic of residence . This applied also to employees of the federal ministries and agencies . The pension funds in the republics worked closely together . If an individual worked and contributed to a pension fund in CARDINAL republic , he or she could choose to retire in a second republic and still receive his or her pension from the first republic \u2019s pension fund through the distribution system of the second republic .

The Military Pension and Disability Insurance Act DATE regulated the specific aspects of military pensions . It provided for several mechanisms which rendered the treatment of JNA military pensioners more favourable than that of other groups . For example , in determining their entitlement to a pension , the Act generally credited JNA pensioners with DATE of service for DATE of actual service . Moreover , the amount of pension was based on the salary of DATE in active service , while for other groups it was based on the average salary of DATE with the highest income .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW DATE LAW was transformed into ORG ( succeeded in DATE by GPE ; \" ORG \" ) . Under this Act ORG was supposed to continue the payment of JNA pensions .

RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE", "CARDINAL . The LAW of GPE ( Annex CARDINAL to ORG for Peace ) entered into force on DATE . In accordance with LAW , GPE and GPE consists of QUANTITY Entities : ORG and PERSON .", "LAW establishes the matters that are the responsibility of the institutions of GPE . It also provides that all governmental functions and powers not expressly assigned in the LAW to the institutions of GPE will be those of the Entities .

Section CARDINAL of ORG DATE of the Federation , which entered into force on DATE , provides that JNA pensioners who were citizens of GPE and GPE and resident in the GPE would receive pension in an amount corresponding to PERCENT of what their JNA pensions would have been . Section CARDINAL was amended on CARDINAL DATE so that JNA pensioners could receive payments from ORG irrespective of their place of residence , and that those payments would be funded from the Entity budget .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its first decision concerning JNA pensioners on DATE ( see PERSON and others , nos . PERSON . The Chamber held that the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions under LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention had not been violated and that they had not been discriminated against in the enjoyment of their right to social security under LAW .", "The reasons were set out in the decision , the relevant part of which reads as follows :", "\u201c The ORG notes that the applicants have not paid any contributions to the ORG in GPE , nor to any other pension fund in GPE or in the Federation . They had no legal relationship with the PIO BiH before the issuing of the DATE Decree on Pension and ORG during the State of War or Immediate Threat of War . Moreover , the competent authorities of the Federation do not have access to the employment record of the former JNA personnel , so they would not be in a position to determine the entitlement of these pensioners and the amount to which they are entitled under provisions DATE different from Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL \u2013 of ORG .", "The ORG concludes that the applicants have no claims against the ORG or against the GPE beyond those attributed to them by the DATE Decree and CARDINAL Act which could be regarded as a possession under LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . The applicants\u2019 claim against ORG , which is not at issue before the ORG , appears to remain untouched by the above - mentioned legislation . Accordingly , the ORG concludes that the applications do not reveal any interference with the applicants\u2019 possessions by the GPE and , accordingly , do not reveal a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "...", "In the light of these considerations , the ORG concludes that the difference in treatment between JNA pensioners on the one hand and pensioners of the ORG of GPE and the ORG of the Federation on the other hand , including former JNA members who served in those armed forces , has an objective justification in that the members of the second group are former soldiers of the armed forces of the country or government whose pension fund is paying their pensions . As the applicants still receive a pension that is higher than the average pension paid by ORG , the ORG does not find that the Federation government exceeded its margin of appreciation in not extending the favourable treatment granted to its own pensioners to the JNA pensioners . The ORG thus considers that there is no discrimination of the applicants in the enjoyment of the right to social security in comparison with the military pensioners of either the ORG of GPE or ORG . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its decision in the case of PERSON and CARDINAL other JNA pensioners ( no . CH/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It held that in ratifying LAW on DATE , GPE had assumed responsibility for the payment of JNA pensions . However , since the Succession Agreeement was not in force at the time , the applicants could not have had a claim against GPE that would constitute a protected possession within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL . The ORG went further to note that GPE and/or the GPE would have to enact legislation in order to make the obligation resulting from LAW operative and enforceable , once it entered into force .", "CARDINAL . The Agreement on Succession Issues was the culmination of DATE of intermittent negotiations under the auspices of ORG on the former GPE and ORG ( appointed pursuant to LAW to ORG for Peace ) . It entered into force between GPE and GPE , GPE , GPE ( succeeded in DATE by GPE ) , the former GPE and GPE on DATE .
