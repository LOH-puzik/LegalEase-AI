As she received no reply to her request to purchase of the flat , on DATE the applicant , relying on section CARDINAL of ORG , brought a civil action in ORG ( PERSON ) against ORG seeking judgment in lieu of a contract of sale .", "CARDINAL .

The court found that the applicant had been absent from the flat DATE and DATE , that is , for a period exceeding six months , and that her absence had not been justified . In so deciding the court followed the case - law of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , according to which , in cases where a third person moves into the flat , the bringing of legal proceedings in order to evict the occupant would demonstrate an intention to live in the flat and prevent the tenant \u2019s absence from being considered unjustified and resulting in a termination of the tenancy . However , the applicant had never instituted any proceedings to regain possession of her flat .
