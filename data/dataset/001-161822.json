The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At some point before DATE , the applicant \u2019s parents were deprived of their parental responsibility and the applicant was placed in a local orphanage until his grandfather was assigned as his guardian in DATE and the applicant was placed with him . On DATE the grandfather \u2019s guardianship was revoked but he was reinstated as guardian at DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the applicant allegedly committed offences prohibited by LAW of GPE , including disorderly acts , aggravated robbery and extortion , alone or in a group of minors . Since he was under the age of criminal responsibility , no criminal proceedings were instituted against him but he was the subject of CARDINAL pre - investigation inquiries and placed under the supervision of ORG within ORG of LOC ( hereafter \u201c the LOC \u201d ) . Moreover , following the fourth inquiry , he was placed in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders on DATE for DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s medical records , he suffered from an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( a mental and neurobehavioural disorder characterised by either substantial attention difficulties , or hyperactivity and impulsiveness , or a combination of the CARDINAL ; hereafter \u201c ADHD \u201d ) and a neurogenic bladder causing enuresis ( a disorder involving urinary incontinence ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE he was examined by a neurologist and a psychiatrist . He was prescribed medication , regular supervision by a neurologist and a psychiatrist and regular psychological counselling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who at that time was DATE , was at the home of his DATE neighbour PERSON when his mother , PERSON , called the police , who came and took the applicant to the police station of LOC . He was not informed of the reasons for his arrest .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he was put in a cell that had no windows and the lights in the cell were turned off . After he had spent TIME in the dark , he was questioned by a police officer . The police officer told him that PERSON had accused him of extortion . He urged the applicant to confess , saying that if he did so he would be immediately released , whereas if he refused he would be placed in custody . The applicant signed a confession statement . The police officer then immediately telephoned the applicant \u2019s grandfather to tell him that the applicant was at the police station and could be taken home . When his grandfather arrived at the police station , the applicant retracted his confession and protested his innocence .", "CARDINAL . The Government disputed the applicant \u2019s account of the events at the police station . They submitted that the applicant had been asked to give an \u201c explanation \u201d rather than being formally questioned , that he had been interviewed by a police officer who had pedagogical training , and that he had been apprised of his right to remain silent . He had not been subjected to any pressure or intimidation . His grandfather had been present during the interview .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s grandfather signed a written statement describing the applicant \u2019s character and way of life . He stated that DATE he had seen the applicant in possession of some money . When asked where the money had come from , the applicant had said that he had got it from his father .", "CARDINAL . S. and his mother were also heard by the police about the incident and they claimed that on CARDINAL occasions , on DATE and DATE , the applicant had extorted MONEY ( RUB ) from S. , threatening him with violence if he did not hand over the money .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant . Relying on the applicant \u2019s confession and the statements of PERSON mother , it found it to be established that on DATE and DATE the applicant had extorted money from S. His actions therefore contained elements of the criminal offence of extortion , punishable under LAW . However , given that the applicant was below the statutory age of criminal responsibility he could not be prosecuted for his actions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s grandfather complained to ORG of LOC that the applicant , a minor suffering from a psychological disorder , had been intimidated and then questioned in the absence of his guardian and that his confession had been obtained under duress . The grandfather requested that the confession statement be declared inadmissible as evidence and that the pre - investigation inquiry be closed on account of lack of evidence of an offence , rather than the applicant \u2019s age .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of LOC quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE , finding that the preinvestigation inquiry had been incomplete . It ordered a further pre - investigation inquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again refused to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant , for the same reasons as before .", "CARDINAL . During DATE the applicant \u2019s grandfather lodged several complaints with ORG offices of various levels , asking for a fresh examination of the case against the applicant . He complained that the applicant \u2019s confession had been obtained as a result of intimidation by the police ; in particular , he had been placed in a dark cell for TIME and he had then been questioned by a police officer in the absence of a guardian , psychologist or teacher . The police officer had coerced the applicant into signing the confession statement without the benefit of legal advice . He had then issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings on the ground that the applicant had not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility , while stating at the same time that the applicant \u2019s involvement in extortion had been established .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letters of CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE ORG of LOC and ORG of LOC replied that no criminal proceedings had been instituted against the applicant on grounds of his age . He therefore did not have the status of a suspect or a defendant . On DATE he had been asked to give an \u201c explanation \u201d rather than questioned by the police . In those circumstances the participation of a lawyer , psychologist or teacher had not been mandatory . There was no evidence that the applicant had been held in a dark cell before the interview and he had had to wait TIME for an officer from ORG to arrive and interview him . That the applicant had committed extortion had been established on the basis of the statements of PERSON mother and the applicant \u2019s admission of guilt during the interview of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Head of ORG asked ORG to order the applicant \u2019s placement in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing at which the applicant and his grandfather attended and submitted medical certificates confirming that the applicant suffered from a psychological disorder and enuresis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court delivered its judgment in which it ordered the applicant \u2019s placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for DATE . It held as follows :", "\u201c The Head of the Sovetskiy District Police Department of GPE has applied to the court with a request to place [ the applicant ] , who has been registered with the [ Juveniles ] Inspectorate as a delinquent minor since DATE , in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for DATE .", "On DATE [ the applicant ] committed an offence proscribed by LAW of GPE . A criminal case was not opened because he had not reached the age of criminal responsibility .", "On DATE [ the applicant ] again committed an offence proscribed by LAW of GPE . A criminal case was not opened because he had not reached the age of criminal responsibility .", "On DATE [ the applicant ] again committed a criminal offence under LAW of LAW of GPE . A criminal case was not opened because he had not reached the age of criminal responsibility . [ The applicant ] was placed in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for DATE .", "The minor lives in unfavourable family conditions in which his grandfather is responsible for his upbringing in so far as possible ; [ the applicant \u2019s ] parents are alcoholics and have a negative influence on their son . Before [ the grandfather ] was given guardianship status , [ the applicant ] had lived in an orphanage and studied in school no . CARDINAL . At the material time he studied in school no . CARDINAL , often played truant from school , and stopped attending school entirely from DATE . Given that the requisite control over him is absent , the minor spends the major part of DATE on the streets , committing socially dangerous offences .", "On DATE [ the applicant ] committed another offence proscribed by LAW of GPE ; a criminal case was not opened because he had not reached the age of criminal responsibility .", "Taking the above - mentioned circumstances into account , [ the Head of ORG ] considers it necessary to place [ the applicant ] in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for DATE to prevent his further unlawful actions .", "The representative of ORG supported the request made by the Head of ORG and explained that [ the applicant \u2019s ] guardian had requested in writing that his guardianship rights be lifted and the [ Inspectorate ] had accepted that request .", "[ The applicant ] refused to provide any explanations .", "The [ applicant \u2019s ] representative [ the grandfather ] objected to [ the applicant \u2019s ] placement in the temporary detention centre , having noted that [ the applicant ] had not committed a criminal offence on DATE as he had been with [ the grandfather ] at a doctor \u2019s surgery for an examination at that time .", "The lawyer , Ms [ NORP ] , asked the court to dismiss the request of the Head of ORG .", "The prosecutor asked the court to accept the request and to place [ the applicant ] in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders , taking into account that the documents presented by [ the applicant \u2019s ] guardian did not confirm that [ the applicant ] had been at a doctor \u2019s surgery on DATE at TIME or that he had been unable to commit the criminal offence , particularly taking into account the [ applicant \u2019s ] personality and the fact that he had already committed a number of offences .", "Having heard the parties to the proceedings and having examined the materials submitted by them , the court considers that the request must be allowed for the following reasons : [ the applicant ] is registered in the database of [ ORG of the police ] ; he was previously placed in the [ temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders ] for behaviour correction but did not draw the proper conclusions and committed further delinquent acts ; the preventive measures put in place by the [ Juveniles ] Inspectorate and by the guardian have not produced results , which shows that [ the applicant ] has not learnt his lesson . [ The applicant ] must be placed in the [ temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders ] for DATE for behaviour correction .", "The case - file materials examined by the court confirm that [ the applicant ] committed a socially dangerous offence : a complaint by Ms [ S. ] shows that on DATE , at TIME , [ the applicant ] extorted MONEY from her son [ S. ] in a yard ; he accompanied those actions with threats of violence . On DATE [ the applicant ] again came to their house and again extorted MONEY from her son , having again threatened the son with violence .

On DATE [ the applicant ] again came to their house and requested MONEY from [ S. ] , having again threatened him with violence . [ S. ] complained to his mother , who called the police .", "The court takes into account that those circumstances are corroborated by the statement made by [ the applicant ] , who did not deny that he had received money from [ S. ] on DATE as the latter had been afraid of the applicant . [ The applicant ] also did not deny that he had come to [ S. \u2019s ] house on DATE . A criminal case in respect of the events on DATE and DATE was not opened as the applicant had not reached the age of criminal responsibility .", "Having taken these circumstances into account , the court finds unsubstantiated and far - fetched the explanations by the applicant \u2019s guardian that [ the applicant ] did not commit the offences on DATE and DATE .", "Having regard to the above - mentioned facts and ruling under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the court grants the request of the Head of ORG and decides to place the applicant in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed in the GPE temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders , where he remained until DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he had shared his bedroom in the centre with CARDINAL other inmates . The lights were kept on TIME .", "CARDINAL . During DATE inmates were forbidden to lie on their beds or to enter the bedroom . They had to spend DATE in a large empty room which had no furniture or sports equipment . On a few occasions they were given a chess set and other board games . They were allowed to go out into the yard only twice during the applicant \u2019s DATE stay in the centre .", "CARDINAL . Inmates had classes twice a week for TIME . They had mathematics and NORP grammar classes only . They were not taught any other courses from the officially approved secondary school curriculum . CARDINAL children of different ages and school levels were taught together in CARDINAL class .", "CARDINAL . The supervisors applied collective punishment to the inmates . If CARDINAL of them committed a breach of the centre \u2019s strict regime , all inmates were forced to stand in line against the wall without moving , talking or being allowed to sit down . Given that many inmates were psychologically unstable and unruly , because of their socially disadvantaged background , such punishment was applied DATE and often lasted for TIME .", "CARDINAL . Inmates were not allowed to leave the room where they were assembled . They had to ask for the supervisor \u2019s permission to go to the toilet and were accompanied there in groups of CARDINAL . They therefore had to wait until such a group was formed before being able to go to the toilet . Given that the applicant suffered from enuresis , the fact that he could not go to the toilet as often as he needed caused him bladder pain and psychological suffering . If his requests for permission to go to the toilet became too frequent , the supervisors punished him by making him do particularly arduous cleaning work .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant \u2019s grandfather had informed the staff of the centre about the applicant \u2019s enuresis and his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , the applicant did not receive any treatment .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , each bedroom in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders measured QUANTITY and was equipped with CARDINAL beds . Access to the bathrooms and toilets situated on each floor was not limited .", "CARDINAL . The centre had a dining room where meals were served CARDINAL times a day . There was also a games room and a sports room . Audio and video equipment , educational games and fictional works were available .", "CARDINAL . The supervisors carried out \u201c preventive work \u201d with each inmate of the centre and could apply incentive measures or punitive measures in the form of oral reprimands . Corporal punishment was not used ; nor were juvenile inmates ever required to do hard or dirty work .", "CARDINAL . The centre \u2019s medical unit had all the necessary equipment and medicine . It could be seen from the staff list of the centre submitted by the Government that the medical unit was staffed by a paediatrician , CARDINAL nurses and a psychologist . According to the Government , each child was examined by the paediatrician on his admission and DATE thereafter . Treatment was prescribed when necessary . It could be seen from the temporary detention centre \u2019s \u201c accounting and statistical record \u201d concerning the applicant that he had not informed the doctor about his enuresis .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s personal file , containing , in particular , the information about his medical condition on admission , the preventive work carried out and the punishment applied to him , had been destroyed on DATE after the expiry of the statutory time - limit on storage , in accordance with Order no . CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , the Government stated that the applicant \u2019s \u201c accounting and statistical record \u201d , referred to above , had been retained since its storage period was unlimited in accordance with Order no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG , the applicant \u2019s other medical records and logbooks at the temporary detention centre had been destroyed as soon as they had become unnecessary , without any records being compiled in this respect . This had been possible because there had been no regulations on storing such documents until Order no . CARDINAL of ORG had entered into force on DATE ( which provided that medical records were to be stored for DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . However , the ORG submitted a written statement by a supervisor at the detention centre dated DATE . She confirmed the ORG \u2019s description of the conditions of detention in the centre . She also stated that CARDINAL of the supervisors was always present in the room where the inmates were gathered , which ensured continuity of the educational process . Teachers from the neighbouring school regularly came to the centre so that the inmates could follow the secondary - school curriculum . After their release from the centre , they received an education progress record . She stated that she did not remember the applicant but asserted that she had not received any requests or complaints from him or from any other inmate .", "CARDINAL . The Government also submitted a copy of an agreement of CARDINAL September CARDINAL between the detention centre and secondary school no . CARDINAL according to which the school undertook to organise secondary - school courses in the centre in accordance with a curriculum developed by the centre . A copy of an undated DATE curriculum was produced by the Government . It included CARDINAL classes per day on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from the detention centre . On DATE he was taken to hospital , where he received treatment for neurosis and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . He remained at the hospital until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was placed in an orphanage and , according to an extract from the applicant \u2019s medical record drawn up at the orphanage , he was on the run between DATE and DATE and again DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was transferred to a children \u2019s psychiatric hospital , where he remained until DATE . At some point after this , he was returned to his grandfather who had been reinstated as his guardian .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s grandfather complained to ORG that the applicant , who suffered from a mental disorder , had not received any medical treatment in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders , which had caused a deterioration in his condition ; nor had he been provided with any educational courses . He reiterated his complaints to the prosecution authorities in a letter dated DATE . While ORG of GPE sent a reply to the applicant \u2019s grandfather on DATE and ORG of LOC sent a reply on DATE , both of these dealt exclusively with the procedural issues related to the applicant \u2019s case ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and did not contain any answer to the grandfather \u2019s complaints in so far as they related to the applicant \u2019s health and the conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant \u2019s grandfather appealed against the detention order of CARDINAL DATE . He submitted , firstly , that the detention was unlawful because LAW did not permit detention for \u201c behaviour correction \u201d . Secondly , he complained that he had not been informed of the decision of CARDINAL DATE refusing to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant and had therefore been deprived of an opportunity to appeal against it . He further submitted that the court \u2019s finding that the applicant had committed an offence had been based on the statements of S. and his mother and the applicant \u2019s confession statement . However , the applicant had made his confession statement in the absence of his guardian . Nor had a teacher been present . No teacher had been present during the questioning of S. either . Their statements were therefore inadmissible as evidence . Moreover , S. and his mother had not attended the court hearing and had not been heard by the court . Nor had the court verified the applicant \u2019s alibi . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s grandfather complained that the court had not taken into account the applicant \u2019s frail health and had not verified whether his medical condition was compatible with detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the detention order of CARDINAL DATE on appeal . It found that behaviour correction was not among the grounds listed in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW for placing a minor in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders . Detention for behaviour correction therefore had no basis in domestic law . Moreover , ORG had not stated reasons why it considered it necessary to detain the applicant . The mere fact that the applicant had committed an offence for which he was not liable to prosecution because of his age could not justify his detention . Such detention would be permissible only if one of the additional conditions listed in section CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was met . ORG remitted the case to ORG for fresh examination .", "DATE . On DATE the ORG discontinued the proceedings because the Head of ORG had withdrawn his request for the placement of the applicant in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders . The applicant and his grandfather were not informed of the date of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s grandfather lodged an application for supervisory review of the decision of DATE . He complained that as a result of the discontinuation of the proceedings the applicant had been deprived of an opportunity to prove his innocence in respect of the offence for which he had already unlawfully served a term of detention in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG quashed the decision of DATE . He found , firstly , that , in accordance with section CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , a judge examining a request for the placement of a minor in a temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders had the power either to grant or to reject the request . He had no power to discontinue the proceedings . Secondly , the applicant and his guardian had not been informed of the date of the hearing and had therefore been deprived of an opportunity to make submissions on the issue of the discontinuation of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Prosecutor of the Novosibirsk Region lodged an application for supervisory review of ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of ORG quashed the decision of DATE , finding that it had been adopted by an unlawful composition of judges . It remitted the case for a fresh examination on appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG held a fresh appeal hearing and upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE ordering the applicant \u2019s placement in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders . He found that the applicant had committed a delinquent act punishable under LAW but that no criminal proceedings had been instituted against him because he had not reached the statutory age of criminal responsibility . He belonged to a \u201c problem family \u201d ; his parents had been deprived of parental responsibility and he was cared for by his grandfather . He played truant from school and spent most of the time on the streets or in a computer club . In those circumstances , it had been necessary , in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW , to place him in the temporary detention centre for juvenile offenders for DATE to prevent him from committing further delinquent acts . The fact that ORG had referred to \u201c behaviour correction \u201d as a ground for detention had not made the detention order of CARDINAL DATE unlawful . The applicant \u2019s detention had been justified by other grounds . Nor could the detention order of CARDINAL DATE be quashed on account of the applicant \u2019s frail health , given that it had already been enforced in DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-d", "6-3-c", "6-3-d"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
