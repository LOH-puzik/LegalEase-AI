The applicants were born in GPE . They were married on DATE . In the applicants\u2019 submission they were repeatedly persecuted in their country on account of their NORP origin and their affiliation to ORG . On DATE the applicant \u2019s father was beaten up in the street and required treatment in hospital . The family filed a complaint and on DATE the applicants received , at their house , a visit from unknown individuals of NORP origin who asked them to withdraw their complaint and threatened them with reprisals . On DATE an incendiary device was thrown into their home through the window , starting a fire , and they were rescued by a neighbour . Following that incident , the applicant \u2019s father left GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the second applicant was returning home , NORP police officers stopped her in the street and questioned her about her father . They took her away and she was beaten up . They tried to shut her in a vehicle and threatened to rape and kill her . She managed to escape . DATE , she went to the casualty department in the town of Taraz to have her injuries recorded and treated . On DATE her mother came home having also been beaten up by NORP policemen who were looking for her husband . After that incident they moved to the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was again assaulted . She had gone shopping and did not return until DATE , covered in bruises and blood . DATE she lost the child she was carrying . She then decided to leave the country and entered GPE on DATE on a DATE visa . After her departure , the applicant , who had filed a complaint , was assaulted by policemen on DATE . He spent DATE in hiding but the authorities found him , confiscated his papers , and threatened to kill him if he did not withdraw his complaint . He too decided to leave the country and joined his wife in GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants each filed an asylum application with ORG ( OFPRA ) and obtained residence permits . Their asylum applications were rejected on DATE on the ground that their statements were \u201c riddled with inconsistencies \u201d , followed \u201c a stereotyped pattern \u201d and were \u201c unconvincing \u201d . On DATE ORG dismissed their appeals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having learnt of the murder of the second applicant \u2019s father , after his return to GPE , the applicants requested a fresh examination of their case by the OFPRA . On DATE the OFPRA refused to re - examine the case . On DATE ORG rejected their appeal on the ground that the new fact could not be regarded as established .", "CARDINAL . They subsequently applied for recognition as stateless persons , but the ORG rejected their request on DATE , on the ground , first , that they had not provided evidence that the NORP authorities had withdrawn their nationality and they could not lose that nationality purely of their own volition , and , secondly , that they held passports issued by their national authorities that were valid until DATE . On DATE the applicants appealed against that rejection before ORG . They subsequently dropped their appeal , however , having obtained refugee status in the meantime ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP prefecture notified the applicants of its refusal to issue them with residence permits and directed them to leave the country within DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG upheld that judgment , finding that he had not adduced any conclusive evidence in support of his allegations that he had been persecuted in his country of origin .", "CARDINAL . The removal order against the first applicant was not enforced , however , and he was released from the detention centre , as no laissez - passer had been issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE it was decided to place the applicants in administrative detention but the prefect of the Ardennes ordered them to reside at a specific address , pursuant to Article PERSON of the Entry and Residence of Aliens and Right of Asylum Code ( CESEDA ) . CARDINAL attempts to remove the applicants failed as a result of the mobilisation of a support group . The family was thus released .", "CARDINAL .

After a long wait , the GPE - et - LOC prefecture ordered their administrative detention in a hotel in Angers . On CARDINAL DATE the applicants and their children were transferred to PERSON airport pending their removal to GPE . However , the flight scheduled for TIME was cancelled , without the prefecture having been informed , and the removal could not therefore be carried out . It was only in TIME that the applicants and their children were transferred , in a police van , to the administrative detention centre of ORG .", "CARDINAL . That centre , even though it is mentioned on the list of centres that cater for families , does not have any real leisure or learning area . Whilst CARDINAL wing is reserved for families and single women , the atmosphere there is distressing and stressful , with a lack of privacy and a high level of tension . Announcements via loud - speakers reverberate throughout the centre and exacerbate the feeling of stress . The GPE centre , at the time of the applicants\u2019 detention , was not equipped with the basic facilities for the detention of young children ( it had metal beds with pointed corners , no cots , just a few toys in the corner of a room , etc . ) . The only outdoor area is a courtyard , concreted over and with wire netting over the top , and the bedroom windows are covered with a tight grill obscuring the view to the outside ...", "The eldest child refused to eat in the centre and showed signs of anxiety and stress .

They were only able to receive CARDINAL short visit during their detention , as it was not easy to gain access to the centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the liberties and detention judge of the GPE tribunal de grande instance ordered the extension of the detention measure for DATE , after observing that the maintaining of a family in detention was not in breach of the decree of CARDINAL DATE on administrative detention and holding areas and that their transfer to ORG was not vitiated by any defect . The decision also mentioned the loss of the second applicant \u2019s NORP nationality but it was found that this could not justify release , as ORG alone had jurisdiction to decide if that situation would have any consequences . On DATE ORG upheld the extension decision .", "CARDINAL . Having been held in the detention centre since DATE , the applicants were again transferred to PERSON airport pending their removal on DATE , the flight being scheduled for the early afternoon . It did not go ahead , however . The applicants were not taken back to the GPE - GPE centre until TIME , without any measure of placement in a detention facility being decided at PERSON during that period . The prefect then applied to the LOC liberties and detention judge to have the LOC detention extended for DATE , relying solely on the argument that the non - enforcement of the removal order could be attributed to the applicants themselves ( CESEDA , Article PERSON ) . The applicants complained about the conditions of their detention and its length , arguing that the authorities had failed to prove that the length of the measure was strictly necessary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted to the ORG , under Rule CARDINAL of ORG , a request for the suspension of the removal measure . The ORG declined to indicate an interim measure in response to that request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the liberties and detention judge found that there was no evidence to show that the applicants had deliberately impeded their removal , because the documents concerning the circumstances of the attempt expressly stated that \u201c no refusal to board the plane was recorded on CARDINAL DATE \u201d , and he ordered their release , with the obligation to leave GPE being maintained . The prefect appealed against that decision but without seeking suspensive effect . The applicants were thus released from the detention centre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set aside the liberties and detention judge \u2019s decision and extended the administrative detention measure for DATE , finding that it could be seen from certain documents in the file that the applicants had indeed prevented their removal ( an e - mail from one of the border police officers mentioning the need for an escort to carry out the removal the next time , in view of PERSON reaction ) . It had been found that the next flight with an escort for the ORG removal would not be available before DATE , and the prefect had not therefore shown a lack of diligence in organising the departure and limiting the length of the detention . He had thus been justified in seeking an extension of the administrative detention pending the organisation of a fresh removal . That decision was not enforced .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before their arrest the applicants had filed a fresh request to be granted refugee status . In a decision of DATE the ORG rejected the request on account of the very general nature of the alleged facts , finding that this , together with the unlikely claim of blackmail on the part of the NORP authorities , precluded the establishment of their veracity . The OFPRA further stated that as the allegation that the applicants had lost their nationality had not been corroborated , the request for re - examination had to be rejected . The applicants appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicants refugee status , finding that the enquiries made by the LOC prefecture vis - \u00e0 - vis the NORP authorities , in breach of the confidentiality of asylum applications , had exposed the applicants to danger in the event of their return to GPE , and that their loss of NORP nationality , in DATE and DATE respectively , whilst not per se constituting persecution , did not , however , preclude the granting of refugee status .", "CARDINAL .

Following his visit from DATE , the Commissioner for Human Rights published , on DATE , a report on \u201c the effective respect for human rights in GPE \u201d ( CommDH(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) . He observed , concerning the detention of minors , that children should not be kept in an enclosed facility , offering little in the way of activities and few , if any , outings , and where conditions were precarious and their safety could not be guaranteed . He recommended that an alternative solution be proposed to families with children ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He noted in this connection that compulsory residence orders , which were provided for by law , were \u201c little used \u201d ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The Commissioner further observed that the placement of children in a detention centre was incompatible with ORG and NORP law , which precluded the use of removal orders against minors . He found , however , that a legal vacuum made it possible to place children in detention centres and remove them , on the grounds of concern not to separate them from their families . In his view , the NORP authorities appeared to completely underestimate the legal and humanitarian problems posed by the presence of children in such centres ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He added , lastly , that in any event , no children should be detained on the grounds that their parents did not have the necessary papers to remain in GPE , especially \u201c in places marked by overcrowding , dilapidation , promiscuity ( sic ) and very strong tensions \u201d ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In his report of DATE ( CommDHCARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) the Commissioner noted that \u201c [ n]otwithstanding the recommendation made in the DATE report , an increasing number of children [ were ] placed in administrative holding centres with their parents \u201d . He added that it was regrettable that such holding centres and waiting zones at the border were the only places in GPE where minors under the age of CARDINAL were deprived of their liberty . He found , lastly , that the NORP authorities continued to underestimate the problems posed by the presence of children in holding centres and invited the authorities to place families in administrative detention only in cases of extreme necessity , so as to avoid causing children irreparable trauma .", "CARDINAL . Following its visit to numerous administrative detention centres in GPE ( PERSON , Vincennes CARDINAL and CARDINAL , GPE , FAC , in DATE , the ORG raised with the Government the question of detaining families , and in particular any \u201c accompanying \u201d children , in such centres .

The report presents an exhaustive study of the conditions of reception of vulnerable persons in GPE member GPE . GPE appears to be the only State that never has recourse to detention for minors and GPE limits it to TIME . Countries such as GPE , GPE and GPE , however , have recourse to detention almost systematically for accompanied children .", "The report further shows that in spite of the existence of separate sections reserved for families with children and improved conditions ( game rooms , toys , etc . ) , the fact remains that the lack of privacy , stressful living conditions , food , DATE routine , negation of intimacy and the human and material environment are not adapted to children . The detention centre staff interviewed all felt that children should not be imprisoned in detention centres for the short or long term , because of the negative impact this traumatic experience could have on the children \u2019s psychological balance , on their relations with their parents and on the image the children had of their parents whilst in detention .", "CARDINAL . In the part concerning GPE , the report noted a deterioration in the atmosphere in these secure centres and in particular a rise in the number of desperate acts committed , including physical assaults . It was also suggested that the improvement in physical conditions for families had the perverse effect of making this type of detention seem banal when the very principle of detaining them in this position could be questioned . The report \u2019s authors added : \u201c The presence of children in these places where they are deprived of their freedom , even if these are \u2018 family ORG and they are kept here in order to keep families together , was particularly shocking for the study team \u201d .", "CARDINAL .
