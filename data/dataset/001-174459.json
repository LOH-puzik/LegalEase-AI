On this point , the Deputy Minister considered that it was unlikely that the applicant \u2019s spouse had not known about the applicant \u2019s work for the ORG / WAD whose brutal working methods were known to large parts of the NORP population . The Deputy Minister also found no objective obstacles to them exercising their right to family life in GPE , taking into account that the applicant \u2019s wife and children had not been admitted to the GPE as refugees fearing persecution on the basis of their individual circumstances but entered instead under a temporary categorical protection policy . Furthermore , like the applicant , the applicant \u2019s spouse came from GPE , spoke the local language and was familiar with NORP society .

In reaching this conclusion , the Deputy Minister took into account , inter alia , the applicant \u2019s voluntary choice to join the ORG , his career in this service and the nature of his work . The Deputy Minister considered that the systematic and large - scale commission of serious human - rights violations by the ORG had been common knowledge well before the applicant had joined this service and that therefore he could not have been ignorant of those acts as had been averred by him . The Deputy Minister further rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an objection to that decision . On DATE he was heard on his objection before an official board of enquiry . On DATE the Minister for ORG rejected the objection , having found nothing in the applicant \u2019s submissions warranting another conclusion than the one set out in the impugned decision . However , as it could not be ruled out that the applicant , given his work in GPE , would run a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW if he were expelled to GPE , the Deputy Minister further indicated that for the time being the applicant would not be removed to that ORG . However , this did not render him eligible for a nonasylumbased residence permit , including a residence permit on account of the duration of the proceedings on his asylum claim ( tijdsverloop in de asielprocedure ) as the application of LAW constituted a contraindication .", "CARDINAL .

In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG of The Hague , sitting in GPE , allowed the appeals and annulled the CARDINAL impugned decisions . Although it agreed with the Minister \u2019s decision and pertaining reasoning to apply LAW in the applicant \u2019s case , it also held \u2013 referring to CARDINAL rulings given on DATE by ORG ( ORG . CARDINAL and DATE ) and noting that the Minister had acknowledged the existence of an LAW risk for the applicant in GPE \u2013 that the Minister should also have examined whether the applicant had established that LAW constituted a sustained obstacle to his expulsion to GPE . It further found that the Minister had unjustly based the decision concerning the non - asylum - based residence permit on section QUANTITY of LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit DATE ) . Consequently , the Minister \u2019s examination had been incomplete . Accordingly it annulled the decisions of DATE and DATE and ordered the Minister to take fresh decisions within DATE .", "DATE .

Referring to the reasons given in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the Minister again rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum claim regarding Article CARDINAL As regards LAW , the Minister found that that it could not be concluded from the applicant \u2019s asylum statement \u2013 viewed against the background of the current political and social situation in GPE \u2013 that there existed a real and foreseeable risk that if returned to GPE the applicant would be subjected to treatment in breach of LAW . The Minister considered , inter alia , that the applicant had not encountered any tangible problems in GPE or FAC during the reign of the mujahideen . The Minister further considered that while the problems which had caused the applicant to flee GPE had only begun after the arrival of the ORG in GPE , the ORG were no longer in a position of power in GPE . The Minister further found that , on the basis of the decision to apply LAW to his case , the applicant was not eligible for a non - asylum - based residence permit on the basis of the so - called DATE policy ( driejarenbeleid ) set out in paragraphs CCARDINAL/CARDINAL.CARDINAL and QUANTITY of LAW DATE ) .

However , to the extent that the appeal was directed against the decision that the applicant was not eligible for a non - asylum - based residence permit , it found that the Minister had unjustly failed to hear the applicant on his objection . Accordingly , it annulled this part of the decision of CARDINAL DATE and ordered the Minister to take a fresh decision on the applicant \u2019s objection of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant had been heard on DATE before an official board of enquiry in respect of his objection of DATE , the Minister rejected this objection .

As regards the applicant \u2019s arguments under LAW , the Deputy Minister considered , taking into account the criteria formulated in the cases of GPE ( cited above ) and PERSON v. the GPE ( no . PERSON , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) , that Article CARDINAL did not prevent the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE either . On this point , the Deputy Minister found , inter alia , that the applicant had substantial links with GPE , where he had been born and raised and where he had lived for CARDINAL years , and that there was no appearance of an objective obstacle to carrying on the family life at issue in GPE or in another country .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE a son was born to the applicant and his spouse .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the applicant had been heard on DATE before an official board of inquiry , the Minister for ORG took a fresh decision on the applicant \u2019s objection of CARDINAL DATE and again rejected it . With reference to the findings in respect of this provision made in CARDINAL decisions and CARDINAL judgments given previously in the applicant \u2019s case , the Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments under LAW , holding that it had not been demonstrated that the applicant , if returned to GPE , would risk treatment in violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicant \u2019s arguments under LAW , the Minister reiterated that LAW had been applied in respect of the applicant and that he thus represented a danger to public order . It should therefore be determined whether the interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW was necessary and justified in a NORP society . For this purpose the general interest was to be weighed against the applicant \u2019s personal interest in staying in the GPE to enjoy his family life with his spouse and their children . The Minister concluded that the interference at issue , that is to say the imposition of the exclusion order , was justified under the terms of LAW in that it was provided for in domestic law provisions and was necessary for the protection of public order and the prevention of crime . As regards the competing interests , the Minister \u2013 taking into account the guiding principles as formulated in the ORG \u2019s judgments in the cases of LOC ( cited above ) and PERSON ( cited above ) \u2013 held that public interest considerations in excluding the applicant from the GPE outweighed the applicant \u2019s personal interests in being enabled to carry on his family life in the GPE . He noted that the applicant had been born and raised in GPE and had lived there for DATE . This supposed the existence of ties with GPE and thus the possibility to build up a life there again . Even if the applicant did not have a social network at present in GPE , it would be easy for him to build up such a network after his return there . The Minister further considered that , even assuming that there would be an objective obstacle to the applicant \u2019s spouse and their children enjoying their family life with the applicant in GPE , it did not appear that it there would be an objective obstacle to him carrying on this family life in a third country . It had appeared from the hearing held on DATE that the applicant had done nothing to explore that possibility . The applicant \u2019s spouse and children were free to visit the applicant abroad or to settle with him in another country . The Minister therefore concluded that Article CARDINAL did not prevent the applicant \u2019s expulsion from the GPE .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant against this fresh decision was allowed on DATE by ORG of The Hague . It annulled the decision and ordered the Minister to take a fresh decision .
