She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant applied for disability benefits in DATE . Additional information was requested from her and she was asked to fill out the appropriate form .", "Her formal application for a disability allowance ( handikappers\u00e4ttning ) under LAW , LAW DATE LAW ( lagen om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring ; hereinafter \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) was lodged on DATE . CARDINAL different medical opinions and also medical records from a hospital were enclosed . The applicant invoked back problems and problems relating to incontinence . She stated , inter alia , that she was unable to use public transportation .", "ORG ( f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringskassan ) of GPE requested the opinion of CARDINAL other medical doctors who were attached to the ORG in order to assist in medical matters ( f\u00f6rtroendel\u00e4kare ; \u201d insurance doctor \u201d ) . After having studied the documents in the case , the insurance doctors came to different conclusions . CARDINAL doctor , ORG , considered that the applicant was unable to use public transportation and the other doctor found that the available documents failed to substantiate this contention .", "On DATE the ORG rejected the application , finding that the applicant \u2019s needs or costs did not attain the level required under the above Act .", "Doctor PERSON \u2019s statement had not been included among the documents which formed the basis of the ORG \u2019s decision , nor had the applicant been informed of the statement . After the applicant had made a complaint in these respects , ORG ( PERSON ) levelled serious criticism against the ORG \u2019s handling of the case .", "The applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision to ORG ( l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE . Before this court as well as during the following court proceedings she was represented by legal counsel . She requested the court to hold an oral hearing and to obtain the opinion of a medical expert . She gave no explicit motive for her request for an oral hearing .", "On DATE the court informed the applicant as follows :", "( Translation )", "\u201c Having regard to the available material , the [ court ] finds no need to hold an oral hearing .", "In your submission of DATE you have also requested the court to obtain a certificate from a medical doctor with special neurological knowledge regarding the need to use a car for transport to and from work and the need for help with heavy domestic duties . Doctor [ I.O .- L. ] has in a certificate of CARDINAL DATE made an assessment of [ the applicant \u2019s ] need of a car for transports to and from work . [ The court ] therefore considers further material unnecessary as regards that issue . [ The court ] invites you to submit whether you maintain your request .", "[ The court ] hereby gives you the opportunity to make in writing , no later than CARDINAL DATE , your final submissions in the case .", "If you maintain your request for an oral hearing in the case , you are required to submit to [ the court ] , within the same time , a statement of evidence indicating the evidence you want to invoke and what you want to prove with each separate piece of evidence . [ ... ]", "If no response is submitted to [ the court ] , the case will be determined on the basis of the available material . \u201d", "No submission of evidence was made by the applicant . Instead she responded by informing the court that she regarded the court \u2019s notification as a decision of , inter alia , her request for an oral hearing .", "By judgment of DATE , ORG , taking into account the medical certificates and the other evidence in the case , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal with extensive reasons . The court , referring to most of the medical certificates available in the case , found no evidence from the documentation supporting that the applicant in her everyday life needed assistance from another person to such an extent as to qualify for benefits . Neither did the court find that the applicant needed continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed . Lastly the court found nothing to substantiate that the applicant due to a functional impairment was prevented from using public transportation to and from work , for which reason she was not entitled to benefits in order to cover any extra expenses .", "The applicant then appealed to ORG ( kammarr\u00e4tten ) in GPE , submitting yet another medical certificate . She again requested that the opinion of a medical expert be obtained . She did not request the appellate court to hold an oral hearing , and the court did not hold a hearing on its own motion . By decision of DATE the court rejected her request for a further medical opinion and instructed her to submit concluding arguments in writing .", "On DATE ORG , after having rejected the applicant \u2019s renewed request for a further medical opinion , upheld ORG judgment with substantial reasons . The court referred to the new medical certificate and found that the functional impairments described therein did not prevent the applicant from using public transportation .", "The applicant made a further appeal to ORG ( F\u00f6rs\u00e4krings\u00f6verdomstolen ) . She requested that an oral hearing be held and that the opinion of a medical expert be obtained . She also complained about the lack of oral hearings before the lower courts and their refusal to obtain a further medical opinion .", "By letters of DATE and DATE , ORG informed the applicant that it did not intend to request a further medical opinion or to hold an oral hearing . The applicant was given the opportunity to submit further observations on the question of leave to appeal .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal against the judgment of ORG .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "According to LAW , LAW , a person who is ill or handicapped may receive disability benefits provided that he or she is insured and registered with ORG and has reached the age of DATE . A further requirement is that the insured person before turning DATE has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she is in need of more time - consuming assistance from another person on a DATE basis , is in need of continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses . All NORP nationals and other residents in GPE are automatically insured in accordance with LAW .", "It is the total need of support and assistance that determines whether an insured person is entitled to disability benefits and , should that be the case , the amount of compensation . When making this assessment , it is necessary to look into the insured person \u2019s whole situation and to add together the need for different types of assistance and extra expenses . A medical report is required when it comes to the assessment of the functional impairment itself . As far as extra expenses are concerned , the extent to which other measures from the social services compensate also have to be taken into account , for instance assistance benefit ( when the handicapped person has his or her own personal assistant ) . When it comes to costs for transportation to and from work by car , it also has to be considered whether it is possible to use public transportation service for the disabled . Furthermore , at the time of relevance for the present case , protection aids against incontinence were provided free of charge .", "Disability benefits are not subject to taxation . They are granted on a DATE basis with CARDINAL , CARDINAL or DATE per cent of the yearly basic amount for national security purposes ( \u201c the basic amount \u201d ) , depending on the extent to which the insured person is in need of assistance and the amount of extra expenses caused by the handicap . The basic amount was MONEY ( SEK ) during DATE when the applicant applied for disability benefits . In DATE , when her application was rejected by ORG , the amount was SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "A decision by ORG in accordance with LAW may be appealed against to ORG and from there on to ORG and , at the relevant time , to ORG . The latter court was the highest social insurance court prior to DATE . ORG was abolished with effect from this date and its tasks were taken over by ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) .", "ORG could not examine a case on its merits without first granting leave to appeal . According to the provisions in force after DATE , the ORG could grant leave to appeal in CARDINAL different situations : if it was of importance for guidance in application of the law that the ORG examine the case ; and if there were extraordinary reasons for the ORG to examine the case , e.g. on account of the fact that a ground existed for the re - opening of the case or that the outcome of the case in the inferior court was clearly due to a gross oversight or a gross mistake .", "The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the DATE LAW ( f\u00f6rvaltningsprocesslagen ; hereinafter \u201d the DATE LAW ) . The same LAW also regulated the proceedings before ORG . According to LAW , the proceedings consist of a written procedure . However , the proceedings may include an oral hearing with regard to a certain issue , when there is reason to assume that such a measure would be to the advantage of the proceedings or that a rapid determination of the case is promoted . According to the third paragraph of LAW , an oral hearing shall take place before a ORG and an ORG on the request of an individual party to the case , if such a hearing is not unnecessary and there are no particular reasons against it . Thus , the opportunity for an individual party to the case to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances was not available in the proceedings before ORG .", "According to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to LAW PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) the oral element can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and an oral hearing can be of advantage to the examination of a case in CARDINAL respects , mainly . First of all , in order to hear a witness , an expert witness or a party , or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing . Secondly , in order to sort out the different positions in the case and to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute . In the latter case , the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character . When the LAW was drafted , it was also stressed that oral elements in the proceedings are not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but merely as a complement to it .", "The reference in LAW to the promotion of a rapid determination of the case was added in DATE . The purpose was to make it clearer that an oral hearing could , and should , be held in order to further a more rapid and effective examination of the case . The amendment aimed mainly at such cases concerning taxation that are connected with criminal proceedings before the general courts ( cf . Government Bill CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) .", "In connection with the enactment of the DATE Act it was stated , in respect of the third paragraph of LAW , that a party \u2019s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration . However , the party would not be allowed to have a decisive influence in the matter . The question whether or not an oral hearing is unnecessary should primarily be determined against the background of the available information in the case . Other circumstances can , however , also be of relevance , for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the fact that an oral hearing would enhance the party \u2019s understanding of a future decision in the case . A particular reason against the holding of an oral hearing can be that the case is of a trivial character or that the costs for an oral hearing would not be proportionate to the values involved in the matter at stake ( cf . Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
