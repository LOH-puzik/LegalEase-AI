The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE Tagil , GPE region . He is currently serving a prison sentence in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and a certain PERSON were arrested on suspicion of CARDINAL murders and were placed in detention . The applicant alleged that he was ill - treated while in detention . However , he did not lodge any complaints in that respect with the competent domestic authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the trial court \u201d ) heard the case in the presence of the applicant , his counsel PERSON . and his co - accused PERSON The applicant submitted that PERSON had tried to strangle the first victim with a cord , but had not managed to do so and asked him for help . So , he had tightened the cord . Afterwards he strangled the second victim . He further maintained that the third victim was killed by his co - accused . Co - accused PERSON submitted that the applicant had killed the third victim with a knife .", "CARDINAL . The trial court considered that PERSON \u2019s testimony regarding the third murder was coherent and consistent with other evidence submitted at trial and therefore deserved more credit . It found the applicant guilty of CARDINAL murders and theft and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . It found PERSON guilty of complicity in committing the first and the second murders as well as of theft and sentenced her to DATE imprisonment . The judgment stated that the applicant and his co - accused could appeal to ORG of GPE within DATE of the date on which they received a copy of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . In their appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE the applicant and his counsel complained , in particular , that the trial court \u2019s conclusions regarding the applicant \u2019s guilt in the first murder were not supported by the evidence submitted at trial . The first victim had been strangled by PERSON and when the applicant approached her , she was already dead . The applicant \u2019s conviction for the third murder had been based solely on PERSON \u2019s testimony which was supported by nothing else but the court \u2019s suppositions . The applicant and his counsel requested that the judgment be quashed and the case be remitted for a fresh trial . When lodging the appeal the applicant did not expressly state that he wished to take part in the appeal hearing . The applicant \u2019s co - accused did not appeal against her conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) examined the applicant \u2019s appeal in the presence of the prosecutor and dismissed it . Neither the applicant nor his counsel were present at that hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prosecutor General of GPE lodged an application for supervisory review of the appeal decision of DATE with the Presidium of ORG , on the ground that the applicant and his lawyer had not been properly notified of the appeal hearing of DATE and therefore , could not attend it . He requested that the above decision be quashed and the case be remitted for a fresh appeal examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case for a fresh examination of the appeal . It appears that neither the applicant nor his representative were present at that hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the head of the detention facility in which the applicant was held received a telegram which read as follows : \u201c Inform PERSON that his case will be heard by ORG of GPE at TIME on DATE \u201d . On the same date the applicant read that telegram . A similar notification was also sent to the applicant \u2019s legal counsel PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held an appeal hearing in the absence of the applicant and his counsel . It heard the prosecutor who requested that the applicant \u2019s conviction on CARDINAL counts of murder be upheld and that the sentence imposed for theft be lifted as the prescription period had expired .", "CARDINAL . Having studied the materials of the case , the appeal court found , in particular , that the trial court had rightly concluded on the basis of evidence submitted at trial that when the applicant had been tightening the cord , the first victim was still alive and that therefore , he had killed her . It further confirmed the trial court \u2019s conclusion that the applicant had also killed the third victim . ORG concluded that the trial court had correctly characterised the applicant \u2019s actions as murders and had imposed an appropriate sentence . It upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction for the murders , lifted his sentence in respect of theft and sentenced the applicant to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear from the decision of DATE that the appeal court verified whether the applicant had been duly informed of the hearing and whether he had expressed a wish to take part in it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who allegedly was not aware of the appeal hearing of DATE , but at some point learned that the appeal decision of CARDINAL DATE had been quashed on DATE , sent additional grounds of appeal to the appeal court . On the same date he also lodged a special request for leave to appear at the appeal hearing and requested the appeal court to provide him with legal counsel .", "CARDINAL .
