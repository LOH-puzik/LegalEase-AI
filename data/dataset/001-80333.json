In DATE , like many other persons , the applicant and his family were displaced from GPE to GPE . In GPE , the applicant worked as a reporter and photographer , chiefly for the independent newspaper PERSON , whose editor - in - chief at the time was Mr PERSON . The applicant stated that the latter was well known as a champion of the free press in GPE and that his case had been dealt with in ORG DATE report , which referred in particular to the fact that he had been arrested and arbitrarily detained in that country on CARDINAL occasion on account of his work as a journalist .

Some time after PERSON PERSON \u2019s departure \u2013 on an unspecified date \u2013 the police questioned the applicant about him . Police officers searched his home and found photographs which they considered to be compromising . The applicant was arrested and was subjected to ill - treatment , signs of which allegedly persist in the form of cigarette burns and injuries to his back caused by the position in which he was held for DATE , lying face down with his feet and hands tied above his back . He was subsequently imprisoned for DATE before falling ill and being transferred to hospital , from where he escaped by paying the guards , with the help of relatives of his maternal grandmother who worked there . He then hid in his grandmother \u2019s home in PERSON , where he was treated by a doctor . As soon as he had recovered he fled to GPE where one of his uncles lived . When an NORP was shot dead in GPE he decided to leave the country , as the NORP community there believed the killing had been carried out by NORP government agents in pursuit of opponents of the government .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he had travelled to GPE and , with the help of a smuggler and using a NORP passport ( in the name of \u201c PERSON \u201d or similar ) , which had been kept by the smuggler , had arrived in GPE - FAC in FAC TIME on DATE on a flight from GPE . He submitted that he had been held in the airport \u2019s international zone until DATE and had thus been unable to apply for leave to enter the country .

The police officer asked him to \u201c prove where [ he ] had come from , claiming that [ he ] was not NORP but NORP , and for the first time refused [ him ] permission to leave the international zone \u201d . According to the applicant , over DATE ( DATE and DATE ) , he went regularly to the police station \u2013 at each change of shift , or CARDINAL times \u2013 in the vain hope of finding a police officer who would deal with his application .

They said that they had checked the passenger lists for flights from GPE which landed at FAC on DATE and DATE and DATE and that there had been no mention of anyone by the name of ORG , PERSON or ORG .

On DATE the applicant applied for leave to enter GPE as an asylum - seeker .

The Government , for their part , contended that no recommendation had been issued on DATE . The record of the interview and the proposed recommendation , both drafted by the official concerned , had been considered unsatisfactory by the official \u2019s immediate superior , who was responsible for approving them .

While I was there I met a guy who was a journalist . When I PERSON finished my service I worked with this journalist friend as a cameraman and photographer , and we travelled together on reporting assignments . My friend was having problems with the authorities and wanted to leave the country . As soon as I got back the authorities questioned me about my friend and put me in prison . While I was in prison the police searched my house and found CARDINAL photos which they considered compromising . Then they started torturing me with cigarettes . I stayed in prison for DATE until I fell ill with tuberculosis . They took me to hospital . By chance , it was the hospital where some of my maternal grandmother \u2019s relatives worked . They bribed the guards , brought me clothes and helped me to escape . I went to my grandmother \u2019s place in Areza and stayed there for DATE while I was being treated . Then I left the country secretly for GPE . I found work straight away in a garage in GPE , but there were NORP agents around , and an NORP who worked not far away was killed . I was afraid and went to GPE , where I worked as a porter on the quays . I stayed in GPE for DATE in all ( DATE in GPE , DATE in GPE and DATE in GPE ) . My uncle sold his car to pay for my trip . I travelled to GPE before coming to GPE . My uncle found the network of people smugglers . I do n\u2019t know how they organised things .", "What is your friend called and how did you meet him ? His name is PERSON , he \u2019s a friend of the family , he knew my parents in GPE . When we moved back to GPE , I spent DATE doing my national service . After that I was in the reserves and worked in an army garage but did n\u2019t wear a uniform . That was when my friend arranged for me to go and work for him , by acting as a guarantor for me .", "Can you give some examples of events you covered ?

Firstly , my friend was in favour of a LAW and , secondly , CARDINAL ministers were imprisoned and my friend had published their biographies .

I think they \u2019re still trying to get that information .", "Is this your real name ? Yes , I do n\u2019t have any other name , I never have had .", "Have you anything to add ? No .", "Reasoned recommendation", "Mr PERSON , an NORP national , has stated that he worked as a photographer with a family friend who is a journalist . According to Mr PERSON , in DATE , while they were on a reporting assignment on the NORP border , the journalist took the opportunity to leave GPE . On his return to GPE , PERSON continued to work for DATE before being arrested by the NORP authorities .

He then stayed with his grandmother for DATE before leaving GPE for GPE , where he lived and worked for DATE .", "However , PERSON account contains a large number of inaccuracies and erroneous references which cast doubt on the truth of his statements . While the episode in which several journalists were arrested in GPE is very well known and received widespread media coverage , PERSON account bears no relation to what actually happened . The NORP journalists were arrested in DATE , not in DATE , and the applicant displays no knowledge of the reasons leading to the closing - down of the newspapers and the arrest of the journalists . The editor - in - chief of the newspaper PERSON also left GPE in DATE ( it therefore seems impossible that he could have covered the student strikes in DATE ) . The circumstances of his departure , accompanied by another reporter from the same newspaper , do not tally either with PERSON statements . It seems surprising to say the least that , apart from the editor - in - chief of PERSON , he is unable to name any other journalist or photographer arrested by the NORP government of DATE , or to name any other newspaper that was banned . Likewise , it is extremely surprising that PERSON is only able to cite \u2013 in a very sketchy and imprecise way \u2013 one event which he covered as a photographer . His lack of knowledge is such that it raises serious doubts as to whether he was actually engaged in this activity . Given the widespread media coverage of the events at the time , it seems strange that PERSON name does not appear anywhere , either as a member of staff of PERSON or as one of the persons arrested . All these factors taken together suggest that PERSON is attempting to falsify his past .", "ORG for ORG takes the view that the application for leave to enter GPE as an asylum - seeker made by Mr PERSON should be considered as manifestly unfounded , and therefore issues a", "RECOMMENDATION TO REFUSE LEAVE TO ENTER \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The circumstances of the editor \u2019s departure , together with another reporter from the same newspaper , do not tally either with X \u2019s statements . In addition , there is no proof of his professional activity : it is very surprising that he is unable to name any other newspaper that was banned or any other journalist or photographer arrested by the NORP government of DATE .

On DATE the applicant made an urgent application to ORG under Article L.

In that regard the applicant maintained , in particular , that the Ministry had not only exceeded the scope of its powers in examining the substance of his asylum application , but had also committed an error of assessment in finding the application manifestly unfounded . He stressed in particular that , as a cameraman and photographer working for a journalist , he had been subjected to persecution in his country of origin , where he had been imprisoned twice and subjected to ill - treatment , before seeking refuge in GPE , from where he had fled as his life had been in danger .", "The applicant submitted to the urgent - applications judge the following statement , drawn up DATE by the non - governmental organisation Reporters without ORG ( Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res ) :", "\u201c ...
