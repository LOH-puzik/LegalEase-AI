The applicant was born in DATE , he is a lawyer and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was appointed as an IDC judge on DATE and as its President on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the CARDINAL main trade unions and the CARDINAL corresponding ORG federations submitted a complaint to ORG , alleging misconduct on the part of the applicant in the exercise of his judicial functions . The letter referred , in general , to complaints received by members of trade unions and ORG federations who had carried out duties as lay members of the ORG , concerning the applicant \u2019s conduct towards litigants , witnesses , lawyers and lay members of the court during proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was served with a written notice from ORG dated DATE , informing him of the allegations against him and noting that ORG had decided that it was justified to activate Rule CARDINAL of LAW concerning the exercise of the ORG \u2019s disciplinary authority ( \u201c the Procedural Rules \u201d ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant was provided with a copy of the letter of complaint and was requested to send his comments within DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the applicant submitted his comments to ORG with regard to the allegations against him . The applicant observed , inter alia , that the complaint was so general and vague that he was unable to identify the precise events on which it was based as he had presided over numerous proceedings . He also informed ORG that the authors of the letter had given a copy to the press and that it had been published in a newspaper on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided , in accordance with LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to appoint an investigating judge to look into the allegations against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appointed the then President of ORG of GPE as investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE the investigating judge informed the applicant of his appointment . He also provided the applicant with statements he had taken from CARDINAL people during his investigation and invited the applicant to submit a supplementary statement , if he so wished , within DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made a lengthy supplementary statement to the investigating judge , providing his comments on the statements collected by the judge and referring to various proceedings in which the witnesses had been involved . He also noted that he did not view his comments as a supplementary statement as such , since it was only at that time that the complaint had become more precise , at least in part . Furthermore , he observed that the witness statements covered a period of DATE , when he had sat in CARDINAL cases . The statements could not therefore provide the full picture . He suggested that statements should be taken from a number of lay members of the court and provided the investigating judge with their names and telephone numbers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon completion of the investigation , the investigating judge submitted a report to ORG summarising his investigation and the evidence collected . The report was accompanied by all the material he had collected , including the statements given by the witnesses and the applicant . The report made no recommendation .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE the chief registrar of ORG informed the applicant that the court had decided that a disciplinary process was warranted . He provided the applicant with the charge sheet drawn up by ORG at a meeting it had held on DATE . This included CARDINAL charges of misconduct , and details of the preparatory investigation by the investigating judge . The charges against the applicant were as follows :", "\u201c First Charge", "Misconduct ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW )", "Particulars", "While you exercised the duties of President of ORG you repeatedly displayed oppressive , disparaging , scornful and , more generally , insulting behaviour towards the lay members of the ORG , both inside and outside the courtroom and , at the same time , in the course of proceedings you sometimes ignored them , sometimes did not allow them to put questions and sometimes did not allow them to ask for clarification on the matters at issue .", "Second Charge", "Misconduct ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW )", "Particulars", "While you exercised the duties of President of ORG you repeatedly displayed oppressive , disparaging , scornful and , more generally , insulting and even humiliating behaviour towards lawyers and/or litigants and/or witnesses during the proceedings , including ironic comments at their expense and/or innuendos , with the result that , owing to the agitation and disruption caused to them , the entire proceedings were diverted from their proper course . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A list of CARDINAL witnesses was attached to the charge sheet .", "CARDINAL . In his letter the chief registrar summoned the applicant to appear on DATE before the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to answer the charges . He informed the applicant that the proceedings would not be held in public unless he so wished and that , pending the proceedings , he would have to refrain from carrying out his duties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before the applicant answered the charges against him , his lawyer raised several preliminary objections . In particular , he argued that the investigation had been incomplete as statements had not been taken from the people indicated by the applicant . Furthermore , he argued that the charge sheet was incomplete , defective and vague ; it did not give sufficient information to the applicant about the offences in relation to the actual content of the CARDINAL charges he was facing .", "CARDINAL . The ORG ruled DATE that the charge sheet , taken together with the CARDINAL statements , provided sufficient information to the applicant about the facts on which the charges had been based . In that regard , it noted that the applicant had commented on all the details referred to in the statements in a lengthy statement . The ORG also held that the investigation had been adequate and had provided grounds for bringing charges .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant then pleaded not guilty to the charges .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was set for DATE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer agreed that the proceedings would not be held in public .", "CARDINAL . Hearings commenced on the scheduled date . The ORG set out the procedure to be followed : every witness would read out the statement he or she had given to the investigating officer and would then be cross - examined by the applicant \u2019s lawyer . Following a request by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , the ORG also held on DATE that in view of the defence \u2019s line of argument all the files of the proceedings in which the witnesses had sat as members of the ORG , from the applicant \u2019s appointment as president of the IDC onwards , should be brought before it . The hearing was scheduled to continue on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following a request by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , leave was given by the ORG on the latter date for the applicant to have full access to the ORG registry \u2019s archives in order to enable him to examine and collect any elements that could help his defence .", "CARDINAL . The hearings continued , with CARDINAL more sessions being held . Files of the proceedings over which the applicant had presided and in which the witnesses had been involved were admitted as exhibits . They were filed in separate bundles by reference to the particular witness and were recorded in the list of exhibits .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings it was clarified that the charge sheet was limited to the period subsequent to the applicant \u2019s appointment as President of the IDC . Further statements that related to pending proceedings and complaints that had previously been dealt with by ORG were removed from the charge sheet . CARDINAL out of the QUANTITY witnesses listed on the charge sheet ultimately testified . They comprised CARDINAL lay members , CARDINAL lawyers and CARDINAL people who had been witnesses in proceedings over which the applicant had presided . The witnesses read out and confirmed the contents of their statements . They were then cross - examined by the applicant \u2019s lawyer .", "CARDINAL . In addition , at the suggestion of the applicant \u2019s lawyer , the court also summoned the ORG \u2019s registrar .", "CARDINAL . After the conclusion of the witness statements and an address by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , the ORG found on DATE that a prima facie case had been established against the applicant . It therefore called the applicant to put forward his defence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant took until DATE to set out his defence case , testifying himself and calling CARDINAL witnesses . They consisted of QUANTITY lay members of the ORG , CARDINAL lawyers and a representative from the redundancy fund . The proceedings concluded with the applicant \u2019s lawyer addressing the court . He raised the issue of the charge sheet again and also submitted that because ORG and the ORG had the same composition , the same judges had examined the witness statements , had decided to refer the case to trial , formulated the charge sheet and overseen the proceedings . Those judges had also acted as prosecutors and had then tried the case . He argued that that was contrary to the rules of natural justice and the right to a fair trial . He stressed , however , that this had nothing to do with the judges as individuals .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the ORG found , by a majority of CARDINAL ( the President and CARDINAL justices concurring ) , that on the basis of the evidence and all the material facts before it , the applicant \u2019s alleged misconduct had been proved . The ORG assessed the evidence given by the CARDINAL witnesses and made specific reference to events transcribed in the records of court proceedings over which the applicant had presided and in which the witnesses had been involved . It referred to CARDINAL specific cases . After hearing the applicant , in accordance with Rule CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the ORG removed him from office .", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the decision read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Rule CARDINAL secures for the judge against whom proceedings are brought all the rights provided for in LAW for persons who are charged with a criminal offence . That constitutional provision secures the well - known rights that an accused has in a criminal trial and are identical to those secured under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW , which was ratified by ORG by law in DATE ( Law CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , the provisions of LAW , which are the equivalent to those of LAW , are also applicable .", "...", "At no stage did ORG function as a public prosecutor against PERSON . The President and Members of ORG did not put a single question to the witnesses who were listed on the charge sheet , or to those summoned on behalf of PERSON , which might have been construed as cross - examination for the purpose of contesting the ORG allegations . On the contrary , the President and Members of ORG asked very few questions , and they were solely for the purpose of clarification ; special reference will be made to some of those questions at the appropriate stage . Not a single question was put to PERSON . ORG was not seeking to pursue a procedure of prosecution against PERSON in the form of a confrontation between prosecution and defence . For that reason , and despite having such powers under LAW , the relevant provision of the LAW on the judicial process and the procedure to be followed in investigating disciplinary cases , it did not assign the duties of prosecutor to the judge - investigator or to any other judicial official . In that way , which was the declared intention of ORG , more rights were secured for PERSON than those which he had under the aforementioned ORG of the LAW and the Rule . That was precisely the aim of the procedure followed by ORG , which essentially remained an audience for the ORG statements .", "It follows that this is the appropriate moment to refer to the suggestion made by PERSON PERSON \u2019s lawyer in his final address . Its subject relates directly and absolutely to what we have just said . The lawyer alleged that ORG had functioned in a dual capacity , given that it had judged the case and simultaneously exercised the duties of prosecutor . Clarifying his position , he said that that is inferred from the fact that the President and Members of ORG put questions to the witnesses . In our opinion , that suggestion is unfounded and unjustifiable . It is unfounded for the reasons which we explained above , and unjustifiable because it conflicts with what the lawyer said to us at the beginning of the proceedings , when he ... spoke in praise of the powers invested by LAW in ORG , describing its work as difficult and important [ in those instances ] when it is called upon to decide whether a judge displayed misconduct and is obliged , again in accordance with the LAW , to terminate the latter \u2019s services in the event of conviction . In brief , PERSON not only accepted but also praised as correct the competence , arising from the LAW , of ORG , which is made up of the full bench of the Members of ORG , the highest judicial authority in the ORG .", "...", "[ The applicant \u2019s lawyer ] asked many witnesses to express an opinion on the extent to which they considered that PERSON decisions were correct . Most of them , including the lawyers , gave the right reply , namely , that it was not for them to judge PERSON decisions . In the same way , ORG is not judging the correctness of PERSON decisions . We do not have such competence . That belongs to ORG . The competence of ORG is only to decide whether the charges of improper behaviour ( misconduct ) are proved , which [ behaviour ] in the case we are examining and according to the particulars of the charges , is continuous ( \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03c5\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03ae , \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 ) and directly refers to the function of PERSON as the President of ORG .", "...", "We previously stated that certain witnesses called by PERSON , evidently in an endeavour to tone down or explain what the witnesses listed on the charge sheet had testified to and who touched on PERSON behaviour in the course of the hearing , in essence confirmed what those witnesses had said . Several examples follow ...", "...", "From the evidence that we have analysed above , we find that the charges have been proved .", "...", "We wish to clarify that the purpose of this procedure is not to punish Mr PERSON but to protect the public by adopting of a strict standard of judicial behaviour in order to preserve public confidence in the integrity , prestige and independence of the judicial system . We borrow and adopt the above principle from the decision ( Investigation concerning Judge PERSON , No . CARDINAL ) given in DATE by ORG , in GPE , which concerned a procedure against a specific judge whose services were also terminated for misconduct , with facts and particulars similar to the case before us . In essence , we translate the principle which that Commission adopted and recorded on page CARDINAL of the decision . The principle is based , as stated in the decision , on what was said by ORG , that the purpose of the procedure was not to punish judges who have erred but to protect the judicial system and those who are subject to the formidable power exercised by judges .", "...", "Evaluating the above with great care , caution and , we would say , anxiety , we are led to the conclusion that everything imputed to PERSON as stated in the CARDINAL charges has been proved . In accordance with the relevant provisions of the LAW , which are referred to in our decision , the proof of a charge of misconduct against a judge leads to the termination of his services . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The dissenting judge found in his decision that the evidence was not sufficient to prove such a serious charge as misconduct . As regards the procedure , the judge noted , inter alia , that ORG had asked the witnesses very few questions and that they had been for the purposes of clarification . Furthermore , with regard to the investigation and the object of the hearing , he observed :", "\u201c A judicial official with the duties of prosecutor was not appointed , a possibility which is referred to in Rule CARDINAL , and we adopted the following approach : every witness read his statement to the investigating officer out loud and , immediately after , was cross - examined by Mr PERSON \u2019s lawyer . During the cross - examination or subsequently members of ORG asked the witnesses a few questions for clarification purposes . This is also exactly what happened in the case of PERSON and the DATE witnesses called by him .", "...", "Before referring to the evidence , it is useful if we outline the methodology which led to the taking of statements by ORG . He did not himself take the initiative of collecting evidence in view of the accusation , as he explains in his report . The persons who signed the accusation did not have any personal knowledge of the circumstances and statements were taken from all those they ... named , and from others subsequently named by those who had been initially summoned . The investigation into the manner in which PERSON exercised his duties in general was therefore not systematic and that is also the reason for not taking statements from a number of other persons whom PERSON himself indicated . Besides , as we have seen , of the CARDINAL statements which ORG took , CARDINAL were attached to the charge sheet , with a further reduction to CARDINAL in the course of the hearing . They did not include statements which , as the Investigating Officer reported , not only expressed no complaints but stated that PERSON conduct had been irreproachable in all respects . Consequently , as is in any case self - evident , the object of the hearing is [ to determine ] whether , on the basis of the evidence of those CARDINAL witnesses , the charge has been substantiated as formulated . That is to say , whether , from each individual \u2019s evidence and the correlation between them , to the extent possible , there arises conduct as cumulatively stated on the charge sheet , [ and ] in the case of the second charge \u201c with the result that , owing to the agitation and disruption they were caused , the entire proceedings were diverted from their proper course \u201d . This ( was the wording ) , without any specification on the charge sheet of a definite , specific incident at a specific time , ... in relation to a specific person in the context of a specific case . The witnesses who remained on the charge sheet ( whose statements I shall of course return to ) , as lay members of the court , or as lawyers or witnesses , did not submit a complaint there and then about what they considered to be objectionable conduct . ... Nor did the litigants in any specific case which could be related to the charge sheet make a complaint at the time , or appeal or employ any other legal means so that any objectionable conduct would be examined also from the aspect of its effect on the final outcome . That was what occurred in the cases of PERSON v. PERSON . ORG Ltd and others ( DATE ) CARDINAL C.L.R. CARDINAL , and PERSON v. ORG and others ( DATE ) CARDINAL C.L.R.CARDINAL , in which ORG annulled decisions issued by ORG under the presidency of Mr PERSON , using strong language about the degree of his intervention in the proceedings and the appearance of partiality to which it could give rise . Of course , the charge sheet does not extend to those cases and does not concern the issue of interventions as such ... The core of the charge is the conduct attributed to Mr PERSON at the expense of lay members of the court , lawyers , litigants and witnesses , and it is in the light of such considerations that I shall go on to examine the evidence adduced . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant continued to receive all the benefits that came with his post during the proceedings . It appears from a letter sent to him by the ORG of GPE that the applicant was considered as having retired from the date of his dismissal , DATE . He was paid a retirement lump sum and started receiving his pension ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
