CARDINAL , the tenant applied to ORG for a stay of execution of the eviction . The court stayed the execution until DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the tenant spontaneously vacated the LOC and the applicants were able to recover the use of their flat .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the public authorities in GPE have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents . This has been achieved by rent freezes ( occasionally relaxed when the government decreed statutory increases ) , by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession . With respect to the extension of leases and the suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession , the relevant domestic law is set out in the ORG 's judgment in the case of ORG GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ECHR CARDINAL-V ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , which later became PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , suspended the enforcement of certain orders for possession until DATE .", "CARDINAL . By Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , the suspension was extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The history of legislative developments in the area of rent control may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first relevant measure was PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE , which provided for a system of \u201c fair rents \u201d ( equo canone ) on the basis of a number of criteria such as the surface area of the flat and the cost of its construction .", "CARDINAL . The second was adopted by the NORP authorities in DATE , with a view to the progressive liberalisation of the rental property market . Legislation relaxing rent level restrictions ( patti in deroga ) then came into force . Owners and tenants were in principle given the opportunity to derogate from the rent fixed by law and to agree on a different amount .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE reformed the tenancy regulations and liberalised rents .", "CARDINAL . The tenant is under a general obligation to compensate the landlord for any loss caused by the belated return of the accommodation . In this connection , Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides :", "\u201c Tenants who fail to vacate premises are under an obligation to pay the landlord the agreed amount until DATE of their departure , together with compensation for any other loss . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE provided , inter alia , that the compensation claimable by the landlord would be limited to the amount of the rent paid by the tenant at the time of the expiry of the lease , index - linked to the cost of living ( section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) and increased by PERCENT , in respect of the whole period in which the landlord had been unable to recover possession of his property .", "CARDINAL . On a number of occasions ORG has been called upon to consider whether the statutory system for the extension of leases and for the suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession was compatible with the LAW in terms of the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and the reasonable - time requirement . It has also been requested to rule on the issue of the limitation to the compensation that a landlord is entitled to claim .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the first question , ORG gave a number of judgments DATE ( in particular , judgments nos . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) in which it found that the legislative measures were compliant , being justified by their transitional and limited nature . In the last of the above - mentioned judgments , in particular , ORG asserted that , even though the legislature had a duty to make provision for individuals who were particularly destitute , the burden could no longer simply be transferred exclusively to the landlord , who might himself be in a situation of hardship . Moreover , the future continuation of the same legislative logic could no longer be perceived as legitimate .", "CARDINAL . As to the second question , in judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG confirmed that compensation could be limited during the periods determined by law for the suspension of evictions . It explained that the introduction of such limits was intended to govern tenancies concerned by the emergency legislation currently in force , and that the housing shortage made such suspension of enforcement necessary . Whilst evictions were suspended ex lege , the law also determined the quantum of the compensation that could be claimed from the tenant , both measures being temporary and exceptional . Besides , to compensate landlords to some extent , they had been exempted from having to prove that they had suffered a loss .", "CARDINAL . ORG declared the limitation to the compensation claimable by the landlord unconstitutional in cases where the inability of the landlord to recover possession stemmed from the conduct of the tenant rather than from any legislative intervention .", "CARDINAL . The court thus opened the way for landlords to bring civil proceedings in order to obtain full compensation for the loss caused by the tenant .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held that Article CARDINAL of LAW did not prevent the parties concerned from agreeing in advance on the amount of the compensation , so that the landlord would not be obliged to adduce evidence of the sum lost .", "CARDINAL . In its subsequent judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG explained that a delay in the return of the property could only , by itself , justify a general finding that the tenant should pay compensation for the loss sustained by the landlord , who would be required to provide specific evidence of that loss in relation to the condition and location of the property and its potential use . In that particular case , ORG upheld the decision of the court below , which had dismissed the landlord 's claim for compensation on the ground that he had not submitted evidence of the loss actually sustained by producing specific documents concerning precise offers to rent the property or agreements with prospective tenants on rent rates .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE of DATE , ORG considered that the loss sustained by a landlord could also be evaluated on an equitable basis .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE of CARDINAL DATE , ORG established that the limiting of the compensation to which a landlord was entitled only applied in respect of periods during which the suspension of evictions had been provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG confirmed that the landlord was obliged to provide evidence of precise offers to rent or purchase the property , in order to substantiate the loss claimed on the basis of a shortfall in rent or an inability to sell the flat . The same principle was subsequently confirmed by judgments FAC . CARDINAL of DATE and DATE of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held that the loss sustained by the landlord could be proved simply by a request for a higher rent , determined on the basis of the amount that he could have charged on the free market .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , in judgment no . DATE of DATE , ORG laid down the principle that the tenant is considered to have been given notice to quit as soon as the lease agreement expires , regardless of the eviction date set by the judge .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ORG ruled on the issue of police assistance .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was given in a case arising from a claim for compensation lodged by a number of landlords against ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In particular , they were claiming reimbursement for losses sustained as a result of a delay in recovering their property that was attributable , in their view , to the fact that they had not been provided with police assistance .", "CARDINAL . A bailiff had made CARDINAL attempts to gain access and CARDINAL of them were unsuccessful . According to the landlords , CARDINAL of those attempts were made during periods when evictions were subject to legislative suspension .", "CARDINAL . In the other CARDINAL cases , the claimants asserted that the authorities had not provided evidence of any force majeure that made it absolutely impossible for them to grant the necessary police assistance .", "CARDINAL . At first instance ORG found in favour of the claimants and awarded them the sum of MONEY ( MONEY ) in compensation . The Ministry appealed and the judgment was set aside by ORG on the ground that , in view of the public policy imperatives cited by the authorities , the claimants had not provided evidence to show that the refusal to grant police assistance was unjustified . The claimants appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that , in judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , sitting in plenary , it had laid down the principle that a landlord who has obtained an enforceable judgment in his favour is entitled to apply to the authorities for any acts required for the purpose of enforcement , including police assistance . It was thus an obligation rather than a discretionary power of the authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG further observed that , in judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , sitting in plenary , it had held that as a consequence of that principle any inability of the authorities to comply with their obligation should be subjected to a stringent test . In particular , the question whether the police authority had legitimately refused to provide assistance on DATE and at the time indicated by the bailiff was to be assessed by taking into account whether any alternative time , or even date , had been proposed , and if any reasons had been given , in each specific case , to justify the refusal .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Cassation moreover stated that the police authority enjoyed a margin of discretion as to the actual time when its assistance was to be allocated .", "CARDINAL . Except where the inability to comply is caused by force majeure , if the competent authority refuses to grant such resources in spite of a request from a bailiff , the landlord should be entitled to lodge a claim with the ordinary courts seeking compensation from the authorities for the loss sustained as a result of the refusal .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterated the principle set out in judgments nos . CARDINAL and DATE of CARDINAL DATE that reparation in the form of compensation was the minimum guarantee necessary to uphold an impaired right in cases where the resulting damage interfered with an interest protected by LAW . It held that the right to execution of the order contained in an enforceable judgment had to be regarded as such a right , because the possibility for a person to bring legal proceedings seeking the protection of his or her rights extended to the enforcement of final and binding judicial decisions .", "CARDINAL . ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and referred it back to the lower courts for reconsideration . It stated as a matter of principle that , when compensation claims were brought against public authorities by landlords complaining of damage because an eviction order had not been executed or its execution had been delayed , it was for the authorities to prove that they had been prevented from allocating police assistance . Such a defence would only release the authorities from responsibility , in particular , if it arose from extraordinary and unforeseeable imperatives . In this connection , ORG emphasised that any permanent crisis situations , such as those affecting the judicial system or public authorities , did not preclude responsibility for damage caused to individuals , but , on the contrary , might constitute the origin of such responsibility . In particular , the \u201c crisis \u201d in the NORP court system had not helped the ORG to avoid a number of unfavourable judgments by ORG for the excessive length of judicial proceedings , and currently did not preclude such findings by domestic courts pursuant to PERSON no .
