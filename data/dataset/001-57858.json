On a petition by the applicant \u2019s wife , the GPE tribunal de grande instance granted a divorce on DATE on the grounds of fault by her husband , awarded her custody of the children and allowed PERSON the right to have them visit him or stay with him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG varied that decision . It pronounced divorce on the grounds of fault by both spouses and upheld the other provisions after studying a social inquiry report on the children \u2019s living conditions with their mother .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal on points of law against ORG judgment but lodged a complaint against his former wife alleging that she had committed forgery and uttering during the divorce proceedings . On DATE ORG sentenced PERSON to a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) for having produced CARDINAL false certificates supposedly from her employers .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , when exercising his right of access to the children , the applicant had left NORP territory and taken his CARDINAL children to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Poitrimol applied to the matrimonial causes judge at the tribunal de grande instance in GPE , where the applicant \u2019s former wife now lived , for custody of the children . On DATE the judge awarded custody to both parents jointly and made an order that the father should return at least temporarily to GPE , within DATE at most , in order that the children should be interviewed . If , for reasons other than circumstances beyond his control , the applicant did not comply with the time - limit , the mother would continue to have sole custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON lodged a complaint alleging failure to return children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge committed the applicant for trial at ORG .", "CARDINAL . Mr Poitrimol did not return to GPE but sought leave to avail himself of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court gave leave and he was represented at the trial on DATE by CARDINAL counsel , who filed pleadings in which they asked for their client and his children to be examined on commission and , in the alternative , for him to be acquitted . They submitted that the defendant had acted under irresistible mental duress owing to the risk of harm to the physical health and psychological balance of his children , having regard to the behaviour of their mother and her lovers .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment delivered after proceedings deemed to be inter partes the court sentenced him on DATE imprisonment and issued a warrant for his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE counsel for PERSON lodged an appeal and the prosecution immediately did likewise .", "CARDINAL . Although he had been summoned to the hearing on DATE , the applicant did not appear in person . His lawyer , PERSON , said that his client wished to be tried in absentia and defended in court by his counsel ; he proceeded to make submissions similar to those he had filed at the trial . In an interlocutory judgment the ORG - en - ORG adjourned the case to CARDINAL DATE and , under the third paragraph of LAW , ordered that Mr Poitrimol should be summoned again as it considered his presence in court to be necessary .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not attend the new hearing , but Mr PERSON did and made supplementary submissions asking the court to uphold his pleadings of DATE and authorise him to represent his client .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG , taking its decision after proceedings deemed to be inter partes , delivered a judgment in which it refused the latter request on the following grounds :", "\" While a defendant summoned for an offence punishable , as in the instant case , by a term of imprisonment of DATE may , by letter to the presiding judge , apply to be tried inter partes in his absence but represented by counsel , pursuant to the first and second paragraphs of LAW , it is a principle , and is apparent from the general scheme of LAW , that this is a right which does not apply where , as in Mr Poitrimol \u2019s case , a warrant has been issued for the defendant \u2019s arrest and the defendant has absconded and is accordingly not entitled to instruct counsel to represent and defend him ... ;", "That being so , the ORG will try the case on the merits without the defendant , PERSON , being able to be represented by Mr PERSON . \"", "It also ruled that the pleadings of DATE were inadmissible and upheld the impugned judgment in its entirety .", "CARDINAL . Through a member of the ORG d\u2019Etat and ORG the applicant appealed on points of law against ORG judgment . In substance he argued that LAW previously cited was incompatible with the Convention .", "On DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible on the grounds that a convicted person who had not surrendered to a warrant issued for his arrest was not entitled to instruct counsel to represent him and lodge an appeal on points of law on his behalf against his conviction .", "CARDINAL . Mr Poitrimol submitted a petition for pardon , which was rejected by the NORP President on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The main provisions of LAW mentioned in the case are the following :", "\" An accused on whom a summons has been served personally in the proper manner must appear unless he provides an excuse that is accepted as valid by the court before which he has been summoned . An accused shall be under the same obligation where it is established that , even though the summons was not served on him personally , he was made aware by the means provided for in Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL that he had been properly summoned .", "If these conditions are satisfied , an accused who fails to appear and has not been excused from doing so shall be tried as if he were present . \"", "ORG has held this provision to be compatible with LAW , DATE ) but sometimes quashes judgments in which no ruling has been made on whether there was a valid excuse as argued by the defendant ( PERSON , DATE ) or no finding made as to whether the defendant had been made personally aware of the date of the hearing ( ORG , DATE ) .", "\" An accused summoned in connection with an offence punishable by a fine or a term of imprisonment of DATE may , by letter to the presiding judge which shall be placed in the file on the proceedings , apply to be tried in absentia .", "In that case his counsel shall be heard .", "However , if the court considers it necessary for the accused to appear in person , he shall be summoned again , at the instance of the prosecution , to a hearing on a date which shall be fixed by the court .", "An accused who fails to comply with this summons shall be tried as if he were present .", "He shall likewise be tried as if he were present in the eventuality provided for in the first paragraph of this Article . \"", "According to the case - law of ORG , where an accused who fails to appear and has not been excused from doing so is tried as if he were present , his counsel can neither be heard nor file pleadings ( ORG , DATE , ORG . ) no .
