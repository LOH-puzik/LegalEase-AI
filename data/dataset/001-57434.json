ORG The applicant lodged a public - law appeal against this decision with ORG . In her submission , GPE \u2019s interpretative declaration in respect of the Convention ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) did not mean that an administrative authority such as ORG was empowered to determine the merits of a criminal charge . Such a jurisdiction was conceivable only if judicial review was ultimately available . This was not so in the present case , however , as ORG of ORG and ORG had limited powers , which did not normally allow them to review questions of fact ( on which ORG findings were final ) , for example by examining witnesses . Furthermore , under LAW of ORG the municipality could delegate its powers to a senior police official , who was an agent of the executive ; that being so , ORG was acting as judge in its own cause .", "CARDINAL .

Contrary to that ORG statement in its ruling of CARDINAL DATE , the appellant did not claim , even by implication , that ORG was in this case an ( administrative ) body lacking impartiality . In any event , such a complaint was not formulated in terms sufficiently clear with regard to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) OJ [ LAW ] .", "( b ) The scope of LAW ( article DATE ) ORG must be examined in the light of GPE \u2019s interpretative declaration , according to which : \u2018 ORG considers that the guarantee of fair trial in LAW ( article DATE ) of the LAW , ... is intended solely to ensure ultimate control by the judiciary over the acts or decisions of the public authorities ... \u2019 . ( LAW ( a ) of LAW of DATE approving the ORG , ORG [ ORG ] DATE , DATE . ) In its communication of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , ORG noted that this interpretative declaration was formulated precisely with a view to \u2018 cases in which the decision taken by an administrative authority may be referred to a court not for a ruling on the merits but solely for review of its lawfulness ( pourvoi en nullit\u00e9)\u2019 , on the basis of the interpretation of LAW ( article DATE ) given by the President of ORG ( DATE I p. CARDINAL ) . ORG finds no grounds for departing from that interpretative declaration ( ORG [ Judgments of ORG ] CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL ) , even though its validity and its scope have been contested by academic writers ( PERSON , PERSON auslegende PERSON ORG , GPE thesis DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Moreover , ORG has also acknowledged that LAW ( article DATE ) is complied with in so far as a decision of an administrative authority may be subject to ultimate control by the judiciary , since the guarantee of a fair trial must be assessed having regard to the entire procedure ( ORG CARDINAL Ia CARDINAL ; cf . PERSON , \u2018 GPE devant les organes de la CEDH\u2019 , in ORG [ Revue de droit suisse ] CARDINAL/CARDINAL II p. CARDINAL , and the decisions cited therein ; ORG , GPE par la Convention europ\u00e9enne des Droits de l\u2019Homme , p. CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The GPE legislature used the right conferred on cantons by LAW CC [ LAW ] to allow certain minor offences to be tried by the municipal authority ( section CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ; sections CARDINAL et seq . MDA [ LAW ] ) . According to section CARDINAL MDA , judicial review of such municipal decisions is effected by ORG , which may determine both whether the correct procedure has been followed ( in the case of a recours en nullit\u00e9 - section CARDINAL MDA ) and whether the law has been properly applied ( in the case of a recours en r\u00e9forme - section CARDINAL MDA ) . It does not therefore have full competence to re - examine the facts . However , that is not necessary under LAW ( article DATE ) ORG provided that appeal lies to a judicial authority which not only reviews the correctness of the procedure - including \u2018 whether there are serious doubts as to the facts ORG ( section CARDINAL ( e ) ) - but may also be called upon to consider complaints of \u2018 incorrect application of the law\u2019 and of \u2018 misuse of discretion in the application of the law\u2019 ( section DATE ) . ORG therefore enjoys a much more extensive power of review than ORG in a public - law appeal , where jurisdiction is restricted to ensuring that a decision is not arbitrary ( cf .

Moreover , where ORG quashes a decision because there are serious doubts as to the facts found ( section CARDINAL(e ) ORG ) , it may request the municipal authority , to which it remits the case ( section CARDINAL MDA ) , to carry out additional investigative measures . That in itself is sufficient to show that the ultimate control by the judiciary of municipal decisions in GPE is in conformity with LAW ( article DATE ) ORG , as interpreted in accordance with the declaration made by GPE . The view advanced by PERSON , who appears to argue that ultimate judicial control should cover both the law and the facts ( PERSON Europa\u00efschen Konvention zum Schutze der PERSON ( Art . CARDINAL und CARDINAL ) ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) in ihrer GPE auf das schweizerische GPE , GPE thesis DATE , pp .
