On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as a whole , holding that the second - instance court had correctly assessed the amount of compensation for non - pecuniary damage and correctly awarded default interest from DATE the first - instance court judgment had been issued .

Instead , this factor should be taken into account when determining a just amount of compensation ( the principal ) . ORG stated that this approach had been adopted since DATE owing to the unstable economic situation in the country and the high rate of inflation and monetary depreciation in particular . In order to preserve the real value of a compensation claim for non - pecuniary damage , the amount due was therefore determined only on the date of delivery of the judgment .

In the Constitutional Court\u2019 \u2019s opinion , was generally adopted and was applicable to all disputes concerning non - pecuniary damage . Since ORG did not find any violation of human rights , it dismissed the complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decision was served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE this section was abrogated ( ORG of ORG . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

The Code of Obligations ( PERSON zakonik , ORG , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) reintroduced in CARDINAL a provision to the effect that default interest ceased to accrue once the amount of overdue interest reached the value of the principal ( prohibition ultra alterum tantum , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also repealed former section CARDINAL and provided instead in section CARDINAL that default interest was to be regulated as follows :", "\u201c If a debtor is in default as regards the performance of a pecuniary obligation , he shall owe default interest in addition to the principal .", "The rate of default interest shall be PERCENT per annum , unless a special law provides otherwise . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its transitional and final provisions the new Code stated that the provisions were not to apply to obligations that arose prior to its entry into force . It also provided that the special law referred to in section CARDINAL ) was the Statutory Default and Basic Interest Rate Act ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . Other provisions of the new Code of Obligations relevant to the present case follow the wording of the former LAW .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Zakon o obrestni meri zamudnih obresti , ORG , Nos . CARDINAL ) prescribed the interest rate as the retail price growth rate in DATE , recalculated on an DATE level , and increased by a PERCENT real DATE default interest rate . In DATE the real DATE default interest rate was reduced to PERCENT . The default interest was composed of the real index and the retail price index ( adjustment index ) , the latter having the function of increasing the amount of the principal according to the monetary depreciation in the country . Default interest thus had a function of preserving the real value of a pecuniary obligation and hence ensuring that the purchasing power of the claim remained unchanged .", "CARDINAL . The Statutory Default and LAW ( Zakon o predpisani obrestni meri zamudnih obresti in temeljni obrestni meri , ORG , No . CARDINAL ) determined the statutory default interest rate as being equal to the basic interest rate increased by CARDINAL times the general discount rate of ORG ( section CARDINAL ) , the basic interest rate being the DATE interest rate for domestic - currency pecuniary obligations ensuring the preservation of their real value ( adjustment ) ( section CARDINAL ) . Default interest thus formally assumed CARDINAL distinctive functions : a function of adjustment of pecuniary obligations in accordance with inflation in the country , a function of payment for the use of another person \u2019s capital , and a punitive function for a debtor in default as regards the performance of his obligation .", "CARDINAL . The Amendments and Supplements to the Statutory Default and LAW ( Zakon o spremembah in dopolnitvah zakona o predpisani obrestni meri zamudnih obresti in temeljni obrestni meri , ORG , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) determined the statutory default interest rate as the basic interest rate increased by CARDINAL percentage points ( section CARDINAL ) , the basic interest rate being the DATE interest rate for domestic - currency pecuniary obligations ensuring the preservation of their real value ( adjustment ) ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Zakon o pravdnem postopku , Official Gazette of GPE , No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provided in section CARDINAL that in civil proceedings , the court should decide only within the boundaries of the claims filed ( ne eat iudex ultra et extra petita partium ) . A case in which the court nevertheless decided extra petitum and made an award that was higher than or did not correspond to what was claimed would , pursuant to sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , amount to a major violation of procedural law and constitute a ground for a higher - instance court to quash the judgment in question .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG , ORG and ORG , sitting in PERSON ( present - day GPE and GPE ) , adopted a new interpretation of the provisions of LAW , which dealt with default interest on compensation for non - pecuniary damage , by issuing the following opinion :", "\u201c Default interest on a pecuniary claim for non - pecuniary damage shall be payable with effect from the date of delivery of the first - instance court judgment in which the compensation was determined .", "When determining the amount of just pecuniary compensation , the court shall also take into account the period from the date of the occurrence of the damage until the date of the judgment , if this is justified by the time that has elapsed since the damage occurred or by \u201d", "CARDINAL . With the incorporation of LAW , enacted under the former SFRY , into the legal system of the newly established GPE , ORG also adopted the interpretation of the relevant provisions of that LAW as developed by the former ORG , ORG and ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that , under the legislation in force since DATE , default interest also included interest for adjustment of a pecuniary obligation in accordance with the level of inflation . On certain occasions in the past , the default interest for pecuniary obligations therefore amounted to PERCENT of the main claim . However , in the case of claims for compensation for non - pecuniary damage , the preservation of the real value of a debt was ensured by determining its amount only on the date of delivery of the first - instance court judgment . By DATE , a claim in respect of a non - pecuniary obligation therefore remained unaffected by inflation . Thus , if default interest was awarded with effect from the date on which non - pecuniary damage had occurred , this would result in a double adjustment of the compensation claim from that date until the delivery of the judgment : once by determining its amount only on DATE of delivery of the judgment , and then also with the award of default interest from DATE the damage occurred . In ORG view , this was unacceptable .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG consistently held that a higher amount of compensation was not to be awarded solely on the basis of the fact that the case had been decided after a longer period of time . Thus , a claimant could only claim a higher amount of compensation under that head if the length of the court proceedings was excessive , for example on account of delays caused by one of the parties to the proceedings or perhaps even abuses of his or her procedural rights ( see , for example , the reasoning of ORG in II Ips CARDINAL/CARDINAL , II Ips CARDINAL , II Ips CARDINAL/CARDINAL and II Ips CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Finally , ORG emphasised on several occasions that despite the fact that in DATE inflation had no longer been so high and default interest had therefore no longer included such a high adjustment index , the jurisprudence could not be changed in an isolated case where a claimant had sought default interest from DATE he had sustained the damage . Such a change in jurisprudence could only be carried out in a general manner , so that it took effect with respect to a non - identifiable circle of claimants and for all claimants at the same time ( see in particular II Ips CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . After the new Code of Obligations had been enacted in DATE , replacing LAW , ORG adopted a new legal opinion on DATE concerning the issue of default interest , which read :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) From the date on which LAW came into force ( DATE ) , the victim is entitled to default interest on a pecuniary claim for non - pecuniary damage ( sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW and sections CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the former LAW ) , unless the default occurred at a later stage ( section CARDINAL of LAW and section CARDINAL of the former LAW ) , after the entry into force of the LAW and Supplements to the LAW , as a result of which default interest is awarded :", "\u2013 until the date of delivery of the first - instance court judgment at the prescribed interest rate , reduced by the basic interest rate ( currently PERCENT ) ;", "\u2013 from the date of the first - instance court judgment DATE at the prescribed default - interest rate ( section CARDINAL of the Amendments and Supplements to the LAW ) .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) Payments of compensation are subject to adjustment at the basic interest rate ( section CARDINAL of the Statutory Default and LAW ) or at the rate agreed between the parties ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its reasoning on its newly adopted legal opinion , ORG observed , inter alia , that the economic situation in the country had stabilised , and the new legislation , namely the new LAW and the LAW and Supplements to the LAW , now distinguished between default interest and the interest intended for adjustment of a pecuniary obligation . In ORG view , these developments allowed a change in the jurisprudence concerning the awards of default interest in the case of claims for non - pecuniary damage . Thus , default interest may now be payable with effect from the date on which the damage occurred , regardless of whether it was of a pecuniary or a non - pecuniary nature .", "CARDINAL . The above - mentioned ORG jurisprudence was upheld also by ORG ( see , for example , the decision of ORG in the present case , para . CARDINAL above ) . Therefore , the following provisions of LAW ( Zakon o Ustavnem sodi\u0161\u010du , ORG , Nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) concerning legal effects of ORG decisions are of particular relevance in the present case :", "( CARDINAL . ) ...", "( CARDINAL . ) ...", "( CARDINAL . ) \u201c The decisions of ORG are binding . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
