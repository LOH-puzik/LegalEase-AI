The plaintiff set the claim value of the dispute ( \u0432\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 ) at MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) , as a basis for calculation of the court fees . The case was heard in ORG ( \u201c the first - instance court \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Both parties were legally represented in the proceedings . According to an expert report of CARDINAL DATE , the value of the property at issue was set at MKD CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s claim , which it summarised as follows :", "\u201c to recognise that the plaintiff holds title to a CARDINAL share of the [ property ] , it being joint matrimonial property ... and if the [ applicant ] wants to be released from this obligation , to pay the plaintiff the sum of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) \u201d .", "CARDINAL . It established that the applicant , who had been living and working in GPE , had paid for the house that had been constructed on a land owned by his late father .

She complained that the first - instance court had been assisted by an unqualified interpreter and that it had wrongly established the facts regarding her contribution to the construction of the house , which was a matrimonial property . The public prosecutor also requested a protection - of - legality review ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430 ) arguing that the lower courts had wrongly established that the parties had lived together for DATE , instead of DATE ( their marriage had terminated de facto in DATE when the plaintiff had left the house ) . The prosecutor further argued that the house in question , the value of which was NORP Marks CARDINAL , had been constructed DATE . The lower courts had failed to consider the plaintiff \u2019s contribution to the construction of the house , as a property obtained in wedlock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld both the legality review request and the plaintiff \u2019s appeal on points of law and remitted the case to the first - instance court for fresh examination . It held that the lower courts had incorrectly established that the house in question had been constructed while the parties had no longer been married . In the court \u2019s view , it had been in DATE when the applicant had explicitly declared his intention to separate from the plaintiff . It was irrelevant that the parties had not lived together for DATE before ( while the applicant had been in GPE ) . Similarly , it was of no importance whether the plaintiff had contributed to the construction of the house . Had it been constructed during marriage , it had been a joint property . The introductory part of that judgment specified that the value of the dispute was MKD CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL .

She alleged substantial procedural flaws and errors on the law . The applicant did not submit observations in reply .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG accepted the plaintiff \u2019s appeal on points of law and set aside the lower courts\u2019 judgments in the disputed parts . It found that the lower courts had provided conflicting and insufficient reasons for their judgments . They had given contradictory arguments concerning the time when the house had been constructed and whether the latter could be regarded as a joint property obtained during marriage . Since the first - instance court had not complied with its instructions outlined in the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the court ordered that the case is considered by a different panel of judges of the first - instance court .

On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant and upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . Neither judgment contained any information about the value of the dispute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged , with ORG , an appeal on points of law arguing that the lower courts had not followed the instructions of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In this connection he complained that they had not established the relevant facts , namely when had the relations between the parties deteriorated and what had been the plaintiff \u2019s contribution to the construction of the house .

The admissibility of an appeal on points of law is assessed on the basis of the value of the dispute of the claim and the counterclaim taken separately .", "In the present case , the value of the dispute regarding the claim was set at MKD CARDINAL .

According to a list of court fees under LAW , the plaintiff paid court fees in amount of LAW , which corresponds to a claim of MKD CARDINAL,CARDINAL in value . In view of the foregoing , the appeal on points of law is inadmissible . ORG accordingly rejects the appeal on points of law as inadmissible under section CARDINAL of LAW .
