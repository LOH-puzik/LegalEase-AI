{"ITEMID": "001-5841", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "NLD", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2001, "DOCNAME": "ARHIM v. THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Luigi Ferrari Bravo", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in the GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr T. Adank and PERSON NORP GPE , both lawyers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant arrived in the GPE where he applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit for compelling humanitarian grounds . On DATE , the applicant was interviewed by immigration official on the reasons for his asylum request .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s request were rejected by the ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) . The applicant \u2019s objection ( bezwaar ) against this decision was rejected by the ORG Secretary on DATE . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG ( ORG ) sitting in GPE was dismissed on DATE .", "ORG noted that , in support of his asylum request the applicant submitted that his father had been arrested in DATE for involvement in a trade union and that he had been released later , that his brother was detained since DATE for opposition activities and that in this connection his family had been arrested and questioned on CARDINAL occasions ; the last time in DATE . As to his personal situation , the applicant had submitted that , since DATE , he had been a member of the illegal organisation \u201c ORG NORP Citizen \u201d which association collects and provides information about detained persons and acts as a go - between between detainees and their families . He had stencilled and copied pamphlets for this association at his work . His immediate superior in the association was Y. , an internal security service officer . In DATE , he had been informed that a travel prohibition had been issued against him and in DATE the association decided that he and another person , PERSON , should leave the country . In DATE , the applicant and PERSON obtained a visa in their passport via FAC in GPE and , on DATE , they travelled by car to GPE from where they travelled by plane to GPE . They were refused entry to GPE and sent back to GPE . They subsequently travelled by plane to the GPE . After his departure from GPE , his brother had been arrested and released later .", "ORG held that the general situation in GPE was not as such that asylum seekers from GPE automatically qualified for asylum . It should therefore be established whether , on the basis of his personal situation , the applicant had founded reasons to fear persecution within the meaning of the DATE LAW relating to ORG .", "ORG did not find it established that the applicant had attracted the negative attention of the NORP authorities in connection with his alleged activities for the association indicated . Noting that the applicant had left GPE in a lawful and controlled manner , it did not find it established that the applicant had been subject to travel prohibition . It further did not find it established that the applicant had left the country in an illegal manner . ORG further noted that a link between the alleged travel prohibition and the applicant \u2019s activities had remained unsubstantiated . It further noted that , after having learned of the alleged travel prohibition in DATE , the applicant had remained at his permanent addresses and had encountered no problems from the side of the NORP authorities until his departure from GPE on DATE .", "ORG further found it unlikely that an investigation against the applicant would have been conducted as from DATE . On this point it rejected as unlikely that Y. , a founder of the association and who allegedly held a high position in the NORP internal security service , would have held further meetings with the applicant and other members of the association whilst the applicant would have been under investigation and the chances of discovery thus being real . This alleged approach of the NORP authorities did not , in the court \u2019s view , match the situation described by ORG in its report of DATE , i.e. a ruthless suppression of any form of opposition .", "As to applicant \u2019s argument that he belonged to a family considered suspect by the authorities , ORG noted that it had not appeared that , since DATE , the applicant \u2019s family had encountered any problems from the side of the authorities whereas , until his departure , the applicant had worked in the public service . Without any further substantiation , this finding could not be altered by the fact that the applicant \u2019s brother had been arrested after DATE and released later .", "ORG also rejected as not having been established that the applicant had evaded his military obligations by failing to respond to a summons for military retraining . This claim had remained fully unsubstantiated despite the fact that the applicant had contacts with his family on various occasions and the fact that the applicant \u2019s brother had been in the GPE . Even assuming that the applicant would have in fact been summoned to report for military service , ORG considered that it could not be concluded from an official report of DATE of ORG nor from the ORG report that it would be likely that the applicant , on grounds of failing to report for military service , would risk a disproportionate or discriminatory sanction . According to ORG , the sanction for such a failure was imprisonment for a maximum of DATE and deprivation of civic rights for a maximum of DATE .", "As to the applicant \u2019s claim that an absence from GPE for an extended period of time is sufficient to attract the negative attention from the NORP authorities , ORG noted that , according to ORG , it was not known whether NORP nationals required permission for a lengthy stay abroad but that it could be expected that NORP nationals , upon their return to GPE after a lengthy stay abroad , would be questioned by the security service . However , according to ORG , this was insufficient to conclude that the applicant had founded fears for persecution .", "In view of these findings , ORG concluded that the applicant did not qualify for the status of refugee and that it had not been established that , if expelled to GPE , he would run a real risk of treatment contrary to LAW . On the latter point , ORG further held that it had not been established that the applicant , on grounds of a recognition by any public official or informer of the NORP authorities in the GPE , had to fear treatment contrary to LAW upon his return to GPE . Insofar as the applicant argued that returned unsuccessful asylum seekers did run such a risk in GPE , ORG noted that , according to ORG , suspected opponents of the NORP authorities who had applied for asylum abroad did run the risk , when returned , to be tortured . However , ORG did not find it established that the applicant was considered as an opponent by the NORP authorities .", "On DATE , the applicant was apprehended and placed in GPE detention ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) for the purposes of his expulsion . On DATE , the applicant filed a second asylum request . An immigration official interviewed him on DATE on the reason for this second asylum request .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a request for release from aliens\u2019 detention with ORG sitting in \u2018 s - PERSON and to award him compensation for having been unlawfully detained .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary declared the applicant \u2019s second asylum request inadmissible in that no other substantial grounds had been submitted by the applicant than those already examined in the proceeding on his first asylum request . The ORG Secretary decided that the applicant would not be allowed to remain in the GPE pending the outcome of a possible appeal .", "By decision of DATE , the President of ORG sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch ordered the applicant \u2019s release from alien \u2019s detention , holding that this had been unlawful given the absence of any indication that the applicant had sought ways to prevent his expulsion . The President awarded the applicant an amount of ORG . CARDINAL in compensation for having been unlawfully detained .", "On DATE , in violation of an agreement reached with him , the applicant failed to report himself to ORG ( ORG ) at FAC for his expulsion to GPE . It appeared that the applicant had left his known address for an unknown destination .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG sitting in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch against the decision of DATE .", "On DATE , acting upon a complaint filed by neighbouring women that they had been bothered by men living in a certain house in GPE , the police visited this house . CARDINAL of the men found there was the applicant , who was subsequently placed in GPE detention .", "On DATE the applicant filed a third request for asylum . After having been interviewed by an immigration officer on DATE , his third asylum request was rejected by the ORG Secretary on DATE .", "The ORG Secretary noted that this third request was based on , inter alia , an article published in a NORP regional DATE newspaper on a protest action by the applicant \u2019s friends in front of the NORP police station where the applicant had been detained . In this article , the applicant \u2019s name is mentioned . The applicant claimed that he had obtained this article via a NORP friend in the GPE to whom this article had been sent by a person who had bought this newspaper at a newspaper stand in GPE . The applicant further claimed that the NORP intelligence authorities were aware of this article . As this claim had remained unsubstantiated , the ORG Secretary did not find this fact established . Insofar as the applicant relied on other documents , the ORG Secretary held that these did not constitute substantially new facts or circumstances , or were or could have been submitted during the proceedings on the applicant \u2019s previous asylum requests . The ORG Secretary finally did not find that the applicant would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if he would be returned to GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE was scheduled for CARDINAL DATE . However , physically resisting his expulsion , the applicant was refused access to the plane and he remained in the GPE .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a request for release from aliens\u2019 detention with ORG sitting in GPE .", "In the meantime a new date for the applicant \u2019s expulsion had planned , namely for DATE . This expulsion was cancelled as his passport could not be found . It was found again on DATE .", "On DATE , ORG sitting in GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s request for release from GPE detention .", "On DATE , ORG sitting in GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision of DATE .", "In its decision of CARDINAL DATE , the President of ORG sitting in GPE accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal against the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE on the applicant \u2019s third asylum request and quashed this decision on grounds of a failure to state sufficient reasons for holding that the new documents submitted by the applicant \u2013 i.e. an article from a NORP newspaper about the execution of CARDINAL NORP nationals , a judgment and arrest warrant from GPE in connection with the applicant \u2019s conviction of anti - government activities , the publicity around his case in the GPE , his conversion to NORP and the worsened situation in GPE \u2013 did not constitute substantially new facts or circumstances , or were or could have been submitted during the proceedings on the applicant \u2019s previous asylum requests .", "However , as to the general situation in GPE , the President held that this point had already been examined in the proceedings having resulted in the decision of DATE and that , since then , this situation had not seriously worsened .", "The President further has doubts as to the value of the NORP documents submitted by the applicant in DATE in the first place \u2013 it had remained unclear how the applicant had obtained these \u201c very secret \u201d documents and also in the course of the hearing before ORG the applicant was unable to give a satisfactory explanation on this point . Secondly , these documents were presented as a judgment and arrest warrant against the applicant whereas it appeared from the translation that in fact it concerned an \u201c information form \u201d not disclosing the existence of a conviction . Finally , even assuming the veracity of the applicant \u2019s claim that it dates back to DATE but that he did not think that this would be needed for his asylum request , the President concluded that on that ground it could not be regarded as a new fact .", "The President further consider rather incredible the applicant \u2019s account that the NORP regional newspaper article would have been found at a petrol station in GPE . The applicant \u2019s subsequent account that this newspaper would have been bought at a newspaper stand in GPE was even more incredible . The President concluded that , in any event , it had not appeared that the NORP authorities would have become aware of the contents of the article . The President further rejected as speculative , the applicant \u2019s argument that he had become known to NORP security officials who were in the GPE in connection with the GPE trial . On this point , the President further considered that it had not appeared that the applicant had continued the activities undertaken in this country of origin . The President added that it would be unacceptable when an alien , whose personal history in itself did not give rise to an assumption of a founded fear for persecution , would be able to make a valid claim to asylum on the basis of subsequent activities that would have attracted attention . A risk thus created remains in principle to be borne by the person concerned .", "As regards the applicant \u2019s conversion to NORP , the President noted that this had taken place DATE and that therefore this argument could have been raised in the proceedings on the applicant \u2019s first asylum request . As regards the NORP newspaper article , the President held that this article did not concern the applicant and that there was no indication that his personal situation was comparable to that of the QUANTITY persons referred to in this article .", "The President , therefore , concluded that the applicant did not meet the requirements for granting him refugee status and that there was no real risk of that he would be subjected to treatment contrary to LAW if he would be expelled to GPE . For these reasons , the President decided that , although the decision of CARDINAL DATE was quashed , its legal consequences were to remain entirely intact ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
