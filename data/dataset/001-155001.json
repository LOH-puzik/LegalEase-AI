The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The fourth applicant lives in the village of PERSON , the second applicant lives in the village of GPE and the third applicant lives in GPE . The first applicant also lived in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . A predecessor of the applicants had owned agricultural land in the village of PERSON , which had been collectivised after DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the adoption of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d , see paragraph QUANTITY below ) in DATE , the fourth applicant , on behalf of his ORG heirs , sought the restitution of land QUANTITY . In a decision of DATE , the ORG agricultural land commission partially allowed the request , refusing to restore the heirs\u2019 rights to QUANTITY of land which had been either taken for urban development or transferred to third parties .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal lodged by the fourth applicant , in a final judgment of DATE the ORG quashed the relevant part of the land commission \u2019s decision of DATE . It noted , in particular , that the public works for which parts of the land at issue had been taken had not been completed , and that in so far as other parts of the land had been transferred to third parties , there was no bar to restitution as the third parties had not carried out any construction work . On that basis ORG recognised the heirs as the \u201c owners \u201d of all of the land claimed by them .", "CARDINAL . In execution of the above judgment , on DATE the land commission issued another decision , restoring to the heirs , inter alia , in its \u201c actual boundaries \u201d , a plot of QUANTITY described as \u201c plot no .

The action was examined by CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction and disallowed in a final judgment of ORG . The domestic courts took note of ORG final judgment of DATE , but found that they were competent to exercise an \u201c indirect judicial review \u201d ( \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u043d \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b ) of it .

CARDINAL , district CARDINAL under the cadastral plan of PERSON of DATE \u201d . However , there existed no cadastral plan dating from DATE and the current plans , the last of which dated from DATE , did not show a plot bearing that number . ORG and the land commission had thus restored the claimants\u2019 rights to \u201c a non - existent plot under a non - existent plan \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the domestic courts found that the defendants had validly obtained title to their plot pursuant to the DATE exchange and the DATE contract of sale .
