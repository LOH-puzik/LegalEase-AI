The applicants were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and lived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are all pensioners ( retired prior to DATE ) and former employees of ORG ( a banking group which was originally a public entity and was later privatised ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before their privatisation , the Banco di GPE and ORG were subject to exclusive welfare systems according to LAW and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE . Their employees benefited from a more favourable equalisation mechanism ( meccanismo perequativo ) than that available to persons registered with the general compulsory insurance ( assicurazione generale obligatoria ) . In particular , the DATE pension increase of their pensioners was calculated on the basis of the salary increases of working employees in equal grades of service ( perequazione aziendale ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the PERSON reform provided for the privatisation of public banks such as ORG . It suppressed their exclusive pension regimes , replacing them by integrated ones . It provided for the registration of the ORG employees with a new welfare management system which was part of the general obligatory insurance managed by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , an NORP welfare entity .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a further partial pension reform took place .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a number of former employees who had by then retired , entered into a dispute with ORG about the application of certain provisions . In particular , by means of a wide interpretation of section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ( hereinafter Law no . DATE ) and LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ( hereinafter Law no . DATE ) ( see Relevant domestic law ) the ORG attempted to suppress the system of perequazione aziendale calculated on the basis of the salary increases of working employees in equal grades of service , also in respect of persons who were already retired , limiting the latter \u2019s perequazione to an automatic one , namely a simple increase according to the cost of living ( perequazione legale ) , which resulted in a less substantial pension .", "CARDINAL . The latter stand was taken notwithstanding that , according to the applicants , PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ( Amato reform ) , particularly its section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and section CARDINAL of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ( see Relevant domestic law ) , limited this suppression solely to persons still employed and not persons already receiving a pension . Indeed persons still employed had been given the option of taking up other benefits as agreed by means of corporate collective bargaining .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date a number of pensioners in the applicants\u2019 position instituted civil proceedings contesting the actions of ORG , since as a consequence they were receiving lesser amounts than those they claimed to be entitled to . They highlighted that LAW . DATE and DATE safeguarded any more favourable treatment applicable to persons who had retired prior to DATE . Thus , they requested the court to find that they had a right to retain the system of perequazione aziendale as applied before the enactment of such laws , and to order the ORG to pay the sums it had failed to pay them .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE in PERSON and others v. ORG GPE , the domestic court upheld the PERSON arguments , holding that they had a right to remain under the system of perequazione ORG even following the entry into force of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . The same was confirmed in a number of other judgments in various jurisdictions , including ORG ( for example , judgments LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and more specifically ORG in its ultimate formation , namely , sitting as a full court ( ORG ) . The latter in its judgment ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of DATE upheld the PERSON argument on the basis of the interpretation of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and LAW . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of DATE and DATE respectively , which explicitly made reference to perequazione aziendale , confirming that it had not been abrogated by the DATE laws . The impugned amendments applied solely to persons still employed and not to persons who had retired on or before DATE . In consequence , the contested right was legitimately due to the former ORG employees who had retired by DATE , for the period DATE ( date when a general suspension of pension adjustments ceased ) to DATE ( date when a new suspension of such adjustments started in respect of the Banco di GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . This interpretation continued to be followed uniformly by all the judges sitting in such cases .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , various legislative amendments took place attempting to limit the application of the system of perequazione aziendale . These culminated in the enactment of LAW paragraph CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL , which interpreted the relevant law to the effect that retired employees of ORG could no longer benefit from the system of perequazione ORG and made it effective retroactively , with effect from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ( legge finanziaria of DATE ) had definitively suppressed all systems of perequazione aziendale , as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Thus , generally the system of pension adjustment according to perequazione ORG had been recognised and remained in force from DATE ( just before the entry into force of the legge finanziaria of DATE ) for other public banking entities that had previously applied a system of perequazione aziendale , except for ORG . In reality , this benefit had already been suspended in respect of the employees of ORG ( and ORG ) with effect from CARDINAL DATE by means of the ORG law . Thus , for the latter \u2019s employees the system of perequazione aziendale would have applied only from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants instituted proceedings on the lines of the proceedings mentioned above , namely they argued that LAW . DATE and DATE safeguarded any more favourable treatments applicable to persons who had retired prior to DATE . Thus , they requested ORG ) to find that they had a right to retain the system of perequazione aziendale as applied before the enactment of such laws and to order the ORG to pay the sums it had failed to pay them .", "CARDINAL . The applicants expected a favourable outcome in view of the then applicable case - law . Indeed , in accordance with the latter , by a judgment of DATE , ORG ) found in favour of the applicants . It ordered ORG to pay the outstanding amounts with inflation increases and legal interest to run from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a judgment of DATE , ORG confirmed the first - instance judgment upholding the applicants\u2019 right to be covered by the system of perequazione aziendale , however only for the period from DATE ( date when a general suspension of pension adjustments ceased ) to DATE ( date when a new suspension of such adjustments started in respect of the Banco di GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Banco di GPE appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment ( no . PERSON ) of DATE deposited in the relevant registry on DATE ORG reversed the lower courts\u2019 judgments and found against the applicants , ordering the costs of the CARDINAL court instances to be paid equally between the parties . ORG upheld the ground of appeal that ORG could not have taken account of PERSON no . CARDINAL - not yet in force at the time of its judgment - an interpretation law applicable retroactively , which was designed to resolve a conflict of interpretation which had been present in domestic case - law and which had ultimately been resolved by ORG ) . Indeed , PERSON no . CARDINAL was enacted to resolve the matter as to whether Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL applied only to employees still in service or also to retired pensioners , and provided that as from DATE onwards a perequazione legale ( increase according to the standard of living ) had to apply to \u201c all \u201d pensioners , irrespective of their date of retirement .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected a claim of unconstitutionality in so far as this interpretative law had retroactive effects impinging on the principle of legal and judicial certainty . In this respect it referred to previous ORG judgments which held that the legislator could impose norms specifying the meaning of other norms in so far as the meaning was one of the options emanating from the original text and in conformity with the principle of rationality .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , in CARDINAL different civil cases , ORG referred the matter to ORG considering that paragraph CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL raised issues of constitutionality on a number of grounds : i ) recourse to norms of authentic interpretation would be unreasonable in such circumstances , it being disproportionate and counterproductive vis\u00e0vis the aim sought , namely the extinction of contentious proceedings ; ii ) the impugned law would make the determination of the parties interest dependent on an unconstitutional factor , namely the length of proceedings , and would constitute an inequality of treatment between persons whose proceedings have terminated and others whose proceedings were still pending ; iii ) the impugned law would unreasonably obliterate the role of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment filed in the registry on DATE , ORG upheld the legitimacy of PERSON no . CARDINAL . It considered that the impugned law was an interpretative norm to the provisions of law no . DATE which eradicated perequazione aziendale for all pensioners , irrespective of their date of retirement . Indeed , the interpretative nature of the norm was evident since it had confirmed one of the possible meanings of the original DATE text , which had also been upheld in some jurisprudence . The impugned law had been reasonable because it aimed to achieve recognition of an equal and homogenous treatment of all pensioners under the current integrative regimes . Moreover , this law had not augmented contentious proceedings since it had rendered their outcome foreseeable . As to the other inconveniences mentioned by ORG , it considered that these arose from a random number of circumstances and was not sufficient to consider the norm unconstitutional . It further considered that the legislator could enact interpretative laws , once they were based on CARDINAL of the possible meanings of the original text even if there had been consistent jurisprudence about the matter , and this did not affect the role of ORG .", "CARDINAL .
