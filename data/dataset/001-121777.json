The LAW , which was published in ORG on CARDINAL DATE , introduced inter alia a new tax on certain payments to employees in the public sector whose employment was terminated . Consequently , severance pay and other payments related to the termination of employment exceeding ORG CARDINAL became subject to a PERCENT tax .

Notwithstanding the limit of ORG CARDINAL , the statutory provisions on the sum of severance pay DATE in some cases amounting to CARDINAL months\u2019 remuneration \u2013 were not modified .

ORG pointed out that it reviewed the rate or amount of taxes only exceptionally ; however , it held that a pecuniary burden was unconstitutional if it was of a confiscatory nature or its extent was clearly exaggerated , i.e. was disproportionate and unjustified . Considering also the \u201c PERCENT rule \u201d ( GPE ) set out by ORG \u2013 according to which the overall tax load on assets must be limited to PERCENT of the yield on those assets \u2013 the court found that the PERCENT tax was excessive and punitive , yet it equally applied to severance pay earned in a fully untainted manner . The tax was levied on or deducted from the revenues concerned even if their morally doubtful origin could not be established . ORG annulled the relevant provisions retroactively , that is , from DATE of the Act \u2019s entry into force .

[ The LAW ] applies to ... payments originating in unconditional statutory entitlements and defined by objective criteria , that is , to those ... received from any source specified in the LAW and exceeding the [ relevant ] amount .... The LAW does not apply only to budgetary institutions but to other , ORG - owned employers as well . The use of private resources depends on the ORG relatively free choices and autonomous decisions .

Depending on the circumstances , [ the ] PERCENT tax may apply to payments which derive from the obligatory application of cogent legal provisions . ... In these cases , the special tax does not function as a regulatory instrument , given its inescapable factual basis .

The LAW would be applied also in cases where no infringement of law can be established in connection with the payments concerning the termination of a legal relation . It would deprive the taxable persons of incomes originating in unconditional statutory entitlements . ...", "To increase budgetary revenues and secure a general and proportionate distribution of public burden is only the secondary and eventual purpose of the legislator when introducing such a tax . The direct purpose of the legislator in this case is to set a certain barrier on incomes by using the means of tax law . However , imposing a tax or other similar duty is no constitutional means to achieve such purpose . Several constitutional instruments are at the disposal of the legislator to accomplish its objective . It may reduce or even abolish some ORG allowances falling under the scope of the LAW for the future , or transform the allocation system so that in the future it should not be possible to acquire further entitlements to allowances above a certain limit .

The new legislation was published in ORG of DATE and entered into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG again amended the LAW , allowing retroactive taxation going back DATE . Furthermore , ORG powers were limited : the amended articles of the LAW contained a restriction on ORG \u2019s right to review legislation on budgetary and tax issues .

Upon a petition for an abstract ex post facto control , on CARDINAL DATE ORG annulled \u2013 notwithstanding its limited powers \u2013 the DATE retroactive application of PERCENT tax in decision no . CARDINAL , relying on the right to human dignity . However , the reasoning of the decision underlined that only the taxation of revenues gathered before the DATE tax year constituted a violation of the right to human dignity . ORG did not find unconstitutional as such the Act \u2019s presumption that the relevant revenues infringed good morals ; however , it ruled that this presumption should be susceptible to a legal challenge .

In that specific case the specific circumstances were relevant because the heir could not secure her own existence after paying the taxes for the annuity for life . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In GPE v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL , CARDINAL ( DATE ) ORG dealt with the following problem : According to the provisions of LAW , after DATE no salary or compensation was to be paid to certain individuals , who were then government employees , out of any moneys then or thereafter appropriated , except for services as jurors or members of armed forces unless they were prior to that date again appointed to jobs by the President with advice and consent of the ORG . In the background of the statute challenged lay the ORG of Representatives\u2019 feeling that in DATE many \u2018 subversives\u2019 were occupying influential positions in the Government and elsewhere and that their influence must not remained unchallenged . In DATE the respondents , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , were and had been for DATE working for the Government . The Government agencies which had lawfully employed them were fully satisfied with the quality of their work and wished to keep them employed in their jobs . ORG held that the purpose of the provision challenged was not merely to cut off the ORG compensation through regular disbursing channels , but permanently to bar them from government service and it was designed to force the employing agencies to discharge respondents and to bar their being hired by any other governmental agency . ORG reiterated that the LAW barred such legislative acts by providing that \u201c LAW or ex post facto PERSON shall be passed \u201d . It found that the relevant provision was designed to apply to particular individuals and operated as a legislative decree of perpetual exclusion from a chosen vocation . It ruled that this permanent proscription from any opportunity to serve the Government was punishment of those individuals without a judicial trial and thus carried the usual characteristics of bills of attainder . ORG found that \u201c legislative acts , no matter what their form , that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial , are \u2018 bills of attainder\u2019 prohibited by LAW .", "The subject matter of the case PERSON GPE , CARDINAL GPE DATE ) was as follows : The petitioners ( PERSON and PERSON . ) furnished various materials to PERSON for use in construction of boats .

When the transfer occurred , the petitioners had not been paid for their materials and they were not paid afterwards , either . The petitioners therefore contended that they had liens . ORG held \u201c that there was a taking of these liens for which just compensation is due under LAW . It is true that not every destruction or injury to property by governmental action has been held to be a \u2018 taking\u2019 in the constitutional sense . This case and many others reveal the difficulty of trying to draw the line between what destructions of property by lawful governmental actions are compensable \u2018 LOC and what destructions are \u2018 consequential\u2019 and therefore not compensable ... LAW guarantee that private property shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which , in all fairness and justice , should be borne by the public as a whole . A fair interpretation of this constitutional protection entitles these lienholders to just compensation here . \u201d", "In ORG v. ORG , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ( DATE ) ORG held that ORG DATE amounted to an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property . It held that the economic impact of the LAW was substantial as to the petitioner , in that it required ORG to contribute large sums of money to a pension fund for employees employed in DATE solely because those payments could not be allocated to other coal companies that were currently operating in the coal industry . The retroactive effect of the LAW imposed a substantial economic injury on ORG that could not have been anticipated . Moreover , the challenged statute interfered with ORG Enterprises\u2019 expectations in that in DATE the company sold off its remaining holdings in coal operations and completely quitted this industry . The statute \u2019s requirement for ORG to undertake the obligation at issue clearly interfered with the expectations of ORG when it sold off its interest in coal operations . Lastly , the nature of the government action was unusual because it retroactively applied a substantial economic burden on ORG . For ORG , the character of the government action was substantial and invasive .
