The applicants owned a number of plots of land located in GPE , on FAC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a local land development plan was adopted under which a local health centre was to be built on their land . However , this plan was not implemented and apparently the land was later designated for the construction of small individual houses .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants requested the municipal authorities to reclassify their land so that it could be used for construction purposes . In DATE they were granted an initial approval for a development project on their land ( decyzja o warunkach zabudowy ) .", "In DATE they obtained a permit under LAW DATE to divide their plot , which was listed in the local land register as plot no . CARDINAL , into CARDINAL smaller plots suitable for the construction of individual houses ( decyzja o zatwierdzeniu projektu podzialu nieruchomo\u015bci ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG announced that it was intending to adopt a new land development plan under which part of the applicants\u2019 property was to be used for the construction of a major roadway . On DATE the applicants lodged their objections against the proposed amendments . On DATE the amendments were adopted by the ORG . The ORG objections were not taken into consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested that final construction permits ( zezwolenie na budow\u0119 ) be granted to them in respect of certain plots on the basis of the decisions given in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the local ORG administration obliged ORG to draw up a financing plan for local infrastructure investments , including the road network , and to fix time - limits for the purchase from their owners of plots necessary for the implementation of the plans .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested ORG to amend further the local plan as amended in DATE by providing that the projected roadway would , instead of CARDINAL , be QUANTITY wide , as provided for in DATE decisions allowing their property to be divided into smaller construction plots .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to FAC DATE , communicated to the applicants for information , the PERSON Governor stated that the construction of the roadway would not be provided for in the financing scheme for the local land development plan until DATE . Therefore , no purpose was served by blocking the development of the properties concerned .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in DATE the local municipality informed the public that it would start proceedings in order to amend the DATE land development plan in its part concerning the projected roadway .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants submitted a request to obtain a final construction permit for their plot no . CARDINAL on FAC . Those proceedings were subsequently stayed , the authorities considering that no decision could be given before the changes to the development plan had been adopted .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the local municipality made public the proposed amendments to that plan . In DATE the applicants lodged their objections against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants asked the Mayor when ORG would discuss the new amendments to the plan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they were informed that ORG would discuss the amendments to the plan at its session to be held on DATE , but that it would most likely decline to make any changes to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided not to make any changes to the DATE plan as proposed by the applicants and other persons who had lodged objections against the amendments . It was observed that the proposed changes had resulted in a number of objections being lodged by the owners of properties concerned . It was impossible to reconcile all of the conflicting interests . It was further acknowledged that the proposed amendments to the plan would free some of the applicants\u2019 plots . However , on the whole , and having regard to the number of serious objections against the changes , it was not considered feasible to amend the plan accordingly . In particular , it would not have been feasible to build the projected roadway if it were to be QUANTITY wide , as had been proposed inter alia by the applicants . Moreover , had the plan been amended , the municipality would have incurred substantial expenditure for the purchase of plots which would have to be used for the construction of the roadway . It was further noted that the local investment plan did not provide for the construction of the road to begin before DATE . Nevertheless , it would be premature to give up the construction , since there remained a possibility that the necessary funds might eventually be secured from ORG funds .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a complaint against this decision with ORG . The court rejected their complaint as it was still open to them to have recourse to a remedy provided by local government legislation , namely requesting ORG to bring its actions into conformity with the law . The applicants accordingly did so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the ORG request .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified later date the ORG request for the final construction permits for their plots was dismissed , regard being had to the fact that these plots were in the vicinity of the projected road .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a complaint with ORG against the municipality \u2019s failure to adopt changes to the local development plan . They argued that under the DATE land development plan they could not use their property in accordance with their wishes . Their requests to obtain final construction permits had been refused . The local investment plans did not provide for any work in connection with the construction of the roadway to be carried out before DATE at the earliest and until then they were be prevented from making use of their property . Therefore , they had to bear an intolerable burden in that the local municipality had adopted the plan to build a roadway which would necessitate their expropriation at some undetermined time in the future . However , that plan could not be implemented in the foreseeable future because of lack of financial resources .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed their complaint . The court recalled the history of the local development plan dating back to DATE . The court noted the municipality \u2019s argument that the current budget did not allow for the construction of the roadway . It considered that the applicable planning laws did not make it obligatory for the municipality to amend existing land development plans in response to every request of the public . The nature of the policy functions of the municipality in the area of land development was such that the municipal organs could not be taken to be under an obligation to amend the plan once it had started the relevant proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

All members of the public were entitled to submit objections and comments on the draft plan .", "A final plan was adopted by way of a resolution of a local council . The council , when voting on the draft plan , also decided whether and , if so , in what manner , objections and comments submitted by the local public were to be considered .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of DATE owners of properties to be expropriated in the future were not entitled to any form of compensation for damage resulting from restrictions on the use of their property and the reduction in its value originating in expropriations to be carried out at a future undetermined point in time .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW enacted in DATE created for local authorities a number of obligations towards owners whose properties were to be expropriated at an undetermined future date under land development plans adopted by competent municipal authorities .
