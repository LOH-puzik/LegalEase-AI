SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Sigvard PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG ( r\u00e5dhusr\u00e4tten ) in PERSON declared that the applicant was the father of B , born in DATE . The judgment gained legal force .", "However , in DATE , a DNA - test was carried out by ORG PERSON ) which showed that the applicant could not be B \u2019s biological father .", "Based on the DNA - result , the applicant requested ORG ) for NORP Norrland to re - open the case and to annul the paternity . The mother of B consented to the annulment . On DATE ORG re - opened the case and repealed the original judgment , thereby declaring that the applicant was not the father of B. The decision gained legal force .", "In DATE the applicant requested that ORG ( l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) of GPE reimburse him all his expenses for child maintenance and other costs , in total SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( QUANTITY ) , that he had been obliged to pay to B and her mother DATE , with the amount up - dated according to the consumer index and with interest .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request on the ground that it had been lodged out of time as the statutory limitation period was DATE from the date of payment of the child maintenance .", "The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( ORG ) in GPE , arguing that the statutory limitation period should be calculated as starting from the date of the DNA - result in DATE and not from the date of the actual payments . He argued that his claim on ORG had only arisen once he was freed from the paternity as this was the sole basis for his claim for reimbursement .", "On DATE ORG upheld the ORG \u2019s decision and reasoning . However , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges did not agree with the majority and , in his dissenting opinion , he stated that a claim for reimbursement of paid child maintenance could not be considered to arise until a judgment , which had gained legal force , had annulled the paternity . Thus , the DATE statutory limitation period should be counted from that point since , up until then , the man had been legally obliged to pay child maintenance and could not be said to have a claim on the ORG for reimbursement .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) , maintaining his claims and invoking the dissenting opinion in support of his position . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal and informed the applicant of its decision without giving any reasons for it .", "From section CARDINAL of the Act on Reimbursement in Certain Cases for Paid Child Maintenance ( lag om ers\u00e4ttning i vissa fall f\u00f6r utgivna underh\u00e5llsbidrag , Lag CARDINAL NORP \u201c the DATE LAW ) , it appears that if a man , who legally has been considered the father of a child , is freed from the paternity obligation , he has the right to be reimbursed by the ORG for child maintenance which he has paid to the child .", "However , according to section CARDINAL of LAW ( preskriptionslagen , Lag CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , a claim will become statute - barred DATE after it arose , unless the limitation is interrupted before its date of expiration .", "In the preparatory work to LAW ( prop . CARDINAL ) , it was considered that it was not necessary to set out in the LAW a specific time - limit for lodging a claim against the ORG , but that this did not mean that there were no limits at all , since \u201c claims for reimbursement for child maintenance which had been paid DATE became statute - barred \u201d ( p. CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
