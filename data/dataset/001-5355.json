MALTA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE . He is currently serving a fifteenyear prison sentence in GPE .", "He is represented before the ORG by Professor PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , all lawyers practising in GPE .", "A.", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "At the time of the events giving rise to his prosecution and conviction , the applicant was a Commissioner of Police in GPE .", "In DATE the Government of DATE ordered the re - opening of a criminal inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of a suspect at the police headquarters in DATE which occurred when they were in opposition . In DATE , following the close of the inquiry , the applicant was charged with the following offences arising out of the incident : perjury ; wilful homicide ; giving false testimony under oath ; and CARDINAL separate charges of subornation of QUANTITY police witnesses . On DATE ORG declared the CARDINAL charges relating to witness subornation null and void .", "Before the applicant \u2019s trial opened on DATE , the applicant , then on bail , appeared before a criminal court charged with having breached the conditions of his bail . On DATE the court revoked the applicant \u2019s bail , being satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to prove that the applicant had approached a prosecution witness in circumstances which showed that the intention was to corrupt the latter \u2019s evidence at the forthcoming trial . The court ordered a ban on the publication of these proceedings .", "According to the applicant the trial opened against the background of intense and sustained media coverage and political discussion . The applicant cites among other incidents the appearance in a newspaper before the jury was empanelled of a report alleging that he had been found guilty of violations of human rights . The editor of the newspaper was subsequently found guilty on DATE of contempt of court . The court which convicted the editor considered that the report could have had a negative affect on the jury causing irreparable harm to the applicant . He also points to the fact that a witness who had failed to appear at the bail revocation proceedings was subsequently tried on a perjury charge DATE before his own trial with the result that the public learned in press reports dated CARDINAL and DATE that his bail had been revoked .", "The trial commenced on DATE and was presided over by the same judge who had earlier ordered the applicant \u2019s bail to be revoked . Following empanelment the judge instructed the jury to disregard anything which they may have heard or read about the case .", "On DATE the prosecution announced at the close of its case that it had no further evidence to present to the court . Among the witnesses called by the prosecution were CARDINAL persons who had testified against him in the earlier proceedings in which his bail had been revoked . According to the applicant the result was to allow these witnesses to give evidence on the circumstances which led to the revocation of the applicant \u2019s bail thus creating for him a new case to answer . QUANTITY police officers also gave evidence against the applicant . CARDINAL of these officers who had admitted to beating up the suspect had been granted a presidential pardon to secure their testimony against the applicant .", "Throughout this phase of the trial the applicant took detailed notes of the case against him in order to facilitate the giving of his own evidence in rebuttal at the appropriate moment . The applicant began his testimony on DATE . When the TIME sitting was adjourned at TIME , the prosecution requested the court to disallow the applicant use of his notes . The court upheld the request and ordered the confiscation not only of the notes but also other documentation including legal materials which the applicant had assembled in his place of confinement for the purposes of preparing defence .", "The TIME sitting resumed at TIME on DATE . Before the jury were admitted to the courtroom , the applicant \u2019s counsel informed the presiding judge that the applicant was experiencing difficulty in testifying without the aid of his notes . Submissions were made on this matter by counsel for both sides . The applicant \u2019s counsel insisted that the materials in the case were so voluminous that it would be impossible for any witness to remember everything without the aid of reference materials . The presiding judge decided to postpone a decision on the issue . The applicant resumed his evidence . At TIME the prosecution commenced its cross - examination of the applicant . The cross - examination was later suspended , whereupon the applicant \u2019s counsel again raised the issue of his client \u2019s notes . Both counsel entered TIME in the record of the proceedings setting out their respective views on the matter . At a later stage the presiding judge ruled as follows :", "\u201c Until such time as the accused concludes his testimony he is precluded from having access to any writing except that indicated in section CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d", "The applicant concluded his evidence on DATE . The following days were taken up with matters such as the hearing of witnesses requested by the jury , the defence speech , the prosecution \u2019s reply , the addresses to the jury and the latter \u2019s deliberations and verdict .", "In his summing up to the jury the judge gave directions on the relevant law and stressed that it was for the jury to reach its decision on the basis of the facts and without taking into account any extraneous matters . The judge advised the jury that the applicant was to be presumed innocent until proved guilty and it was for the prosecution to prove guilt to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt . He further stressed the need to subject to scrutiny the evidence of those witnesses who had testified in return for a pardon and that the applicant could not be convicted on the sole evidence of an accomplice .", "On DATE the jury , after DATE of deliberations , found the applicant not guilty of the charge of wilful homicide but guilty of being an accomplice to the crime of causing grievous bodily harm resulting in death . According to the applicant he was never charged with the latter offence but was nevertheless found guilty of it . He was found not guilty of the perjury charge but guilty of giving false evidence under oath . However , on DATE the court acquitted him of the perjury charge and declared the related charge to be time - barred .", "The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of DATE on the charge of being an accomplice to the crime of causing grievous bodily harm resulting in death .", "On DATE ORG confirmed the judgment and sentence of the trial court . Although the court held for the first time that the confiscation of a defendant \u2019s notes at his trial was illegal under NORP law , it nonetheless found that no miscarriage of justice had taken place at the applicant \u2019s trial having regard to the strength of the evidence against him . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the fairness of the trial was impaired on account of the adverse media reporting of the case , the court held that the balance between the applicant \u2019s rights as an accused person and the freedom of the press had not been disturbed to the point where it could be said that the media coverage had a negative influence on the deliberations of the jury and the verdict reached . The court also ruled that the applicant had the opportunity to challenge the presence of the trial judge under domestic law . Since he had failed to do so it was no longer open to him to raise the issue of the judge \u2019s impartiality on appeal .", "The applicant appealed to ORG contending that he had been denied a fair trial in breach of the guarantees laid down in LAW and LAW . On DATE his appeal was rejected , the court being of the opinion that the applicant \u2019s complaints whether taken individually or collectively did not substantiate that he had been denied a fair trial .", "The applicant subsequently appealed to ORG , which in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE dismissed his appeal . ORG acknowledged that the applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial had been breached since the confiscation of his reference materials had seriously disrupted his defence . It stated in this regard that :", "\u201c ... the confiscation of the notes and other books of the applicant and this after he has already started testifying and without a forewarning , certainly hindered the testimony given by him in defence , both from the factual aspect and from the psychological one and this particularly because those notes which were prepared by him to conduct the defence did not necessarily refer to evidence previously given ...", "... The ORG is therefore of the opinion that in this regard and limited to this grievance , the right of the [ applicant ] to a fair hearing before the first ORG was violated ... \u201d", "However ORG then proceeded to rule that the criminal proceedings , taken as a whole , had been fair . The court noted also that it was relevant that at no time before ORG had the applicant asked to give evidence with the assistance of those materials .", "In line with the rulings of the appellate courts , ORG also found that the applicant had not adduced any concrete proof that the jury or the trial or appeal court judges had been influenced by press coverage of the proceedings or related political statements . It noted , inter alia , that the jury had taken a considerable length of time in reaching a verdict . Furthermore , the court rejected the applicant \u2019s challenge to the impartiality of the trial judge , inter alia , on the ground that he had not raised this matter at the appropriate moment in the trial and had not availed himself of domestic remedies for this purpose .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "Section CARDINAL of the LAW of GPE provides :", "\u201c \u2026", "( CARDINAL ) Every person who is charged with a criminal offence \u2013", "\u2026", "( b ) shall be given adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence ; \u2026 \u201d", "Sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provide as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
