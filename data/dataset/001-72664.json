The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE - on - Trent .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was arrested on DATE on suspicion of having intimidated witnesses . In an identity parade held the same afternoon , he was positively identified by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL witnesses . The applicant states that this witness accepted in her original statement of evidence to the police that she was a heroin user and an inherently unreliable witness . The applicant was subsequently charged with CARDINAL counts of doing acts tending and intended to pervert the course of public justice .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded not guilty on DATE and the trial was adjourned to the NORP - on - ORG on DATE . On that date no judge was available and the trial was moved to DATE . On DATE of the trial the witness who had identified the applicant did not attend and the trial had to be aborted . At the re - listed trial on DATE , Counsel for the ORG addressed the court in the following terms :", "\u201c When this matter was listed for trial in DATE , [ L. ] attended on DATE . She was n't called to give evidence and did n't come back on DATE . Certainly , that caused some concern . I think it is fair to say , at different stages of the entire case , she has blown slightly hot and cold .", "[ L. ] indicated to the police when they contacted her recently and , in fact , again DATE , that she was reluctant to give evidence . She has attended court DATE and with my learned friend 's permission , I have had the chance to sit down and have a chat to her .", "Your Honour , the reality is that she does not want to give evidence . She has personal reasons I do n't propose to divulge in open court . She has formed a new relationship . She has moved on . She is trying very hard to put the events of this entire case behind her . She has satisfied the police who spoke to her DATE and satisfied those who instruct me that no threats have been made toward her in relation to DATE 's proceedings . She insists that there has been no contact from [ the applicant ] or others acting on his behalf . We do n't feel that , due to the nature of this allegation , she ought to be compelled to give evidence in this case .", "Your Honour , there has been a very full discussion and the view we have taken is that without her evidence , plainly , we ca n't proceed . I offer no evidence . Verdicts must follow . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was duly acquitted . On his counsel 's application for a defendant 's costs order , the judge refused to make an order and stated :", "\u201c That order will be refused . There is clear evidence on the court papers . The ORG have taken the view that they are not going to compel this witness although there is compelling evidence in respect of those matters . It is a discretion which I am afraid I am not going to exercise in your favour . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's attempted appeal was dismissed on DATE as \u201c to be appealable as a sentence , the order must be contingent upon conviction . As the defendant 's costs order only arises when a prosecution is unsuccessful , it can not be a sentence and can not be appealed at ORG \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

Such an order should normally be made whether or not an order for costs inter partes is made , unless there are positive reasons for not doing so , as where , for example , the defendant 's own conduct has brought suspicion on himself and has misled the prosecution into thinking that the case against him is stronger than it is . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As noted above , no appeal lies to ORG against a refusal of a defendant 's costs order .", "CARDINAL .
