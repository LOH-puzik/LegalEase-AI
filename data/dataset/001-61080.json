{"ITEMID": "001-61080", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2003, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF APPLEBY AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 10;No violation of Art. 11;No violation of Art. 13", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first , second and third applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE ( GPE and Wear ) , where the fourth applicant , an environmental group set up by the applicants , is also based .", "CARDINAL . The new town centre of GPE is known as \u201c the Galleries \u201d and is located within an area now owned by ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , a private company . This town centre was originally built by ORG ( \u201c the Corporation \u201d ) , a body set up by the government of the GPE pursuant to an ORG to build the \u201c new \u201d centre . The centre was sold to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Galleries , as owned by PERSON at the relevant time , comprised a shopping mall ( with CARDINAL hypermarkets and major shops ) , the surrounding car parks with spaces for CARDINAL cars and walkways . Public services were also available in the vicinity . However , the freehold of the ORG office and the public library was owned by ORG , the social services office and health centre were leased to the ORG by the Secretary of ORG and the freehold of the police station was held on behalf of ORG . There was a post office within the FAC and also the offices of the housing department , leased to the ORG by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Around DATE the ORG gave outline planning permission to GPE to build on a part of LOC in GPE known as the ORG . The ORG is the only playing field in the vicinity of GPE town centre which is available for use by the local community . The first to third applicants , together with other concerned residents , formed the fourth applicant to campaign against the college \u2019s proposal and to persuade the ORG not to grant the college permission to build on the field .", "CARDINAL . On or around DATE the first applicant , together with her husband and son , set up CARDINAL stands at the entrance of the shopping mall in the Galleries , displaying posters alerting the public to the likely loss of the open space and seeking signatures to present to the ORG on behalf of ORG . Security guards employed by ORG would not let the first applicant or her assistants continue to collect signatures on any land or LOC owned by PERSON . The applicants had to remove their stands and stop collecting signatures .", "CARDINAL . The manager of CARDINAL of the hypermarkets gave the applicants permission to set up stands within that store in DATE , allowing them to transmit their message and to collect signatures , albeit from a reduced number of people . However , the same permission was not granted in DATE when the applicants wanted to collect signatures for a further petition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant , as acting chair of ORG , wrote to the manager of the ORG asking for permission to set up a stand and to canvass views from the public either inside the mall itself or in the adjacent car parks and offered to pay to be allowed to do so . In his reply of DATE , the manager of the PERSON refused access . His letter read as follows :", "\u201c ... the Galleries is unique in as much as although it is FAC , it is also privately owned .", "The owner \u2019s stance on all political and religious issues , is CARDINAL of strict neutrality and I am charged with applying this philosophy .", "I am therefore obliged to refuse permission for you to carry out a petition within the PERSON or the adjacent car parks . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant wrote again to the manager of the Galleries , asking him to reconsider his decision . His letter remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant continued to try and reach the public by setting up stands by the roadside on public footpaths and going to the old town centre at GPE which , however , is visited by a much smaller number of GPE residents .", "CARDINAL . The deadline for letters of representation to the ORG regarding the building works was DATE . On DATE the applicants submitted the CARDINAL letters of representation they had obtained .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant has produced a list of associations and others which were given permission to carry out collections , set up stands and displays within the Galleries . These included : the ORG ( collection before DATE ) , local school choirs ( carol - singing and collection before DATE ) , ORG ( advertising display and handing out of nicotine patches ) , ORG ( blood collection ) , ORG ( collection for DATE ) , various photographers ( advertising and taking of photographs ) and ORG ( staffed advertising display ) .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , ORG ran a consultation campaign under the banner \u201c Your Council , Your Choice \u201d , informing the local residents of CARDINAL leadership choices for the future of the ORG and were allowed to use the Galleries for this purpose . This was a statutory consultation exercise carried out under LAW of LAW , which required local authorities to draw up proposals for the operation of \u201c executive arrangements \u201d and consult local electors before sending them to the Secretary of ORG . CARDINAL people were reported as having responded to the survey .", "CARDINAL . At common law , a private property owner may , in certain circumstances , be presumed to have extended an implied invitation to members of the public to come onto his land for lawful purposes . This is the case with commercial LOC , such as shops , theatres and restaurants , as well as private LOC ( for example , there is a presumption that a house owner authorises people to come up the path to his front door to deliver letters or newspapers or for political canvassing ) . Any implied invitation may be revoked at will . A private person \u2019s ability to eject people from his land is generally unfettered and he does not have to justify his conduct or comply with any test of reasonableness .", "CARDINAL . In ORG v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL EGLR ( Estates Gazette Law Reports ) CARDINAL ) , where the applicants ( young men ) were barred from a shopping centre in GPE as the private company owner ORG considered that their behaviour was a nuisance , ORG held that ORG had the right to determine any licence which the applicants might have had to enter the centre . In giving judgment , Lord PERSON found that the local authority had not entered into any walkways agreement with the company within the meaning of section CARDINAL ) of the Highways Act DATE ( later replaced by LAW of LAW ) which would have dedicated the walkways or footpaths as public rights of way and which would have given the local council the power to issue by - laws regulating the use of those rights of way . Nor was there any basis for finding an equitable licence . He also considered case - law from LOC concerning the applicants\u2019 arguments for the finding of some kind of public right :", "\u201c Of more obvious relevance are CARDINAL NORP cases . In GPE v. ORG ( DATE ) GPE QUANTITY , ORG laid down as a general proposition that when property owners open their LOC \u2013 in that case a gaming casino \u2013 to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests , they have no right to exclude people unreasonably but , on the contrary , have a duty not to act in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner towards persons who come on their LOC . However , that decision was based upon a previous decision of the same court in ORG v. PERSON ( DATE ) GPE CARDINALA CARDINALd CARDINAL , which clearly turned upon the constitutional freedoms of LAW . The general proposition cited above has no application in LANGUAGE law .", "The case of PERSON v. PERSON ( DATE ) DATE in ORG concerned the right of an employee of a tenant in a shopping centre to picket her employer in the centre , against the wishes of the owner of the centre . The majority of ORG held that she had no such right and that the owner of the centre had sufficient control or possession of the common areas to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass . However , PERSON , in a strong dissenting judgment held that since a shopping centre was freely accessible to the public , the public did not enter under a revocable licence subject only to the owner \u2019s whim . He said that the case involved a search for an appropriate legal framework for new social facts and \u2013", "\u2019If it was necessary to categorise the legal situation which , in my view , arises upon the opening of a shopping centre , with public areas of the kind I have mentioned ( at least where the opening is not accompanied by an announced limitation on the classes of public entrants ) , I would say that the members of the public are privileged visitors whose privilege is revocable only upon misbehaviour ( and I need not spell out here what this embraces ) or by reason of unlawful activity . Such a view reconciles both the interests of the shopping centre owner and of members of the public , doing violence to neither and recognising the mutual or reciprocal commercial interests of shopping centre owner , business tenants and members of the public upon which the shopping centre is based.\u2019", "I have already said that this was a dissenting judgment . Nevertheless counsel [ for the applicants ] submitted that we should apply it in the present case . I accept that courts may have to be ready to adapt the law to new social facts where necessary . However there is no such necessity where ORG has already made adequate provision for the new social facts in question as it has here by LAW of LAW DATE and LAW of LAW . ( PERSON v. ORG makes no mention of any similar legislation in GPE . ) Where ORG has legislated and the ORG , as representing the public , chooses not to invoke the machinery which the statute provides , it is not for the courts to intervene .", "I would allow this appeal ... on the basis that ORG had the right , subject only to the issue under LAW , to determine any licence the [ applicants ] may have had to enter the LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The parties have referred to case - law from GPE and GPE .", "CARDINAL . LAW to LAW protects freedom of speech and peaceful assembly .", "CARDINAL . ORG has accepted a general right of access to certain types of public places , such as streets and parks , known as \u201c public fora \u201d for the exercise of free speech ( GPE v. ORG , CARDINAL GPE ( GPE : ORG Reports ) DATE ) ) . In GPE v. GPE ( CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG . ( ORG Reporter ) CARDINAL , CARDINAL L.Ed . ( ORG , Lawyers\u2019 Edition ) CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) , ORG also held that a privately owned corporate town ( a company town ) having all the characteristics of other municipalities was subject to the LAW rights of free speech and peaceable assembly . It has found that LAW does not require access to privately owned properties , such as shopping centres , on the basis that there has to be \u201c State action \u201d ( a degree of State involvement ) for the amendment to apply ( see , for example , PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has taken the position that LAW does not prevent a private shopping - centre owner from prohibiting distribution on its LOC of leaflets unrelated to its own operations ( ORG v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL , CARDINAL S.Ct . DATE , CARDINAL L.Ed . CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) . This did not however prevent ORG constitutional provisions from adopting more expansive liberties than LAW to permit individuals reasonably to exercise free speech and petition rights on the property of a privately owned shopping centre to which the public was invited and this did not violate the property rights of the shopping - centre owner so long as any restriction did not amount to taking without compensation or contravene any other federal constitutional provisions ( ORG v. PERSON , CARDINAL GPE CARDINAL , CARDINAL L.Ed . CARDINAL , CARDINAL ORG . CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Some ORG courts have found that a right of access to shopping centres could be derived from provisions in their ORG constitutions according to which individuals could initiate legislation by gathering a certain number of signatures in a petition or individuals could stand for office by gathering a certain number of signatures ( see , for example , ORG v. ORG , ORG ( West \u2019s ORG Reporter ) CARDINALd MONEY ( GPE , DATE ) ; ORG v. GPE , CARDINAL P. ( DATE ORG ) CARDINAL , CARDINAL - CARDINAL ( GPE , DATE ) ; ORG v. ORG . , CARDINAL P. CARDINALd CARDINAL ( GPE , DATE ) ) . Some cases found State obligations arising due to ORG involvement , for example , PERSON ORG , CARDINAL P. CARDINALd DATE ( GPE , DATE ) ( the shopping centre was a ORG actor because of financial participation of public authorities in its development and the active presence of government agencies in the common areas ) , and GPE v. Beneda , CARDINAL N.W. ( LOC \u2019s NORP Reporter ) CARDINAL CARDINAL ( GPE , DATE ) ( where the shopping centre was owned by a public body , although leased to a private developer ) .", "CARDINAL . Other cases cited as indicating a right to reasonable access to property under ORG private law were ORG v. ORG , CARDINAL A. ( LOC \u2019s LOC Reporter ) CARDINAL ( GPE , DATE ) , where the court ruled that under GPE property law ownership of real property did not include the right to bar access to governmental services available to migrant workers , in this case a publicly funded non - profit lawyer attempting to advise migrant workers ; GPE v. ORG , CARDINAL A. CARDINALd CARDINAL ( GPE , DATE ) , a GPE case concerning casinos where the court held that when property owners open their LOC to the general public in pursuit of their own property interests they have no right to exclude people unreasonably ( although it was acknowledged that the private law of most GPE did not require a right of reasonable access to privately owned property , p. CARDINAL ) ; and ORG v. ORG , CARDINAL PERSON . ( LOC \u2019s ORG ) CARDINAL ( LOC of GPE , DATE ) concerning the ejection of homeless people from a railway station .", "CARDINAL . States in which courts ruled that free speech provisions in their constitutions did not apply to privately owned shopping centres included GPE ( ORG v. ORG . , ORG CARDINAL ( ORG , DATE ) ) ; GPE ( GPE v. PERSON , DATE ( DATE ) ) ; GPE ( ORG . , CARDINAL S.E. ( LOC \u2019s NORP Reporter ) DATE ) ) ; GPE ( ORG v. GPE ORG , CARDINAL N.W.

Prior to the entry into force of LAW , ORG had taken the view that the owner of a shopping centre could exclude protesters ( PERSON v. ORG , CARDINAL D.L.R. ( ORG ) DATE ) ) . After the Charter entered into force , a lower court held that the right to free speech applied in privately owned shopping centres ( NORP v. PERSON , CARDINAL ORG ) DATE ) ( ORG , GPE of GPE , GPE ) ) . However , an individual judge of ORG has since expressed the opposite view , stating obiter that the LAW does not confer a right to use private property as a forum of expression ( PERSON , Committee for Cth of Can . v.
