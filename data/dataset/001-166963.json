GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention);No violation of Article 7 - No punishment without law (Article 7-1 - Heavier penalty)", "JUDGES": "Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Erik M\u00f8se;Ganna Yudkivska;Khanlar Hajiyev;S\u00edofra O\u2019Leary", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . At the time of lodging his application , he was detained in a Centre for persons in preventive detention in FAC . He now lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of rape and sexual assault . It sentenced him to eight years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court found that in DATE the applicant , having acted with full criminal responsibility , had raped an DATE woman whom he had lured into a forest . It noted that DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicant had been convicted of CARDINAL counts of rape of young women , committed DATE after his release from prison . Therefore , and having consulted a medical expert , the court found that the applicant had a propensity to commit serious sexual offences and was dangerous to the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who had fully served his prison sentence , was placed for the first time in preventive detention , initially in FAC . He had thus served DATE in preventive detention by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the L\u00fcbeck ORG , having heard the applicant in person as well as his lawyer , by whom he was represented throughout the proceedings , ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention to continue .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the requirements set up by LAW of LAW , read in the light of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , in order for retrospectively - extended preventive detention to continue , were met . It found that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder , for the purposes of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He had a personality and conduct disorder as described by the relevant tool for the classification of diseases , ORG in its current version ( ICD-CARDINAL ) . ORG endorsed the findings which psychiatric expert PERSON had made in his report dated DATE on the possibility of granting relaxation of the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention ( PERSON ) after having examined the applicant in person . The expert had found that the applicant suffered from a profound and serious personality disorder with narcissistic elements and a lack of self - esteem . His disorder was characterised by denying and idealising conduct , total denial of his own aggression and minimisation of his criminal acts .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in ORG view , there was still a high risk that the applicant , owing to the said specific circumstances relating to his person and his conduct , would commit the most serious sexual offences if released . It had repeatedly been confirmed , in particular , by expert PERSON and by FAC hospital , that the applicant needed comprehensive therapy for sexual offenders in a social therapeutic institution . However , the applicant , who had not completed therapy , had confirmed at the hearing that he refused transfer to the prison \u2019s social therapeutic department . Furthermore , the applicant had already raped CARDINAL women and had repeatedly reoffended shortly after his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision with ORG . He argued that his continued preventive detention beyond the former tenyear time - limit breached LAW , as interpreted by ORG , and the LAW . He complained , in particular , that ORG had failed to obtain a new report by a different expert and had relied on the report of expert PERSON dating back CARDINAL - and - a - half years , on relaxation of the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention , which had not addressed the issues relevant to his continued detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Schleswig - Holstein Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . As regards the finding that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , ORG stressed that the decision to extend the applicant \u2019s preventive detention had not only been based on the written report submitted by expert PERSON in DATE . The expert had been heard in person by ORG in different proceedings ( concerning the applicant \u2019s transfer to a psychiatric hospital , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) on DATE and had updated and confirmed his previous findings . His assessment had further been shared by ORG hospital in its statement dated DATE on the therapeutic progress made by the applicant . The hospital , having regard to the voluminous casefile , had confirmed expert PERSON \u2019s conclusion that the applicant , who had refused any therapeutic treatment for DATE , suffered from a profound personality disorder as defined by the ICD-CARDINAL , namely a narcissistic personality disorder with emotionally unstable and sadistic elements .", "CARDINAL . ORG , having regard to the applicant \u2019s previous offences and the fact that therapy to date had not yielded success , further agreed that there was still a high risk that the applicant would commit the most serious sexual offences if released . As had been confirmed by the applicant in the hearing before ORG , his personal and therapeutic situation had not changed since ORG last decision of CARDINAL DATE in which , in periodic review proceedings , it had ordered the extension of the applicant \u2019s preventive detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained that the extension of his preventive detention beyond the former statutory DATE time - limit had violated his right to liberty and the protection of legitimate expectations in a ORG governed by the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that the restrictive criteria set up by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE for a continuation of his retrospectively extended preventive detention had not been met . In particular , the order for the continuation of his preventive detention had been based on an old expert report on relaxation of the conditions of his detention , which had not addressed the criteria set up by ORG . In these circumstances , the courts had not had at their disposal a sufficient basis for concluding that he had a mental disorder for the purposes of LAW . In any event , he did not suffer from a mental illness as required by LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . From DATE until CARDINAL DATE the preventive detention order against the applicant was executed in PERSON , where the applicant was detained together with persons serving their prison sentence . For as long as the applicant \u2019s detention was executed at that prison during the time covered by the proceedings at issue , the applicant , having refused repeated offers of treatment , in particular transfer to the socialtherapeutic institution of FAC , apparently did not undergo any therapy for sexual offenders . His occasional conversations with the prison psychologists had been discontinued in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was transferred to the newly - set - up ORG for persons in preventive detention in FAC . That ORG was built in order to comply with the constitutional requirement , as defined by ORG in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE , to differentiate between preventive detention and imprisonment . Soon after his transfer to that ORG the applicant started comprehensive therapy , including CARDINAL - to - one and group therapy sessions . He was granted leave without escort from DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the proceedings at issue , on DATE ORG dismissed the prosecution \u2019s request to transfer the applicant to a psychiatric hospital for the further execution of his preventive detention under Article DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Having heard psychiatric expert PERSON , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s reintegration into society could not better be supported in a psychiatric hospital . It was necessary for the applicant to undergo therapy for sex offenders in a social - therapeutic department in prison or possibly with an external social therapist . Transferring the applicant , who was not willing to undergo therapy , to a psychiatric hospital against his will would not yield any success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in new review proceedings , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s preventive detention to continue . It had regard to the report dated DATE , submitted by psychiatric expert PERSON , on the applicant \u2019s mental condition and the danger he represented . Having examined the applicant in person , PERSON had considered that the applicant was an accentuated personality , possibly with sadistic personality traits , and lacked self - esteem . He found , however , that the applicant could not be diagnosed with a mental disorder as defined in the ICD-CARDINAL ; in particular , he showed no signs of sexual sadism . There was a medium risk that the applicant would again commit serious sexual offences if released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having regard to an additional report drawn up by expert PERSON , declared the applicant \u2019s preventive detention terminated and ordered his release on DATE . It found that the applicant neither suffered from a mental disorder nor was there a high likelihood that he would commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "7-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
