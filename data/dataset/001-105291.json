In DATE the applicant received part of a house in Punat on the island of GPE , GPE by way of a gift from his father .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG brought a civil action against the applicant in ORG ( PERSON ORG ) , seeking his eviction . The ORG argued that , as the owner of the flat , it had the right to seek the eviction of the applicant because the decision issued by the ORG , granting the applicant the right to purchase the flat in question , had been contrary to the Decree . The ORG sought repossession of the flat .", "CARDINAL . In his defence dated DATE the applicant maintained that he had served as a ORG officer and that the ORG had allocated the flat in question to him and that , therefore , he had had a valid legal basis for occupying the flat .

On DATE ORG found in the ORG \u2019s favour and ordered the applicant to vacate the flat . The court found that the ORG owned the flat and that the applicant had no legal entitlement to occupy it . The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c It is disputed between the parties whether the defendant \u2019s occupancy is based on a valid legal entitlement .", "It is to be noted in that connection that the defendant had moved into the flat in question on the basis of a decision of the [ ORG ( PERSON garnizona ) no .

On DATE ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u ORG ) upheld the first - instance judgment , endorsing the reasoning of the first - instance court , and dismissing the applicant \u2019s argument that GPE had had no authority to adopt the Decree .

The Decree entered into force on DATE , while the decision of ORG was not issued until DATE , which was after the entry into force of the above - mentioned Decree . In view of the nullity of the said decision , the plaintiff \u2019s claim was granted ...", "The factual findings and legal standpoints of the first - instance court are accepted by this court as correct .", "The defendant argued that , before it had declared its independence , GPE had had no authority to enact any decrees concerning the assets of the ORG because these had been federal assets given to the ORG by a federal statute , namely , the YPA Assets and Financing Act ( Zakon o sredstvima i financiranju JNA ) . Therefore , GPE had had no authority to enact the Decree on the Prohibition of All Real Estate Transactions in GPE ...", "These arguments are , however , ill - founded . The Decree is based on LAW , which provides that \u201c where an act or action by a federal body or by another federal republic ... goes against the territorial integrity of GPE or its interests or where such an act places it in a position of inequality within the Federation , the bodies of the Republic [ of GPE ] shall , on the basis of the right to self - determination and the sovereignty of GPE established by LAW , adopt necessary decisions in order to protect the interests of GPE . ...", "Hence , the first - instance court correctly applied sections CARDINAL of the Decree ... by declaring the decision of ORG ... null and void , since it was issued after the said Decree had entered into force . Accordingly the defendant does not have a valid legal basis for occupying the flat in GPE ... and his reliance on the Agreement between GPE and the ORG of CARDINAL DATE is irrelevant .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant brought a constitutional complaint on DATE .
