The commercial court had granted the claim . However , ORG had set aside the decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration . The commercial court was instructed to review the issue of ORG immunity , taking into account that construction of the hotel was for the public , and non - commercial , activity of the foreign ORG in GPE , and was therefore instructed to consider termination of the proceedings under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of its findings in the above case , the Presidium of ORG made the following general recommendation : \u201c A commercial court shall terminate proceedings in a case concerning an investment dispute , the defendant in which is a foreign ORG acting in the capacity of a sovereign \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

However , if the ORG ( through specially empowered agencies ) takes part in property turnover or in commercial activity , then it is regarded as a foreign private person and its ORG ownership does not enjoy immunity . The turnover of such property is regulated by norms of international private law and by legislation of the country where the property is located , the foreign ORG with respect to the country of location of the property acting on the basis of equal rights with other participants of these relations \u2013 with foreign juridical and natural persons .
