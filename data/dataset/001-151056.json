THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE", "CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in LOC .", "CARDINAL . The applicants are a married couple . In the application form , they indicated that , after unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilisation , they decided to resort to gestational surrogacy in order to become parents . To that end , they contacted a GPE - based clinic which specialised in assisted reproduction technology . They entered into a gestational surrogacy agreement with the company PERSON . After a successful in vitro fertilisation on DATE , CARDINAL embryos \u201c belonging to them \u201d were implanted in the womb of a surrogate mother on DATE . There was no genetic link between this woman and the embryos .", "CARDINAL . The baby was born on DATE . The surrogate mother gave her written consent to the child being registered as the applicants\u2019 son . Her written declaration , dated DATE , and read aloud at the hospital in the presence of her doctor , the head doctor and the head of the ( hospital ) department , is worded as follows ( LANGUAGE translation of the original LANGUAGE version ) :", "\u201c I , the undersigned ... gave birth to a boy in the ... maternity hospital in GPE . The child \u2019s parents are an NORP married couple , PERSON , born on ... and PERSON , born on ... , who expressed in writing their wish to have their embryos implanted in my womb .", "On the basis of the foregoing and in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW and LAW , I hereby give my consent for the above couple \u2019s entry in the birth record and the birth certificate as parents of the child to whom I gave birth ... \u201d", "This statement , in the NORP translation appended to the original , reads as follows ( in LANGUAGE ) :", "\u201c I , the undersigned ... gave birth to a boy in the ... maternity hospital in GPE . The child \u2019s genetic parents are an NORP married couple , PERSON , born on ... and PERSON , born on ... , who expressed in writing their wish to have their embryos implanted in my womb .", "On the basis of the foregoing and in accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW and LAW , I hereby give my consent for the above couple \u2019s entry in the birth record and the birth certificate as parents of the child to whom I gave birth ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with NORP law , the applicants were registered as the baby \u2019s parents . The NORP birth certificate , which contained no reference to the gestational surrogacy , was certified in accordance with the provisions of LAW of DATE ( hereafter , \u201c the LAW \u201d ) Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant went to FAC in GPE to obtain the documents that would allow the baby to leave for GPE with her . The applicant answered questions and submitted the paperwork concerning the child \u2019s birth . ORG issued the documents enabling the boy to leave for GPE with the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant and the child arrived in GPE . DATE the second applicant contacted the ORG , requesting that the particulars of the birth certificate be entered in the register .", "CARDINAL . In a note of CARDINAL DATE which is not included in the ORG \u2019s casefile CARDINAL the NORP FAC in GPE indicated to ORG , ORG and ORG and municipality that the paperwork in respect of the child \u2019s birth contained false information .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicants were placed under formal investigation for \u201c altering civil status \u201d within the meaning of LAW and forgery within the meaning of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Criminal Code ; and also for breaching section CARDINAL of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , since they had brought the child into the country in breach of the law and had circumvented the condition set out in the adoption authorisation obtained by them on DATE , which prohibited them from adopting such a young child .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG attached to ORG asked that proceedings to free the child for adoption be opened , since the child ought to be considered , for legal purposes , as having been abandoned . On DATE ORG appointed a guardian ad litem ( curatore special ) within the meaning of LAW no . CARDINAL and opened proceedings to free the child for adoption . On CARDINAL DATE ORG asked for a court - appointed adviser ( curatore ) to be named within the meaning of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL . A court - appointed adviser was named . It appears from the case file that the applicants protested against the measures in respect of the child and had asked to be able to adopt him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant , assisted by a lawyer of her own choosing , was questioned by the Larino carabinieri . She stated that she had travelled to GPE alone in DATE , carrying with her seminal fluid that had previously been collected from her husband . She had concluded a contract with the company PERSON , which had undertaken to find a surrogate mother willing to have implanted in her womb genetic material from the first applicant and her husband , through ORG in GPE . This practice was perfectly legal in GPE , and made it possible to obtain a birth certificate which identified the applicants as parents . In DATE the first applicant had been contacted by the NORP company , which stated that a surrogate mother had been found and had agreed to the medical procedure . On DATE the first applicant had travelled to GPE . In DATE , with a birth certificate issued on DATE by the NORP authorities , she had gone to ORG in GPE to obtain the documents that would enable the child to leave GPE and travel to GPE . The birth certificate showed the applicants\u2019 names and identified them as the parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were heard by ORG . The first applicant stated that , after CARDINAL unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilisation , which had endangered her health , she had resorted to the NORP clinic , since it had been possible in GPE to use ova from a donor , which were subsequently implanted in the surrogate mother \u2019s womb .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , the child \u2019s court - appointed adviser asked the court to suspend the applicants\u2019 parental responsibility within the meaning of section QUANTITY of Law no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court ordered that DNA testing be carried out in order to establish whether the second applicant was the child \u2019s biological father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG to refuse to enter the particulars of the birth certificate in the civil - status register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant and the child underwent DNA testing . The result of those tests showed that there was no genetic link between them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to register the birth certificate . The applicants lodged an appeal with ORG against this refusal . ORG asked the court to give the child a new identity and to issue a new birth certificate .", "CARDINAL . ORG having ruled on DATE that it did not have jurisdiction , the proceedings resumed before ORG . The applicants demanded that the particulars of the NORP birth certificate be entered in the NORP register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of the genetic testing and the submissions of the parties , including those of the child \u2019s court - appointed adviser , ORG decided to remove the child from the applicants . This decision was immediately enforceable . In reaching its decision , the court took account of the following factors : the first applicant had stated that she was not the genetic mother ; the ova came from an unknown woman ; the DNA test carried out on the second applicant and the child had shown that there was no genetic link between them ; the applicants had paid a large sum of money ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) ; contrary to his allegations , there was nothing to prove that the second applicant \u2019s genetic material had indeed been transported to GPE . The only thing that was certain in this story was the identity of the surrogate mother , who was not the biological mother and who had relinquished the child just after his birth . The biological parents remained unknown . That being the case , the situation was not CARDINAL of subrogated maternity , since the child had no biological link with the applicants . The latter were steeped in illegality : they had brought a child into GPE by passing him off as their son . In so doing , they had , in the first place , breached the provisions on international adoption ( PERSON no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , section DATE of which made such breaches a criminal offence , the assessment of which was not , however , a matter for the youth court . Secondly , the agreement entered into by the applicants with the company PERSON was contrary to the Medically Assisted Reproduction Act ( Law no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , section CARDINAL of which prohibited heterologous assisted fertilisation . This illegal situation had to be brought to an end , and the only way to do so was to remove the child from the applicants . The child would admittedly suffer harm as a consequence of the separation but , given the short period spent with the applicants and his young age , the child would be able to surmount this . Steps would be taken immediately to find a couple of adoptive parents . In addition , given that the applicants had preferred to circumvent the adoption legislation , notwithstanding the authorisation they had received , it could be thought that the child resulted from a narcissistic desire on the part of the couple or indeed that he was intended to resolve problems in their relationship . In consequence , the court cast doubt on whether they were genuinely capable of providing emotional and educational support . As the child had neither a biological family nor his surrogate mother , since she had relinquished him , the court considered that the NORP legislation on adoption was applicable to this case ( within the meaning of CARDINAL of PERSON no . CARDINAL ) , entrusted the child to the social services and appointed a guardian ( tutore ) for his defence .", "CARDINAL . The child was placed in a children \u2019s home ( casa famiglia ) in a locality that was unknown to the applicants . They were forbidden from having contact with the child .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an appeal ( reclamo ) with ORG . They argued , inter alia , that the NORP courts could not call into question the birth certificate . They further requested that no measures be taken concerning the child while the criminal proceedings brought against them and the proceedings challenging the refusal to enter the birth certificate in the NORP register were pending .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . It transpires from this decision , among other points , that section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL ( LAW ) did not prevent the NORP courts from refusing to comply with certified information from a foreign ORG . There was no issue of lack of jurisdiction , since LAW of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) provided that NORP law was applicable if the alien minor had been abandoned , and that was the situation in this case . Moreover , it was unnecessary to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings , since the applicants\u2019 criminal liability was irrelevant . On the contrary , it was necessary to take an urgent measure in respect of the child , in order to put an end to the illegal situation in which the applicants existed . It was not possible to lodge an appeal on points of law against this decision .", "CARDINAL . It appears from a memorandum dated CARDINAL DATE , sent by the youth court to ORG , that the child had not yet been declared available for adoption , since the proceedings with regard to the transcription of the child \u2019s birth certificate were pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG attached to ORG had ordered the interim attachment of the NORP birth certificate , on the ground that it was an essential piece of evidence . It appeared from the case file that not only had the applicants probably committed the offences with which they were charged , but that they had attempted to conceal them . Among other things , they had stated that they were the biological parents , and had corrected their versions of the events over time as those versions had been proved inaccurate .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against the interim attachment order .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeal . The decision indicates that there existed serious suspicions that the offences in question had been committed . In particular , the first applicant had put about a rumour that she was pregnant ; she had gone to the FAC and implied that she was the natural mother ; she had then admitted that the child had been born to a surrogate mother ; she had stated to the carabinieri on DATE that the second applicant was the biological father , although the DNA tests had disproved this , and had therefore made false statements ; she had been very vague as to the identity of the genetic mother ; the documents concerning the surrogate motherhood stated that the CARDINAL applicants had been seen by the NORP doctors , which did not accord with the fact that the second applicant had not been in GPE ; the documents about the birth did not have a precise date . All that was known was that the child had been born and that he had been handed over to the first applicant against payment of almost EUR CARDINAL . Accordingly , the hypothesis that the applicants had conducted themselves illegally with a view to having the particulars of the birth certificate entered in the register of births , marriages and deaths and to circumventing the NORP legislation appeared sound .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the decision regarding the interim attachment was transmitted to the youth court by ORG , since it had the following implications . The charges under section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL deprived the applicants of the possibility of fostering ( affido ) the child and of adopting him or other minors . There was therefore no other solution but to proceed with the adoption procedure for the child . The temporary placement with a foster family had been requested by virtue of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL . ORG repeated his request and emphasised that the child had been removed DATE previously , and that he had since been living in a children \u2019s home ( casa famiglia ) , where he had developed meaningful relationships with the persons responsible for looking after him . Thus , the child had not yet found a replacement family environment for the home that had been illegally provided by those who had brought him to GPE . He seemed destined for yet another separation , even more painful than that from the mother who had given birth to him and from the woman who was claiming to be his mother .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the file that the child was placed in a foster family on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , at the guardian \u2019s request , an expert examination was carried out to determine the child \u2019s age . It found that the child was probably DATE , with a margin of error of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In addition , at DATE the guardian asked the juvenile court to give the child a formal identity , so that he could be registered for school without difficulty . He stated that the child had been placed in a family on DATE , but that he did not have an official identity . This \u201c lack of existence \u201d had a significant impact on administrative matters : it was unclear under what name the child was to be registered for school , for vaccination records , or for residence . Admittedly , this situation corresponded to the aim of preventing the original family , that is , the applicants , from discovering the child \u2019s whereabouts , for his own protection . However , a temporary formal identity would enable the secrecy surrounding the child \u2019s real identity to be maintained , while simultaneously enabling him to have access to public services ; for the time being , he was entitled only to use emergency medical services .", "CARDINAL . By an immediately enforceable decision of DATE , ORG ruled in respect of the birth certificate and on whether an order should be made for it to be entered in the register of births , marriages and deaths ( within the meaning of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) no . CARDINAL ) . It dismissed the objection raised by the guardian to the effect that the applicants did not have standing before the court ; it acknowledged that the applicants had capacity to act in legal proceedings , in so far as they were indicated as the \u201c parents \u201d in the birth certificate that they wished to have transcribed . However , it was clear that the applicants were not the biological parents . There had not therefore been a gestational surrogacy , although the applicants had referred in their pleadings to heterologous artificial fertilisation ; the parties agreed that the NORP legislation presupposed a biological link between the child and CARDINAL of the potential parents before the term surrogate motherhood could be used . The birth certificate was therefore fraudulent ( ideologicamente falso ) . Further , given that there was nothing to show that the child had NORP citizenship , the ORG argument that NORP law was inapplicable ran counter to section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL , which stated that the legal parent - child relationship was determined by the national law governing the child at the time of his or her birth . In addition , it was contrary to public order to enter the particulars of the disputed birth certificate in the register of births , marriages and deaths , since it was fraudulent . The applicants had pleaded their good faith , alleging that they were unable to explain why the second applicant \u2019s seminal fluid had not been used in the NORP clinic ; however , this did not alter the situation , and did not rectify the fact that the second applicant was not the biological father . In conclusion , it was legitimate to refuse to enter the particulars of the NORP birth certificate in the register of births , marriages and deaths , and to grant ORG request that a new birth certificate be issued . The court therefore ordered that a new birth certificate be issued , indicating that the child was the son of persons unknown , born in GPE on DATE , and that he be given a new name ( determined within the meaning of ORG no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings relating to the child \u2019s adoption were resumed before ORG . The applicants confirmed their opposition to the child \u2019s placement with third persons . The guardian asked the court to rule that the applicants no longer had locus standi . ORG asked the court not to rule on its request to declare that the child was available for adoption using the child \u2019s original name , on the ground that , in the meantime , he had opened a second set of proceedings requesting that the child be declared available for adoption using his new identity as a child of unknown parents . On DATE , in the light of the material in the file , ORG held that the applicants no longer had capacity to act in the adoption proceedings brought by them , given that they were neither the child \u2019s parents nor members of his family , within the meaning of section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL . The court stated that it would decide on the question of the child \u2019s adoption in the context of the other adoption proceedings , referred to by ORG ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
