NORP In or before DATE criminal proceedings were instituted in GPE against named individuals ( not including the applicants ) who were charged , inter alia , of conspiracy , money laundering , abuse of a position of influence in financial trading , embezzlement , tax evasion and fraud . In particular it was suspected that Mr ORG organised , financed and managed , directly or indirectly a network of companies situated in various states ( GPE GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ( ORG ) and GPE ) which were all traceable to CARDINAL source namely , ORG ( hereinafter \u201c NORP \u201d ) . According to the applicants , Mr ORG owned ORG \u2019s entire capital stock which was instrumental to the accomplishment of a series of investment and fiduciary operations ( operazioni fiduciarie ) the aim of which was to allow a number of NORP clients to launder money coming from illicit sources ( by impeding the identification of the real source of the money entrusted to it by means of a double system of fiduciary mandates ( mandati fiduciari ) ) . The group of co - accused were suspected of having , through such network , abusively supplied investment services contrary to the legal requirements as provided in the relevant NORP law ( ORG ) and of having abusively carried out financial activities without being in possession of the necessary economic and financial requisites and the relevant registration as required by NORP law ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In the context of these proceedings , by means of a letter rogatory received by the GPE judicial authorities on CARDINAL DATE , ORG office ( of ORG ) asked the GPE authorities for assistance in obtaining documentation and carrying out searches in various banks , fiduciary institutes and trust companies ( banche , fiduciare e societa\u2019 trust ) in GPE , in accordance with LAW between GPE and GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( hereinafter also referred to as the exequatur decision ) , the ordinary first - instance tribunal ( PERSON , hereinafter the PERSON ) , accepted the request in conjunction with the crimes of conspiracy , money laundering , aggravated fraud and embezzlement with the aim of fraud , considering that the relevant requirements for the execution of the request were fulfilled . In particular the PERSON considered that those crimes were also punishable under GPE law . It therefore ordered , inter alia , an investigation in respect of all banks , fiduciary institutes and trust companies in GPE . The purpose was to acquire information and banking documents ( inter alia , copies of statements showing transactions and movements , cheques , fiduciary dispositions ( disposizioni fiduciarie ) and emails ) related to a number of named current accounts in specified institutes as well as any other current account which could be traced back ( riferibile ) to ORG , held by all banks and fiduciary institutes in GPE , which were directly or indirectly involved with the company or physical persons mentioned in this decision . In reaching that decision the PERSON bore in mind the relevant articles of LAW between GPE and GPE of DATE , law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG , and GPE commitment to international organs such as ORG and ORG ( ORG ) as well as LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which provides that banking secrecy can not be held against the criminal justice authorities and LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL according to which the act of acquiring copies of documentation amounts to seizure .", "It gave further details as to the search and seizure operation , inter alia , that copies should be made of the documentation , that in the event that the investigation was successful the directors of the credit institute were to submit the relevant documents within DATE to the ORG for financial investigations , who in turn would immediately transfer it , indicating the names of those involved ( directly or indirectly ) , to enable notification . It further ordered that where data was held on electronic storage devices ( supporti informatici ) , the collection of data from these devices should be supervised by appointed experts ; and that clone copies were to be made of these storage devices , as well as back - up copies . Any means of information technology seized had to be sealed and kept in custody in appropriate places , and the removal of such seals had to be notified to the interested persons to enable them ( or their lawyers ) to be present . It ordered the judicial police to serve the decision upon the directors of all the banks and trust companies , to the legal representatives of the physical persons , to the directly interested persons , and to persons who were in possession , under whatever title , of the those places . It also warned that documentation obtained and forwarded could not to be used for purposes other than those linked to the criminal proceedings mentioned in the decree accepting the request made in the letter rogatory , unless the court decided otherwise following a further assessment .", "CARDINAL . By a note of DATE the PERSON ordered that NORP citizens who had entered into fiduciary agreements ( aperto posizioni fiduciarie ) with NORP ( CARDINAL in all ) should be notified of the decision . It was noted that any information referring to the said citizens and transmitted to the judicial authority of the requesting state could not be used for the purposes other than the prosecution of the criminal offences mentioned in the exequatur decision ( non potra essere utilizzata per fini diversi dal perseguimento degli illeciti penali di cui alle norme di legge indicate nel provvedimento di amissione della rogatoria ) , unless the court decided otherwise following a new assessment .", "CARDINAL . Following the investigation and implementation of the exequatur decision , in consequence of the last - mentioned order of the PERSON , the applicants were served with the relevant notification ( ORG on CARDINAL DATE , GPE on DATE and ORG and ORG DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicants lodged a complaint ( Article CARDINAL of law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) before the judge of criminal appeals ( Giudice delle PERSON ) against the PERSON \u2019s decision concerning the seizure of documents related to them on the basis that they were not persons charged with the criminal offences at issue . They alleged a violation of the principles contained in LOC on NORP and Fundamental Principles ( hereinafter \u201c the declaration \u201d ) . In particular they contended that the principle that crimes had to be punishable under the law of the requested state had not been respected , that there had been a violation of both NORP and GPE law , and they noted the absence of the fumus delicti and of any link between the crimes at issue and the position of the applicants . Moreover , given that many such complaints by persons in similar situations had already been declared inadmissible by the domestic courts for lack of standing - them not being the persons charged and therefore not the direct victims of the seizure - the applicants further complained that LAW ) of law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was not compatible with the principles laid down in the LAW , in so far as it had been interpreted as not protecting or recognising the right to lodge a complaint by anyone who was subject to coercive measures of seizure of documents ( related to their interests ) as a result of an exequatur decision .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of CARDINAL DATE in respect of GPE , C.R. and ORG , and of DATE in respect of ORG , the judge of criminal appeals declared the complaints inadmissible . The court noted that the applicants had been served with a notice of the exequatur order and had exhausted pleas available in law in that respect ( hanno esperito le impugnazioni previste dalla legge ) . It further noted that an exequatur decision may only be challenged by a person who is involved in the investigation being carried out by the requested authority , or by a third party who is not investigated but who has been subjected to the measure . A person , who , in consequence of the investigation , is involved in any way with the activity undertaken , may not be considered as an interested person since any breach of the rights or interests of such persons , resulting from the execution of the exequatur decision , must be raised in the ambit of the NORP jurisdictions . The court considered that as established by domestic case - law it was only after the finding of admissibility of the application that a judge had to set a time - limit for submissions . For the purposes of admissibility one had to verify , amongst other things , the juridical interest of the appellant . Moreover , any constitutional complaints could give rise to an assessment of such question by the competent court ( PERSON ) , following a referral , only if the original proceedings were properly instituted , and not where , because of a lack of juridical interest of the appellant , the application was inadmissible . In the present case the appellants were not interested parties in relation to the exequatur decision , but may only have an eventual interest in the effects of such execution , and thus they did not have juridical interest to challenge the said decision .", "CARDINAL . In relation to the complaint of incompatibility with the LAW , the court of criminal appeals only pronounced itself on the request made by ORG : on DATE it declared the complaint inadmissible as on that date no proceedings appeared to be pending .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to the third instance criminal judge ( Terza Istanza Penale ) reiterating their complaints and invoking LAW . In particular they noted that the PERSON \u2019s exequatur decision had ordered the seizure of documents related to them , despite them not being linked to any of the activities mentioned in that decision or them having ever had relations with the NORP companies . Moreover , the seized documents were irrelevant for the purposes of ascertaining the existence of the crimes attributed to the accused , thus , the only purpose behind the seizure was to name the NORP who had had dealings with NORP irrespective of any involvement they had had with the facts object of the letter rogatory . They further challenged the appeal decisions in so far as they were issued in breach of the rights of the defence , in particular as they were not allowed to present submissions as provided for in law , neither in respect of the challenge nor in respect of the constitutional complaint . Furthermore , the decisions had lacked reasons and made no reference to the actual position of the applicants and a lack of reasoning in respect of the rejection of the constitutional complaint was particularly detrimental as it did not allow a proper examination of the matter by the third - instance judge .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of CARDINAL DATE filed in the registry on DATE and served on DATE in respect of PERSON and GPE , and of CARDINAL DATE filed in the registry on DATE and served on DATE in respect of ORG , the third - instance criminal judge confirmed the appeal decision in that the appellants lacked juridical interest . In consequence the appeal was inadmissible and in any event there appeared to be no violation of law tainting the impugned decision . The question of constitutional legitimacy of law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL was also rejected on the same ground as that put forward by the appeal court .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicants ( except for ORG ) had lodged an objection requesting the revocation of the exequatur decision in their respect , on the basis that the documents related to them were of no relevance to the investigation .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE , served on their lawyer on an unspecified date , the PERSON held that the objection was to be discontinued ( non luogo a procedere ) in view of the findings of the third - instance criminal judge . The PERSON noted that the authorities were not limited to carrying out the actions requested by the letters rogatory only in respect of persons formally charged , but could also extend such acts to third persons who were not so charged .", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged a further objection requesting the PERSON to restrict the use of the seized documents . By decisions filed in the relevant registry on DATE the PERSON held that its exequatur decision of CARDINAL DATE had already applied such a limitation , indeed that decision had clearly stated that such documentation was not to be used for purposes other than those linked to the criminal proceedings mentioned in the letters rogatory , unless the court decided otherwise following a further assessment ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
