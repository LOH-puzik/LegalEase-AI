She was represented before the ORG by Mr J .- L. Chalanset , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their agent , PERSON , Director of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The \u201c PERSON \u201d trial , so named after CARDINAL of the main defendants , PERSON , who was represented by the applicant , took place from DATE . In that case CARDINAL people , mainly of NORP origin , had been arrested in so - called \u201c NORP \u201d circles . Eventually , CARDINAL people , including PERSON , were committed for trial in ORG on charges of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism . The trial was held in a gymnasium at FAC , which was transformed into a courtroom for the occasion .", "The organisation of the trial triggered strong protests , from the GPE , inter alia , against \u201c the organisation of a mass trial apparently incompatible with respect for the rights of the defence \u201d . Many lawyers decided to withdraw from the trial altogether .", "On DATE , on her client \u2019s behalf , the applicant issued a press release , part of which was reproduced by the ORG news agency in a report .", "The press release read as follows :", "\u201c For PERSON", "Through what is happening in the new law court at FAC , the public are finally beginning to realise the infamy of the procedures used by the special sections of the NORP justice system under the pretext of fighting terrorism .", "Purely for the media and for political and demagogic reasons , many people have been branded terrorists whose political opinions differ from those of the powers that be .", "But above and beyond what some people are learning in the final , public phase of the court hearings , the public must be told what goes on in secret behind the scenes of the political police and the special judges of the CARDINALth section , whose motto \u2013 \u201c NORP the terrorists \u201d \u2013 was coined by PERSON . At the same time , he declared \u201c I will cover up any blunders \u201d .", "The hunt was on and the so - called war on terror had a free hand to use terrorist measures against targets designated by those in power , for their own political interests or those of their foreign allies .", "Police raids , for example , using methods worthy of the Gestapo and the ORG , at TIME , against whole families , including children , even planting incriminating evidence on them ( like the documents the ORG slipped into ORG \u2019s briefcase ) .", "Not to mention brutality and torture during DATE of police custody , under the supervision of judges from the special section .", "Or holding people in complete solitary confinement , for DATE or DATE at a time , without any concrete charges against them other than being \u201c capable of ... \u201d , practically without any court hearing , much less any confrontation with their accusers , who in GPE remain anonymous , and the courts consider that normal !", "And the trials themselves , a pure formality : the outcome is a foregone conclusion as the so - called terrorists are obviously a threat to public order ; the volume of the case files shows how serious the accusations are , even if they contain nothing but charges fabricated by the investigating judges of the special section , in the form of questions designed to prompt replies that suit their theories .", "In the face of such NORP feeling , people with NORP blood naturally take pride of place among the obvious targets , with the aggravating circumstance that they belong to the NORP faith and are therefore presumed guilty of the offence of holding terrorist religious opinions .", "PERSON , a mujahid , believes only in the Tawhid , but he is entitled to demand justice , like the other victims of police and judicial terrorism .", "Mr PERSON , a founding member and former chief of the CARDINALth special section , considers the groundswell of revolt against the terrorist methods used by his teams as \u201c an insult to justice in our country \u201d .", "CARDINAL insult , the practices and the manipulation of the media by the special anti - terrorist sections of the police are a crime against public and individual freedoms .", "It is high time GPE put a stop to this infamy .", "GPE , DATE Isabelle Coutant Peyre", "Barrister", "for PERSON \u201d", "On DATE the Minister of the ORG , considering some of these remarks defamatory vis - \u00e0 - vis the national police , lodged a complaint with the GPE public prosecutor for public defamation of a public authority , relying on LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the Freedom of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the DATE Act \u201d ) .", "The applicant alleged that as she , the accused , was a lawyer , and having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the trial in question , the courts should be broad in their interpretation of the immunity provided for in section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW and allow her the benefit of it . She also argued that because of her profession it was her duty to denounce practices incompatible with the LAW and , that being so , that her press release had been issued in the context of the type of political debate and discussion of ideas accepted in the ORG \u2019s case - law .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG decided that the offending statements were not covered by the immunity provided for in CARDINAL of the DATE Act and , stressing the defamatory nature of the applicant \u2019s remarks vis - \u00e0 - vis the national police , found her guilty of public defamation of a public authority , an offence provided for in and punishable under sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of that Act . The applicant was fined MONEY ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) and ordered to pay the token sum of MONEY to ORG . The court also ordered the publication , in CARDINAL newspapers of the civil party \u2019s choice , of a statement announcing the applicant \u2019s conviction . The court \u2019s findings read as follows :", "\u201c It is precisely because it is the lawyer \u2019s duty , in exercising the rights of the defence , to denounce facts or a system in conflict with human rights publicly and forcefully , and because his function makes him particularly credible in the eyes of his fellow citizens , that a lawyer can not afford , without proof or reservations , to voice extremely serious specific accusations against an administrative body \u2013 the National Police \u2013 essential to the democratic edifice , CARDINAL of whose tasks is to protect people against terrorist activities ;", "In the instant case , however , [ the applicant ] did not confine herself to a general criticism of the judicial and police institutions or even the functioning of the fight against terrorism , but in a specific set of proceedings , made extreme accusations against the police of allegedly odious and inhuman practices , without being able to produce a shred of evidence ; that being so , her plea of good faith can not be accepted and the offence with which she stands charged is established ... \u201d", "The applicant appealed . In support of her appeal she relied , inter alia , on the legitimacy of the debate on the means used in the \u201c fight against terrorism \u201d , her duty as a lawyer \u201c to speak out \u201d and the principle of freedom of expression enshrined in LAW .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the judgment concerning the applicant \u2019s guilt but reduced the fine to ORG CARDINAL ( about ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The court declared , inter alia :", "\u201c Considering that denouncing the conditions of organisation of the trial of her client , PERSON , and others , and criticising the proceedings as a whole constituted a manifestly legitimate aim for [ the applicant ] , a lawyer ; she could perfectly well have fully attained that aim by developing arguments , even laced with harsh criticisms , without having to draw inconsiderate , insulting parallels ;", "Considering that in making extremely serious and ignominious accusations , in a particularly offensive manner , against the police responsible for fighting terrorism , in making the worst kind of comparisons to stir up indignation , in deliberately casting aspersions on a whole body of public servants , [ the applicant ] deliberately expressed herself in partial and vindictive terms , without the slightest caution or moderation ; she can not be accorded the benefit of good faith . \u201d", "The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law . In her pleadings she relied on LAW , alleging , inter alia , that the impugned conviction had violated her freedom of expression .", "In a judgment delivered on DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . With regard to the applicant \u2019s first submission , invoking the immunity provided for in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , it held that \u201c as the impugned press release can not be considered as a written document adduced before a court , ORG applied the PERSON correctly \u201d . Concerning her second submission , it declared :", "\u201c Given that , in rejecting the defence submission based on the provisions of the LAW and denying the lawyer the benefit of good faith , the judges stated that while denouncing the conditions of organisation of the trial concerning her client and criticising the proceedings as a whole constituted a legitimate aim for [ the applicant ] , she could also have developed arguments , even laced with harsh criticisms , without having to draw inconsiderate , insulting parallels ; that the same judges considered that in making extremely serious and ignominious accusations against the police responsible for fighting terrorism , and making comparisons with the NORP and ORG regime the lawyer deliberately expressed herself \u201c in partial and vindictive terms \u201d , without the slightest caution or moderation , casting aspersions on the whole police force ;", "Given that in the light of those considerations ORG justified its decision ;", "First of all , when a lawyer does not have the benefit of the immunity provided for in section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE , he is not absolved , when expressing himself on his client \u2019s behalf , of the caution and circumspection necessary to the acceptance of the defence of good faith ;", "And secondly , while freedom of expression is protected by LAW , it may , by virtue of the second paragraph of LAW , be subject to restrictions and penalties in the cases determined by LAW of DATE ; that is the purpose of LAW , which provides for a penalty necessary in a NORP society for the prevention of disorder and the protection of the reputation of the public authorities , in this case the national police ; \u201d .", "The relevant provisions of the Freedom of LAW of DATE , as amended , in force at the material time , read as follows :", "\u201c It shall be defamatory to make any statement or allegation of a fact that damages the honour or reputation of the person or body of whom the fact is alleged .
