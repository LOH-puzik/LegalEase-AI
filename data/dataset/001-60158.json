On CARDINAL DATE ORG acquitted the applicant on the count of obtaining property by deception under LAW . In connection with the charge under LAW the court held : \u201c the charge of abuse of office can not be sustained ... . However , [ the applicant ] , being a ORG official , improperly performed his functions because of negligence \u201d in that he had failed to ensure proper investigation and control of the smuggling case .
