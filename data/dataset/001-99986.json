They were represented by Dr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Dr PERSON , Attorney General .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants are owners of undeveloped plots of land situated both inside and outside the perimeter of land earmarked for ORG .", "The applicants ' land is subject to a declaration by the Governor General dated CARDINAL DATE , stating that such land will be expropriated for a public purpose .", "On DATE the amount offered in compensation by the ORG was deposited in court by means of a schedule of deposit . On DATE the applicants contested the amount before ORG . These proceedings are still pending .", "At the date of the introduction of the application , the property belonging to the applicants , situated outside the perimeter of the GPE , had not been taken possession of and included within the perimeter of the GPE Project ; neither had the procedures to conclude the transfer of property to ORG been finalised and nor had any compensation been paid .", "Adjoining the applicants ' property is land belonging to PERSON , which was subject to a similar declaration dated DATE and made in the same factual circumstances . On DATE ORG of GPE found that the Governor 's declaration had breached PERSON right to enjoyment of property . It held that whenever the process by which an individual was divested of his property had not been concluded , and therefore the interference remained CARDINAL of control of use , the ORG had to release the property to its rightful owners as soon as it transpired that the grounds on which the ORG had originally , validly and justifiably taken the measure restricting the owner 's use no longer existed . According to the applicants , the judgment of ORG further established the standard of proof required in such cases for determining whether there still existed a public interest ground for the taking , namely , i ) the competent authorities ' active consideration for DATE to release the property in question because it was not needed for the purposes for which it had originally been expropriated , and ii ) the lapse of DATE between the date of the declaration and the date when the constitutional case was brought .", "In the light of the judgment in PERSON case , the applicants instituted constitutional proceedings in DATE before ORG ( FAC ) claiming a breach of LAW in respect of their property . In particular , they claimed that no public interest ground subsisted since the authorities had not made use of the said land in DATE . They maintained that they had a legitimate expectation that the same law and criteria used in the C. case would be applied to them . They complained moreover that the authorities had breached the reasonable time requirement under LAW in that the proceedings for the payment of compensation had not yet been concluded , DATE after the date of the declaration .", "During the proceedings , the Commissioner of LOC declared under oath that CARDINAL of the said plots were within GPE , CARDINAL other plots were partly in the zone and the third was outside it . The latter could thus be released . Moreover , he had requested the relevant department to release any of the plots which had not been used , but he had not received a reply . To his knowledge , no use was foreseen for these plots , but it was up to the relevant department to decide on that matter . He observed that no department had applied to use the plots in DATE since their taking . He further stated that all the plots were located within the extension area of the GPE . A representative of the GPE declared that CARDINAL of the plots had been excavated , and that the other CARDINAL were the subject of pending permits for the building of warehouses , applied for in DATE . Another witness presented a marketing brochure confirming that certain areas could not yet be built on and that there was a plan for the construction of warehouses in other areas .", "In the applicants ' view , the ORG had had no need of the land in question and had considered the possibility of releasing it . They further adduced proof of their argument that the ORG had not taken possession of their land ( in fact no structural works had been carried out ) , nor had the expropriation proceedings been concluded even though DATE had elapsed since the date of the Governor 's declaration .", "The ORG or the competent authorities did not submit any evidence regarding a change in jurisprudence subsequent to the PERSON case .", "On DATE ORG found against the applicants in respect of their complaint under LAW . It held that ORG was CARDINAL of great importance and was \u201c rationally related to a conceivable public purpose \u201d . It had been proved that the plots at issue were located in the area already being used for the GPE or in the extension area . When assessing the issue of fair balance , the public interest in the project outweighed the interests of private individuals . That there had only been a de facto expropriation for DATE did not detract in any way from the continuing relevance of the public interest grounds relied upon by the ORG . The future expansion of a project fell within the notion of the public interest and therefore the expropriation proceedings taken in relation to the applicants ' property were a matter of public interest . As to the yet unpaid compensation , the court did not examine the matter since the compensation proceedings were still pending before the ORG . The court , however , found a violation of LAW in that those proceedings had still not been concluded after DATE . It awarded the applicants MONEY ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "The applicants appealed . On DATE the ORG confirmed the authority of the C. case as a correct application of the law ; it dismissed , however , the applicants ' claims , confirming the existence of a public interest purpose for the expropriation of the applicants ' land .", "ORG held that the plots situated within the GPE perimeter had clearly been taken in the public interest even though the ORG had only started developing the land in DATE . However , it was reasonable to take a larger portion of land for a project and then make use of only a part of it in DATE , leaving the rest for further expansion . This was especially true of a project such as the GPE . Thus , the public interest persisted at the time of these proceedings . As to the plots outside the GPE , it acknowledged that part of the applicants ' land had remained unused ; however , that land might be required if ORG were to be expanded ( as appeared to be the case in view of the building of warehouses ) . Indeed , the Government , in DATE , had started to expropriate other lands in the area . It followed that on the evidence as presented , the public interest requirement in respect of those plots also persisted at the time of these proceedings .", "It upheld the first - instance judgment in respect of LAW .", "By a deed of DATE , at the time when the proceedings before this Court were pending , the Government sold back to the applicants the CARDINAL plots of land situated outside the perimeter of the GPE ( excluding a part which had been used to build a road ) , these plots being the subject matter of the LAW proceedings . The sale was carried out in accordance with Government policy . According to that policy , where land had been acquired by the ORG but was no longer needed for a public purpose , it could be returned to the original owners for a price or any other amount originally agreed , with interest of PERCENT per year being paid from DATE of the taking to the date of release . By means of the above - mentioned deed , the applicant buyers undertook to withdraw any pending proceedings and declared that they had no further claims against the Government in respect of the plots of land which they were buying back .", "CARDINAL . NORP In PERSON case ( PERSON vs PERSON u l - Kummissarju ta l - Artijiet , Rikors Nru DATE , DATE ) ORG held , after giving an overview of the applicable principles under LAW to the LAW , that whenever the process by which an individual was divested of his property had not yet been concluded , the interference remained CARDINAL of control of use . The ORG had the obligation to release the property to its rightful owners as soon as it transpired that the grounds on which the ORG had originally , validly and justifiably taken the measure restricting the owner 's use no longer existed . It was for the Government to prove that both at the time of the Governor 's declaration and throughout the proceedings until the time of transfer of the property concluding the expropriation there existed a public interest for the taking of the property .", "CARDINAL . It resulted from the evidence that , in respect of PERSON plots of land which were outside the GPE zone , the competent authorities had for DATE actively considered releasing the property to its rightful owners as it was no longer necessary for the purpose for which it had originally been taken . Moreover , DATE had passed since the date of the declaration . The absence of a public interest was thus apparent even if such an interest had been present at the time of the declaration . It had subsequently emerged that PERSON property would not be used in the public interest . The ORG should therefore have returned the said property to PERSON .. Their failure to comply with this latter obligation amounted to a breach of PERSON property rights under LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
