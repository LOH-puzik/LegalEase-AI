The first applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently in detention in an FAC in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he entered the GPE clandestinely using false travel documents . On DATE he claimed asylum on the ground that as a member of the PERSON , a sub - clan of the minority ORG , he had been subjected to persecution by PERSON militia , who had killed his father and sister and seriously injured him . As a consequence , he had no surviving relatives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG refused the first applicant \u2019s asylum application , finding , inter alia , that the fact he had remained in GPE until DATE undermined his claim to be a member of a minority clan . On DATE he appealed against the refusal of the application on both asylum and human rights grounds , namely ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention . On DATE both the asylum appeal and the human rights appeal were dismissed by an Adjudicator who found that his account of what had happened to him in GPE was not credible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant pleaded guilty to CARDINAL offences of burglary , CARDINAL offences of dishonestly obtaining goods by deception and one offence of attempting to dishonestly obtain goods by deception . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE he was convicted , inter alia , of threats to kill and was sentenced to a further CARDINAL months\u2019 detention at ORG . He was later sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment following a conviction for indecent exposure in DATE and to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment following a conviction for CARDINAL counts of burglary and theft and CARDINAL counts of attempted burglary in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was served with a decision to make a deportation order , in which the Secretary of ORG noted the seriousness of his offences and the need to protect the public from serious crime and its effects . He also noted that he was DATE , in good health and single . Although he had been resident in GPE for DATE , he had spent his youth and DATE in GPE . In the circumstances , it would not be unreasonable to expect him to readjust to life there . The Secretary of ORG for ORG also considered LAW but concluded that the first applicant \u2019s deportation would not constitute a disproportionate interference with his right to respect for his family and private life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE his appeal against the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision was rejected by an Immigration Judge . On DATE a deportation order against the first applicant was signed and an application for judicial review of the deportation decision was refused in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG granted the first applicant interim measures under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to prevent his removal to GPE prior to the ORG \u2019s consideration of his application .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant , Mr ORG , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and is currently detained in an FAC .", "CARDINAL . He was born in PERSON , which is now the capital of the selfdeclared state of NORP . When he was DATE , his family moved to GPE and he never returned to the north of the country .", "CARDINAL . His father , a high - ranking officer in the army during the PERSON regime , was appointed to ORG in GPE as a military attach\u00e9 in DATE . The second applicant joined him in GPE on DATE and was given CARDINAL months\u2019 leave to enter . On DATE his father died . On DATE the second applicant made an application for asylum based on his father \u2019s position in the NORP army and the beginning of the civil war in GPE . On DATE he was recognised as a refugee and granted leave to remain until DATE . On DATE he was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was convicted of a road traffic offence in DATE . On DATE he was sentenced to a total of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment by a ORG for handling stolen goods , obtaining property by deception , robbery and possessing an imitation firearm while committing an offence . On DATE he was convicted of perverting the course of justice and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . In DATE he was convicted on further counts of theft and road traffic offences . On DATE he was convicted of theft by a ORG and placed on a curfew . On DATE he was again convicted of theft and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE he was convicted by a ORG on CARDINAL counts of supplying class A drugs ( cocaine and heroin ) and on DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On an unspecified date the second applicant was released on licence . On DATE he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment by a ORG for burglary and theft .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a decision was made to issue a deportation order by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Immigration Act DATE and the second applicant was invited to rebut the presumption that his continued presence in GPE constituted a danger to the community .", "CARDINAL . He accepted that he was a drug addict but submitted that he did not constitute a danger to the community because he had made efforts to overcome his addiction and had recognised his past wrongdoings . However , on DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG found that he had failed to demonstrate that he would not constitute such a danger . In respect of his rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW , the Secretary of ORG found that even though he had been living in GPE and could be identified as such he would not be at risk on return to GPE as he was a member of the ORG , a majority clan . In respect of his rights under LAW , the Secretary of ORG accepted that he had family ties with his CARDINAL sisters and his mother in GPE but did not consider that these relationships constituted family life for the purposes of LAW as there was no evidence of dependency going beyond the normal emotional ties . The Secretary of ORG therefore concluded that his removal would not violate Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL or DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant \u2019s appeal against the decision of the Secretary of ORG for ORG was refused by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which considered that he could obtain clan protection in any part of GPE as he was a member of a majority clan . Although the ORG accepted that he would not find support in relation to his drug dependency in GPE , it found that this did not suffice to rebut the presumption in favour of deportation . As to his DATE claim , the second applicant had not shown that family life existed amongst his adult siblings and , even if it did , he had not shown that his circumstances were \u201c truly exceptional so that his removal would violate his LAW . Finally , the ORG noted that the sale of drugs posed a danger to the community and there was a real likelihood of the second applicant reoffending .", "CARDINAL . A deportation order against the second applicant was signed on DATE and on DATE he was served with removal directions . On DATE he requested , and was granted , interim measures under Rule CARDINAL of ORG to prevent his removal before his application was considered by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant was convicted of possession of a Class A controlled drug with intent to supply and was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE he was again charged with possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply . A hearing has not yet taken place .", "CARDINAL . At the material time , following the refusal of an asylum application by the Secretary of ORG for ORG , an applicant had a right of appeal to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . Section CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE ( as inserted by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG , etc . ) Act CARDINAL ) provided that a party to an appeal to the ORG could apply for an order that the ORG reconsider its decision on appeal on the ground that it had made a material error of law .", "CARDINAL . Once the appeal process against the refusal of an asylum application had been exhausted , an applicant could continue to make further submissions to the Secretary of ORG for ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( ORG CARDINAL , as amended by ORG ) stated that :", "\u201c When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending , the decision maker will consider any further submissions and , if rejected , will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim . The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered . The submissions will only be significantly different if the content :", "( i ) had not already been considered ; and", "( ii ) taken together with the previously considered material , created a realistic prospect of success , notwithstanding its rejection . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Where a person was not granted leave to enter GPE , he or she could be subject to administrative removal pursuant to paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL of LAW DATE . Pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , the Secretary of ORG also had power to deport any person who was not a NORP citizen on the ground that his deportation would be \u201c conducive to the public good \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Council Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) has the objective , inter alia , of ensuring ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) Member GPE apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection ( recital CARDINAL of the preamble ) . In addition to regulating refugee status , it makes provision for granting subsidiary protection status . Article CARDINAL(e ) defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection status as someone who would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin . Serious harm is defined in article CARDINAL as consisting of : ( a ) death penalty or execution ; ( b ) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin ; or ( c ) serious and individual threat to a civilian \u2019s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State ) , when considering the case of PERSON and ORG v. ORG ( the Deputy Minister of ORG ) , lodged a reference for a preliminary ruling with ORG ( \u201c ECJ \u201d ) asking , inter alia , whether article PERSON ) of the Directive offered supplementary or other protection to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ECJ held that article CARDINAL(c ) protection went beyond that of LAW , which was covered by article CARDINAL(b ) of LAW . The ECJ summarised the criteria to be applied as follows :", "\u201c Article PERSON ) of the Directive , in conjunction with article CARDINAL(e ) of the Directive , must be interpreted as meaning that the existence of a serious and individual threat to the life or person of an applicant for subsidiary protection is not subject to the condition that that applicant adduce evidence that he is specifically targeted by reason of factors particular to his personal circumstances , and the existence of such a threat can exceptionally be considered to be established where the degree of indiscriminate violence characterising the armed conflict taking place ... reaches such a high level that substantial grounds are shown for believing that a civilian , returned to the relevant country or as the case may be , to the relevant region , would , solely on account of his presence on the territory of that country or region , face a real risk of being subject to that threat . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE ( GPE ) v Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ORG observed that the ECJ in ORG had not introduced an additional test of exceptionality , but had simply stressed that not every armed conflict or violent situation would attract the protection of article CARDINAL(c ) . A conflict or violent situation would only attract the protection of article CARDINAL(c ) where the level of violence was such that , without anything to render them a particular target , civilians faced real risks to their lives or personal safety .", "CARDINAL . More recently , in the case of ORG and Others ( Article PERSON ) ) GPE CG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , ORG ) did not consider it helpful to attempt to distinguish between a real risk of civilian deaths as a result of targeted attacks and a real risk as a result of incidental attacks . In the ORG \u2019s opinion , the nexus between the generalised armed conflict and the indiscriminate violence posing a real risk to life and person was met when the intensity of the conflict involved means of combat , whether permissible under the laws or not , that seriously endangered non - combatants as well as to result in such a general breakdown of law and order as to permit anarchy and criminality occasioning the serious harm referred to in the Directive .", "CARDINAL . It is a well - established principle that persons will generally not be in need of asylum or subsidiary protection if they could obtain protection by moving elsewhere in their own country . This principle is reflected both in article CARDINAL of the Qualification Directive and paragraph CARDINALO of ORG CARDINAL ( as amended ) , both of which provide that an applicant is not in need of international protection if there is a part of the country of origin where there is no well - founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm , and where the applicant can reasonably be expected to stay .", "CARDINAL . In the cases of GPE , GPE , PERSON and PERSON v Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG DATE ( GPE ) v Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ORG held that the decision - maker , taking account of all relevant circumstances pertaining to the applicant and his country of origin , must decide whether it is reasonable to expect the applicant to relocate or whether it would be unduly harsh to expect him to do so . In this regard , the relevant comparison was between the conditions which prevailed in the place of relocation and those which prevailed elsewhere in the country of his nationality , including in his former place of habitual residence . If the applicant could live a relatively normal life in the place of relocation , judged by the standards which prevailed in his country of nationality generally , and if he could reach the less hostile part without undue hardship or undue difficulty , it would not be unreasonable to expect him to move there . However , the more closely the persecution was linked to the ORG , and the greater the control of the ORG over those acting or purporting to act on its behalf , the more likely ( other things being equal ) that a victim of persecution in CARDINAL place would be similarly vulnerable in another place within the same ORG .", "CARDINAL . The factual background to the conflict in GPE , as described in the country reports at paragraphs CARDINAL \u2013 CARDINAL below and subsequently agreed by the parties , is as follows .", "CARDINAL . GPE is comprised of CARDINAL autonomous areas : the self - declared Republic of NORP in the north west , the state of GPE in the north east , and the remaining southern and central regions . NORP society has traditionally been characterised by membership of clan families , which are subdivided into clans and sub - clans . The CARDINAL majority clans are ORG , GPE and GPE . In addition there are a number of minority groups , which are also divided into sub - groups . The FAC and PERSON take an intermediate position between the majority clans and the minority groups .", "CARDINAL . GPE has been without a functioning central government since the overthrow of President PERSON by opposing clans in DATE . The clans could not agree on a replacement and lawlessness , civil conflict and clan warfare followed . GPE was fragmented into rival , clan - based factions and control of the city was divided among warlords . ORG was established in DATE but a combination of internal divisions within ORG and insecurity in central and southern GPE hindered it from becoming a functioning Government . In DATE ORG , a union of various LAW courts , took control of GPE . Following a period of fighting against a coalition of warlords called ORG and ORG , ORG took control of most of central and southern GPE . ORG Resolution DATE ( DATE ) authorised the deployment of ORG force to protect ORG . NORP ground and air forces also moved into GPE to support ORG and by DATE ORG had been ousted from GPE and much of southern GPE . Remnants of ORG withdrew to the southern reaches of the Lower Juba region where they continued to fight against ORG and NORP troops .", "CARDINAL . After DATE of ORG , the semblance of order and security that it had created in GPE deteriorated . Roadblocks and checkpoints returned , as did banditry and violence . Furthermore , attacks by anti - government elements on ORG and NORP forces continued in GPE , with civilians frequently caught up in the fighting . Homes and public infrastructure were destroyed and a significant part of the civilian population was displaced . The fall of ORG also bought to the fore some of the inter- and intra - clan rivalries that had been suppressed during the conflict and serious clan related fighting ensued .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG for ORG was created when NORP and opposition leaders joined forces to fight ORG and NORP forces .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and the opposition Alliance for ORG signed a ceasefire agreement in GPE . At the same time , ORG extended the mandate of the ORG peacekeeping mission in GPE . However , the NORP insurgents at the heart of the escalation in violence were not party to the ceasefire agreement , and instead indicated that they would continue to fight until NORP forces withdrew from GPE .", "CARDINAL . By DATE NORP insurgents , including a group called ORG , had regained control of most of southern GPE .", "CARDINAL . GPE \u2019s ORG met in GPE in DATE and swore in CARDINAL new members from the ORG for ORG . The ORG also extended the mandate of ORG for DATE and installed moderate NORP Sheikh PERSON as the new President .", "CARDINAL . GPE pulled its troops out of GPE in DATE . Soon after , ORG took control of GPE , formerly a key stronghold of ORG . In DATE NORP insurgents launched an attack on GPE , prompting President PERSON to appeal for help from abroad .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG consolidated its position as the most powerful insurgent group by driving its main rival , PERSON , out of the southern port city of GPE . Since then it has openly declared its alliance with ORG and has been steadily moving forces up towards GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON and ORG merged .", "CARDINAL . ORG is recognised by ORG and almost all key foreign powers as the legitimate government of GPE . However , it currently controls only a small section of GPE centred on the port , the airport and the presidential palace . It is largely dependent on ORG troops for its survival .", "CARDINAL . AMISOM is an ORG force authorised by ORG and deployed to GPE to support ORG . It currently consists of CARDINAL GPE and NORP troops .", "CARDINAL . NORP forces joined the conflict in DATE to help drive out ORG . They remained in GPE until their withdrawal at DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG began as part of the armed wing of ORG . When the DATE NORP military intervention sent the leaders of ORG into exile , a hard core of ORG fighters remained in GPE to fight . In their DATE report , \u201c Harsh War , Harsh Peace \u201d , ORG indicated that ORG was an alliance of factions rather than a single entity , but the group \u2019s diverse leaders had a common agenda : defeating ORG and ORG and extending LAW law across GPE . Some of its leaders have links with ORG although the extent of ORG influence over ORG remains unclear .", "CARDINAL . ORG has emerged as the most powerful and effective armed faction on the ground , especially in southern GPE . They have received material support from the NORP government , which is eager to undercut GPE \u2019s interests in the region . By DATE ORG controlled more territory than any other faction in GPE , including GPE , the former seat of ORG parliament , PERSON , which had been one of ORG President \u2019s most reliable strongholds , and the strategic port of GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG claimed responsibility for twin suicide bombings in the GPE capital GPE on DATE , which killed CARDINAL people watching the World Cup soccer final on television . It was PERSON first attack outside GPE and heightened concerns about its ability to carry out more attacks in the region and beyond .", "CARDINAL . Hizbul ORG is another armed group which has both a LAW agenda and the goal of driving LAW and ORG from GPE . In DATE it entered into an alliance with ORG but the alliance came to an end in DATE during the fight for PERSON . In DATE , however , it once again merged with ORG .", "CARDINAL . Ahlu Sunna PERSON is an NORP group which professes to support a more moderate agenda . The group exists primarily in central GPE , where it has maintained control over large strips of territory , predominantly in GPE and GPE regions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Ahlu Sunna PERSON signed a power - sharing and military unification pact with ORG , although at times relations between the CARDINAL groups were strained .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and others ( Lone women \u2013 PERSON ) GPE CG [ DATE ] PERSON DATE the ORG found that conditions in southern GPE and particularly in and around GPE were such that both men and women from minority clans were in danger of LAW ill - treatment and should be regarded as refugees in the absence of evidence of a clan or personal patron which could protect them . Men and women from majority clans were not likely to be in need of international protection , although individual circumstances required separate consideration . Although women were at greater risk than men , they would not be able to show that , simply as lone female returnees from GPE , they had no place of clan safety . Finally , the ORG held that the general conditions of life or circumstances in GPE did not engage the obligations of LAW or engage LAW for all female returnees . A differential impact had to be shown . Being a single woman was not of itself a sufficient differentiator .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observed in passing that , on the strength of the background evidence and the expert evidence given at the hearing , it would consider that any person at real risk on return of being compelled to live in an ORG camp would have little difficulty in making out a claim under LAW , if not under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP In HH & others ( GPE : armed conflict : risk ) ORG [ DATE ] PERSON CARDINAL ORG held that for the purposes of article CARDINAL(c ) of the Qualification Directive , a situation of internal armed conflict existed in GPE . The ORG held , however , that while all sides to the conflict had acted from time to time in such a way as to cause harm to civilians , they were not in general engaging in indiscriminate violence and , as a consequence , a person would not be at real risk of serious harm by reason only of his or her presence in that zone or area .", "CARDINAL . The ORG found that although clan support networks were strained , they had not yet collapsed . Majority clans continued to have arms , even though their militias no longer controlled the city . A person from a majority clan , or whose background disclosed a significant degree of assimilation with , or acceptance by , a majority clan would in general be able to rely on that clan for support and assistance , including at times of displacement . A member of a minority clan or group who had no identifiable home area where majority clan support could be found would in general be at real risk of serious harm of being targeted by criminal elements , both in any area of former residence and in the likely event of being displaced . Members of minority groups found it harder to flee and move around to escape fighting , because they were not so easily accepted in new surroundings . The ORG found that persons displaced from their home in GPE without being able to find a place elsewhere with clan members or friends would likely have to spend a significant period of time in a makeshift shelter , such as those along the road to GPE , or in an ORG camp , and could well experience treatment proscribed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the ORG held that the issue of whether a person from a minority clan would be able to find majority clan support would often need specific and detailed consideration . The evidence suggested that certain minority groups could be accepted by the majority clan of the area in question , so as to call on protection from that clan . On the current evidence , it might not be appropriate to assume that a finding of minority group status in southern GPE was in itself sufficient to entitle a person to international protection , particularly where a person \u2019s credibility was otherwise lacking .", "CARDINAL . In its most recent NORP Country Guidance determination , ORG found that since its decision in HH there had been a number of significant changes in GPE .", "CARDINAL . First , the ORG found that by DATE the armed conflict had spread beyond GPE and its environs . The ORG therefore found that a situation of internal armed conflict existed throughout central and southern GPE . In respect of the intensity of the violence , the ORG noted that \u201c manifestly all significant armed parties to the conflict have engaged in indiscriminate attacks \u201d . In particular , it noted that the NORP were reported to have used means of war ( firing inherently indiscriminate NORP rockets in urban areas ) and methods of warfare ( using mortars and indirect weapons without guidance in urban areas ) that violated LAW . The FAC were reported to have engaged in aggression against civilians and to have acted \u201c as if they believe that they are immune from accountability , investigation or prosecution , including for crimes under international law \u201d . Moreover , reports indicated that insurgents had perpetrated raids , robberies and other abuses against civilians , including rape and other forms of sexual violence . The ORG referred to information received from ORG ( \u201c IASC \u201d ) which expressed concerns about :", "\u201c indiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas ; indiscriminate use of roadside bombs and mortars from and in civilian areas ; indiscriminate shooting in response to roadside bombs ; arbitrary arrest and detention of civilians , including children ; forced evictions ; forced recruitment , including of children ; sexual and gender based violence ; intimidation and assassination of journalists , aid workers and civilian officials ; and extra - judicial killings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG also noted that the worsening security situation was coupled with a deteriorating humanitarian situation . It observed that CARDINAL people had been displaced from GPE and that there had been significant displacements from other towns to which armed clashes had spread . The ORG also observed first , that IDPs experienced serious problems while on the move , which included checkpoints , threats , intimidation , looting , rape , abduction and harassment ; secondly , that many did not end up in camps or makeshift settlements and consequently struggled to obtain shelter , food , water and sanitation ; and thirdly , that the effect of displacement appeared to reduce the ability of IDPs to count on protection from their own clan : even where they fled to a traditional area for their clan , the pressures of numbers and scarce resources could mean that newcomers were not supported or absorbed by the local community .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the situation in GPE , the ORG considered that :", "\u201c the movements of population out of GPE in DATE have been unprecedented . ORG sources have estimated ( at various times ) that CARDINAL , up to CARDINAL ( or CARDINAL ) , of the population of GPE have been displaced . An DATE ORG report states that CARDINAL of GPE has been turned into an urban battleground . Since DATE there have been significantly fewer returns . Whatever the precise figures , it is clear that the ongoing violence has forced substantial numbers to flee the city more than once and flight seems an ongoing process : the ORG report of DATE cites PERSON estimates that CARDINAL people recently fled their homes due to the fighting and shelling ( GPE , A CARDINAL ) . The FAC Reply dated DATE states that : \u201c [ a]ccording to the ORG CARDINAL people were displaced from the city during DATE and CARDINAL since DATE CARDINAL \u201d . Armed clashes have increasingly destroyed housing , market areas ( LOC market has been deliberately shelled ) and infrastructure and the recent closure of the airport is likely to make matters in GPE worse . According to ORG , the aid community has been largely ineffective in providing the necessary aid to those who have stayed in GPE ( GPE evidence CARDINAL ) . They also state that GPE is a \u201c ghost town \u201d and that only the most vulnerable remain there . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It concluded that since HH the situation in GPE had changed significantly , both in terms of the extent of population displacement away from the city , the intensity of the fighting and the security conditions there . On the available evidence the ORG considered that GPE was no longer safe as a place to live for the great majority of its citizens . It did not rule out that there might be certain individuals who on the facts might be considered to be able to live safely in the city , for example if they had close connections with powerful actors in GPE , such as prominent businessmen or senior figures in the insurgency or in powerful criminal gangs . However , barring cases of this kind , in the case of persons found to come from GPE who were returnees from GPE , the ORG found that they would face on return a real risk of persecution or serious harm and it was reasonably likely , if they tried staying there , that they would soon be forced to leave or that they would decide not to try to live there in the first place .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the ORG were not persuaded that the situation in central and southern GPE had reached the threshold where civilians per se or NORP civilian IDPs per se could be said to face a real risk of persecution , serious harm or treatment proscribed by LAW . First , although the levels of violence had increased in intensity , the numbers of those killed and wounded was not of great magnitude . Secondly , while the humanitarian situation was dire , it did not appear that civilians per se faced a real risk of denial of basic food and shelter and other bare necessities of life . Thirdly , while there was evidence of attacks on IDPs , in view of the huge numbers of people displaced ( CARDINAL according to some reports ) , it appeared that the great majority of IDPs were able to travel and subsist in ORG camps or settlements without serious setbacks .", "DATE . Rather , the ORG assessment of the extent to which IDPs would face greater or lesser hardships , at least outside GPE , would vary depending on a number of factors . In particular , the ORG noted that IDPs from more influential clans appeared to have a better chance of being tolerated in the area to which they fled ; IDPs with a traditional clan area that they could travel to , especially if they had close relatives or close clan affiliations in that area , appeared to have better prospects of finding safety and support ( although not if the area concerned was already saturated with fellow IDPs ) ; those who lacked recent experience of living in GPE appeared more likely to have difficulty dealing with the changed environment in which clan loyalties had to some extent fractured ; persons returning to their home area from GPE could be perceived as having relative wealth and might be more susceptible to extortion , abduction and the like ; those who lived in areas not particularly affected by the fighting and which were not seen as strategically important to any of the main parties to the conflict would appear less subject to security problems ; women and girls faced the additional risks of rape , abduction and harassment ; the prevailing economic conditions in the area would also be relevant , bearing in mind GPE \u2019s history of droughts , poor harvests and rising food prices .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recognised that there had been a significant change in the clan - based character of NORP society since PERSON was promulgated . Clan protection was not as effective as it had been in DATE and conflicts over scarce resources had complicated the situation and made it unpredictable . This did not mean , however , that the clan or sub - clan had ceased to be the primary entity to which individuals turned for protection .", "CARDINAL . As regards internal relocation , whether those whose home area was GPE ( or indeed any other part of central and southern GPE ) would be able to relocate in safety and without undue hardship would depend on the evidence as to the general circumstances in the relevant parts of central and southern GPE and the personal circumstances of the applicant . Whether or not it was likely that relocation would mean that they had to live in an ORG camp would be an important but not necessarily a decisive factor .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considered the safety of en route travel from FAC , which was the point of return for anyone being removed to central and southern GPE . The ORG noted that :", "\u201c The airport is one of the facilities patrolled by ORG troops ( GPE , CARDINAL ) . According to GPE Humanitarian Overview , DATE , normally CARDINAL commercial flights arrive and depart on a DATE basis to and from the rest of GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . The FAC Reply of DATE notes that it is expected in DATE will leave via ORG to perform PERSON in GPE . At the time of HH , the airport was fully operational with flights arriving and departing regularly . However in DATE the situation has been unsettled . There were attacks of some kind in DATE and the downing of a plane by a missile in DATE ( GPE , CARDINAL ) . The airport was attacked by insurgents on DATE as the President \u2019s plane left for talks in GPE . On DATE a group identifying themselves as PERSON threatened to shut the airport down , although a counter - report from ORG said that the NORP forces did not intend to close it . It was closed on DATE . On DATE there were mortar attacks on it upon the arrival of an ORG military plane ( GPE , PERSON ) . A Press TV cutting dated DATE states that CARDINAL heavy mortars landed inside ORG injuring a number of soldiers . The assailants apparently targeted a plane trying to land . A ORG Reply dated DATE reports an ORG source as saying that on DATE a civilian plane carrying CARDINAL NORP deportees from GPE managed to land without incident . A CARDINAL DATE press report refers to several mortar attacks on the airport . We were told by the respondent at the outset of the hearing that removals to GPE were temporarily suspended because of travel documentation problems , but it may well be , in the light of these recent developments , that for the immediate future at least , there would be difficulties in ensuring safe arrival in any event . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In HH the ORG had concluded that those moving around GPE and the environs would in general not be at risk of serious harm at checkpoints , although it left open the possibility that the situation might be different if a person were likely to encounter a non - ORG checkpoint alone , without friends , family or other clan members . However , in AM the ORG noted that from DATE ORG for the Co - ordination of ORG estimate of the number of roadblocks / checkpoints in central and southern GPE showed an increase from CARDINAL in DATE to CARDINAL in DATE and considerably CARDINAL were under the control of insurgents . Nevertheless , while the ORG found that ORG appeared by and large to have lost control of many of the roadblocks and checkpoints in central and southern GPE , the evidence continued to indicate that they retained control of the main road from the airport into GPE . While there was some evidence that the road came under attack from insurgents on a DATE basis , there was clearly a great deal of ongoing movement of people along the roads in central and southern GPE and in and around the airport and the ORG did not consider that the available evidence demonstrated a real risk en route of persecution or serious harm for travellers from the airport to GPE .", "CARDINAL . One of the applicants in HH and CARDINAL of the applicants in AM were granted leave to appeal to ORG . Their appeals were joined to those of CARDINAL other NORP applicants .", "CARDINAL . HH contended that the ORG had erred in its application of the provisions of article CARDINAL(c ) of the Qualification Directive as it had held first , that the notion of an \u201c individual threat \u201d required a \u201c differential impact \u201d and secondly , that article PERSON ) did not add anything to ORG and CARDINAL of the LAW . Before ORG , the Secretary of ORG for ORG accepted that the ORG had erred in its interpretation of article PERSON ) , but submitted that the error was not material . ORG held that if the correct ( post - Elgafaji ) approach to article PERSON ) had been applied to the facts found by the ORG , it was inevitable that it would have found that the population of GPE as a whole was not subject to such a high level of indiscriminate violence as to justify the conclusion that merely to be there attracted entitlement to subsidiary protection . Consequently , ORG dismissed ORG \u2019s appeal on the ground that the error of law was not material .", "CARDINAL . The ORG had accepted that AM was from LOC . It noted that there was no longer any significant fighting there but accepted that there was evidence that en route travel to LOC was hazardous . Nevertheless , the ORG held that it was not empowered to consider the risk faced in making the journey : rather , it was for the Secretary of ORG for ORG , in finalising the removal arrangements , to satisfy herself that there would be safe en route travel for AM . AM appealed to ORG on the ground that this was not a lawful approach . ORG allowed the appeal , finding that in any case in which it could be shown either directly or by implication what route and method of return was envisaged , the ORG was required by law to consider and determine any challenge to the safety of that route or method . The ORG therefore fell into error as it had declined to consider ORG safety on return . ORG remitted the case to the ORG to consider this issue .", "DATE . J had sought judicial review of the Secretary of ORG for ORG refusal to accept as a fresh claim her submissions about the situation facing her were she to be returned to GPE . ORG had held that if the removal directions had indicated that J was expected to go by road from FAC to her home town , the evidence would have given her a strongly arguable case for judicial review . However , as the detail or method of return was neither clearly nor necessarily implicit within the immigration decision , the judicial review application had been refused . J appealed to ORG . For the same reasons adopted in AM \u2019s case , ORG allowed the appeal . ORG indicated ( on an obiter basis ) that the Qualification Directive and the Asylum Procedures Directive read together required that the issues of safety during return ( as opposed to technical obstacles during return ) should be considered as part of the decision on entitlement . Only technical obstacles could legitimately be deferred to the point at which removal directions were being made or considered . If there was a real issue of safety on return the Secretary of ORG had to engage with it in his decision on entitlement to protection . If he failed to do so , the appeal tribunal would have to deal with the issue . In any case , the decision on entitlement had to be made within a reasonable time and could not be left until the Secretary of ORG was in a position to set safe removal directions .", "CARDINAL . MA appealed against the rejection of his LAW claims by the ORG . In particular , he complained that the ORG had misdirected itself because it had focused on his failure to tell the truth when it should have asked whether there was evidence relating to his own particular situation , even ignoring his own rejected testimony , which would support his contention that there was a real risk on return . ORG accepted that the ORG had adopted the wrong approach , apparently considering that the applicant \u2019s lies had disabled it from reaching a conclusion on the LAW risk . Had it made an assessment on the basis of the available evidence , it would have had to have concluded that the applicant was at risk of LAW ill - treatment on return . ORG noted that following AM , the Country Guidance relating to GPE was such that most potential returnees would be entitled to subsidiary protection under LAW . It therefore followed that only those NORP who could get without undue risk to a place of safety or who had access to protection against the endemic dangers could properly be deported or returned . It was accepted that MA was from a minority clan , that he had not been in GPE for DATE , and that for much of that time he had been in detention . There was therefore sufficient evidence before the ORG to at least establish a real risk that he would not have the necessary contacts in GPE to afford him the necessary protection .", "CARDINAL . In AM ( Evidence \u2013 route of return ) GPE [ DATE ] ORG ( ORG ) ORG held that ORG had failed to give adequate reasons for concluding that the applicant could safely reach his home area of GPE from FAC . However , on reconsideration the ORG was not satisfied that returning him would give rise to a breach of LAW . In particular , it found that travel took place with some degree of frequency from the airport to the city of GPE and into other areas of GPE ; that as the applicant had lived in GPE and GPE , he would be well able to anticipate and comply with the requirements of ORG ; that there was nothing which would put him at any risk were he to encounter a ORG checkpoint ; that the evidence did not support a finding that all men or young men were at risk of forced recruitment by ORG ; and , that as the applicant was not found to be a minority clan member , and as his uncle had been able to fund his departure from GPE , he would be able to avoid foreseeable risks and pay the relatively modest sums demanded at checkpoints .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Migration Court of Appeal , which is the court of final instance in immigration cases , found that a situation of internal armed conflict existed throughout the whole of southern and central GPE which was sufficiently serious to expose the NORP applicant to a risk of serious harm , even though he could not demonstrate that he would be specifically targeted . The court had regard to many reports which indicated that the fighting had increased in DATE and that the situation had become very unstable and unpredictable . Moreover , due to the worsening security situation , the presence of ORG and other international organisations had decreased and , as a consequence , detailed and updated information was hard to come by . Although the safety level in GPE and GPE was considered to be acceptable , a NORP returnee could only gain admittance to those areas if he was seen as belonging or having another connection to them . As that was not the case with the applicant , the court concluded that he could not internally relocate and that he should thus be given a residence permit and subsidiary protection in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The fact - finding mission interviewed a number of anonymous sources , including international NGOs , security advisors and diplomatic sources , about the current security and humanitarian situation in southern and central GPE . In particular , the mission sought to obtain information on which groups controlled which areas , how easy it was to travel between different areas , the security and human rights situation , and the conditions in the ORG camps .", "CARDINAL . Sources indicated that control of GPE was divided between ORG , backed by ORG troops , and PERSON . Although the sources had different views on which groups controlled which districts , they mostly agreed that ORG controlled the airport , the seaport , LOC and the road between the airport and LOC .", "CARDINAL . Sources indicated that the security situation in GPE was poor , with CARDINAL of civilians killed in the fighting between FAC and PERSON . Areas controlled by ORG were at risk of shelling by ORG , while areas controlled by ORG were at risk of shelling by ORG . All parties to the conflict were guilty of indiscriminate shelling . Violence was sporadic and rape was an issue in many areas . Consequently , there was a constant movement of IDPs into and out of the city . However , CARDINAL diplomatic source suggested that it would be possible to live in non - conflict areas of the city , which were generally considered to be safe .", "CARDINAL . Sources also indicated that the nature of ORG violence had become more sophisticated over DATE as foreign fighters had brought with them new tactics and techniques . They not only carried out targeted attacks against AMISOM troops and ORG ministers and MPs , but they also carried out random killings of civilians in GPE in order to create disorder and chaos .", "CARDINAL . The report noted that there were regular flights into GPE , most of which were destined for FAC . ORG informed the Mission that CARDINAL flights arrived in GPE DATE . An airplane captain working for ORG also told the Mission that his airline had carried CARDINAL passengers into GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The road between the airport and GPE was controlled by ORG with ORG support and these groups managed all checkpoints along the route . It would not be particularly dangerous for ordinary NORP unless they found themselves \u201c in the wrong place at the wrong time \u201d . However , there were reports of a failed attack on the airport on CARDINAL September CARDINAL and some sources suggested that contacts were required in order to make the journey from the airport . ORG for ORG on GPE indicated that those members of the diaspora who regularly travelled to GPE were well - connected and that mobility was limited unless the individual was aligned with a militia . Likewise , a representative from an international NGO indicated that \u201c any NORP returning to FAC would need a lot of preparation and would need to ensure they had contacts in GPE \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A representative from CARDINAL international NGO suggested that ORG knew who was landing at the airport as they were receiving information from ORG soldiers based there .", "CARDINAL . Most of the sources interviewed agreed that NORP were able to move around within GPE without much restriction . CARDINAL sources described the checkpoints in the city as \u201c random \u201d or \u201c variable \u201d as they tended to change according to fighting areas and the level of control of specific groups . CARDINAL source suggested that checkpoints operated by ORG or PERSON were more difficult to negotiate as they were operated with less discipline and normally demanded money . ORG checkpoints normally checked that people were obeying their code of behaviour and would therefore stop women travelling alone . Some individuals operating these checkpoints would punish those who were not acting according to ORG rules .", "CARDINAL . Contrary to the majority opinion , the EU Special Representative informed the fact - finding mission that all civilians in GPE would either be aligned to a militia or completely unable to get out of the town . The Special Representative even suggested that some NORP were unable to leave their own district .", "CARDINAL . There was no consensus on which groups controlled the other regions in southern and central GPE , although all agreed that ORG controlled most of the land south of a line drawn between PERSON and Dhusarmareb . Militias broadly aligned with ORG controlled pockets of land on the NORP border . PERSON was nominally in control of some small areas , including parts of FAC , but ORG influence in these areas was significant . Finally , the region of PERSON was controlled by a local clan - based administration which acted under the umbrella of Ahlu Sunna Waljamaca .", "CARDINAL . Outside GPE , people were generally permitted to travel within the areas controlled by ORG although they could encounter difficulties at checkpoints if they were not obeying ORG rules . Although ORG had endeavoured to remove \u201c illegal \u201d checkpoints , a number of sources indicated that some clan militia checkpoints remained . The evidence appeared to suggest that it was possible to negotiate the various checkpoints , although a certain amount of risk was involved .", "CARDINAL . A diplomatic source stated that young men travelling in ORG held areas could be targeted by ORG for recruitment . This was supported by an international NGO , which advised that forced recruitment was becoming systematic . Young men were asked to register with PERSON , including those who were stopped at checkpoints .", "CARDINAL . A number of sources considered the areas controlled by ORG to be stable and generally safe for those NORP who were able to \u201c play the game \u201d and avoid the unnecessary attention of ORG . CARDINAL the other hand , CARDINAL international NGO believed that there were \u201c no safe areas in southern - central GPE as long as LOC and PERSON were present \u201d . Another NGO indicated that everywhere in southern and central GPE had been affected by violations of international humanitarian law and by a situation of generalised violence and displacement over DATE on account of the expansion of the insurgency outside GPE . Finally , a diplomatic source stated that \u201c everywhere is volatile and can change at any time \u201d .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the human rights situation , forced recruitment of adults and children appeared to be an emerging problem , particularly for those displaced in FAC . Sources suggested that all parties to the conflict recruited children , although it was not certain that ORG forcibly recruited them . Child recruitment was , however , very common in ORG areas , as they would forcibly recruit the eldest son from local families , some of whom were as young as DATE . Adult males were also forced to register with ORG in ORG .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the sources indicated that in ORG areas , human rights were practically non - existent because of the organisation \u2019s interpretation of LAW law , which was not in accordance with the beliefs of ordinary NORP . Consequently , people lived in fear as there were serious punishments if ORG orders were not obeyed . Women in particular were routinely targeted and were not permitted to engage in trade . In addition , ORG had made a concerted effort to drive NGOs out of its areas by a number of means , including demanding payment of a \u201c registration fee \u201d of up to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , looting warehouses and threatening workers . In some cases ORG had stolen aid and confiscated the assets of NGOs to sell for profit . There was therefore no international NGO presence in ORG controlled areas and health and feeding programmes had been stopped , with significant consequences for the civilian population .", "CARDINAL . Finally , sources were asked about the conditions in ORG camps . They indicated that although those with resources had left GPE , there were CARDINAL people displaced within the city and no humanitarian assistance was available to them . Estimates suggested that there were a further CARDINAL people in FAC , which had become increasingly urbanised . It was difficult to give an exact number of the people based in the corridor because , due to the nature of the fighting , a lot of people were going back and forward to GPE . Moreover , access for NGOs was difficult as the corridor was controlled by \u201c gatekeepers \u201d who controlled who and what moved into and out of the area . These \u201c gatekeepers \u201d tended to be opportunists who were not aligned to any particular group but they were able to make assistance from NGOs very difficult . CARDINAL NGOs said that it was incredibly difficult to access the corridor and , where access was possible , aid was often diverted . Moreover , landlords in the area were either selling the land that the IDPs lived on or were charging rent that they could not afford , forcing them to move on .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL international NGO believed that there was a hierarchy within the camps , but did not know whether it was based on clan membership or length of residence . Consequently , it could not be guaranteed that majority clan members would not face problems within the ORG camps .", "CARDINAL . The sources were not aware of any other significant ORG settlements within GPE .", "CARDINAL . Operational Guidance Notes ( \u201c OGNs \u201d ) are produced by ORG of ORG . They evaluate the general , political and human rights situation in a country and provide guidance on the nature and handling of the most common type of claim .", "CARDINAL . The ORG on GPE of DATE described how fighting by ORG troops , allied militias , and LAW forces against anti - government forces in southern and central GPE had resulted in widespread human rights abuses , including the killing of CARDINAL of civilians , the displacement of CARDINAL people and widespread property damage , particularly in GPE . However , a fall in clashes between government troops and insurgents had led to a substantial drop in the numbers of civilians killed in fighting in GPE in DATE . The GPE - based ORG stated that CARDINAL civilians were killed in fighting in DATE , down from CARDINAL in DATE and CARDINAL in DATE . CARDINAL civilians were wounded and CARDINAL families displaced by clashes in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The report noted that while GPE remained the focus of the insurgency , fighting had occurred in other parts of the country , including PERSON , PERSON , the GPE and ORG regions , from GPE to GPE and around the central towns of GPE and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report indicated that restrictions on movement within GPE had reduced significantly compared to when the ORG considered the situation in AM and AM ( GPE ) . In particular , checkpoints operated by ORG had decreased and there were no reports of armed clan factions operating checkpoints in DATE . ORG had established checkpoints at the exit / entry routes of the towns under its control for security reasons . It checked goods , searched people and ensured that its strict NORP codes were enforced , but it did not collect money . There were also reports that ORG had eradicated extortion , robbery and murder from bandits in areas it controlled .", "CARDINAL . With the exception of GPE , there were no reports of checkpoints between towns or within towns , as was common in DATE . There were , however , several checkpoints on the route from GPE towards LOC and some precautions could be necessary , particularly during militia fighting . There was no evidence that those not of adverse interest to ORG , PERSON or groups such as PERSON or Ahlu Sunna PERSON , would be unable to pass through checkpoints safely . During overland trips clan protection was not required unless ongoing animosities between CARDINAL rival clans were involved . Individuals would not generally need an escort , but if they considered an escort to be necessary , it would be feasible for them to arrange CARDINAL either before or after arrival . It would therefore be feasible for many to return to their home areas from FAC as most areas were more accessible than previously .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report also noted that it was possible for NORP to fly from FAC directly to PERSON , in GPE , a region which was widely considered to be relatively safe . However , the authorities in GPE , like the authorities in GPE , would only admit those who originated from the territory or those who had close affiliation to the territory through clan membership . In GPE , the majority clan was the PERSON .", "ORG . With regard to the human rights situation , the report noted that :", "\u201c ORG currently controls much of southern and central GPE , including large portions of GPE . ORG has maintained control of a few areas in the south east of the city , government installations , the Presidential palace and strategic locations such as the airport and seaport . ORG controls large portions of GPE including the north and north - east parts of the city , the main stadium and the main market . It controls nearly all of Middle and LOC regions , GPE , LOC , ORG region , and parts of LOC region . This includes control of the key port cities of PERSON and PERSON and the GPE border town of PERSON . It also wields significant influence in LOC and PERSON region .", "The human rights situation has deteriorated particularly in areas controlled by PERSON and allied extremist groups . ORG and other armed groups have continued to violate women \u2019s rights in southern and central GPE . Women face arbitrary detention , restriction of movement and other forms of abuse for failure to obey orders , including non - observance of dress codes . There is a rising pattern of inhuman and degrading treatment , including stoning , amputations , floggings and corporal punishment . Men too are subjected to inhuman and cruel treatment for their illicit relationship with women and other offences such as \u2018 ORG . Journalists have been repeatedly subjected to threats and short - term arbitrary detentions , particularly in GPE and PERSON . ORG has increasingly targeted civil society groups , peace activists , media and human rights organisations . Humanitarian assistance has been severely hampered by the prevailing insecurity and threats specifically targeting humanitarian agencies . In southern and central GPE there is evidence that children are being exposed to recruitment into armed forces by all parties to the conflict . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the humanitarian situation , the report indicated that by DATE the total number of displaced persons had reached MONEY , PERCENT of whom were concentrated in southern and central areas , including CARDINAL in the GPE corridor . The security situation was having a negative impact on the relief operation . Rising threats and attacks on humanitarian operations , as well as the imposition of demands from armed groups , had made it virtually impossible for ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) to continue reaching people in need in southern GPE . Inflammatory statements by ORG against relief organisations , threats against humanitarian staff , explicit rejection of foreign food aid and demands for fees had all worsened .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report concluded that while the general humanitarian situation in southern and central GPE was poor , it was not so serious as to cause , in itself , a breach of LAW Aid agencies were subjected to obstructions and dangers in delivering aid to IDPs but most of those in need continued to be reached and efforts were being strengthened to sustain critical food operations in southern and central LAW CARDINAL threshold was met .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report indicated that ORG respect for human rights had improved . However , the poor human rights situation in GPE had deteriorated further during DATE , especially in the areas controlled by ORG and allied extremist groups . Human rights abuses included unlawful and politically motivated killings , kidnappings , torture , rape , amputations , beatings , official impunity , harsh and life - threatening prison conditions , and arbitrary arrest and detention .", "CARDINAL . With regard to movement within GPE , the report indicated that checkpoints operated by ORG and its associated militias had decreased . According to a report by PERSON , ORG established checkpoints at the exit / entry routes of the towns under its control for security reasons . There were no reports of checkpoints between towns or within towns , as was common in DATE . There were also no reports of armed clan factions operating checkpoints during DATE .", "CARDINAL . The report noted that the humanitarian situation in GPE remained dire as the fighting in GPE had added more challenges to already poor conditions on the ground . CARDINAL people had been displaced and CARDINAL had fled to neighbouring countries in DATE . Targeted attacks on humanitarian groups had made delivery of assistance difficult and ORG had suspended assistance in areas controlled by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The report noted that the situation in southern GPE and in GPE in particular was unstable and the power balance in the regions , districts and urban areas could change almost from DATE . Consequently , information on area control could become out of date very quickly .", "CARDINAL . It was clear , however , that the military and political situation remained extremely complicated . Large areas of southern GPE were controlled by ORG and other NORP groups in opposition to the authorities . Many areas of GPE had been the scene of shooting , shelling and fighting between NORP and Government forces supported by ORG . In spite of a certain amount of stability in parts of the country , the civilian population was still the victim of indiscriminate violence , albeit to a slightly lesser extent than previously . Leading observers agreed that the situation was fragile as the NORP groups had the will and means to continue to fight , while ORG was weak and probably would not survive without the presence of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG Special Envoy for Human Rights , together with a number of other international observers , noted that the arrival of foreign jihadists in GPE had resulted in ORG operations becoming \u201c professionalised \u201d , which meant that they were implemented with greater precision and brutality . According to a number of observers , individual ORG cells were controlled by foreign jihadists who did not wish for peace or to enter into any form of dialogue with the authorities .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the humanitarian situation , the report noted that while the nutritional situation was expected to improve in DATE on account of a good harvest , the food security situation remained poor . Food prices were high and access to clean drinking water remained a considerable problem .", "CARDINAL . Estimates indicated that the total number of displaced persons in GPE was CARDINAL . Resources in local areas were stretched to the maximum as the displaced from GPE sought refuge in traditional clan areas . While clan members were prepared to share what resources they had as far as possible , displaced persons without clan connections did not have that safety net and were therefore in a more difficult position . However , the report quoted the ORG Special Envoy as stating :", "\u201c Monitoring the human rights situation in south and central GPE remains very difficult due to the serious constraints on gathering information owing to security conditions . The independent expert was himself unable to visit the region . Nevertheless , major human rights concerns have been documented and the independent expert remains deeply concerned at the deterioration of the situation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report noted that freedom of movement in GPE had improved since DATE and the general impression was that the population could travel relatively freely in both government controlled areas and areas controlled by other groups . The removal of road blocks had had a positive effect on criminality as cases of \u201c rape and run \u201d had previously been widespread in these areas . However , in spite of the improvements , restrictions imposed by ORG on women restricted their freedom of movement and had a negative impact on their families , which were often dependant on women \u2019s income from trading .", "CARDINAL . International organisations had increasingly been the target of violent attacks DATE and , because of the safety risk , only a few international representatives remained in southern GPE . Like the ORG and foreign embassies , business was run from main offices in GPE while local employees were responsible for work on the ground in GPE . Local human rights organisations could not publish detailed reports for fear of their own safety . However , aid work in GPE could be risky for local employees as they were increasingly coming under attack .", "CARDINAL . In any case , aid organisations had limited access in the areas controlled by ORG . In DATE the ORG decided to suspend its activities in the ORG controlled areas . This has had consequences for the population in LOC , ORG and GPE as access to the necessary food supplies and other aid was limited . Moreover , at DATE , ORG ordered ORG , ORG and PERSON out of the areas under their control on the ground that they were operating missionary activities . With these CARDINAL organisations gone , very few international aid organisations remained in place in southern GPE .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the situation in GPE , the report noted that conditions in the different areas varied and there was a difference between the northern and southern parts of the capital . The areas of LOC , ORG , PERSON , Bondheere , PERSON and PERSON were the hardest hit by shelling and attacks . To a lesser extent , the districts of LOC , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were also affected by the fighting . However , the report noted that the situation was unpredictable and could easily change . For example , the Karaan district in the north had previously been considered relatively peaceful but was now shot to pieces and all its inhabitants had fled .", "CARDINAL . According to a well - informed international aid worker , CARDINAL people per week died in GPE due to fighting . It was difficult to estimate how many of the dead were civilians . It was also difficult accurately to estimate the number of displaced . According to the ORG , there were CARDINAL displaced persons in GPE and CARDINAL in GPE . However , it was possible that there were great margins of error as the ORG estimates were based on satellite images and it was thought that many houses had been built to mislead aid organisations . Nevertheless , well - informed sources indicated that the situation in GPE DATE was much more difficult than it had been at DATE as international organisations were no longer able to carry out their tasks . Poverty was more widespread in GPE than it had been previously and it was therefore more difficult to help those in need . In addition , the clan system had been weakened .", "CARDINAL . Outside GPE the fighting was mostly localised around certain key areas and towns . Strategic towns such as GPE , PERSON and various towns in the PERSON had changed hands many times in DATE and there were also tensions in GPE and GPE . However , the main challenge for most of the population of southern GPE was humanitarian . PERCENT of all children DATE in southern GPE were malnourished and medical treatment was limited , especially in villages , where it was estimated that there was CARDINAL doctor per CARDINAL inhabitants .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his report to ORG on CARDINAL DATE , the Secretary General noted that there had been increased fighting in southern and central GPE during DATE . CARDINAL people had been displaced during this period . In addition to the fighting in GPE , there was also continued fighting between ORG and PERSON in PERSON and PERSON , and between ORG and ORG Sunna Waljamaca in the central region . ORG staff faced direct threats from armed groups in these areas and the presence of international staff in these regions was restricted .", "CARDINAL . The security situation continued to have a direct impact on the provision of humanitarian aid . The report noted that on DATE ORG called for the termination of all ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) operations inside GPE , and on DATE and DATE ORG compounds in GPE and GPE were occupied by ORG . There had been no food distribution to over CARDINAL IDPs in the GPE corridor since DATE owing to inaccessibility and CARDINAL intended beneficiaries were not receiving food distributions throughout the south and central regions .", "CARDINAL . In his report to ORG on DATE , the Secretary General noted that volatility and insecurity had once again increased in GPE . ORG and ORG frequently engaged the insurgents in response to mortar fire and direct attacks and military operations to secure positions in key districts of GPE led to fierce battles . Moreover , the frequency of attacks with improvised explosive devices had led to an increase in civilian casualties during the reporting period . According to ORG , CARDINAL civilian casualties were admitted to the CARDINAL main hospitals in GPE from DATE to DATE . That figure , which included CARDINAL children DATE and CARDINAL registered deaths , had left GPE \u2019s already weak health services struggling to cope with the casualties . He also reported that beyond GPE , sporadic clashes between ORG and ORG Sunna ORG continued in the central regions and the continuing insecurity had hampered ORG operations in GPE by limiting freedom of movement for ORG staff and contractors . In DATE ORG seized the compound of ORG and the houses of CARDINAL national staff .", "CARDINAL . The ongoing conflict , particularly in GPE , had displaced CARDINAL people in DATE and CARDINAL people in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the Secretary - General \u2019s report of CARDINAL DATE on children and armed conflict in GPE , he noted that civilians , including children , continued to be the majority of casualties in GPE , primarily as a result of being caught in the crossfire between the parties to the conflict , shelling and explosions . During DATE CARDINAL people , including CARDINAL children , relied on humanitarian assistance . However , food supplies remained disrupted , access to clean water and medical assistance hindered , and hospitals were stretched to capacity . As from DATE , food distribution by ORG was disrupted in all areas controlled by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the climate of violence and impunity exacerbated grave violations of children \u2019s rights as individuals were taking advantage of the lack of rule of law and the availability of arms to commit violent crimes against children and other vulnerable members of the population . This was borne out by evidence of rising levels of acts of sexual violence against children . Most at risk were women and girls living on the streets or in open and unprotected settlements for IDPs . In addition , available information indicated that ORG had undertaken systematic and widespread recruitment of children for use in the conflict . Indeed , it was alleged that at the GPE base between LOC and PERSON , ORG had CARDINAL children , some as young as DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his most recent report to ORG , dated DATE , the Secretary General stated that a major military offensive against ORG had begun on DATE . The offensive by the Ahlu PERSON Jama\u2019a and other groups allied with ORG against ORG in southern central GPE had focused on the GPE - GPE - GPE border . Hostilities centred on the GPE , FAC and ORG regions , with armed conflict most prevalent in PERSON and , to a lesser extent , in the vicinity of PERSON and PERSON . Troops allied with ORG had taken control of the town of ORG , close to the NORP border , on DATE . Reports of heavy casualties and intensified recruitment efforts on the part of ORG suggested that the group \u2019s capabilities might have been reduced . However , ORG continued to receive arms and ammunition through southern NORP ports and acquire financial resources from extortion , illegal exports and taxation .", "CARDINAL . At the date the report was drafted , heavy fighting had again broken out in GPE and ORG reported that hospitals were swamped with war - wounded . According to a report by ORG , in DATE CARDINAL civilians died and CARDINAL were injured as a result of the increased fighting and shelling . While most casualties appeared to have been the result either of attacks by ORG and its allies against ORG and GPE forces or retaliatory attacks by ORG , direct fighting between NORP such as ORG Sunna PERSON and ORG combined with inter - clan clashes in central GPE also contributed to the high number of deaths . In addition , reports indicated that parties to the conflict had failed to adhere to the principles of international humanitarian law relating to the protection of civilians as hostilities had been waged in urban areas and precautionary measures to avoid civilian casualties had been disregarded .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the human rights situation in areas under PERSON control , ORG recorded reports of CARDINAL executions by firing squad or stoning , mostly for alleged spying or murder , CARDINAL cases of amputation , mostly of suspected thieves , and the flogging or whipping of CARDINAL individuals . In addition , CARDINAL cases of beheading were reported , including those of CARDINAL workers allegedly killed in DATE because they were involved in reconstruction work at the ORG , and CARDINAL people were allegedly shot dead in DATE when they fled from a house in GPE raided by PERSON because they were watching a World Cup match .", "CARDINAL . Displacement also continued to be a problem . According to a ORG report , during DATE CARDINAL NORP sought refuge in neighbouring countries and CARDINAL were internally displaced . As of DATE , there were CARDINAL NORP refugees , mainly hosted in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . In addition , CARDINAL NORP were internally displaced . Assessments conducted revealed that there was a high prevalence of sexual violence in ORG camps , victims were generally of minority clan origin , bereft of clan protection and often forced to engage in risky coping mechanisms .", "CARDINAL . Recruitment of children to be put on the front line remained an issue of major concern . Although recent media attention highlighted the presence of children within the ranks of forces linked to the ORG , the majority of reports of new instances of child recruitment attributed responsibility to anti - Government elements .", "CARDINAL .
