On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to verify whether the investigation and proceedings in respect of her mother had been conducted properly . She submitted that the attempted suicide in DATE and her fragile mental state should have prompted the authorities to conduct the proceedings with particular diligence .

The relevant part of his letter reads :", "\u201c It is true that the experts , apparently by mistake , sent the summonses to the wrong address , but the court was not aware of this and that is why it ordered that she should be escorted to the examination [ by the police ] . There are no grounds on which to conclude that the court \u2019s decision was wrong , but there can be no doubt that it was based on a wrong premise [ nie ma zatem podstaw do przyj\u0119cia , \u017ce post\u0119powanie s\u0105du by\u0142o b\u0142\u0119dne , natomiast niew\u0105tpliwie opiera\u0142o si\u0119 na b\u0142\u0119dnych przes\u0142ankach ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to institute a criminal investigation in order to identify the persons responsible for her mother \u2019s arrest which , in her opinion , had led to her suicide . She submitted that her mother had already tried to commit suicide in DATE ; that at the material time her mental condition had been precarious ; and that the psychiatrists had sent the summonses to the wrong address despite the fact that the correct address had been available in the file . The judge had also failed to check whether the summonses had been sent to the correct address and whether they had been duly served on her . As a result , she had been arrested by the police in TIME of DATE . Her neighbours had told the applicant that during the arrest her mother had been crying . The applicant submitted that her mother had been an elderly , fragile person on the brink of a nervous breakdown and that the manner in which the case had been handled had driven her to commit suicide .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the request was forwarded to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to institute an investigation , having examined the case under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . It was confirmed that the summonses to attend the psychiatric examination had twice been sent to the wrong address and had never been served on the applicant \u2019s mother . The prosecutor was of the view that the court could not be held responsible for that error . It had not known the defendant \u2019s correct address as the entire case file had already been forwarded to the experts at that time . The applicant \u2019s submission that there was a causal link between the defendant \u2019s arrest on DATE and her suicide DATE was too categorical . There were no grounds on which to accept that the prosecuting authorities , the police or the court had failed to perform their duties properly or that the applicant \u2019s mother had been driven to suicide as a result of such failure .", "CARDINAL . The written grounds of that decision did not refer to any evidence other than the file of the criminal case against the applicant \u2019s mother .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She argued that her mother had suffered from depression caused by the transaction she considered fraudulent and that the authorities had been well aware of this . The court had relied on her earlier attempt to commit suicide when ordering the psychiatric examination . Appropriate regard had not been had to the fact that she was psychologically fragile . The authorities had failed to conduct the criminal case against her properly . No steps had been taken by the court to establish her correct address , although it had been available in the case file , in order to serve the summonses correctly . As a result of that failure , her mother had been arrested on DATE . The arrest had been tremendously traumatic for her . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , the fact that her mother had committed suicide just after the examination was proof that the opinion prepared by the experts after her death to the effect that she was fit to stand trial was worthless .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Leszno ORG examined the appeal . The applicant did not attend the hearing . In a decision rendered on DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The relevant parts of the written grounds of this decision , numbering one - and a CARDINAL page read as follows :", "\u201c The appellant \u2019s submission that there was a well - founded suspicion that a criminal offence had been committed could not be shared [ by the court ] in respect of :", "- the prosecutor , because ... he had a right to draw up a bill of indictment within DATE of the investigation being closed and he did so in the present case ;", "- the judge conducting the proceedings , as he was entitled to appoint psychiatrists to the case with a view to checking whether the defendant could stand trial and to order that the defendant be taken to the psychiatric examination under police escort ; he did so as he had been informed in writing that the defendant had twice failed to comply with summonses ;", "- the experts in so far as they failed to foresee that [ the applicant \u2019s mother ] would make another suicide attempt , this time a successful one , as they gave their opinion in accordance with their best knowledge and conscience ; ...", "It is true that the police escort order given by the court failed to take into consideration that the experts had sent the summonses to the wrong address , but the court could not know that , given that at the time the case file had already been forwarded to the experts . This , however , can not change the assessment of the events from the point of view of criminal responsibility , in particular as to the presence of a causal link between the [ applicant \u2019s mother ] being taken to the examination by police escort and her subsequent attempt to commit suicide . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant requested ORG ( Okr\u0119gowy PERSON ) of ORG ( Izba Lekarska ) to institute disciplinary proceedings against the psychiatrists .", "By a decision of DATE the Agent discontinued the investigation , having questioned the psychiatrists . He referred to the fact that the service confirmation slips sent to the applicant \u2019s mother had not been served on the psychiatrists . This suggested that the summonses had been properly served on her . As she had failed to comply with the summonses , they had no choice but to inform the court accordingly . The defendant had subsequently been arrested by the police for the purposes of the examination . The psychiatrists had explained that the defendant \u2019s conduct during the examination was not such as to justify her immediate psychiatric internment . Their opinion had therefore been well - founded and they had no case to answer .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . She reiterated that information about her mother \u2019s accurate address had been in the case - file which the psychiatrists had had at their disposal . They had failed to act diligently by establishing her address correctly . They were aware of her earlier attempt to commit suicide but still they had found her able to stand trial . She reiterated that the arrest and taking her to the clinic under the police escort were traumatising and dishonourable for her mother who felt belittled thereby in the eyes of her friends and neighbours .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG of the Wielkopolska Region ( PERSON ) , sitting in camera , upheld the contested decision . It was of the view that the fact that the psychiatrists had sent the summonses to the wrong address amounted to a formal shortcoming , but it did not have an impact on or had not caused the later tragic events . Similarly , in so far as the applicant had complained about her mother \u2019s arrest by the police , this could not be held against the doctors . The arrest had been ordered by the court in the context of the criminal proceedings , not by the doctors . It was further stated that the psychiatric opinion drawn up by the CARDINAL psychiatrists was correct , and the diagnosis they had made not open to criticism .", "CARDINAL .
