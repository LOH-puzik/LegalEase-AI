{"ITEMID": "001-70188", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "CLARKE v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by Mr PERSON , of ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant sued a local authority and an insurance company ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) in respect of damage caused to property which the applicant had leased from the local authority . He claimed that the authority had failed to look after the property and the surrounding area , and that the insurance company had failed to pay on a policy which covered the damage . The applicant \u2019s claims , initially for \u00a3 MONEY , were revised at trial to a total of \u00a3 MONEY . On DATE , the GPE made a payment into court of \u00a3 MONEY . The court offices of the GPE and GPE - upon - ORG forwarded form NCARDINAL to the applicant to inform him of the payment in . The forms , which provided for a number of options , had not been filled in . The GPE - upon - ORG gave judgment against the applicant in CARDINAL judgments of CARDINAL and DATE . Costs were ordered against the applicant , and leave to appeal was refused . Lord Justice PERSON refused permission to appeal to ORG on DATE , and he further refused permission to appeal to ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , the GPE made a statutory demand in respect of the costs awarded against the applicant in the original action . The demand was not met , and on DATE a bankruptcy petition was served . The applicant was adjudicated bankrupt on DATE . An appeal against the bankruptcy order was dismissed on DATE , and on DATE the applicant applied , out of time , for permission to appeal . The application was refused by Lord Justice PERSON and Sir PERSON on DATE on the ground that the bankruptcy order was made in respect of an unchallengeable judgment debt as to which there was no counter - claim . At the same time , Lord Justice PERSON gave directions that the CARDINAL matters involving the applicant and then pending before ORG ( see below ) were to be heard together before DATE .", "On DATE , at the renewed public examination of the applicant , the applicant was committed to prison for DATE for failure to comply with the reasonable requests of the trustee in bankruptcy . He had previously been imprisoned on a warrant for his arrest after he had failed to attend a hearing , and he had also been imprisoned for DATE for failing to co - operate with the trustee .", "The bankruptcy proceedings revealed a number of incidents in which the applicant failed to comply with various obligations . He did not attend appointments at the Official Receiver \u2019s office on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL May and DATE . He also failed to attend for his public examination , as a result of which he was arrested and held in custody DATE and DATE . Thereafter , he failed to provide the Official Receiver with a statement of affairs , as required by the bankruptcy legislation , and he refused to attend the Official Receiver to answer questions . After the dismissal of his appeal against the bankruptcy order on DATE , the applicant \u2019s public examination was resumed before Mr Justice PERSON on DATE . The applicant again refused to answer questions and , after an adjournment to allow him more time to comply , the applicant was sentenced to DATE in prison on DATE .", "After the judgment of DATE in the initial action , the applicant brought CARDINAL further sets of proceedings , against the Lord Chancellor \u2019s Department ( sued as ORG ) in respect of the information contained in Form NCARDINAL , against the GPE which , he claimed , had misled him into not accepting the payment into court , and against the GPE \u2019s barrister who , he claimed , had misled him into thinking that he could not withdraw the payment into court at the beginning of the action on DATE .", "In the proceedings against the Lord Chancellor \u2019s Department , the applicant \u2019s claim was issued on DATE and re - issued on DATE . On DATE District Judge PERSON in ORG noted that Form NCARDINAL stated that :", "\u201c if the defendant does wish to accept the payment in he should do so in writing within DATE . It then proceeds to give other events and times in brackets . The form , in this respect , is most unsatisfactory and is made worse because none of the various bracketed events are deleted . Indeed , I would not expect the average court clerk to have sufficient knowledge of the rules to know how to complete this part of the form and I imagine that in most cases all options were left open . \u201d", "The claim was nevertheless dismissed on the ground that it had no real prospect of success , as the applicant could not establish that the CARDINAL error on the form had caused his losses . Leave to appeal was granted by the trial judge , and the appeal was dismissed by His Honour Judge PERSON ( a circuit judge ) in ORG on DATE . Judge PERSON summarised the claim as being that the court office had been negligent in that it issued a form that was ambiguous and to a certain extent incorrect , as a result of which the applicant did not accept the payment into court , lost the proceedings , and was ordered to pay costs of \u00a3 MONEY . The judge accepted that the Lord Chancellor \u2019s Department owed the applicant a duty of care and that the duty had been breached . He did not , however , accept that the applicant had acted to his detriment as a result of the breach : on the applicant \u2019s own account , he had not accepted the payment into court before the hearing because he relied on a statement of the GPE \u2019s barrister . The applicant applied for leave to appeal by a series of notices . CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s points on appeal concerned the issue of the participation of the district and circuit judges who sat as single judges in the case . He underlined that they had been recommended for appointment , and were governed and could be dismissed by the Lord Chancellor , who was the defendant in the proceedings . Lord Justice PERSON , determining the application for permission to have a second appeal , granted permission on DATE , principally on the \u201c point of constitutional importance \u201d concerning the position of circuit and district judges in cases against the Lord Chancellor or his department . Leave to appeal was also granted on a number of subsidiary points .", "The appeal before ORG was to have been heard on DATE , the ORG Solicitor had appointed counsel , and an amicus curiae had been appointed . Shortly before the hearing , the ORG office learned that the applicant had been adjudicated bankrupt on DATE , and the hearing was adjourned to establish the effect of the bankruptcy on the proceedings . The Official Receiver took the view that the causes of action had vested in him , and that he had no funds to pursue them . He added , in a letter of DATE , that he was prepared to consider a request to assign the causes of action to the applicant , but in the absence of co - operation from the applicant , was unwilling to do so .", "The claim in the second action against the GPE , in respect of alleged negligent misstatement by the GPE \u2019s representatives during the trial of the initial action , was struck out by a district judge on DATE . Permission to appeal was refused on DATE by a circuit judge . No appeal lay against that refusal by virtue of Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE . The applicant \u2019s request for a further appeal was discussed in ORG on DATE , when Lord Justice PERSON directed that the request be put before him to determine what direction to give . On receiving the papers , it became apparent that no appeal lay , and Lord Justice PERSON so directed . The applicant was informed on DATE and requested an oral hearing . On DATE Lord Justice PERSON directed that the hearing should be held together with the hearing in the action against the Lord Chancellor \u2019s Department .", "The action against the GPE \u2019s barrister was dismissed on DATE , and the applicant applied for permission to appeal . The application was dealt with by Lord Justice PERSON on DATE , when he directed that the application should be listed with the action against the Lord Chancellor \u2019s Department .", "On DATE , pursuant to the directions given on DATE in the bankruptcy appeal , Lord Justice PERSON considered the outstanding issues in relation to the CARDINAL sets of proceedings before him ( those CARDINAL above ) . He outlined the history of the case , and noted the CARDINAL important points which were raised . The first point was whether the district and county court judges were sufficiently independent of the Lord Chancellor , having regard to the terms of their appointments , to avoid a perception of bias or a violation of LAW . The second point was whether LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG DATE was compatible with LAW DATE .", "Lord Justice PERSON found that all CARDINAL actions had vested in LOC on the applicant \u2019s bankruptcy . He did not accept the applicant \u2019s claim that where matters of great public importance had been identified , they should always be pursued . He insisted that it was always necessary for someone to be able and willing to pursue them . He noted specifically the applicant \u2019s history of non - cooperation with LOC .", "The appeal in the action against the Lord Chancellor \u2019s Department was struck out , and the applications in the other CARDINAL actions were also struck out . The orders were made on the grounds \u201c that the person in whom the causes of action are vested does not wish to pursue that appeal and those applications ; and that [ the applicant ] , who does wish to pursue them , has no standing in those proceedings to do so \u201d . Lord Justice PERSON also directed that the applicant \u201c on providing to this court a copy of an assignment of the causes of action by the trustee in bankruptcy to him , may apply in writing to this court , within DATE , to reinstate the appeal and the applications . ... [ I]t seems to me correct , in view of [ the applicant \u2019s ] strong sense of grievance ... to leave open the possibility that , if such an assignment were made in his favour , he should be able to restore the appeal in this court . DATE may , itself , be extended on a written application to this court , with a copy to the Official Receiver , setting out the circumstances which suggest that any extension of the period would be likely to serve any purpose . \u201d", "On DATE the Official Receiver asked the applicant for copies of requests for assignment of the action which the applicant had claimed had been made . He also asked for the applicant \u2019s proposals as to an assignment , and added that on receiving them he would consult his solicitors and seek their advice . He noted that he would have to be put in funds , as there were no funds in the estate and no assets of which he was aware which could be used to provide funds .", "On DATE , in reply to CARDINAL letters of DATE from the applicant , the Official Receiver responded in the following terms :", "\u201c As requested , I confirm that it is not my intention to pursue these matters further . I do not have access to public funds as ORG , other than in the most limited of capacities , and as you will know ... it is not the view of ORG that the matter should be taken forward ... I must also point out , that your failure to co - operate in these proceedings does nothing to advance your arguments , as you seem to be of the opinion that any decision that I take should be made in a vacuum .. . I am of the view that you have not co - operated in any substantive way whatsoever to date ...", "As far as I am concerned , on no occasion have you made a formal request for the assignment to you of the ... action . ... I should be grateful if you would now forward a copy of the letters to which you refer . The absence of those letters suggests to me that no such letters were ever written by you ... If you wish the matter to proceed , please let me have your remittance for [ \u00a3 MONEY plus GPE for solicitors\u2019 costs ] , and I will instruct them to consider the matter , and advise me ... \u201d", "The applicant states that the Official Receiver sought his further committal to prison for failure to answer questions but that the application was refused on DATE .", "The following is an extract from the skeleton argument of the amicus curiae appointed for the hearing which was to be held before ORG on DATE ( see above ) :", "\u201c Appointment", "CARDINAL ) Circuit judges are appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor ( see LAW DATE section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL ) There is a significant judicial input into the selection of circuit and district judges . The selection process for both ORG involves confidential \u201c soundings \u201d from judges and members of the legal profession , which are not disclosed to candidates ( ... ) . More importantly , the selection of candidates for interview is made by a panel which comprises a sitting ORG , a civil servant and a lay person ( ... ) .", "CARDINAL ) That said , the final decision as to whom to recommend to the Queen for appointment lies with the Lord Chancellor alone ( ... ) . The Lord Chancellor \u2019s recommendation is a necessary condition for appointment ( Courts Act DATE section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL ) The arrangements for the appointment of a District Judge are similar ( ... ) save that the appointment of ORG is made by the Lord Chancellor himself pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ....", "CARDINAL ) The personal qualities sought in candidates for the posts of ORG Judge include \u201c integrity and independence \u201d which is said to include \u201c independence of mind and moral courage \u201d and \u201c fairness and impartiality \u201d ( ... ) .", "Pay", "CARDINAL ) The salaries of both ORG are , by statute , set at the discretion of the Lord Chancellor , acting with the concurrence of the ORG ( ORG ) or the consent of the Minister for ORG ) .", "CARDINAL ) In the case of ORG , section CARDINAL ) of GPE DATE provides :", "\u201c Subject to the provisions of this section , there shall be a district judge for each district , who shall be appointed by the Lord Chancellor and paid such salary as the Lord Chancellor may , with the concurrence of the ORG , direct . \u201d", "CARDINAL ) In the case of ORG , section CARDINAL ) of the Courts Act DATE provides :", "\u201c Subject to Part II of Schedule CARDINAL to this LAW , there shall be paid to each Circuit judge such salary as may be determined by the Lord Chancellor with the consent of the Minister for ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL ) Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides , inter alia , that salary shall be payable at such intervals , not exceeding DATE , as the ORG may determine ( s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL)c ) and that such salary may be increased , but not reduced , by a further determination under LAW ( s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) ) .", "CARDINAL ) Mr Staff [ a civil servant from the Lord Chancellor \u2019s Department who gave evidence in the case ] explains that \u201c in practice \u201d judicial salaries are now settled DATE \u201c in the light of recommendations made to the Government by ORG \u201d . It does not appear , however , that this ORG has any statutory underpinning . Its recommendations are not binding on the Lord Chancellor or the Executive .", "Oath", "CARDINAL ) As PERSON Staff points out ( witness statement \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) both ORG are required to take the oath of allegiance and the judicial oath ( see ORG DATE section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , Courts Act DATE section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "Removal", "CARDINAL ) ORG may be removed from office by the Lord Chancellor pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of FAC DATE which provide :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person appointed to an office to which subsection ( CARDINAL ) applies shall hold that office during good behaviour .", "( CARDINAL ) The power to remove such a person from his office on account of misbehaviour shall be exercisable by the Lord Chancellor .", "( CARDINAL ) The Lord Chancellor may also remove such a person from his office on account of inability to perform the duties of his office . \u201d", "CARDINAL ) Circuit Judges may be removed from office by the Lord Chancellor pursuant to section CARDINAL of the Courts Act DATE . That provides :", "\u201c The Lord Chancellor may , if he thinks fit , remove a Circuit judge from office on the ground of incapacity or misbehaviour . \u201d", "....", "CARDINAL ) It is submitted that the most troubling aspect in this case , from an LAW , is the limited judicial role in supervising the exercise of the Lord Chancellor \u2019s statutory power to remove county court judges .", "....", "CARDINAL ) It does not necessarily follow that the present arrangements are not LAW . On the face of it , the passages from PERSON ( \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL above ) , PERSON ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and ORG and Fell ( \u00a7 MONEY ) are of significant assistance to the Respondent in the present case . PERSON ( a recent case presided over by ORG ... ) is of particular assistance to the Respondent , albeit that it is not a decision of ORG . It is right to note , however , that the passage quote above from ORG and Fell has been construed narrowly by ORG . See , in particular , the illuminating discussion of this passage by Lord PERSON at page CARDINAL of PERSON .", "CARDINAL ) The Respondent \u2019s best defence to the Appellant \u2019s best point on DATE is that , in practice , removal almost never occurs and when it does it poses no threat to the independence and impartiality of the judiciary .", "CARDINAL ) It is submitted that some caution is needed when seeking to place weight on the absence of many actual cases of removal of ORG judges ... in support of a conclusion as to their independence and impartiality in Convention terms . In theory , the need never to invoke the power to dismiss is just as consistent with a judiciary wholly bent to the will of the Lord Chancellor as it is with a fully independent and impartial judiciary with which no Lord Chancellor dares to interfere .", "CARDINAL ) It is not , however , suggested that the former is the case . Indeed , to hold such a view might well cogently be said to display just the sort of \u201c neurotic distrust \u201d which the ORG cautioned against in Spear .", "....", "CARDINAL ) It is submitted that the answer to the question of whether the county court judges in the present case were not LAW compliant is not obvious . The case is more borderline than GPE , PERSON or PERSON in one direction and than PERSON and PERSON in the other .", "CARDINAL ) On balance , it is respectfully submitted that the combination of", "a ) the apparent long tradition of invoking the removal power in only the most unusual circumstances , and", "b ) the availability of a relatively intense judicial review is sufficient to render the present system LAW , albeit , as emphasized above , a more obviously LAW regime is available and desirable . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
