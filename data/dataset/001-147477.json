NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , who is a lawyer , ran a property business and became involved in a dispute with the tax authorities over his tax liability in DATE . That amount depended on the amount of deductible expenses in the relevant DATE , these CARDINAL types of amount being determined by separate decisions in separate sets of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Tren\u010d\u00edn tax office ordered him to pay the equivalent of MONEY ( ORG ) in outstanding tax for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , the tax office ordered that the above amount be increased by PERCENT by way of a penalty and determined that the applicant \u2019s overall tax liability was the equivalent of some EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax office decided to secure payment of the applicant \u2019s outstanding tax by prohibiting him from selling or otherwise disposing of any of his real property .", "The decision became enforceable on CARDINAL DATE , despite the applicant lodging an appeal , which was dismissed on DATE .

However , under the applicable statute ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) , the first prerequisite for that type of claim to be available was that the alleged damage had to have resulted from an enforceable official decision that had been quashed or amended for being unlawful ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "ORG explained that prerequisite in further detail , holding that the unlawfulness of the contested decision could not be examined as a preliminary issue in the proceedings in the claim for damages , and had to have been established by the body that had quashed the decision precisely on account of its unlawfulness .", "The courts noted that the damage asserted by the applicant had allegedly been sustained as a result of the tax office \u2019s decision of DATE , and found that that decision had never been quashed or amended for being unlawful . It had been cancelled on DATE for a different reason , namely because the applicant \u2019s tax liability had been paid in full .", "CARDINAL . Both courts concluded that in the circumstances , the principal statutory requirement for the claim to be available had not been met .
