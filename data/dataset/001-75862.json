ROMANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr Cornel Ivanciuc , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "After winning the local and parliamentary elections in DATE , ORG ( ORG ) had scheduled elections within its local and regional branches for DATE .", "On DATE the applicant , a journalist with the DATE satirical review ORG , published an article under the following heading :", "\u201c The contents of this page are based on actual facts , events and individuals . Any resemblance to reality is the result of lengthy investigation ! \u201d", "The article was directed at a number of ORG branches and bore the title :", "\u201c Family secrets of main governing party \u2019s provincial bosses in run - up to elections \u201d", "The article included the following passages :", "\u201c Despite appearances ... Timi\u015f county is , by some margin , the ORG \u2019s craziest . Chairman of the branch is the esteemed university lecturer PERSON However , closer examination of the situation reveals that the leader is no more than an aristocratic figurehead , a harmless small fish in a pond beneath whose surface lurk some large and evil fish with shark - like tendencies and ambitions ...", "Right now , deputy prefect Mr PERSON is the man calling the shots behind the scenes . Consider the facts : PERSON recently removed the secretary - general of Timi\u015f prefect \u2019s office , PERSON , from his post . The latter had refused to sign an order from the prefect , drawn up by PERSON , handing over possession of a large piece of land in the border village of GPE to V.M. , a ORG senator ...", "Deputy prefect ORG whipped PERSON out like a rotten tooth for having the temerity not to put his name to the illegal appropriation of the land by the senator and his pack of hounds . He did not rest until PERSON had been removed from any outfit even remotely concerned with the restitution of land ...", "But do n\u2019t be fooled into thinking that PERSON does n\u2019t have problems of his own . He has CARDINAL major problems . The first concerns the land he inherited from his daddy in the village of GPE . QUANTITY of marshland ... Given the pitiable state of his inheritance , PERSON has his eye on a roadside property in the municipality of PERSON . Unfortunately for him , the mayor of PERSON , who chairs the local committee on implementation of LAW , is against the exchange of the CARDINAL pieces of land . Without further ado , ORG suspends him from his post and hands him over to the police , who open CARDINAL criminal investigations against him ... It should be noted that in GPE dealings in real property are coordinated , by law , by the prefects . However , in GPE , the deputy prefect has long since supplanted the prefect by stripping him of all his powers .", "ORG \u2019s biggest personal problem arose on DATE , when he fatally injured the septuagenarian PERSON in an accident . The victim was a shop caretaker ... His executioner , who at the time was sales director of the GPE Radiotel Timi\u015foara company , was driving under the influence of DATE PERSON celebrations . The victim was small and thin . The impact was so sudden and so violent that the bonnet and windscreen of the executioner \u2019s car were smashed to pieces . The victim \u2019s internal organs , also in pieces , were scattered over a radius of QUANTITY . PERSON \u2019s friends in the police said that the executioner \u2019s car had been travelling at CARDINAL km.p.h . Unfortunately for PERSON , the victim \u2019s soninlaw is the university lecturer PERSON ...", "Initially , ORG obtained a ruling that there was no case to answer , and the case was closed . However , PERSON subsequently sent a memorandum to the Procurator - General of GPE and the case was reopened . Sickened by the machinations of those in power , whose excesses are such that the ORG \u2019s exploits in GPE surpass even those in the capital , PERSON dismissed his lawyer and lost the case following an appeal by ORG . The executioner was merely ordered to pay the victim \u2019s family CARDINAL lei in damages . PERSON then made CARDINAL last - ditch attempt to get rid of ORG . Shortly before the appointment of the prefects and deputy prefects , he tried desperately to alert the Civil Service Minister and the Prime Minister to the fact that PERSON was not fit for the job of deputy prefect , as he was guilty of killing through negligence .", "But the die has already been cast . The person pulling strings to have ORG appointed is the current Minister of Agriculture , GPE At first , GPE \u2019s case had been backed up to prime ministerial level by his colleague P.A. , ORG member of parliament for GPE and a university lecturer . But , under pressure from the rector of PERSON , a leading ORG member , PERSON was forced to drop the case unconditionally and hold his tongue . The same sources say that the rector himself had come under intense pressure from GPE [ the Minister of Agriculture ] to persuade PERSON to drop his complaint against ORG . And PERSON , by way of thanks for being found not guilty and having his reputation restored vis - \u00e0 - vis his superiors , never made any apology , not even a purely formal one , to the victim \u2019s family .", "Our readers are no doubt well aware that ORG is the most ardent supporter of GPE \u2019s election to the chair of the PSD county branch . \u201d", "On DATE PERSON lodged a criminal complaint with ORG , alleging that the applicant had made several defamatory and insulting statements in his article , in breach of ORG and CARDINAL of LAW . He also applied to be joined as a civil party to the proceedings against the applicant and the DATE review ORG , the party with civil liability .", "Although the applicant was summoned to appear and a warrant was issued for him to be brought immediately before the court , he did not attend any court hearing , nor did he produce any evidence in his defence .", "In a judgment of DATE , the court rejected the criminal complaint on the ground that there was no evidence in the case file that the applicant had published the article with the intention of insulting or defaming the complainant . The court therefore acquitted the applicant , finding that CARDINAL of the elements constituting the offences of insult and defamation was lacking , namely intent .", "However , the court observed that the applicant had accused the complainant of causing a road traffic accident by driving under the influence of alcohol and of unfairly dismissing the secretary - general of the prefect \u2019s office and the mayor of a municipality . The court considered that those assertions were inaccurate , since the courts which had tried PERSON on a charge of manslaughter had not found him guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol . It also observed that the QUANTITY persons referred to above had been removed from office by order of the prefect , and that there was nothing to suggest that the complainant had influenced the decisions in any way .", "In view of the circumstances , the court found that the complainant should be awarded damages since , while the offences of which the applicant stood accused did not fall within the sphere of criminal law , they were such as to render him liable in tort , as he had not checked thoroughly the facts set out in his article . Accordingly , under LAW and CARDINAL of the Civil Code , the court ordered the applicant and the DATE review jointly and severally to pay the complainant MONEY ( ROL ) in respect of the non - pecuniary damage sustained .", "The applicant , the DATE review ORG and the complainant all lodged appeals against the judgment with ORG . The applicant appealed against the award of compensation for nonpecuniary damage , arguing that the complainant had not proved the existence of such damage . The complainant , for his part , requested that the applicant be convicted of insult and defamation and that the amount of compensation be increased .", "On DATE the court allowed the request for an adjournment lodged by the applicant \u2019s lawyer . At a hearing on DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer raised an objection of unconstitutionality in respect of the first CARDINAL paragraphs of LAW and requested the court to stay its decision on the merits and to refer the case to ORG . He argued in particular that , for a criminal court to decide on a claim for damages without the civil party having paid stamp duty , when the defendant had been acquitted , was in breach of the constitutional principles of protection of private property and prohibition of discrimination with regard to the payment of taxes and levies . The applicant \u2019s lawyer alleged that the exemption from stamp duty gave the civil party an unfair advantage over individuals who , in order to have access to a civil court , had to pay stamp duty in proportion to the amount being claimed .", "On DATE , under the third and sixth paragraphs of LAW of ORG ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the court declared the objection inadmissible on the ground that ORG had already ruled several times , notably on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE and DATE , on the constitutionality of the LAW in question , and had found it to be compatible with LAW .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer lodged a memorial with the registry of ORG , objecting that DATE paragraphs of LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL were in breach of LAW . He submitted that the condition laid down in the first paragraph of the section in question for the referral of an objection to ORG , namely that the provision in issue must be decisive for the outcome of the case , allowed the courts a margin of appreciation and was therefore contrary to the constitutional principle of free access to a court . Pointing out that the third paragraph of the section in question ruled out referral to ORG only of objections relating to provisions which had already been found to be unconstitutional , the lawyer concluded that the court should have referred his first objection to ORG .", "On DATE the court observed that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had attended any hearings , although the applicant had been repeatedly given notice to appear . The court dismissed the objection of unconstitutionality raised DATE , finding that it had already been examined at the hearing of DATE .", "The hearing was held DATE and , in a fresh decision on the merits , the court allowed the complainant \u2019s appeal and ordered the applicant to pay a criminal fine of ROL CARDINAL,CARDINAL for insult and defamation . It also ordered him , jointly and severally with the DATE review , to pay the complainant ROL CARDINAL in compensation for the nonpecuniary damage sustained .", "The court found that the assertions concerning the removal from office of the mayor of a municipality and the complainant \u2019s having driven while under the influence of alcohol had been defamatory , since they had lacked any factual basis and even the most cursory checking of the facts by the applicant would have revealed the truth . In that connection , the court pointed out that the mayor in question had been removed from office by an order of the prefect dated DATE , published in DATE , and that ORG , in a final judgment of DATE , had found the complainant not guilty in relation to the road traffic accident , taking the view that the victim had been entirely at fault , having crossed the road without due care and attention .", "In the circumstances , the court found that the use of the term \u201c executioner \u201d had been insulting .", "In a dissenting opinion , CARDINAL of the judges took the view that the applicant should have been acquitted , as account should have been taken of the fact that the DATE review ORG had a reputation as a satirical publication which made frequent revelations concerning the professional and private conduct of politicians . He added that the complainant could have obtained satisfaction by making use of his right of reply .", "\u201c Any attack on an individual \u2019s honour and reputation through words , gestures or other means shall be punishable by a prison sentence of DATE or by payment of a fine . \u201d", "\u201c Any public statement or allegation concerning an individual which , if true , would render that individual liable to a criminal , administrative or disciplinary penalty or expose him or her to public opprobrium , shall be punishable by a prison sentence of DATE or by payment of a fine . \u201d", "\u201c Evidence of the truth of such a statement or allegation shall be admissible where it was made in order to protect a legitimate interest .
