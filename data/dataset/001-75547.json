THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP citizen who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a solicitor lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s son PERSON died on DATE . He was shot dead by CARDINAL serving soldiers with ORG ( Guardsmen PERSON and PERSON ) . On DATE Mr PERSON and PERSON Fisher were convicted of his murder and sentenced to life imprisonment .", "At trial both guardsmen had raised a number of defences including self - defence / defence of others and the reasonable use of force to effect an arrest .", "In his judgment ( which ran to CARDINAL pages ) the trial judge ( PERSON ) rejected all of their defences and convicted the CARDINAL guardsmen of murder . He said :", "\u201c The whole image of the case most strongly depicted nothing more than that of a cheeky young man after an impudent and improper confrontation with ORG running away as hard as he possibly could , running to escape being caught by pursuing soldiers , because of this impropriety and nothing more . That picture did not suggest a young man wandering around the district with a bomb in a bag and then when stopped and checked out for TIME running off with it , intending to throw it if need be . Nor did it suggest a plan , even a TIME plan to lead a patrol into a trap or ambush from behind a car . All the evidence underlined the fact that the deceased was running away from his pursuers increasing the distance between them , intent on shaking them off and incidentally increasing the range of any throwing distance of a coffee jar bomb .", "As a witness Fisher was far from impressive . He became evasive and then untruthful as soon as he grasped the adverse significance of a point in cross - examination . I have already referred to some of these . His general demeanour when giving evidence did nothing , I am afraid , to lodge with me the possibility that he really believed at any time that he or his comrades were under threat from the deceased or anyone else . In addition his case raised very many improbabilities , the sum of which pointed to the same conclusion .", "On the issue as to whether ORG case is a false CARDINAL or not , I gain very much assistance from the acts and omissions at the scene itself that immediately followed the shooting by the participants . They are done and said or not done or said by those who participated in the events and when they are said or done they contain a spontaneity and lack of calculation that gives them credibility . And when they are not said or done I attach great significance to that . Accordingly I put the following omissions in this category , the absence of any attempt to recover a coffee jar bomb , the failure by PERSON to mention or warn of its suspected existence to others and the failure by him when asked by the police constable what happened to say something like \u2018 he \u2019s got a bomb\u2019 . These point strongly to the absence of any belief by PERSON that the deceased was or might have been armed .", "The events the accused PERSON had to deal with took place in daylight , on TIME in DATE , with the suspect on foot retreating from him at all times and increasing the distance between them and over a distance of parts of CARDINAL streets . It was not a panic situation which required split second decision or split second action , if any action at all . These circumstances must be contrasted with a soldier who is suddenly confronted on TIME with a danger that advances to him or is directed at him , from the cover of a moving vehicle or a place of concealment . That may be a quite different situation .", "As in the case of PERSON , the events of DATE September TIME did not , or could not , in my opinion have put PERSON in any panic situation or in any situation which called for split second reaction . The chase after the deceased was merely to catch and detain . PERSON had him under observation for a considerable period and over a comparatively long distance in these circumstances . During all the time PERSON had him in his vision , he was running away from PERSON and increasing the distance between them . For the greater part of this time , he posed no threat to PERSON as PERSON admitted . Realising he could not catch him , as he must have done , he could have broken off the chase for he believed PERSON had taken his name and address . The first shot which PERSON believed came from the deceased , did not strike PERSON , and after it had been fired , the deceased kept on running . PERSON had then time to stop and reflect and take cover in a doorway and allow the deceased , for the time being at least , to get away .", "On the totality of the evidence , including my assessment of his credibility , my consequent disbelief of crucial parts of his case of self - defence and the prevention of crime , the numerous improbabilities of the truth of that case that the evidence indicates , I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable possibility that Guardsman PERSON held or may have held an honest belief or indeed any belief that the deceased carried or may have carried a coffee jar bomb or that he was about to be attacked or his life was in danger . Therefore I find the ORG case proved beyond reasonable doubt that his case of the use of necessary force in self - defence or in the prevention of crime was false and made up .", "On all the evidence I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable possibility that PERSON held or may have held an honest belief or indeed any belief that the deceased fired a gun at him or that his life was or those of his comrades were in danger or had been put in danger by the deceased and that this was the situation when PERSON fired his shots .", "Each of the accused clearly fired their aimed shots at the deceased with intent to kill or cause him grievous bodily harm . PERSON admitted he intended to kill , but PERSON was reluctant to go that far and admitted he intended to cause really serious bodily harm . If it could be said that PERSON and PERSON in shooting at the deceased with that intent were each carrying out the command of their sergeant to \u201c Grab him \u201d , that is , to effect his arrest , then I would have no difficulty in concluding that to fire aimed shots at an unarmed man , carrying neither bomb nor gun , was beyond reasonable doubt , unreasonable force . I would hold the same position when there was no reasonable possibility that either PERSON or PERSON honestly held the belief that he was armed .", "There was no possible justification for either of the accused to shoot at the deceased . \u201d", "The guardsmen appealed against their conviction to ORG . That appeal was dismissed by way of judgment delivered on DATE . The ORG said :", "\u201c We consider that the evidence clearly established that when they fired the appellants were acting in concert and shared a common intention to stop the deceased by shooting him . \u201d", "Their application for leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE .", "In DATE , the matter of the discharge of Guardsmen PERSON and PERSON from the army was referred to an ORG under ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL(d ) which provided that where a soldier had been sentenced to imprisonment by a civil court he should be dismissed unless there were exceptional reasons to retain him . ORG considered that , while it accepted the decisions of the trial and appeal courts , the guardsmen had shown contrition for their action which they admitted was an error of judgment which they very much regretted and having regard , inter alia , to the ORG \u2019s responsibility for their training , their loyalty to the ORG and previously unblemished records , found that there were exceptional circumstances justifying their retention in the army .", "The guardsmen spent DATE in custody and after their release from prison , continued to serve as soldiers . In addition , the time spent in custody by them did not , in fact , have any adverse impact on their military careers as it has been included in the computation of various benefits based on time served in the ORG .", "The applicant brought judicial review proceedings challenging the ORG decision ( ORG [ DATE ] NI CARDINAL ) . On DATE , Mr Justice PERSON found that the reasons given by ORG for its decision conflicted with the findings of the trial judge , in particular as it was clear from the trial judge \u2019s judgment that the killing was not the result of an \u201c error of judgment \u201d by the CARDINAL soldiers . He indicated that the matter should be considered afresh .", "On DATE , after receiving written representations from the applicant \u2019s solicitors , ORG , ORG and ORG and an oral hearing attended by the guardsmen and their lawyers , a differently constituted ORG decided on DATE that the soldiers should not be discharged from the ORG . It considered exceptional reasons existed in that :", "( a ) the guardsmen were relatively young and inexperienced when the incident took place , it was their first tour of duty in GPE and they had only been there for DATE ;", "( b ) the general security situation was tense in the area where the unit had recently suffered casualties including a fatality and they had been advised the situation was high risk ;", "( c ) the army had been responsible for training the soldiers but could not prepare them for every eventuality ;", "( d ) Guardsman PERSON had expressed genuine concern for the victim \u2019s family and Guardsman PERSON had expressed genuine regret ;", "( e ) neither had a previous criminal record and their conduct in custody after conviction had been exemplary ;", "( f ) the ORG were convinced that there would be no repetition , both men having learned a bitter and lasting lesson", "( g ) both had been utterly loyal to the army during the procedure , clearly wished to serve their country and their commanding officer had spoken highly of them , in particular with reference to their service in operations in GPE and GPE , in which their personal conduct had been of the highest standard .", "This decision was also challenged by the applicant . In the second proceedings ( ORG No . CARDINAL ) , Mr Justice PERSON found on DATE that ORG had been entitled to reach the findings above and that while considerations of the seriousness of their offence and past army practice of discharging offenders militated strongly against retention they did not remove the decision to allow the CARDINAL soldiers to resume their careers from the range of available options . As regarded the applicant \u2019s submissions on LAW , while doubting that the applicant could claim to be a victim in this regard , he found nothing in GPE jurisprudence to require additional punishment beyond that imposed by due process of law and considered that the CARDINAL men had been held duly accountable as required by LAW . The ORG decision could not be construed as condonation as the ORG made it abundantly clear that it accepted without qualification the trial judge \u2019s findings . Nor did he find that the applicant could claim to have been discriminated against under LAW .", "The applicant appealed . On DATE , ORG gave its decision . The Lord Chief Justice found that reasons ( a ) to ( c ) and ( g ) could arguably be regarded as exceptional reasons , Lord Justice PERSON considered that only ( g ) could be regarded as an exceptional reason making it desirable to retain the men in the army , while Lord Justice PERSON considered all the factors relied on would be likely to have existed in the cases of soldiers previously discharged for offences and neither individually or cumulatively amounted to exceptional reasons . In his judgment he stated :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL ] ... the use of excessive force resulting in death , is by no means a unique event arising from the activities of security forces . Where death is caused by the use of excessive force by servants of the ORG , it should be a cause of great public concern . Such events diminish confidence in the maintenance of law and order and endanger the peace of the community if not treated with proper regard by the organs of the ORG .", "[ CARDINAL ] The vast majority of soldiers who have served in GPE have acted with discipline and restraint often under considerable and deliberate provocation and under constant threat from persons difficult to identify and distinguish from law - abiding citizens . It is no compliment to them if those who have not acted with the same degree of self - control are not treated as lawbreakers , however understanding and sympathetic one might be to the dangers and difficulties of service in GPE as being capable in itself of amounting to \u2018 exceptional reasons\u2019 . \u201d", "[ CARDINAL ] If we consider the circumstances of the offence to discover whether it may be said that there were any exceptional circumstances which might provide a reason for retention of the soldiers , it appears that as against other cases of excessive force resulting in death , there is no exceptional feature which would reflect to the credit of the CARDINAL soldiers involved in this case .", "[ CARDINAL ] The shooting took place in daylight , there was no confrontation and no confusion at the scene , there was no menacing crowd or mob . The lives of the solders were not under any risk and the trial judge rejected the proposition that they believed that there was any immediate risk to them . Nothing had occurred to justify the use of a lethal weapon . \u201d", "He went on to say :", "\u201c [ CARDINAL ] However , quite apart from the issue of what may constitute exceptional reasons , I find it difficult to comprehend the view of ORG that it is desirable to retain PERSON and PERSON in army service .", "[ DATE ] Since a sentence of imprisonment almost invariably results in discharge it is not easy to discern any feature in this case which explains the obvious sympathy and concern which all superior officers concerned have displayed for the situation of PERSON and PERSON .", "[ CARDINAL ] The murder of an innocent fellow - citizen should rank as a crime of the greatest magnitude , and one would expect that soldiers who have misused the lethal weaponry with which they are equipped in order to take away a life without justification should be regarded as quite unfitted for further army service .", "[ CARDINAL ] There may be considerations of morale and discipline which make discharge of the soldiers undesirable but if so one would have expected them to have been aired at the hearing of ORG or openly expressed in the ruling . \u201d", "However , he noted that the soldiers had a substantial argument that the army \u2019s tardiness in determining the question of their discharge had materially altered their situation and created exceptional reasons for their retention . As the interests represented by the applicant would not be materially affected by the remedy , it should be sufficient to satisfy her and the public concerned that a declaration be made vindicating the objection to the army \u2019s decision . He concluded that decisions on what was best for the army and its soldiers were best left to the ORG and that it would be an unwise usurpation of power to intervene by mandamus to impose a course of action on ORG authorities .", "All CARDINAL judges agreed with ORG judge \u2019s conclusions under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "ORG ordered the following declaration :", "\u201c Taken together , the reasons expressed by ORG for the retention in ORG service of ORG and PERSON in its determination of DATE do not amount to exceptional reasons . \u201d", "The ORG did not take any action consequent on ORG ruling . In correspondence to the applicant \u2019s solicitors the relevant Minister stated that", "\u201c ... ORG has no plans to revisit the question of the employment of the guardsmen . \u201d", "On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application for judicial review of the ORG \u2019s failure to act in light of the ruling of ORG and to dismiss the soldiers . Mr ORG noted that ORG had expressly declined to grant coercive relief and held that the ORG were under no legal compulsion to take any further action . There was no indication that the ORG had failed to take the entirety of the judgments into account or had failed to understand them and the decision to retain the soldiers in the army remained effective . He refused relief , considering that the application was an impermissible attempt to circumvent the order of ORG .", "ORG state ( at para . CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c A soldier is to be discharged if he has been sentenced :", "by a civil court or by court - martial to imprisonment ( including a suspended sentence , but not a suspended committal ) or to detention or to any other form of custodial sentence ;", "By a court - martial to a period of detention which on confirmation is for DATE or more .", "If in the opinion of the commanding officer there are exceptional reasons that make retention of the soldier desirable then the case is to be submitted with valid and explicit reasons to the Director of ORG for a decision . The case is to be forwarded through the immediate superior headquarters with copies going to the next higher headquarters when this has been so directed . Where a case to an immediate headquarters is not supported it should be sent to the next higher headquarters for further comment before being sent to the Director of ORG ) . ORG ) ) should be informed in advance by the commanding officer of any such cases that are controversial or high profile so that , if necessary , direction can be given for the case to be staffed through the full chain of command . \u201d", "In the period from DATE , DATE officers and men were discharged under PERSON while only a total of CARDINAL were retained ( i.e. under PERCENT or CARDINAL case in DATE ) . Information furnished to ORG by those acting for ORG made it clear that no soldier who had been sentenced to an immediate custodial sentence of DATE imprisonment was retained in the army and no soldier who had been convicted of an offence related to drugs had been retained ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
