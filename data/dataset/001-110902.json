The applicant was born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE . He applied for asylum DATE . He stated , in interviews and written submissions , that he is of mixed NORP / NORP ethnicity and that his mother and younger brother had been killed in DATE during ethnic violence . Following the victory in the DATE general elections by PERSON ( ORG pour la D\u00e9fense de la D\u00e9mocratie ORG ) , that party had set out to imprison and assassinate people suspected of being members of Palipehutu - FNL ( ORG pour la ORG du Peuple Hutu \u2013 Forces ORG ) and other organisations hostile to LOC . He claimed that he and his family had been threatened and harassed on several occasions , being accused of collaborating with the ORG group . On DATE CNDD - ORG supporters had come to the family \u2019s home and had killed the applicant \u2019s father and arrested the applicant . He had then been detained for DATE , during which time he had been beaten and tortured DATE . A return to GPE would entail the risk of renewed detention and torture as well as death , as he would be able to give evidence about what had happened to his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected his application . It stated that the general situation in GPE , due to recent improvements , was not a sufficient ground for asylum . It further considered that the events alleged by the applicant had to be seen as acts of individual soldiers which did not constitute persecution by the PERSON authorities . Moreover , the applicant had not shown that the authorities were unwilling or unable to protect him from such crimes . ORG also considered that the situation in GPE had changed since DATE and that there was no evidence that the applicant would any longer be of interest to the authorities or the ORG . Thus , he had not made plausible that there was a real risk of ill - treatment upon return .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( NORP - domstolen ) in GPE . He submitted a search warrant dated DATE , purportedly issued by the NORP intelligence service ( ORG ) , which had allegedly been given to a friend of his father and forwarded to the applicant by that friend \u2019s wife . He further submitted a death certificate concerning his father issued by a hospital in GPE . At the oral hearing before the court , he claimed that he had not been politically active in GPE but had been involved in an organisation working for peace . He further stated that a guard had helped him to flee from detention . Then his father \u2019s friend had contacted a man who had taken him out of the country . His father \u2019s friend had subsequently been arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the appeal . It noted that the applicant had not proved his identity . Moreover , it found that his explanation how he had come into possession of the above - mentioned documents of the security police and the hospital was peculiar . In these circumstances , the court considered that the documents had a low value as evidence . It further called into question the applicant \u2019s account on how he had been able to flee the prison and then leave the country without himself showing identity papers en route . Thus , in general , the applicant was not credible . As to the alleged risks facing him in GPE , the court noted that he had not been politically active or otherwise active in seeking justice for the alleged crimes against his family . It therefore questioned that the PERSON authorities would have any particular interest in him .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s further appeal , on DATE ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused him leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL subsequent occasions , the applicant claimed that there were impediments to his deportation and requested that his application for a residence permit be examined anew . In support of the second of these applications , he submitted a birth certificate and other documents to prove his identity . He further stated that he had been the deputy head of the youth section of ORG ( ORG pour la PERSON ) , a NORP organisation working for peace and reconciliation in GPE . Because of his membership in ORG and also due to his having refused to join the ORG , the latter organisation had tried to kill him several times and had also extorted food and money from his family . Moreover , in DATE , the applicant had been informed that his remaining CARDINAL siblings , who had been abducted by CNDD - ORG members on CARDINAL DATE , had been found murdered . Previously , he had not known of their fate .", "CARDINAL . By decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE , ORG found that the applicant \u2019s new submissions were just additions or modifications of circumstances already alleged which could neither qualify as impediments to deportation or reasons to examine his asylum application anew .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his third application for a new examination , the applicant added that he had been politically active in GPE , having organised and participated in several demonstrations against the government of GPE . He had also received telephone calls from an unknown person , who had stated that the NORP government knew of these activities and would kill him upon return to the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG did not find that the applicant had made it plausible that he would risk persecution in GPE on account of sur place activities in GPE . Thus , no new circumstances constituting an impediment to his deportation had been adduced . Nor were there reasons to re - examine the question of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeals against ORG decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE were rejected by ORG . It appears that the applicant did not appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , following the ORG \u2019s decision under LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG decided to stay the applicant \u2019s deportation until further notice .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . An alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( LAW , LAW CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country ( Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . Special consideration should be given , inter alia , to the alien \u2019s health status . According to the preparatory works ( Government PERSON , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This is the case where new circumstances have emerged which indicate that there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) . If a residence permit can not be granted under this criteria , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not having done so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
