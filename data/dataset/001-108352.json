The applicants are NORP nationals , except the applicant PERSON ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) who is a non - citizen of GPE . Their names , dates of birth , places of residence and the dates of introduction of applications are listed in the appendix to this decision .", "CARDINAL . According to the amendments to ORG ( \u201c ORG maternit\u0101tes un slim\u012bbas apdro\u0161in\u0101\u0161anu \u201d ) , from DATE the parental benefit ( vec\u0101ku pabalsts ) was allocated to socially insured persons ( to CARDINAL of the parents or a guardian ) who either did not gain income because s / he was on parental leave or , on the contrary , did not use the parental leave and continued working . The benefit was paid until the child reached the age of one .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 children were born in the period DATE and DATE , except CARDINAL applicants whose children were born shortly afterwards ( see the appended list ) .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of a decision of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) the applicants , whose children were born before DATE , were entitled to a parental benefit in the amount of PERCENT of the average salary calculated for the purposes of social insurance deductions . Until DATE the applicants received the parental benefit in full amount and continued working .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE introduced changes to GPE which came into force on DATE and deleted , inter alia , the provision according to which the parental benefit could be allocated to a parent or a guardian who was not on a parental leave but continued working . LAW during DATE ( thereinafter \u2013 Law on Payments ) ( ORG valsts pensiju un valsts pabalstu izmaksu laika period\u0101 no .

In particular , it provided that starting from DATE to CARDINAL DATE the parents ( guardians ) who gained income during the maternity period should receive PERCENT of the parental benefit allocated to them .", "CARDINAL . Each applicant submitted a constitutional complaint seeking ORG to find that provision CARDINAL of the Law on Payments run contrary to Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW . They argued that by virtue of the decision of the ORG they were entitled to a parental benefit , and that , therefore , the legislative changes infringed their legitimate expectations to receive the parental benefit in full amount until the child reached the age of one . The applicants whose children were born after DATE argued that they had the same legitimate expectations arising from the law in force at the time when they planned their family .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court on DATE found that the contested provision was constitutional . Firstly , it concluded that the employed and unemployed parents were not in a comparable situation , therefore differentiated benefit rates did not lead to unequal treatment . Secondly , ORG recognised that even if the parents had had legitimate expectation to receive the parental benefit in full amount , the contested measure in the particular economic situation in GPE had a legitimate aim and it did strike a fair balance between the general interests and the applicants\u2019 rights :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL ... [ The amendments to the social insurance benefits in force as from DATE ] caused a situation that families could choose to attribute parental benefit to the parent who received higher remuneration before the birth of a child . For instance , in a family where CARDINAL of the parents was unemployed before the birth of a child , whilst the other parent was employed , the benefit was allocated to the one who was employed and received a wage ... rather than the one who was not employed and was on a parental leave . However , in cases when both parents were employed before the birth of the child , the family asked to allocate the parental benefit to the one who received a higher salary , even thought de fact it was the other parent who was on the parental leave .... .", "Such application of the parental benefit was in conflict with the conclusions made in the judgment no . DATE - CARDINAL - CARDINAL by ORG regarding the effective social insurance system of the ORG because in the result of this a group of persons was formed who were not socially insured during the childcare period . For instance , if parental benefit was allocated to an employed parent who had a higher wage , social insurance payments were made from the wage of this particular person . However , the other parent who was on childcare leave and did not receive parental benefit , was not socially insured since he or she received neither benefit , nor wage . Therefore persons could not receive any other social insurance services because they have not made social insurance payments for DATE .", "Moreover , the newly established type of insurance , i.e. parental insurance did not provide for an additional social insurance payment rate , therefore it deteriorated the situation in the ORG social insurance budget . CARDINAL of the reasons of such a huge deficit in the social insurance budget was inconsiderate definition of parenting benefit as a type of social insurance . In DATE , CARDINAL lats were spent for the disbursement of this benefit ( when introducing this benefit , it was planned to use CARDINAL lats ) , and already CARDINAL lats were used for this purpose in DATE before the contested provision was adopted .", "( ... )", "CARDINAL . The contested provision was adopted during economic recession in GPE .... In DATE , GPE underwent the most rapid reduction of economic activities in the entire ORG . ... During this period , the financial deficit of the state consolidated budget reached CARDINAL lats or PERCENT from ORG , and it was estimated that the deficit may reach CARDINAL lats or PERCENT from ORG by DATE . As a result , both the functioning of the ORG and economic growth in the foreseeable future would be endangered ...", "( ... )", "CARDINAL . If amendment of legal regulatory framework serves for the benefit of the society , then restriction of the legal trust of persons is permitted . The contested norm has been adopted with the purpose to balance revenues and expenses of the ORG special budget of social insurance . Economic recession denied the possibility for the ORG to guarantee such amount of social security that was established during the period of economic growth of the ORG . If no measures were taken to solve the situation , this would have influenced the possibility of the ORG to ensure the right of persons to social security and to guarantee sustainability of social security system . This would not comply with the principle of a socially responsible ORG .", "Consequently , restriction of the right of employed parents to receive parental benefit at full extent during the transitional period has been established with a view to ensure substantial interests of the society . In the result of this , a fair balance between restriction of legal security of a person and the right of the society to a sustainable State social insurance system and balanced ORG budget was ensured \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court recognised that the reduced amount of the benefit to employed parents in the transitional period was a proportional measure in that the employed parents still continued to receive both the salary and PERCENT of the reduced parental benefit . Consequently , their family income increased in comparison to the unemployed parents who received only the benefit .", "CARDINAL . The dissenting opinion to the aforementioned judgment of ORG stated :", "\u201c It has been concluded in the ORG that a transitional period of CARDINAL days has been observed , which guarantees protection of legitimate expectations , whilst the amount of benefit to be disbursed has only been reduced ( see : PERSON \u2013 CARDINAL of the Judgment ) . I do not share this point of view . Even based on the strictest criteria for assessing legitimate expectations , the above mentioned transitional period could only be applied to those persons who have not been calculated and allocated the benefit before coming into force of LAW . It would be more appropriate for a socially responsible ORG not to change the amount of the benefit regarding all children who were incepted before coming into force of LAW .", "However , the amount of benefit for persons , to whom it has already been granted , was reduced in CARDINAL within the term of DATE ( the contested norm was adopted on DATE and came into force on DATE of DATE ) . In that short time , no one could change their life . For instance , those person who decided to take a child care leave because of the amendments to the legal regulatory framework , could not implement their intention because , pursuant to LAW ) of LAW , an employee has a duty to notify the employer in writing DATE in advance of the beginning and the length of the parental leave or parts thereof \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

The ORG shall provide special support to disabled children , children left without parental care or who have suffered from violence .", "CARDINAL . The law defines the state social benefit as a ORG monetary support , such as , for instance , child - care benefit , to individuals belonging to certain categories in situations when they bear additional expenditures or when those individuals do not gain income , and the compensation is not provided from ORG social insurance scheme . It is paid from the ORG budget .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provided that parental benefits were allocated to socially insured persons ( to CARDINAL of the parent or a guardian ) who either did not gain income because s / he was on parental leave or , did not use the parental leave and continued working .

[ With the amendment ] it was planned to disburse parental benefit to employed persons without restrictions and at full extent , these persons also receiving labour incomes ; however this does not comply with the essence of social insurance . Second , introduction of parental benefit would be ensured in the frameworks of the present social insurance payment rate ; therefore this would negatively influence social insurance special budget in the long term . Consequently , according to the prognosis of the social insurance budget model , the reserve accumulated in the social insurance special budget would be used DATE , i.e. already in DATE after introduction of parental benefit and disbursing it from the state social insurance budget in the frameworks of the actual social insurance payment rate \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL provides that an employed or a self - employed person who was granted a parental benefit with respect to a child born until DATE shall receive the parental benefit in the amount of PERCENT of the amount of the benefit granted .", "CARDINAL . NORP The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the aforementioned law provided that it shall ensure functioning of the fundamental principle of state social insurance . Namely , the State social insurance substitutes certain income in a situation when a person loses earning from labour . If a person takes care for a child aged DATE and at the same time continues working , s / he does not lose the income from labour . Moreover , persons who receive both a wage and a parental benefit enjoy better circumstances when compared to those parents who are on a childcare leave and receive parental benefit only .", "CARDINAL .
