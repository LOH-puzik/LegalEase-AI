In reaching that conclusion the ORG relied , inter alia , on the information on air pollution in the whole town . In addition , the ORG referred to the data collected by ORG for ORG at the monitoring post situated at CARDINAL Zhukov Street ( post no . CARDINAL ) . That post was the closest CARDINAL to the applicant 's house , and in the absence of any more precise measurement , the data obtained from post no .

Moreover , an over - concentration of various other substances , such as manganese , benzopyrene and sulphur dioxide , was registered during that period ( for further details see \u00a7 CARDINAL et seq . of the ORG judgment , with further references ) . In DATE an over - concentration of manganese ( CARDINAL times higher than MPL ) , dust ( CARDINAL times higher ) , and formaldehyde ( CARDINAL times higher ) was registered .", "CARDINAL . As regards the houses of the second and third applicants , they are located somewhere in between post no . CARDINAL and post no . CARDINAL , situated at CARDINAL , Stalevarov street . As follows from the data produced by the Government in the ORG case , the pollution levels registered there were slightly lower than those registered at post no . CARDINAL . Nevertheless , in DATE the concentration of formaldehyde in the air was from CARDINAL times higher than the respective ORG . The concentration of carbon disulphide was from CARDINAL times higher ( except for DATE , when it did not reach dangerous levels ) .

In DATE the over - concentration of the following substances was registered : nitrogen dioxide ( CARDINAL times higher than ORG ) , carbon disulphide ( CARDINAL times ) , and formaldehyde ( CARDINAL times ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards general effects of industrial pollution on the population of GPE , the Government produced a report , prepared in DATE by ORG in GPE in order to delimit the boundaries of the sanitary security zone . The conclusions of the report may be summarised as follows . The steel - plant 's emissions in DATE were CARDINAL as much as in DATE . However , in DATE the concentration of several polluting substances in the air of the residential areas of the town still exceeded safe levels . At the same time the birth rate in the town was higher than the average in the country and the morbidity rate was lower . Most of the deceases registered in the town were not place - specific . However , prevalence of some chronic respiratory diseases was directly linked to the distance of the patients ' houses from the territory of the steel - plant . The measures provided by the steel - plant in order to reduce emissions , would be capable of reducing health risks for the population of GPE . If all these measures were implemented , by DATE the concentration of pollutants in the air of the residential areas of the town could reach CARDINAL MPL , which is the acceptable level . It would be possible to establish a sanitary security zone at a distance of QUANTITY from the main sources of pollution . Having regard to the measures , scheduled for DATE , it would be possible to fix the boundaries of the sanitary security zone at the confines of the residential areas of the city .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of that report the Chief Sanitary Inspector of GPE issued a certificate , confirming that the project \u201c On creating a sanitary security zone around the ORG \u201d was in conformity with the requirements of the relevant NORP legislation . That certificate concluded that the realisation of the project would allow by DATE a complete reduction of the concentration of air contaminants to hygienic standards , which would \u201c guarantee reaching acceptable levels of public health hazards \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Government further produced a set of materials , prepared by the \u201c ORG called \u201c For the important contribution to the environmental protection \u201d . These materials described the environmental protection policy of the plant , environmental risks assessment mechanisms in place , the management structure of the environmental protection programs , particular technological measures implemented by the plant in order to reduce pollution levels and to normalise the environmental situation in the town , payments to the local budget for excessive pollution levels , participation of the plant in environmental education programs etc .", "CARDINAL . The Government further produced a certificate , issued by ORG , which confirmed that the management systems of the \u201c ORG in the areas of environmental protection and occupational hazards were in accordance with the standards , applied by that organisation .", "CARDINAL . As regards the effects of the pollution on the applicants ' health , the Government produced the following information . As regards the first applicant , the Government did not have official information on her state of health , and , therefore , could not comment on it . As to the second and third applicants , according to ORG of GPE , their diseases were occupational or age - related . As to the fourth applicant , the Government stated that in DATE she had been excluded from the list of people in need of regular examinations by the GPE dispensary . In sum , the Government claimed that the applicants ' diseases were of general character and had not been caused by the their living near the steel - plant .", "CARDINAL . The applicants claimed that the air pollution in the area where they lived was and continued to be above safe levels . Thus , according to a letter of the Cherepovets Centre for Sanitary Control , DATE the average concentration of dust in the air within this zone exceeded the ORG by CARDINAL times , the concentration of carbon bisulphide \u2013 by CARDINAL times , the concentration of formaldehyde \u2013 by CARDINAL to CARDINAL times . ORG of GPE reported that the level of atmospheric pollution DATE within the zone was rated as \u201c high \u201d or \u201c very high \u201d .

According to the letter of the Head of ORG of GPE , in DATE atmospheric pollution in the town was rated as \u201c high \u201d . Namely , over - concentrations of formaldehyde , benzopyrene , dust and carbon disulphide were registered .", "CARDINAL . As regards DATE , the applicants referred to the information published on the website of ORG of ORG for ORG . This source reported that in DATE the concentration of formaldehyde in GPE was from CARDINAL to CARDINAL times higher than the respective MPL . According to an article published in the local newspaper \u201c PERSON \u201d in DATE the concentration of dust registered at post no . CARDINAL was CARDINAL times higher than ORG , the concentration of nitrogen dioxide was CARDINAL times higher , the concentration of carbonic oxide was CARDINAL times higher . Pollution levels registered at the post no . CARDINAL were QUANTITY CARDINAL and PERCENT than the corresponding MPLs .", "CARDINAL . The applicants also produced various medical documents , which confirmed that they suffered from certain chronic diseases . However , none of these documents certified that there was a link between any given illness and the place of residence of the respective applicant .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the applicants relied on the expert report of PERSON , Ph.D. , submitted to ORG in the ORG case . In that report Dr. ORG analysed the effects of several polluting substances , present in the town 's air in excessive quantities . As a result of his research Dr. ORG concluded that he would expect that the population residing within the sanitary security zone would suffer from excess incidences of various diseases , such as respiratory infections , cancer of nasal passages , chronic irritation of the eyes etc . Dr. PERSON attributed these effects to the emissions of the steel industry ( for further details see the ORG judgment , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Dr. PERSON updated his report , taking into account data produced by the Government . In this new report PERSON concluded that emissions of harmful pollutants from the Severstal steel - plant and ambient levels of pollutants in the vicinity of it had not substantially declined in DATE ; levels of dust , carbon disulfide and formaldehyde were still above permissible levels and were generally higher at monitoring stations closest to the Severstal facility . Dr. PERSON also found that there was no substantiation of the claim that ORG had complied with the NORP and international environmental requirements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant requested the municipality to confirm that her house was located within the sanitary security zone . On DATE the municipality replied that the boundary of the zone had not been officially delimited . On DATE , upon the applicant 's request , the ORG ordered the municipality to provide her with the information sought . That decision was upheld on DATE by ORG . ORG found that , pursuant to ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , the applicant 's house was indeed located within the zone .", "CARDINAL . Shortly thereafter the first applicant brought proceedings against the \u201c Severstal \u201d company . She claimed that the \u201c LAW \u201d , LAW adopted in DATE , imposed on the owners of the plant an obligation to take various environmental protection measures in the zone , including the resettlement of its inhabitants , which obligation the company had failed to observe . Consequently , she claimed the resettlement outside the zone or the payment of a sum sufficient to purchase new housing in a safer area .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rendered a judgment in that case . The court discharged the company from any obligation to resettle the applicant , and ordered the municipality to put the applicant on the general waiting list for the new housing . This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . The applicant was placed on CARDINAL waiting lists . In DATE the first applicant was no . DATE on the general waiting list and no . CARDINAL on the priority waiting list .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Presidium of the ORG quashed , by way of supervisory review , the judgment of DATE . The ORG established that the applicant lived in the sanitary security zone of the plant , where the concentration of by - products of steel production regularly exceeded the health limits . The ORG further criticized the judgment of DATE in the following words :", "\u201c The lower court did not assess whether the measures taken in order to resettle the residents of the sanitary security zone were adequate in comparison to the degree of the threat that the plaintiff encounters . As a result , the court did not establish whether providing PERSON with new housing under the provisions of the housing legislation by placing her on the waiting list could be regarded as giving her a real chance to live in an environment that is favourable for her life and health \u201d .", "The ORG further analysed the legislation and concluded that it was for the polluting enterprise to take all necessary measures and to \u201c develop \u201d the sanitary security zone around its LOC . The ORG remitted the case to the ORG for a fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the municipality challenged before the town court Resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE fixing the boundary of the zone . The applicant requested that she participate in the proceedings as a third party but this motion was refused . On DATE the ORG declared ORG no . CARDINAL invalid as ultra vires , in the presence of the only interested party \u2013 the municipality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant 's claims against the steel - plant . The court , referring to its judgment of DATE , held that the new boundary of the sanitary security zone had not been defined yet . ORG of DATE , referred to by the applicant , contained such measure as the resettlement of the zone residents . However , that program has been abolished by Government Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , which did not provide for any resettlement .", "CARDINAL . Further , the court found that the DATE town planning regulations provided that no housing should be situated within the sanitary security zone . However , those regulations had been adopted after the applicant 's house had been built and , therefore , could not be referred to . Finally , the court noted that the applicant 's family had moved to the flat at issue voluntarily .", "CARDINAL . The court also observed that the \u201c ORG was aware of the environmental consequences of its activities and was taking measures in order to reduce their impact .", "CARDINAL . The court concluded that the \u201c ORG could not be held responsible for not resettling the applicant from the zone . On DATE this decision was upheld by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the second , third and fourth applicants brought a court action against the company , seeking their resettlement outside the zone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rendered a judgment regarding the third applicant . On DATE this judgment was upheld by ORG on appeal . The judgment in respect of the second applicant was rendered by the town court on DATE , and upheld on appeal on DATE . The judgment with respect to the fourth applicant was delivered on DATE and upheld on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In each case the courts came to the same conclusion by using a similar line of reasoning , which can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The courts noted that , before DATE , the applicants ' flats had been owned by ORG , which had also owned the steel plant . Following the privatisation of the plant in DATE , it became a privately - owned entity , while the applicants ' flats had become the property of the local authorities . The courts concluded that the company was therefore under no obligation to resettle the applicants .", "CARDINAL . The courts further recognised that the applicants lived in the sanitary security zone , where the concentration of dangerous substances and the level of noise exceeded the maximum limits permitted . The courts in principle accepted the applicants ' claims , stating that they had the right in domestic law to be resettled by the local authorities . However , no specific order to resettle the applicants was made by the courts in the operative parts of the judgments . Instead , the courts stated that the municipality should put the applicants on a waiting list to obtain new housing ( see the ' Relevant domestic law and practice ' part below ) .", "CARDINAL . Enforcement proceedings were opened in this respect . In the absence of any special procedure for the resettlement of residents of the sanitary security zone , the applicants were put on the general waiting list for those entitled to better housing on social grounds . The second applicant was put on the list on DATE with CARDINAL , and the third and fourth applicants on DATE with the numbers CARDINAL and DATE , respectively .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants brought new court proceedings , alleging that the judgments of DATE had not been duly enforced . The applicants claimed flats in an ecologically - safe area , or the means to buy new flats themselves .", "CARDINAL . The Cherepovets Town Court dismissed their claims . The court established that no special waiting list existed for the zone residents and that on different dates the applicants had been put on the general waiting list . Therefore , the judgments of DATE had been duly executed , and there was no need to undertake any further measures . These decisions were upheld by ORG with respect to the second , third and fourth applicants on DATE , DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL .
