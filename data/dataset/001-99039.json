THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON Geertruida PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant , a philosopher by profession , is currently unemployed and was in receipt of benefits pursuant to ORG for the Unemployed ( Rijksgroepregeling werkloze werknemers ) from DATE . As of CARDINAL DATE she received benefits pursuant to ORG ( PERSON ) . Both ORG and LAW stipulated that an unemployed person was eligible for benefits provided he or she attempted to obtain and was willing to accept employment \u201c deemed suitable \u201d ( passende arbeid ) for him or her .", "On DATE , FAC was replaced by ORG ( PERSON Bijstand ) .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant was informed that , as from DATE , she had to fulfil the obligations pursuant to this LAW , including the obligation to obtain and be willing to take up \u201c generally accepted \u201d employment ( algemeen geaccepteerde arbeid ) . Non - compliance would lead to a reduction of the applicant 's benefit payments .", "On DATE , the applicant raised an objection against the letter , which was rejected on DATE by the Mayor and Aldermen ( PERSON ) of GPE .", "By judgment of DATE ORG upheld the applicant 's appeal against the decision of the Mayor and Aldermen , but only because it considered that those authorities should have declared the objection against the letter of DATE inadmissible since the contents of that letter were not intended to have any legal consequences but served only to inform the applicant \u2013 as a recipient of benefits pursuant to ORG of the obligations she had to comply with ; it was therefore not possible to lodge an objection against the letter . Doing what the authorities should have done , ORG declared the objection inadmissible .", "The applicant lodged an appeal to ORG ( ORG ) . In a decision of DATE , ORG confirmed the judgment of ORG .", "Under LAW all persons DATE and lawfully residing in the GPE were eligible for benefits under LAW if they had no other means of subsistence . General welfare beneficiaries were \u2013 apart from certain exceptions \u2013 obliged to make demonstrable efforts to obtain and accept suitable employment .", "On DATE , FAC was replaced by ORG . In common with the old LAW , persons DATE and lawfully residing in the GPE are eligible for benefits under LAW . However , contrary to the contents of LAW , general welfare beneficiaries are now obliged to make demonstrable efforts to obtain and take up generally accepted employment . It appears from the Explanatory Memorandum ( PERSON ) to this LAW that this new requirement has a much wider scope , as it also includes employment with which the beneficiary has no affinity and only excludes employment which is not generally socially accepted ( algemeen maatschappelijk aanvaard ) . Furthermore , the beneficiary is not obliged to obtain or accept work in respect of which he or she has conscientious objections ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
