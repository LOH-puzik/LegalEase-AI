ESTONIA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 10", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . At the material time the applicant was a journalist and editor of the NORP DATE newspaper ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's complaint under LAW relates to his conviction by the NORP courts of insulting PERSON in an interview he had conducted with another journalist , PERSON , which was published in ORG DATE . The interview was entitled \u201c PERSON denies theft \u201d and was prompted by an allegation made by ORG that Mr PERSON , who had helped her to write her memoirs , had published them without her consent . The interview had the following background .", "CARDINAL . PERSON is married to the NORP politician PERSON . In DATE , when Mr PERSON was still married to his first wife , he became Prime Minister of GPE . PERSON , who had already been working for him , became his assistant . She continued to work with him during DATE and in DATE , when PERSON held the post of Minister of the ORG , she was CARDINAL of his counsellors .", "CARDINAL . PERSON had been politically active in ORG ( GPE ) led by PERSON and was an editor of the party 's paper .", "CARDINAL . NORP In or around DATE PERSON gave birth to a child by PERSON . As she was unwilling to place her child in a kindergarten , the child was entrusted to her parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was forced to resign as Minister of the ORG following the discovery of secret tape recordings of his conversations with other NORP politicians . On DATE PERSON issued a statement in which she claimed full responsibility for the secret recordings .", "CARDINAL . PERSON then left her post in ORG and began writing her memoirs with the help of a journalist , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In her memoirs , as recounted to Mr PERSON , PERSON recalled her experiences in politics and the government . In considering the issue of the secret tape recordings she conceded that the statement she had made on DATE was not true . According to PERSON , she also reflected on her relationship with PERSON , a married man , asking herself whether she had broken up his family . She admitted that she had not been as good a mother as she had wished to be and wondered whether she had paid too high a price in sacrificing her child to her career .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the writing , a disagreement arose between her and Mr PERSON as to the publication and authorship of the memoirs .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON brought a civil action before ORG ( PERSON ) for the protection of her rights as the author of the manuscript .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an order prohibiting Mr PERSON from publishing the manuscript pending the resolution of the issue of its authorship .", "CARDINAL . Following the court order , Mr PERSON decided to publish the material collected in a different form , namely in the form of the information Ms ORG had given him during their collaboration .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON 's account of PERSON story began appearing in the DATE newspaper ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , PERSON published her own memoirs . In her book she stated that some of the information published in the newspaper report of Mr PERSON 's story was incorrect , without specifying in which respect .", "CARDINAL . In the newspaper interview of DATE , mentioned in paragraph CARDINAL above , the applicant questioned PERSON on the issue of the publication of the memoirs and asked him , inter alia , the following question :", "\u201c By the way , do n't you feel that you have made a hero out of the wrong person ? A person breaking up another 's marriage [ abielul\u00f5hkuja ] , an unfit and careless mother deserting her child [ rongaema ] . It does not seem to be the best example for young girls . \u201d [ Note by the Registry : The translation of the NORP words \u201c abielul\u00f5hkuja \u201d and \u201c rongaema \u201d is descriptive since no one - word equivalent exists in LANGUAGE . }", "CARDINAL . Following the above publication , PERSON instituted private prosecution proceedings against the applicant for allegedly having insulted her by referring to her as \u201c abielul\u00f5hkuja \u201d and \u201c rongaema \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP In the proceedings before ORG , the applicant argued that the expressions used had been intended as a question rather than a statement of his opinion and that a question mark after them had been left out by mistake in the course of the editing . He denied the intent to offend PERSON and considered the expressions used as neutral . He further claimed that PERSON actions had justified his asking the question .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant under LAW of the offence of insulting Ms Laanaru and fined him QUANTITY kroons , the equivalent of CARDINAL times the \u201c DATE income \u201d rate ( see paragraph DATE below ) . In finding against the applicant , ORG took note of the expert opinion given by ORG ( ORG ) and of the applicant 's unwillingness to settle the case by issuing an apology . It also noted that under the relevant provision of the Criminal Code liability did not depend on whether or not the victim actually possessed the negative qualities ascribed to her by the applicant . According to the expert opinion , the words at issue constituted value judgments which expressed a strongly negative and disapproving attitude towards the phenomena to which they referred . The word \u201c rongaema \u201d indicated that a mother had not cared for her child , and the word \u201c abielul\u00f5hkuja \u201d indicated a person who had harmed or broken up someone else 's marriage . Both phenomena had always been condemned in NORP society and this was also reflected in the language . However , the words were not improper in their linguistic sense .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( Tallinna GPE ) in which he argued , inter alia , that the first - instance court had failed to take into account the context of the whole article in which the CARDINAL words appeared . He also disputed the qualification of his action as a crime on the grounds that he had lacked criminal intent and that the form used was not improper . He further stressed his right as a journalist freely to disseminate ideas , opinions and other information guaranteed by LAW and argued that the judgment of the first - instance court constituted a violation of his freedom of speech .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL May CARDINALLaanaru by stating that she did not raise her child and that she had destroyed Mr PERSON 's marriage , it would not have constituted an insult . ORG pointed out that the LAW and LAW expressly provided for the possibility of restricting freedom of speech if it infringed the reputation and rights of others . Despite the special interest of the press in public figures , the latter also had the right to have their honour and dignity protected .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG ( NORP ) arguing , inter alia , that the CARDINAL expressions did not have any synonyms in the NORP language and he had therefore had no possibility of using other words . The use of a longer sentence omitting the words had been precluded by objective circumstances peculiar to journalism .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal and upheld ORG judgment . Its judgment included the following reasons :", "\u201c I. The principle of freedom of speech , including the principle of freedom of the press provided for in LAW ( ' LAW ) and LAW of LAW ( ' the ORG ' ) , is an indispensable guarantee for the functioning of a NORP society and therefore one of the most essential social values .", "...", "According to LAW the restriction of any rights or freedoms may take place only pursuant to the LAW ; such restrictions must moreover be necessary in a NORP society and must not distort the nature of the restricted rights and freedoms . Freedom of speech , including freedom of the press , as a fundamental right may be restricted pursuant to LAW for the protection of public order , morals , the rights and freedoms of other persons , health , honour and good name . Under LAW of the ORG , freedom of speech may be restricted by law also for the protection of morals and the reputation or rights of others .", "II . NORP In GPE a person has in principle the right to protect his or her honour as CARDINAL aspect of human dignity by bringing either civil or criminal proceedings .", "According to section PERSON ) of the PERSON on General Principles of LAW , a person has the right to apply for a court order to put a stop to the besmirching of his or her honour , the right to demand rebuttal of the impugned material provided that the person defaming him or her fails to prove the truthfulness of the material and also the right to demand compensation for pecuniary or non - pecuniary damage caused by the attack on his or her honour .", "Thus a person can seek protection through a civil procedure only if the person feels that his or her honour has been sullied with a statement of fact , as only a fact can be proved to be true . However , if a person feels that his or her honour has been besmirched by a value judgment , it is impossible to prove that allegation in a legal sense . In its GPE v. GPE ( DATE ) and PERSON v. GPE ( DATE ) judgments , ORG has also taken the view that a clear distinction must be made between facts and value judgments . Since the truth of a value judgment can not be proved , ORG has found that if a person offended by a journalist through a value judgment goes to a national court in order to prove the value judgment , this constitutes a violation of the freedom of speech provided for in LAW ORG . Therefore , a person in GPE has in fact no possibility of protecting his or her honour through civil - law remedies if he or she has been defamed by means of a value judgment . It follows that in [ such ] cases ... a person can only resort to criminal - law remedies for protecting his or her honour DATE by initiating a private prosecution under LAW . In the present case , the victim has availed herself of this sole opportunity .", "III . ORG considers the judgments delivered by ORG and ORG on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively to be lawful and not subject to annulment .", "In response to the arguments put forward in the appeal , ORG considers it necessary to note the following .", "The appellant 's statement that the words ' rongaema ' and ' abielul\u00f5hkuja ' could not be offensive to PERSON since the sentence in the article which contained these words did not include the name of PERSON , meaning that the words have not been used against anyone personally , is groundless and fabricated . Both ORG and ORG have correctly concluded that the expressions ' rongaema ' and ' abielul\u00f5hkuja ' have been used by [ the applicant ] to characterise the victim ORG PERSON ) . ORG of ORG wishes to add that in the formulation of his next argument \u2013 that it is legitimate to use the impugned expressions towards public figures \u2013 the appellant has considered PERSON to be a public figure , thereby in fact invalidating his first argument .", "Although LAW stipulates the equality of everyone before the law , ORG does not consider it necessary to question the special interest of the press towards public figures \u2013 a principle recognised in the practice of ORG . However , ORG wishes to stress that in GPE there is no legal definition of a public figure and in the practice of ORG no one has been considered a public figure for the reason that he or she is a spouse , cohabitant , child or other person close to a public figure . It must be emphasised nevertheless that it can not be concluded from the practice of ORG that the special interest of the press towards public figures means that public figures can not be offended . On the contrary , according to the criminal laws of several countries , such as GPE , the act of offending a public figure qualifies as a crime . The public has the right to expect the press to describe the life of public figures more thoroughly than the life of ordinary people , but the public has no right to expect the honour of public figures to be degraded , especially in the press and in an improper manner .", "ORG does not agree with the standpoint put forward in the appeal that , since the words ' rongaema ' and ' abielul\u00f5hkuja ' are not vulgar or indecent , their use in referring to a person can not be considered as degrading that person 's honour and dignity in an improper manner , which is an obligatory element of the definition of the offence under LAW . Improper form as a legal category within the meaning of LAW does not only include the use of vulgar or indecent words , but also the use of negative and defamatory figurative expressions . Besides , improper form may also be non - verbal , for example a caricature . Both ORG and ORG have correctly taken the view , on the basis of an expert opinion , that by using the words ' rongaema ' and ' abielul\u00f5hkuja ' in reference to PERSON in the newspaper article [ the applicant ] has treated the victim in public in a defamatory and thus improper manner .", "The statement of [ the applicant 's ] defence lawyer ... that ORG had no right to prescribe which style a journalist was to use when writing a newspaper article is without foundation . Such a statement can be accepted in so far as the journalistic style does not offend or degrade human dignity . Concerning the protection of the honour and dignity of a person , the court was correct in pointing out that the idea expressed in an improper form could also be expressed in a proper form in NORP .", "The argument of the appellant that the offensive expressions ' rongaema ' and ' abielul\u00f5hkuja ' were used due to the absence in the NORP language of synonymous terms and that the use of a longer sentence avoiding these words was precluded by objective circumstances peculiar to journalism , is also ill - founded . There are probably no synonyms for several vulgar and indecent expressions in LANGUAGE . This , however , does not justify their use . Any objective circumstances inherent in the functioning of the press \u2013 such as consideration of newspaper space and information density , according to the appellant \u2013 being values whose scope is limited to a particular sphere , can not be compared to such values as human dignity .", "Under LAW of LAW in Appeal and Cassation Proceedings , the ORG lacks competence to establish factual circumstances . Accordingly , ORG can not reconsider the decision which ORG and ORG took on the basis of an expert opinion that the use of these offensive expressions constituted a value judgment by the journalist and not a question . However , ORG finds it necessary to point out that the prevailing opinion in legal writing is that insult is in principle possible also in the form of a question . It is also important to stress that if the newspaper ORG has violated the rights of the author [ the applicant ] and distorted his intent by an incompetent technical editing [ by leaving out the question mark at DATE CARDINAL expressions ] ( letter of the chief editor of ORG DATE in the file ) , it would have been possible for [ the applicant ] or the newspaper to remedy the damage in an out - of - court settlement by simply publishing an apology as the victim had expressed readiness to reach such a settlement . However , neither [ the applicant ] nor the newspaper ORG was willing to acknowledge in public that they had made a mistake and this constituted further evidence of direct intent to insult . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
