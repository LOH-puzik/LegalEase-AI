G.V. was taken to the police station and gave the name of a lawyer , who was not able to come immediately . In the latter \u2019s absence , GPE agreed to an informal interview in the course of which he stated that he belonged to a revolutionary group . Shortly afterwards he asked to see his father , in whose presence he made other revelations concerning the circumstances of the raid , which had been directed against the NORP ORG rather than the QUANTITY police officers .

Indeed some of the police officers who had been present at the time had similar injuries . The state of shock observed on their arrival at the prison was attributed to a lack of sleep and the lengthy interrogation . As regards the description by the accused of the LOC where the alleged ill - treatment had been carried out and the fact that the accused had named the CARDINAL officers who were said to have perpetrated the violence , the judge concluded that they could have seen the LOC in question on a previous occasion and that the CARDINAL officers were well known in the small town of ORG .", "CARDINAL .
