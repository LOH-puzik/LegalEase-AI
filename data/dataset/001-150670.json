The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother - in - law , PERSON , submitted a petition to LOC prosecutor GPE , and informed him that on DATE her son PERSON , \u2010 the applicant \u2019s husband \u2010 had been travelling home on his motorbike when he was stopped and apprehended by soldiers who had set up a temporary base in a public building near GPE . She described the motorbike as \u201c NORP - made , red and with a basket \u201d . She told the prosecutor that nothing had been heard from her son since that date and that the complaint she had made to the authorities DATE after the disappearance had not elucidated any response . She gave the prosecutor the names of CARDINAL villagers who , she claimed , had witnessed her son being apprehended , and asked the prosecutor to make enquiries in order to find her son .", "CARDINAL . DATE the GPE prosecutor PERSON questioned PERSON in relation to her above - mentioned petition . PERSON confirmed the contents of her petition detailed above and added that the family had been informed about the incident DATE afterwards by villagers who had witnessed the incident . Her elder son , PERSON , had then gone to the military base near GPE village where he was informed that his younger brother had been transferred to the gendarmerie station in GPE . When PERSON had gone to the gendarmerie station in GPE , he was told that his brother \u2019s questioning was continuing and that it would probably continue for DATE .", "CARDINAL . When PERSON was not released , PERSON had gone to the LOC prosecutor \u2019s office and informed the prosecutor of the detention of his younger brother . When the prosecutor had contacted the military authorities he was told that PERSON had never been detained by the military . The family \u2019s subsequent attempts to find PERSON had not yielded any results .", "CARDINAL . A detailed investigation was carried out by LOC prosecutor GPE into the allegations made by PERSON . In the course of that investigation the prosecutor questioned the CARDINAL villagers named by PERSON as eyewitnesses and identified and questioned as suspects CARDINAL soldiers who had been based at the temporary military station at the time of the disappearance . The prosecutor also questioned family members who informed the prosecutor about the steps they had taken to find PERSON . Both the police and the military authorities contacted by the prosecutor denied that PERSON had been detained as alleged .", "CARDINAL . The QUANTITY eyewitnesses named by PERSON told the prosecutor that on DATE they had been travelling to their village when they were stopped by soldiers outside the temporary military base near GPE . While the soldiers were checking their identity documents , PERSON had arrived at the scene and had also been stopped by the soldiers . After their identity papers had been checked they had been allowed to leave but PERSON had been detained . They had then informed PERSON family about what had happened .", "CARDINAL . The security forces personnel questioned by the prosecutor as suspects confirmed that at the time of the events a disused public building outside GPE had been used as a temporary military base . The soldiers denied , however , that they had detained the applicant \u2019s husband .", "CARDINAL . The gendarmerie headquarters contacted by the prosecutor stated in a letter of CARDINAL DATE that they had no information in their possession to show that PERSON had had any links with the ORG . The police headquarters , on the other hand , informed the prosecutor that they had statements indicating that PERSON had been working as a courier for the ORG prior to his disappearance .", "CARDINAL . At the end of his investigation , the LOC prosecutor PERSON concluded in his decision of DATE that PERSON had been unlawfully detained by the military in the temporary military base near GPE . The prosecutor did not attach any weight to the denials of the military personnel who had been on duty at the time of PERSON detention and considered that the military personnel \u2019s denials were outweighed by the consistent eyewitness accounts of civilian villagers . Nevertheless , as the end of the prescription period for the offence of false imprisonment had been reached , the prosecutor concluded that he could not indict the military personnel responsible for the unlawful detention of PERSON . The prosecutor also considered that there was insufficient evidence to prove that PERSON had been killed while in the hands of the soldiers .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection against the prosecutor \u2019s decision with ORG and submitted that nothing had been heard from her husband after his unlawful detention . She argued that similar unlawful detentions had peaked in that area in DATE and that the relatives of those who had disappeared had been too frightened to complain to the authorities on account of their fears of the military . She invited ORG to take into account the possibility that her husband , who had been suspected of having links with the ORG , would in all likelihood be subjected to \u201c torture \u201d by the soldiers . Torture was a criminal offence to which the statute of limitations was not applicable ; thus , the decision of the prosecutor to close the investigation on account of the expiry of the statutory time - limit had been wrong .", "CARDINAL . The objection lodged by the applicant was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a number of soldiers saw PERSON elder brother PERSON digging in an area near GPE . PERSON told the soldiers that he had had a dream and that , according to his dream , his brother PERSON was buried in that place .", "CARDINAL . The same day PERSON also informed the LOC prosecutor PERSON , who went to the area and ordered that the site be dug up . During the digging a total of CARDINAL bones , fabrics , a small axe and the remains of a red motorbike were found . The bones and the motorbike parts , together with soil samples , were taken away by gendarme soldiers for forensic examinations .", "CARDINAL . DATE the applicant also talked to prosecutor PERSON and told him about the disappearance of her husband PERSON . She asked the prosecutor to establish whether the bones found during the excavation belonged to her husband , who had disappeared while travelling on his red motorbike .", "CARDINAL . PERSON brother PERSON told prosecutor PERSON that he had no doubts whatsoever that the items discovered during the excavation belonged to his brother . He said that he recognised the motorbike and the axe which had been given to PERSON by the family . PERSON also informed the prosecutor about the eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen his brother in the hands of the soldiers .", "CARDINAL . Gendarmerie forensic experts who examined the metal parts found in the area stated in their report that they belonged to a motorbike . The experts were not able , however , to identify the type or make of the motorbike due to corrosion , but considered that the motorbike resembled an \u201c Izh \u201d motorbike ( a manufacturer at Izhevsk in GPE ) . The chassis numbers and letters of the motorbike \u2013 in LANGUAGE \u2013 are reproduced in the report of the experts .", "CARDINAL . The bones were examined at ORG . It was established that the bones were animal bones .", "CARDINAL . According to a report drawn up on DATE by the forensic laboratory of the police , the soil on the motorbike parts matched the soil samples taken from the place . However , the soil on the bones did not match the soil samples taken from the place . It was advised in this report that it had to be born in mind when evaluating the report \u2019s conclusions that the forensic examination had not been carried out in order to establish whether the soil samples taken from the bones and the soil samples obtained from the place of digging had come from the same place . Rather , the aim of the forensic examinations had been to establish whether the CARDINAL soil samples had any physical and chemical similarities .", "CARDINAL . According to a report prepared by the police on DATE , no prior applications had been made to them about the disappearance of PERSON . According to a similar report prepared by the military , no one had made any enquiries about any disappearance of a person with the name of PERSON and there had been no temporary or permanent military station at Yo\u011furt\u00e7u village at the time of the events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE TIME prosecutor PERSON decided to close his investigation on the basis that the bones were not human bones . He added that the model and make of the motorbike had not been established and that the basket attached to the motorbike had not been recovered . The prosecutor further stated in his decision that there was no evidence to show that PERSON had been arrested by the soldiers or to show that there had been a temporary military base near GPE at the time of the incident .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection with ORG against the prosecutor \u2019s decision and argued that the investigation had been incomplete . She submitted , in particular , that prosecutor PERSON had failed to take account of the conclusion reached by his predecessor in DATE , namely that her husband had been unlawfully detained by soldiers . She also submitted that the bones had been dug up in the presence of a prosecutor and secured by that prosecutor . Thus , having regard to the finding that the soil on the bones did not match the soil samples , the prosecutor should have considered the possibility that the bones might have been switched .", "CARDINAL . In her petition the applicant also referred to the ORG , and requested that the investigation be continued to find those responsible for the disappearance of her husband . She argued that carrying out an effective investigation was necessary in order to avoid \u201c the ORG being put on trial before ORG for its failure to protect the right to life of her husband \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The objection was rejected by ORG on DATE . No mention was made in the decision about the points raised by the applicant in her objection . ORG decision was communicated to the applicant on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["2-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
