Dr. PERSON , a NORP national born in DATE and resident at ORG , is a medical practitioner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins ( ORG ) , which sits in GPE , ordered that Dr. PERSON right to practise medicine be suspended for DATE . The ground was that he had given to a NORP newspaper an interview considered by the ORG to amount to publicity incompatible with the dignity and reputation of the profession . The applicant lodged an objection ( opposition ) against this decision , which had been given in absentia , but it was confirmed by ORG on DATE , the applicant again having failed to appear .", "Dr. PERSON thereupon referred the matter firstly to ORG , which , on DATE , held his appeal to be inadmissible , and secondly to ORG , on DATE , the latter declared his appeal on a point of law inadmissible , on the ground that it had been filed without the assistance of a lawyer entitled to practise before that ORG .", "The order suspending Dr. PERSON right to practise became effective on DATE but he did not comply with it . For this reason , on DATE , the NORP criminal court ( tribunal correctionnel ) sentenced him , pursuant to LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE on ORG , to imprisonment and a fine .", "This decision was confirmed on DATE by ORG ; a appeal by Dr. PERSON on a point of law was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Concurrently with the foregoing proceedings , which are not in issue in the present case ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , further proceedings were in progress . In fact , on DATE ORG of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins had , by a decision rendered in absentia , ordered another suspension , for DATE , of the applicant \u2019s right to practise : the ORG stated that he had publicised in the press the above - mentioned decisions of the disciplinary organs of the ORG and his criticisms of those organs , such conduct constituting contempt of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Dr. PERSON had appealed to ORG which had confirmed this decision although without upholding the allegation of contempt . He had then referred the matter to ORG , where he relied on the same grounds .", "He contended in the first place that compulsory membership of ORG , without which no one may practise medicine and subjection to the jurisdiction of its disciplinary organs were contrary to the principle of freedom of association , which is guaranteed by LAW ( LAW ) of the Convention .", "The ORG rejected this plea in the following terms :", "\" ... compulsory entry on the register of an ordre which , like the Ordre des m\u00e9decins , is a public - law institution having the function of ensuring the observance of the medical profession \u2019s rules of professional conduct and the maintenance of the reputation , standards of discretion , probity and dignity of its members can not be regarded as incompatible with freedom of association , as guaranteed by LAW ; ... the appellant does not allege that the rule which he is challenging goes beyond the bounds of the restrictions authorised by LAW . CARDINAL ( LAW ) of the LAW , for example for the protection of health . \"", "The applicant also alleged a violation of ORG CARDINAL of the LAW : the first provides that the courts of law shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputes over civil rights and the second prohibits the establishment of extraordinary tribunals for the purpose of resolving such disputes . He pointed out that the decision complained of had nonetheless been taken by a disciplinary organ , set up by LAW no . DATE , and that it had given a ruling on a civil right , namely the right to practise medicine .", "ORG replied that \" disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary sanctions are , in principle , unrelated to the disputes over which exclusive jurisdiction is reserved to the courts of law by LAW \" . The ORG added that , since ORG did not have jurisdiction to determine such disputes , \" they are not extraordinary tribunals whose establishment is prohibited by LAW \" . Finally , the ORG observed that section CARDINAL par . CARDINAL ( a ) of the LAW of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) empowered the Crown \" to reform and adapt the legislation governing the practice of the various branches of medicine \" and that \" the legislature was referring , inter alia , to LAW DATE establishing the ORG , which Act conferred disciplinary powers on ORG \" .", "Lastly , Dr. PERSON alleged that there had been a violation of LAW . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention . He argued that the decision complained of had been given without any public inquiry and by a tribunal composed of medical practitioners , which could not be regarded as impartial since the kind of conduct of which he was accused might harm his colleagues .", "ORG confined itself to pointing out that LAW . CARDINAL ( article DATE ) did not apply to disciplinary proceedings .", "Accordingly , by judgment of CARDINAL DATE , the appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Dr. PERSON did not comply with the order suspending his right to practise medicine , which became final following ORG judgment . On that account he was sentenced by the PERSON criminal court on DATE and DATE to terms of imprisonment and fines . He lodged an appeal against the first decision and an objection against the second , which had been rendered in absentia .", "CARDINAL . Since that time , a number of further proceedings have been instituted , both disciplinary , for the publicity given by the applicant to his dispute with the ORG , and criminal , for his refusal to comply with the measures imposed by its ORG .", "CARDINAL of the disciplinary proceedings resulted in Dr. PERSON being struck off the register of the ORG with effect from DATE . In this connection he lodged a further application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) with the Commission on DATE ; that application , which the ORG declared admissible on DATE , is not relevant for the examination of the present case .", "The criminal proceedings , at first instance , led to prison sentences and to fines .", "CARDINAL . Dr. PERSON and Dr. PERSON are medical practitioners , born in DATE and DATE , respectively . Both of them reside at ORG and are NORP nationals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL medical practitioners practising in and around ORG filed a complaint to the effect that these CARDINAL applicants had committed breaches of the rules of professional conduct ; it was alleged , in particular , that they had systematically limited their fees to the amounts reimbursed by ORG , even when on emergency duty , and had distributed without charge to private houses a DATE magazine called ORG in which general practitioners were held up to ridicule . On DATE , the applicants were heard by ORG . They admitted that they had limited the fees charged to their own clients but not the fees charged when they were on emergency duty . In addition , they pointed out that they were not the publishers of ORG and they denied that they had lampooned their colleagues in its pages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , another medical practitioner lodged a further complaint against the applicants ; he alleged that , DATE after their appearance before ORG , they had put up in the waiting rooms of the ORG medical centre a notice informing the public of the first complaint and the reasons therefore . On DATE , ORG heard the applicants in connection with the second complaint . They declared that they were entitled to provide the public with information about the situation , especially as it was already a matter of common knowledge .", "CARDINAL . ORG of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins , which sits in GPE , summoned Dr. PERSON and Dr. PERSON to answer several allegations .", "On DATE , it directed that their right to practise medicine be suspended for DATE for having charged fees limited to the amounts reimbursed by ORG , for having contributed to the magazine Gezond and for having made therein public utterances judged offensive to their colleagues . In addition , Dr. PERSON was reprimanded for his behaviour when appearing before ORG on DATE . These various decisions were based on Articles CARDINAL par . CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW no . CARDINAL .", "ORG considered , on the other hand , that the posting in the waiting rooms of the medical centre of a notice judged contrary to the rules of professional conduct did not warrant a disciplinary sanction , bearing in mind that the notice had been removed following a request from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG .", "On DATE , the latter declared the appeal admissible and upheld ORG decision insofar as it had found established the allegations relating to the charging of fees limited to the amounts reimbursed by ORG and the contribution to the magazine Gezond . For the rest , ORG set aside the decision challenged and , after taking into account the complaint regarding the notice in the waiting rooms and joining it with the CARDINAL other complaints , directed that the right of Dr. PERSON and Dr. PERSON to practise medicine be suspended for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG ruled against the applicants , who had appealed on a point of law .", "The ORG rejected the ground of appeal based on breach of LAW ( LAW ) of the Convention ; it considered that the functions of the Ordre des m\u00e9decins \" are by no means unrelated to the protection of health and that compulsory entry ... on the register of an Ordre of this kind does not exceed the restrictions on freedom of association which are necessary for the protection of health \" .", "The ORG in addition declared inadmissible , for want of legal interest , the ground of appeal to the effect that the limitation of fees to the amounts reimbursed by ORG was in conformity with both the law and the rules of professional conduct for medical practitioners ; the ORG found that the suspension had in fact also been imposed as a sanction for other disciplinary offences .", "CARDINAL .
