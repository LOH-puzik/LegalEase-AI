{"ITEMID": "001-67091", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "AND", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2000, "DOCNAME": "UBACH MORTES v. ANDORRA", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant [ Mr PERSON NORP ] is an LOC national , born in DATE . When he lodged his application , he was in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , of ORG .", "The applicant was the director of ORG ( ORG ) from its inception in DATE until DATE , apart from the period DATE . The ORG is a quasi - public organisation responsible for the administrative , financial and technical management of the LOC social security system . At DATE the ORG had accumulated old - age pension fund reserves of MONEY ( ESP ) . The governing body decided , at its meeting on DATE , to diversify the use of those reserves by earmarking a maximum of PERCENT for variable - rate investments .", "In his capacity as director of the ORG , the applicant followed a policy of investing part of the retirement pension fund by buying company stock or variable - rate securities . In the course of those operations , the applicant became acquainted with a NORP national , J.M.R. , representative and shareholder of a NORP company called ORG , whose head office was in GPE . In DATE the applicant and J.M.R. decided that the ORG \u2019s investments in GPE would be effected through PERSON . In order to take up the shareholding in PERSON , the applicant used as intermediary the LOC company , IBERINSA , of which he was a shareholder . On DATE ORG of IBERINSA decided to subscribe to shares in PERSON and appointed the applicant to represent it in its dealings with the company .", "From then on , according to the judgments delivered by the PERSON courts , the applicant , aided and abetted by J.M.R. , began channelling substantial pension funds into investment operations in GPE \u2013 on many occasions without the consent or approval of the ORG \u2019s governing body . The ORG incurred losses totalling more than ESP CARDINAL as a result of , inter alia , the depletion by the applicant and J.M.R. of the assets of various companies for the benefit of PERSON .", "On DATE the episcopal batlle ( judge ) received a complaint from the chairman of the governing body of the ORG informing him that the applicant had received threats from J.M.R. and setting out the situation regarding the administration of the ORG \u2019s pension fund reserves . A preliminary investigation was opened following the complaint , but was discontinued DATE .", "On DATE ORG , the legislative body of ORG to which the applicant regularly had to report on the management of the ORG in his capacity as director thereof , lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant with the NORP batlle , followed DATE by a further criminal complaint and application to join the proceedings as a civil party . That complaint gave rise to a criminal investigation , which is the subject of this application . The applicant lodged an application with the investigating judge in which he contested ORG locus standi to join the criminal proceedings . His application was dismissed . The applicant appealed to ORG , which set aside the decision on DATE and dismissed ORG complaint and application to join the proceedings as a civil party . There thus remained the public prosecutor as instigator of the criminal proceedings and the ORG as private prosecutor .", "The applicant was kept in pre - trial detention from DATE until DATE , then from DATE until DATE , and , lastly , from DATE until his conviction on DATE . In the meantime , the investigating judge issued an arrest warrant against J.M.R. on DATE .", "At the end of the investigation , the public prosecutor lodged his provisional indictment submissions in which he categorised the offence as misappropriating public assets or funds , damaging the economy and forging private and official documents .", "At the beginning of his trial in ORG the applicant complained that the trial was being held in the absence of J.M.R. and requested a stay of proceedings . The court replied that J.M.R. was well aware of the commencement date of the trial since his lawyer had stated at the beginning of the hearing that he had spoken to his client on the telephone and , furthermore , had produced a medical certificate issued on a date very close to that of the trial certifying that he was ill and therefore could not attend court . The court added that as J.M.R. was a NORP national in GPE , the warrant for his arrest could not be enforced and that any move by the PERSON courts to secure his extradition would be doomed to failure . Accordingly , the court decided to continue with the trial in order , inter alia , to guarantee the applicant his right to have his case heard within a reasonable time in accordance with LAW . It also noted that the applicant had not at any time during the investigation requested to cross - examine J.M.R. or to be confronted with him .", "In a judgment of DATE , delivered after public proceedings deemed to be inter partes , ORG found the applicant guilty of misappropriating public funds and forging official documents . It sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and payment to the ORG CARDINAL in damages . It acquitted him , however , of damaging the economy . The court based its decision on a whole range of evidence freely discussed at a public trial , particularly the applicant \u2019s written statements , the testimony of numerous witnesses , auditors\u2019 reports and documentary evidence .", "The applicant appealed to ORG , contending that his fundamental rights had been breached . In a judgment delivered after adversarial proceedings , ORG dismissed his appeal on DATE .", "The applicant requested the public prosecutor to lodge an empara appeal against that judgment with ORG , which is a remedy for violations of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by LAW . On DATE the public prosecutor decided to lodge the empara appeal , while disagreeing with the applicant \u2019s allegations .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG declared the empara appeal inadmissible . The public prosecutor lodged a s\u00faplica appeal with ORG , which dismissed it on DATE on the ground that it did not satisfy the conditions set out in LAW ( c ) of LAW .", "Following the entry into force of the DATE Act amending LAW , and pursuant to its third transitional provision , the applicant appealed directly to ORG ( remedy of empara ) on DATE against ORG judgment of DATE complaining of a violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed by LAW . In his appeal the applicant alleged the following violations:-", "CARDINAL . Violation of the right to a predetermined impartial tribunal because the investigation of the case had been entrusted to the NORP batlle and not the episcopal batlle who had examined the first complaint lodged by the chairman of the ORG \u2019s governing body about the threats received by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Violation of the right to a fair trial on account of the court \u2019s decision to continue with the trial against the defendants present and in the absence of a co - defendant , J.M.R. , whom he had been unable to cross - examine or confront .", "CARDINAL . Refusal by the trial and appeal courts to set aside all the investigative measures undertaken during the period in which ORG was a party to the proceedings as private prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . Violation of the principle of the presumption of innocence on account of the assessment of the evidence made by the trial and appeal courts .", "CARDINAL . Violation of the rule that offences and punishments shall be strictly defined by law on the ground that the offence with which the applicant had been charged did not constitute the offence of misappropriation of public funds defined by LAW .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the empara appeal . With regard to the complaint of an infringement of the right to an impartial and predetermined tribunal , ORG concluded , after observing that the applicant had never claimed that the investigating judge had breached his duty of subjective or objective impartiality and examining the provisions of LAW governing conflicts of court jurisdiction , that there had been no violation of the right relied on because the NORP batlle had begun his investigation after the preliminary investigation opened by the episcopal batlle had been closed . In respect of the complaint that ORG had decided to continue with the trial notwithstanding the absence of a co - defendant , J.M.R. , ORG found that the trial court had duly justified its decision on the ground DATE could not attend trial for health reasons and its conviction that he had no intention of cooperating with the courts . The court held that , while DATE \u2019s absence might have affected some of the evidence the applicant wished to adduce , that had neither prevented him from exercising his defence rights nor , consequently , infringed the constitutional rights on which he had relied . With regard to ORG participation in the proceedings up until ORG decision of DATE which excluded it , ORG observed that , as ORG had pointed out , there was nothing to indicate that ORG presence had prevented any investigative measure requested by the applicant from being carried out . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint that he was systematically excluded during the entire investigation , ORG found , inter alia , that the decision to convict had taken account of a whole range of evidence , that the applicant had had the opportunity of informing himself of the investigative measures and that all the evidence he had requested to adduce had been admitted .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
