The applicant was born in DATE and lives in the parish of GPE in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the executive director of the municipality where the applicant resided , ORG , lodged with ORG an application for a private prosecution against the applicant and her husband for offences which at the relevant time were proscribed by sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Criminal Law ( defamation and bringing into disrepute ) . The complaint appears to have been based on CARDINAL letters that the applicant had sent to the council of the local municipality in which it had been alleged that ORG had given false testimony in courts to the applicant \u2019s detriment , that ORG was a liar who did not deserve to be working in an official position , and that ORG had hidden the will left by the applicant \u2019s sister - in - law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , having considered V.D \u2019s complaint , a judge of ORG decided to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant for defamation of a representative of public authority ( section CARDINAL of LAW as in force at the relevant time ) . Offences under section CARDINAL of the Criminal Law were subject to public prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an out - patient psychiatric assessment was carried out on the applicant in a psychiatric hospital located in GPE . The assessment was carried out by a commission composed of several medical professionals . The commission was unable to arrive at a definite conclusion concerning the applicant \u2019s psychiatric condition .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE the applicant was officially charged with defamation of V.D. No documents have been provided in that connection by either of the parties . On DATE an authorisation ( orderis ) was issued to sworn attorney PERSON According to the authorisation , PERSON was authorised to \u201c participate in the pre - trial investigation \u201d to assist the applicant . The applicant claims that she never appointed PERSON to represent her interests . Nothing in the copy of the authorisation submitted by the Government indicates that the applicant was made aware of its existence or of PERSON \u2019s role in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor of ORG requested ORG to order a residential psychiatric - psychological assessment of the applicant to be carried out in a psychiatric hospital in GPE . The prosecutor indicated that there were grounds to believe that the applicant had not been capable of understanding the consequences of writing the letters in issue . The prosecutor also stated that during the out - patient psychiatric assessment of DATE it had been impossible to establish the applicant \u2019s psychiatric condition with certainty .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single judge of ORG issued a decision authorising the applicant \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital . The decision noted that the judge had heard statements from the prosecutor and from PERSON The decision also stated that the applicant had refused to report for a residential examination voluntarily , but no details were given . The Government have not suggested that the applicant was ever requested to report voluntarily for a residential assessment . Lastly , the decision noted that it could be appealed against to ORG but that the lodging of such an appeal did not suspend the execution of the decision . The decision also ordered the LOC police to transport the applicant to a psychiatric hospital in R\u012bga and guard her during the course of the examination .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , on DATE CARDINAL police officers arrived at her home and announced to her that she had TIME to get ready to leave .

The Government did not dispute this account .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submits that the conditions in the hospital were unbearable : she was placed together with people who were mentally ill , drug addicts and people with sexually transmitted diseases , and the toilets in the hospital were flooded and impossible to use . She also submits that prior to CARDINAL DATE \u2013 when , according to her , she was first seen by a psychiatrist \u2013 she was questioned by another doctor in a \u201c political \u201d manner . She also submits that her brain was scanned and that she was injected with unknown substances against her will .", "CARDINAL . At DATE ( probably on DATE ) the applicant submitted an appeal against the decision of ORG . The applicant pointed out that she had not been informed that a hearing concerning her placement in a psychiatric hospital would take place , and had not participated in that hearing ; she accordingly requested that the decision of the first - instance court be quashed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a decision whereby it dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . At the hearing the court heard submissions from the lawyer , PERSON , and a public prosecutor . PERSON supported the applicant \u2019s appeal and alleged that the decision of the first - instance court had been unlawful . The prosecutor considered that the decision had been adopted lawfully and was justified by the applicant \u2019s persistent refusal to respond to any summonses sent to her or to sign the statement of charges brought against her . He furthermore informed the court that the applicant \u2019s assessment would be completed within DATE of the date of the hearing in the appeal court . The appeal court considered that the first - instance court had adopted its decision in full conformity with the requirements of section CARDINAL of LAW ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) , under which the presence of the suspected or accused person at the court hearing concerning that person \u2019s placement in a psychiatric hospital was not mandatory . The court considered that the actual implementation of the decision of ORG had not been sufficiently considerate , since the applicant had been forced to leave her household and domestic animals without any supervision . Nevertheless , the court took into account that ORG had taken certain steps to ensure that the applicant \u2019s property would be looked after during her stay at the psychiatric hospital , and it therefore considered that it was not \u201c expedient \u201d to terminate the assessment of the applicant \u2019s psychiatric health .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a request to ORG . She asked him to lodge a complaint against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE and ORG decision of DATE . On DATE a prosecutor from ORG replied to the applicant , indicating that the decision of CARDINAL DATE was final and therefore no appeal lay against it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from the hospital upon completion of her psychiatric assessment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a commission consisting of CARDINAL certified psychiatrists and CARDINAL certified psychologist issued a report concerning the applicant \u2019s psychiatric health and psychological state . The principal conclusion of the experts was that the applicant suffered from persistent delusions about being persecuted by communists and various other persons , including officials of her local municipality . They also found that the applicant was egocentric and her ability to objectively and adequately assess reality and her own behaviour was impaired . The overall conclusion was that the applicant \u201c was unable to take account of her actions and to control them and [ was to be ] considered to have been in a state of mental incapacity ( nepieskait\u0101ma ) with regard to the offence she was accused of \u201d . It was recommended that the applicant should undergo out - patient psychiatric treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public prosecutor of ORG adopted a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the applicant . The decision indicated that the applicant \u201c had committed \u201d the criminal offence mentioned in section CARDINAL of LAW and that her guilt had been proved by all the materials obtained during the pre - trial investigation . However , taking into account the applicant \u2019s mental incapacity and the fact that there was no need to order her compulsory treatment in a psychiatric hospital , the criminal proceedings were terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a civil - law complaint to the R\u012bga City Zieme\u013cu District Court . She complained about being held in the psychiatric hospital and indicated that it was still unclear to her why she had been held there .

In another complaint dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant complained , inter alia , that she had not been summoned to the hearing of ORG , had had no possibility to defend herself and had not been sent a copy of the decision . The amount of compensation requested was increased to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court rejected the applicant \u2019s claim by a judgment on the merits which was adopted on DATE . The court pointed out that the applicant \u2019s liberty had been restricted in accordance with decisions of a public prosecutor and a court and accordingly the deprivation of liberty had not been unlawful . It was further noted that since the psychiatric hospital where the applicant had been held had received a certificate which attested to its compatibility with the standards set forth in NORP legislation , the applicant \u2019s complaints regarding the conditions in the hospital were ill - founded . The applicant \u2019s complaint about the alleged impossibility of appealing against the decisions of the public prosecutor and ORG was not addressed in the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of the first - instance court . On DATE she supplemented her appeal . She complained , inter alia , about having been held in a psychiatric hospital for an excessive length of time despite having been \u201c completely healthy \u201d .

On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . That court held that the applicant \u2019s constitutional right to liberty had not been violated because she had been placed in the psychiatric hospital in accordance with the law . It also held that the applicant \u2019s placement in the hospital had been \u201c proportionate \u201d ( \u201c sam\u0113r\u012bgs \u201d ) with the aim to determine whether she had \u201c realised and understood the nature and consequences of her actions \u201d . The applicant \u2019s complaint about her purported inability to appeal against the court order requiring her placement in the psychiatric hospital was not addressed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of ORG , in a preparatory meeting ( r\u012bc\u012bbas s\u0113de ) , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law . The ORG pointed out that the applicant had failed to indicate any violations of material or procedural norms .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the placing of suspects or accused persons in medical institutions was governed by LAW of LAW ( in force until DATE ) , which provided as follows :", "\u201c If during the performance of a ... forensic psychiatric assessment there arises a necessity to observe and test the suspect or accused person , the public prosecutor can adopt a reasoned decision and place him in an appropriate medical institution . If the suspect or the accused person is not in detention , he may only be placed in a medical institution on the basis of a decision by a judge or by a court . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , the participation of defense counsel was compulsory during a trial before the first - instance court , as well as during a pre - trial investigation in cases concerning , inter alia , persons \u201c unable to exercise their rights to defence because of mental defects \u201d .
