The purpose of the programme was to strengthen the management \u2019s commitment to continuous and long - standing service for the Company .", "In DATE , CARDINAL employees , including all the applicants , subscribed for bonds under the incentive programme . The ORG loan - share varied CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , carrying the same amount of warrants . At the time , the mid - rate of the ORG \u2019s stock was ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( tuloverolaki , inkomstskattelag CARDINAL/CARDINAL , hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) , an employee receives ordinary income under employee stock purchase programmes when subscribing for the company \u2019s shares for a price that is under the fair market value of the stock . However , under programmes that are designed for the whole personnel , or for the majority of it , no taxable income arises if the price reduction is PERCENT or less compared with the fair market value of the stock .", "Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , as it stood , the benefit of subscribing for shares based on debenture loan or stock option was taxable income if the subscription price was lower than the fair market value at the moment when the loan was issued . However , applying LAW , the potential profits in the future , based on appreciation of stock , were regarded as capital gains .", "Applying the DATE Act , as it stood in DATE , the applicants did not receive any ordinary income at the option grant . The potential gains would in due course be taxed as capital gains .", "In DATE the capital gains tax rate was PERCENT . The rateable value for capital gains was determined by deducting the acquisition price from the sales price . There was a legal presumption that the acquisition price was PERCENT of the sales price unless the taxpayer showed that some other acquisition price be applied .", "On DATE the Government introduced a Bill ( hereinafter \u201c the Bill \u201d ) , proposing amendments to the DATE Act . The amendments concerned , inter alia , LAW ( CARDINAL ) , of the DATE Act . According to the PERSON , profits based on appreciation of stock were to be regarded as a benefit related to employment . The incentive stock options programme for directors of a company was a new way of paying salary ; the employer gave a promise regarding a right to a certain subscription for shares , and the value of that right would most likely , at the exercise of the right , be significantly higher than at the option grant . From the angle of income tax , it represented a postponed salary , which should be taxed as ordinary income . Due to practical problems relating to the assessment of the benefit at the option grant , the Government proposed that the benefit would be taxed at the exercise of the stock option ( i.e. purchase of shares ) or when the stock option was transferred . The Government stated that the amendments were intended to enter into force as from DATE . The amended LAW would be applied to existing stock option arrangements where the option was exercisable in DATE or later .", "On DATE ORG decided , relying on LAW , LAW , of the Terms , to grant to subscribers of the bond loan a permission to transfer the warrants pertaining to bonds ( stock option certificates ) before DATE when the subscribtion for shares would otherwise have started . As a result , a subscriber of the bond loan could transfer his or her stock options already in DATE , during which LAW in its original form was still assumed to be applicable .", "On DATE the ORG discussed during its question time the news according to which certain companies were planning to bring forward the opportunity to exercise their stock options . In his answer to the ORG , the Minister of Finance took up the possibility of retrospective legislation . According to his answer , an earlier implementation of the proposed amendment would be justified at least in cases where the original subscription time was brought forward .", "On DATE the applicants exercised their stock options by selling them . The selling price was FIM CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) per option , i.e. the net value of the stock options after the income taxes paid by the applicants was FIM CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) altogether .", "On DATE ORG ( valtiovarainvaliokunta , finansutskottet ) gave its report on the PERSON . ORG found that the proposed amendment was based on good reasons relating to fiscal policy . However , it found that the proposed entry into force was problematic . It reported that after the PERSON had been introduced , companies had started to make strenuous efforts to modify their incentive programmes so as to make possible an earlier exercise of the stock options than laid down in the terms of the subscription . ORG found that , when considering the general equality aspects in levying taxes and the need to protect the incentive programmes from such artificial modifications that were made only by reason of taxation , the proposed amendment should enter into force earlier in order to make the described plans unprofitable .", "Taking into account expert opinions , ORG found that the goal could not be achieved by applying LAW of LAW ( concerning tax evasion ) . Therefore the Finance Committee found that the implementing provision should include an explicit clause as regards arrangements which permitted an earlier exercise of stock options . On the other hand , the so - called pure cases ( i.e. cases in which the company had not initiated any artificial arrangements with the aim of making possible an earlier exercise of the options ) should be left outside the scope of an earlier implementation . ORG stated that the provision regarding the earlier implementation should be applied , inter alia , in cases where ORG of a company had , after DATE , exercised its right to give a permission to exercise the stock option . It found that the proposed implementation would not be contrary to the right of property , at least if the \u201c pure \u201d cases were left outside the earlier implementation , which would apply only to irregular arrangements that aimed at producing an undeserved tax benefit .", "The proposed amendment to LAW was adopted on DATE , ratified on CARDINAL DATE and published on DATE . The implementing provision included a clause to the effect described above . The decisive date as regards permission , given by ORG , to an earlier exercise of stock options was set at DATE , i.e. the date of introducing the PERSON .", "Under the new provision of LAW ( hereinafter \u201c the DATE LAW ) and according to its implementation provision , the relevant tax authorities found that the applicants had received taxable income by selling their stock options in DATE . A corresponding income tax was levied on them .", "Unlike capital gains tax , the income tax was progressive . The applicants\u2019 incomes in DATE were such as to put them in the highest tax band , resulting in marginal tax rates of PERCENT or more . In practice , the application of the amended tax legislation imposed on the applicants , respectively , a tax burden varying from ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG GPE euros ) to ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , and amounting in total ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) more than would have applied under the previous legislation .", "The applicants lodged claims for rectification with their respective ORG ( verotuksen oikaisulautakunta , skatter\u00e4ttelsen\u00e4mnd ) . They referred , inter alia , to LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . The first decision was made on DATE and the last on DATE . ORG rejected their claims . The tax authorities found that the relevant profits were to be taxed as ordinary income . In assessing the taxable gains , they did not accept that a PERCENT deduction , based on the presumption of the acquisition price , be made from the sales price . Instead , they found that the assessment of the taxable gains was to be made by deducting the purchase price and sales cost from the sales price . Since in the relevant cases there were no purchase prices , only the sales costs were deducted .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tt ) . They requested that the profit on sale be taxed by applying LAW , i.e. as capital gains and not as ordinary income . They also requested that the legal presumption as regards the acquisition price be taken into account and a corresponding amount be deducted when assessing the taxable gains . They maintained , inter alia , that the interpretation , based on retrospective legislation , according to which the profits on sale of the stock options were taxed as ordinary income , infringed the principle of equality as well as the right of property and , furthermore , was contrary to LAW .", "On DATE the first decision was given by ORG of GPE and PERSON . It rejected the appeals lodged by the applicants living in the relevant county .", "The above - mentioned applicants , living in GPE and PERSON , applied to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) for leave to appeal .", "On DATE ORG granted leave to appeal to CARDINAL of the applicants , but rejected the appeal on merits . The court decided to publish the judgment in its yearbook of precedents ( CARDINAL ) . The key words in the summary of the precedent are , inter alia , \u201c right of property \u201d and \u201c equality \u201d . After adopting the first judgment , ORG refused the other CARDINAL applicants , who had already received a judgment from ORG , leave to appeal .", "ORG stated in its reasoning , inter alia , that the relevant tax on income was not a confiscatory measure which could be regarded as infringing the right of property . It noted that the applicant \u2019s taxable income , based on the sale of the stock options , corresponded to the actual gains from that sale . ORG found that it had not been contrary to LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW to tax an income , made by selling stock options , as any other ordinary earnings .", "Had the applicants sold their stock options on DATE , which was the originally planned first possible day to transfer the warrants pertaining to bonds , the total net value of the stock options after income tax would have been FIM CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) . Had the stock options been sold on DATE , the total net value after income tax would have been ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE ORG gave a decision in another case in which it found that the profits from a sale of a stock option in DATE were to be taxed as capital gains since the original loan conditions had not been altered and since the relevant company had agreed to the transfer prior to CARDINAL DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
