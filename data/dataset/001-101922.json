She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , an advocate practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "In DATE the applicant \u2019s mother , together with other heirs , inherited CARDINAL plots of land from her husband . She thereby became a co - owner of various proportions of that property .", "On DATE the applicant and her sister signed a contract of lifelong care ( ugovor o do\u017eivotnom uzdr\u017eavanju ) with their mother before ORG ( PERSON ) , stipulating that the daughters were to provide for their mother until her death while the mother transferred the ownership of all her immovable property , that is , her share of the above CARDINAL plots of land , to the daughters after her death .", "On DATE the parties amended the above contract so that the applicant and her sister , at the moment of signing of the amendment to the contract , became the co - owners of their mother \u2019s share of the above CARDINAL plots of land .", "On the basis of the above amendment of DATE , on DATE the applicant was recorded in the land register as the co - owner of those CARDINAL plots of land in various proportions .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant \u2019s aunt PERSON brought a civil action in ORG against the applicant \u2019s mother , with a view to being declared the owner of part of the above property . After the death of the applicant \u2019s mother in DATE , in DATE the applicant and her sister became parties to the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG adopted a judgment .

On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) found a violation of their constitutional right to a hearing within a reasonable time , awarded them each MONEY ( HRK ) in compensation and ordered ORG to adopt a decision in their case in the shortest time possible but DATE from the publication of its decision in ORG . ORG decision was published on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the plaintiff \u2019s action . That judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE and thereby became final , with the consequence that all concerned remained , as before , co - owners of the CARDINAL plots of land .", "On DATE the applicant instituted non - contentious proceedings before ORG against the other co - owners GPE , GPE and GPE , seeking partition of the co - ownership of CARDINAL of the above CARDINAL plots of land .", "At the hearing held on DATE the applicant appeared before the court but the defendants failed to appear .", "An on - site visit was carried out on DATE in the presence of the judge assigned to hear the case , the parties and an expert .

It found that the changes stipulated in the in - court settlement of DATE could not be recorded in the land register because the share of the property in question belonging to GPE was subject to enforcement proceedings instituted in DATE and DATE by his creditors before the same court , after which it was not allowed , under LAW , to record any changes in ownership or other rights in rem in respect of that property in the land register .", "On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to ORG .", "On DATE the ORG in part upheld and in part quashed the first - instance decision . It held that while LAW indeed did not allow the changes stipulated in the in - court settlement of DATE to be recorded in respect of GPE \u2019s share of the property , they could be recorded in respect of PERSON and GPE \u2019s share of the property .", "Due to the outcome of the civil proceedings for annulment ( see below ) , it appears that no further steps were taken with a view to recording the changes stipulated in the in - court settlement of DATE in the land register .", "On DATE the applicant brought a civil action in ORG against GPE , GPE and GPE seeking to annul the above in - court settlement of DATE because at the time it had been entered into GPE had concealed the fact that enforcement proceedings had been pending in respect of his share of the property .", "On DATE the court delivered a judgment whereby it annulled the in - court settlement , with the effect that all concerned remained , as before , co - owners of the CARDINAL plots of land in question .", "On DATE the applicant instituted a second set of non - contentious proceedings against GPE , GPE and GPE for partition of co - ownership before ORG . This time she sought partition of the co - ownership of CARDINAL plots of land .", "On DATE the court issued a decision ordering the partition of the co - ownership by sale of the CARDINAL plots of land in question at a public auction and distribution of the proceeds of the sale to the co - owners in proportion to their shares . It held that partition in kind ( geometrijska dioba ) was not feasible and therefore ordered partition by auction ( civilna dioba ) .", "The applicant and PERSON appealed as they both objected to partition by auction and sought partition in kind .", "It would appear that the case is currently pending before ORG .", "The relevant part of the Ownership and Other Rights In Rem Act ( Zakon o vlasni\u0161tvu i drugim stvarnim pravima , ORG nos .
