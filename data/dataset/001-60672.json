You could , for instance , infer that the [ applicant and PERSON ] have fabricated their evidence , made it up , after those first interviews . You could infer that they were indeed biding their time and seeing whether or not they would be identified . That failure to mention the sort of things or give answers to the sort of questions that I have listed , as [ the applicant ] failed , can not of itself prove guilt . So , of course , if you were not sure of [ Mr GPE \u2019s ] identifications of any of these defendants , that would be the end of the case even if you thought they were behaving in the way I have just described over their first interviews . But although they can not of themselves , those failures , prove guilt , you may hold that failure against them in deciding whether he is guilty . You do n\u2019t have to . It is for you to decide .", "[ The applicant ] told you that his reason for not answering some of the questions was that he had received advice from his solicitor that he should make no comment ... Of course , we have \u2013 you have \u2013 no independent evidence of what was said by the solicitor , but if simply saying \u2018 Oh my solicitor advised me not to answer ORG was by itself a good and final answer , any competent solicitor and a defendant would have the power to strangle at birth any interview and that would make , you may think , a mockery of the Act of ORG which allows a jury , if they think it is right and proper , to make an adverse inference and that could not have been ORG \u2019s intention . The fact is that it is [ the applicant \u2019s ] choice ... whether or not to accept [ his ] solicitor \u2019s advice or not , and any solicitor worthy of his or her name should have included in the advice the various pros and cons of saying no comment and in particular should have included the possibility , even the probability , that his or her defence could be harmed if they failed to mention facts that they could so easily do and that if they did not mention them , why then an adverse inference could be drawn . But as I say , you have no independent evidence as to what the solicitor said or did not say .", "But whether or not the solicitors said that , the officers certainly did . They [ administered the caution ] more than once ... .", "So it is for each defendant ... to decide whether to answer or not . You decide what you make of the reasons given for not answering . If you thought that the reason given was a good one , then of course you could not hold it against them . If you thought that they were failing to answer certain awkward questions because , for example , they were keeping their powder dry , as it were , hoping against hope they would not be identified and the other reasons I mentioned a moment ago , or because they had not yet worked out what their defence was going to be , you could draw the inference that I have mentioned and , if you did , that might point towards guilt , but it is you who decide whether it is fair and proper to draw those adverse inferences . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the request of the applicant \u2019s counsel the trial judge gave the following further direction to the jury :", "\u201c When dealing with the [ applicant \u2019s ] first [ interview ] when [ he ] failed to answer questions . I did not specifically remind you , though you have heard it any number of times , that the defendants were cautioned that they do not have to say anything . That is of course the position , they do not have to say anything , but the inferences I suggested that you can draw nevertheless remain if you think they have not mentioned things that they could reasonably have been expected to mention and if you think it is fair to take the inferences of the sort I have mentioned , but there is that right to silence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted of robbery , false imprisonment and attempted murder and sentenced to a total of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his co - accused appealed against conviction to ORG .

On DATE ORG in a reserved judgment and following a hearing dismissed the appeal . Lord Justice PERSON stated in his judgment , with reference to section DATE of ORG LAW DATE , that it could not have been the intention of ORG to provide that the only adverse inference that could be drawn from failure to disclose facts was recent fabrication . He quoted with approval the judgment of Lord Justice PERSON in the case of NORP v ORG ( judgment of DATE , unreported ) .", "\u201c The purpose of the statutory provisions is to permit adverse inferences to be drawn where there has been late fabrication , to this extent , to encourage speedy disclosure of a genuine defence . If a defendant disclosed to his solicitor , prior to a police interview , charging or trial , information capable of giving rise to a defence , it will always be open to the defence to lead evidence of this to rebut any inference of subsequent fabrication . But if such evidence was not disclosed or was not disclosed at a late stage in the sequence of interview , charge and trial , adverse inferences can be drawn by the jury . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON added :", "\u201c Thus the statutory objective designed to discourage surprise and \u201c trial by ambush \u201d is achieved . If the applicant was right in submitting that the only adverse inference that could be drawn was subsequent fabrication , the only purpose of the legislation ( to encourage speedy disclosure of genuine defences ) would be easily defeated . But in our judgment that is not the case ...", "The complaint made ... is that under LAW a \u2018 proper inference\u2019 is CARDINAL relevant to \u2018 in determining whether the accused is guilty\u2019 , and not simply adverse to a Defendant . We agree with the first proposition contained in that sentence , but not with the second . As section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(d ) [ of the DATE Act ] makes clear , the jury may make such inferences as they think proper in their task of considering their verdict . Clearly such inferences must be properly drawn , that is to say drawn from facts relevant to the verdict . The inferences that are complained of are not simply \u2018 adverse\u2019 ... When it is proper to take them into account the Judge rightly reminded the jury that they could draw the adverse inference that [ the applicant ] was biding his time and seeing whether or not he would be identified , and it was for the jury to decide whether or not \u2018 to hold that failure against [ him ] in deciding whether [ he was ] guilty\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . With respect to the applicant \u2019s argument that the trial judge should not have intervened to request the applicant whether he wished to relate what he had said to his solicitor before the first police interview , Lord Justice PERSON considered that this intervention was improper and an invitation to the applicant to waive legal professional privilege .
