GPE undertook to ( ... ) find a legal solution for the restitution of church property . The present PERSON on freedom of conscience and religious organisations dates back to DATE . Despite the fact that it is regarded as CARDINAL of the best freedom of religion laws in the region , some of its provisions lack clarity . ( ... ) The law also contains a number of other ambiguous provisions , which leave a wide discretion to the implementing authorities . Hence , the quite progressive law for the time of its adoption now requires significant rewording . ( ... )", "CARDINAL . NORP The NORP legislation still lacks effective legal tools for restitution of church property . So far restitution was carried out occasionally on the basis of the parliament 's DATE resolution and several presidential decrees . The legal problem of restitution mainly stems from the fact that religious associations have no right to obtain a legal entity status and thus can not possess property . Most of the organisations , which owned the property that should be restituted , ceased to exist and ORG is represented by several organisations . This leads to an ad hoc restitution practice totally depending on the local authorities ' preferences and which in most cases entails not the return of the ownership rights but transfer of property into a gratis rent . We , therefore , call on the NORP authorities to elaborate clear rules on the restitution of religious property . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
