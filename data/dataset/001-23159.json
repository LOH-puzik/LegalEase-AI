THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Lord Justice Schiemann;Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant , a NORP politician , was first elected to ORG in DATE . This inner GPE covers a large part of central GPE , including ORG , GPE and Regent \u2019s Park as well as some less affluent areas to the north and north - west . During the DATE \u2019s , she was leader of the ORG as well as of the majority party .", "As a result of the local government elections in DATE , the overall Conservative party majority was reduced from CARDINAL to CARDINAL . The applicant was determined that ORG would have a greater majority at the DATE elections . With this end in view , she re - organised the party \u2019s administrative and decision making structure and chaired ORG which was to develop and promote policy . In DATE , the applicant and others in the majority identified key wards , namely CARDINAL districts which were marginal . Their intention was to develop council policies which would target marginal wards , including such housing policies as could affect the make up of the electorate of those wards . References were made inter alia to \u201c an immediate need to socially engineer the population in marginal wards \u201d and to an aim \u201c to preserve local communities \u2013 but boot out certain categories \u201d .", "The ORG held a stock of CARDINAL dwellings used for the provision of social housing . The plan which was developed involved selling ORG in strategically important areas at reduced prices to approved applicants who , it was hoped , would be more likely to vote Conservative \u2013 \u201c designated sales \u201d . Properties to be sold in this way were designated , then kept empty as they became available until suitable purchasers were approved .", "On DATE , at a meeting of ORG , it was proposed to designate all ORG properties in the CARDINAL marginal wards . A memorandum on CARDINAL DATE from ORG advised that this would render it impossible to meet statutory obligations to the homeless and they should seek legal advice . On DATE , ORG advised the applicant that \u201c it was fundamental that the arguments in favour of selling be soundly based and properly argued . Anything which smacks of political machinations will be viewed with great suspicion by the courts . \u201d He also stated that \u201c the possibility of surcharge [ legal requirement to pay any financial loss to the City ] exists but it will be necessary for those challenging to show wilful misconduct . This re - emphasises the need for a good argument to be constructed in favour of sale \u201d .", "DATE the Chairmen \u2019s group decided to adopt a target of CARDINAL sales per annum in the marginal wards . On DATE , the report commissioned by ORG ( economic consultants ) however failed to provide support or professional justification for the identification of the CARDINAL key wards or for any increase in designated sales . A further paper on designated sales produced by the divisional director of housing adverted to a number of difficulties about the sales target and gave the view that it was imperative to obtain counsel \u2019s advice .", "On DATE , a number of ORG officers met with ORG . There was no contemporaneous record of his advice . A report was made to the applicant and the Chairmen \u2019s group TIME . The independent counsel was informed that the majority group wished to target sales in marginal wards for electoral advantage . He advised that they could not lawfully sell CARDINAL properties per annum in the marginal wards alone . He also advised that properties had to be designated for proper reasons , across the whole of the City and not in particular wards and that , in identifying properties to be designated , the same criteria had to be applied across the whole City and , ultimately , choice made without reference to anything other than those proper criteria . The Chairmen \u2019s group agreed to target sales city - wide in order to produce the number of designated sales in marginal wards .", "At a meeting on CARDINAL - CARDINAL DATE , the DATE \u2019s group endorsed the target of CARDINAL sales across the ORG which was intended to produce the desired number of sales . During DATE , an analysis was conducted in order to identify the properties that could be designated . The legal adviser to ORG repeated that it was vital that the ORG choose estates on the basis of housing and planning issues and that it would be necessary to be able to show that the list was neither arbitrary nor drawn up with reference to \u201c improper factors \u201d .", "A joint report on ORG in the names of various ORG officials was circulated on DATE , outlining CARDINAL options on designated sales but recommending none . The third option was to designate sufficient properties to produce CARDINAL sales per annum . CARDINAL properties had been identified in the report as eligible for designation PERCENT were in the CARDINAL marginal wards . Evidence was given later that the joint report had been shown to counsel who had considered that it was \u201c judge proof \u201d . The list of properties to be designated was not recommended by officers \u2013 it was presented by the Chairman of ORG PERCENT of all eligible dwellings in the CARDINAL key wards were to be designated while PERCENT of all eligible properties in other wards were designated .", "At the meeting of ORG on DATE , the Chairman of ORG presented Option CARDINAL as the majority party \u2019s preferred option . By CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , Option CARDINAL was adopted .", "Following this decision , on instructions from the Chairmen \u2019s group , monitoring reports were issued concerning the progress to achieving \u201c sales targets \u201d in the CARDINAL key wards . Labour members of the Opposition were questioning the sales policy with increasing vigour however , repeatedly pressing for information on the selection of wards .", "DATE and DATE , some CARDINAL dwellings were disposed of with vacant possession , sold to an approved list of purchasers , all first - time buyers , at discounts varying from PERCENT of the market value according to the circumstances of the purchaser .", "In DATE , complaints were made by local government electors to Mr PERSON , the ORG \u2019s Auditor about the legality of the designated sales policy , inviting the ORG to take action under sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW DATE . CARDINAL persons were named or referred to in the objection , including the applicant , her deputy PERSON , the Director of ORG and others on that ORG .", "In DATE , the ORG requested a formal response to the objections from ORG . The ORG produced its response on DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG asked the ORG if it wished to supplement its reply in light of further objections received during DATE . He also asked the Managing Director of the ORG to provide him with a comprehensive set of reports to the ORG , its committees etc . relating to key wards strategy and designated sales and relevant correspondence on those subjects .", "On DATE , the Managing Director informed the Auditor that ORG did not have a key wards strategy and that there were no Council documents under that heading .", "On DATE , the ORG \u2019s supplementary response was sent to the Auditor .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the Managing Director informed the ORG that the files containing papers relevant to the objections were available for inspection at FAC . The documentation assembled was however far from complete .", "From DATE , the Auditor carried out a review of the extensive documentation at FAC and obtained preliminary legal advice . He requested further documentation from the ORG .", "In DATE , the Auditor commenced his interviews of persons involved . He was to carry out a total of CARDINAL interviews , involving CARDINAL individuals .", "From DATE , the LOC made visits to ORG offices to inspect further documents and made further requests for documents .", "He completed his initial round of interviews in DATE . He interviewed the applicant on DATE . Having regard to his wish to arrange interviews in a particular order , the progress of interviews was hampered by a delay on the part of some prospective interviewees in responding to requests for interviews and by the apparent reluctance of some interviewees to attend for interview . The Auditor exercised his powers under LAW of LAW to require CARDINAL individuals , including the applicant , to attend before him .", "The ORG reviewed the evidence and took further legal advice . In DATE , he began a second round of interviews , which lasted from DATE . He interviewed the applicant for the last time on DATE ( a total of CARDINAL occasions at which the applicant was represented by counsel ) . Having regard to information already received and in consequence of further interviews , the LOC decided to visit a number of ORG offices and to search for documents . He inspected a large number of files , locating files in a storeroom and reviewing the entire underground filing area . New documentation , previously undisclosed , was obtained .", "In DATE , the Auditor became aware for the first time of handwritten notes made by ORG during meetings in DATE to DATE .", "The Auditor conducted a further CARDINAL interviews in DATE . The applicant and others made written submissions to the LOC during DATE .", "On DATE , the Auditor issued \u201c Notices to Show Cause \u201d to CARDINAL named individuals , including the applicant . These stated that he had to consider whether to certify the sum of QUANTITY ( GBP ) or any other sum as due from them as being a loss or deficiency incurred by their wilful misconduct and were accompanied by a Note of his provisional findings and views ( CARDINAL pages ) a history of events ( CARDINAL pages ) and CARDINAL other appendices ( a total of over CARDINAL pages ) and a copy of the public statement issued by the Auditor DATE to the press . In his Note , the Auditor concluded in respect of the applicant that he was provisionally minded to find her guilty of wilful misconduct . The purpose of the issuing of provisional views was to inform those at risk , the ORG and the objectors of those views so that they could address such representations to the LOC as they wished before he reached a final conclusion . He invited those concerned to indicate whether they wished an oral hearing .", "On DATE , the Auditor held a press conference to read out his public statement , sitting at a table on which there was a bundle of material documents . This press conference and the ensuing publicity formed the basis of later complaints that there was an appearance of bias tainting the whole inquiry .", "CARDINAL of the persons named in the provisional findings , the ORG Vice - Chairman of ORG , Councillor PERSON , committed suicide shortly afterwards .", "Solicitors for the applicant applied to ORG on DATE to replace PERSON with a new auditor . ORG refused to do so .", "As CARDINAL parties and the ORG requested an oral hearing ( not the applicant ) , the Auditor fixed proceedings to begin on DATE . In a preliminary meeting in DATE , the applicant applied for the Auditor to disqualify himself . Oral submissions were made on the point on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE . On DATE , the Auditor gave written reasons for not disqualifying himself .", "An audit hearing took place between DATE and DATE , involving DATE of hearings . The applicant was represented at the hearing by leading counsel who made extensive submissions on her behalf . She did not give evidence , having no confidence in the impartiality of the LOC . CARDINAL accountants were called on her behalf .", "The ORG received further representations and evidence after the hearing . On DATE , the applicant made submissions in light of a recent ORG judgment on duties of local authorities to the homeless .", "On DATE , the Auditor circulated a revised provisional calculation of net loss and invited representations by CARDINAL DATE . He received representations from the objectors . The parties were informed that notification of arrangements for the issuing of his decision would be given on DATE . On DATE , the applicant requested ORG to investigate his conduct . The Auditor delayed his decision pending this complaint . On DATE , ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request . She did not seek judicial review of this decision .", "On DATE , the Auditor notified his decision and issued certificates of surcharge under LAW in respect of CARDINAL individuals , the applicant , Mr DATE ( deputy leader of ORG ) , Councillor PERSON ( Chairman of ORG ) , PERSON ( Managing Director from DATE ) , PERSON ( Director of Housing ) and Mr PERSON ( divisional Director of Housing ) . Each was found jointly and severally liable in the sum of GBP CARDINAL being the amount of a loss incurred or deficiency caused by their wilful misconduct . The decision and statement of reasons ran to CARDINAL pages .", "The CARDINAL respondents appealed to ORG under section CARDINAL ) of LAW . The appeal of Mr GPE was later allowed on grounds of his ill - health .", "DATE and DATE , ORG held a preliminary hearing on procedure . It directed inter alia :", "\u201c The nature of the present hearing will be to go beyond a mere judicial review on ORG grounds and look at the merits ( ... ) . The ORG \u2019s report and evidence will stand before us , but is open to challenge ( ... ) ... it is for the appellants to open the appeal and to establish prima facie that there was something amiss with the ORG \u2019s report or certificate ...", "The next question is on whom ultimately the burden lies at the appeal . As we have said , initially it is for the appellants to show that something was wrong with the ORG \u2019s report or certificate . If this hurdle is surmounted by the particular appellant , it is , in our view , for the respondents to prove , on the material before this ORG , wilful misconduct by that appellant causing identified loss . ... It should also be borne in mind that this ORG will have to be satisfied to the high degree of proof on the balance of probability , which is necessary for a finding of wilful misconduct . We rule that the ultimate burden of proof on appeal will be on the respondent .", "... we shall receive such evidence as we have indicated on affidavit , but we shall direct that the deponents be available to be cross - examined ... \u201d", "The appeals were heard DATE and DATE .", "On DATE , ORG delivered its judgment ( PERSON v. PERSON , DATE ORG , p. CARDINAL ) . In its judgment , it commented as follows on the complexity of the proceedings :", "\u201c On any view the auditor \u2019s investigation was vast . It cost MONEY . Whether ORG contemplated so gigantic an investigation by an auditor into an objection to local authority accounts we very much doubt . In our judgment , in any future investigation of this kind it will be essential for the auditor to exercise a sense of proportion and to balance , on the one hand , the need for adequate scrutiny of the accounts and the objections to them and , on the other , the need to avoid prolonged and inordinately expensive inquiry ...", "The auditor in this case conducted CARDINAL interviews with CARDINAL people , including the appellants , each of whom he interviewed many times . The history of events is set out in detail in CARDINAL pages ... His investigations started at the behest of electors who were members of the minority party and who on DATE gave him written notice , under section DATE ) of LAW , of objection to the lawfulness of the council \u2019s accounts . He gave his final decision on DATE . Including appendices , it extends to CARDINAL pages . He examined CARDINAL pages of documents . CARDINAL of pages of transcript of his interviews , the proceedings before him and the submissions made to him were generated . We rule , prior to the hearing of the appeal that the auditor \u2019s interviews of persons other that the appellants should be treated as evidence before us .", "Before this court , with the assistance of all counsel to whom we are indebted , it has been possible , with the aid of comprehensive and detailed written submissions , amplified in oral argument , on behalf of all parties , to focus on the issues raised in this appeal with recourse to comparatively few of these voluminous papers . It has also been a significant feature of this appeal that , although none of the appellants chose to give evidence before the auditor , each of them has sworn a substantial affidavit for the purpose of the appeal , on which each was orally cross - examined . We have also received the written reports of expert valuers and accountants in relation to what , if any , loss the council suffered and these experts have also been orally cross - examined ...", "It follows that we have conducted this appeal by way of re - hearing in accordance with ORG , ORG , r.CARDINAL . In doing so we have kept in the forefront of our minds the impairment of recollection which is the inevitable consequence of the passage of DATE between the occurrence of the material events and the evidence before us . In such circumstances , the contemporaneous documents are of obvious importance . We have approached the matter by considering , in relation to each appellant , whether the auditor appears to have gone wrong in any respect and whether , having regard to the high standard of proof appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation ... wilful misconduct causing loss has been shown ... \u201d", "Concerning the appellants\u2019 assertions about alleged breaches of LAW by the procedures before the Auditor , it stated :", "\u201c In our judgment , LANGUAGE law treats that matter as one of civil not criminal liability . The \u2018 penalty\u2019 as it is described by ORG of ORG is in fact calculated by reference to the loss sustained by the council taxpayer by reason of the wilful misconduct alleged . It follows that the nature of the proceedings is compensatory and based upon the principle that those who misbehave in public office should be required to make good to the taxpayer any resulting loss . That is no different from the principle that a trustee should make good to the trust fund any loss which may result from his misconduct . If the penalty imposed were greater than the loss incurred , then different considerations might apply . But the only potential additional consequence is disqualification from office ... \u201d", "It took the view that the jurisdiction of the domestic courts gave the appellants the required control by a judicial body that had full jurisdiction and provided the guarantees of LAW and that even if what happened before the Auditor was capable of amounting to a breach of the Convention the proceedings before the courts remedied any possible unfairness . It went on to find no problems arising from the role imposed on the LOC by legislation and that no right to cross - examine the LOC arose outside criminal proceedings . It noted that the delay had been extreme but that having regard to the proceedings as the whole which involved an expensive and time consuming investigation and to its finding that no prejudice or resulting injustice had been shown as suffered by the appellants , there was no breach of any reasonable time requirement either . It stated as regarded the LOC \u2019s press conference :", "\u201c We are prepared to accept that , in the light of the great public interest in this matter and the lengthy period taken by the initial investigation culminating in the provisional findings , it was appropriate for the public to be given some explanation for the time spent and some indication of the auditor \u2019s provisional views . But , in our judgment , the press conference which took place was ill - conceived and unfortunately executed . It would have been sufficient for a press statement to have been issued , preferably by the auditor \u2019s solicitor , saying that the complexity of the investigation accounted for its length and that , at that stage , the auditor was provisionally minded to make findings of wilful misconduct causing loss against the individuals named but that , before he reached any final decision , the individuals would have the opportunity to give evidence and make submissions to him .", "Instead , a televised announcement was arranged at which the auditor himself appeared and , although he said that his views were provisional , he expressed them in florid language and supported them by reference to the thoroughness of the investigation which he claimed to have carried out . There was a further feature of the event which should have had no place in the middle of a quasi - judicial inquiry . A stack of ringbinders on the desk at which the auditor sat bearing the name of his firm for the benefit of the cameras was , ostensibly , under the protection of a security guard : unless it was being implied that the persons under investigation might wish to steal the documents , it is not clear what was the purpose of this posturing .", "We express the hope that , in any future , the statutory investigation of this kind , no auditor will stage any similar event , which may undermine the perception , whatever may be the reality , of the auditor \u2019s open - mindedness . In the light of the material before us , including , in particular , the auditor \u2019s reasons for declining to recuse himself , we accept that despite such inferences to the contrary as might have been drawn from the press conference , the auditor did have an open mind and was justified in continuing with the subsequent hearings . ... The error of judgment which we find he made , in holding the press conference as he did , did not , in our view , demonstrate bias on his part . He was at pains to stress the provisional nature of his findings and it is pertinent that in his final decision he made no finding of wilful misconduct against CARDINAL persons in relation to whom he had , provisionally , been minded so to find . In any event , as with the investigation , any possible unfairness to the appellants has been cured by the hearing before us ... \u201d", "On the substance of the appeal , ORG found that the LOC \u2019s decision lacked a \u201c sufficient analysis of the possible impact on the state of mind of the appellants , which is crucial in relation to wilful misconduct , of the legal advice received , or reported to have been received , on CARDINAL DATE \u201d . It concluded itself that the decision of CARDINAL DATE was substantially influenced by a wish to alter the composition of the electorate by increasing the Conservative vote in marginal wards by the sale of council properties and was therefore unlawful . It found untrue the applicant and PERSON \u2019s claim that following counsel \u2019s advice on CARDINAL DATE that the designation of sales for electoral purposes was abandoned :", "\u201c ... in our judgment [ the applicant ] and PERSON lied to us , as they had done to the auditor , because they had the ulterior purpose of altering the electorate which they knew rendered targeting sales in marginal wards unlawful ... Because [ the applicant ] and PERSON knew the targeting policy was unlawful they were content , without further enquiry ... to adopt the suggestion ... that it be dressed up in city - wide clothes : neither claims that this was a proper course . Their purpose throughout was to achieve unlawful electoral advantage . Knowledge of the unlawfulness and such deliberate dressing - up both inevitably point to , and we find , wilful misconduct on behalf of each of them . \u201d", "The appeals of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were allowed , largely , on the basis that it was not established to the necessary standard of proof that what they said or did during the relevant time was , to their knowledge , unlawful or improper . The appeals of the applicant and PERSON DATE were dismissed and they were found to have caused loss by wilful misconduct in the reduced sum of GBP CARDINAL . Permission to appeal was refused . They renewed their applications to appeal on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "On DATE and DATE respectively , Mr DATE and the applicant were granted leave to appeal to ORG .", "The appeals were heard before ORG DATE . In its judgment of DATE , by a majority , it allowed the appeals . The majority held that , since the applicant had acted on what she believed to be correct legal advice , it was inconsistent of ORG to find that she and PERSON had committed wilful misconduct while finding that the other appellants who believed that Option CARDINAL was lawful had not shown wilful misconduct . The majority found the decision of ORG to have been lawful and any improper purpose attributable to the applicant did not render the committee \u2019s decision unlawful and was not causative of any loss . It quashed the ORG \u2019s certificate .", "On the allegations of bias , Lord Justice PERSON noted that the applicant \u2019s counsel accepted that he had not shown that the LOC was actually biased and found that the expression of provisional views was part of the procedure sanctioned by ORG and that there was nothing to lead him to suppose that the ORG was unfairly biased against the appellants . As regarded delay , he considered that a fair hearing was still possible notwithstanding the lapse of time which had had no effect on the reliability of the conclusions reached or the appellants\u2019 ability to present evidence . He also noted that as regarded any implied damage , psychological or otherwise , purported to flow from the delay no claim for damages had been put forward . He was satisfied that the appellants had not been required to prove a lack of wilful misconduct but that the LOC and ORG were persuaded that the appellants had committed wilful misconduct . In respect of the argument that the appellants were unable to cross - examine the ORG before ORG , he considered that though a tribunal \u2019s judgment may be reversed on grounds of actual bias , there was no requirement that the tribunal submit itself to cross - examination in order to see whether an admission of actual bias could be procured . Nor was he impressed by the argument that the appellants were unfairly prevented from cross - examining the LOC as regarded quantum .", "ORG granted the Auditor permission to appeal to ORG . His appeal was heard DATE . In the ORG of Lords\u2019 judgment of DATE , the ORG appeal was allowed and the orders of ORG and the certificate of ORG CARDINAL restored .", "ORG concurred generally with the findings of ORG and the approach of the dissenting judge in ORG .", "In his judgment , Lord PERSON found that the applicant and Mr DATE accepted that they knew that they could not use the council \u2019s powers for electoral advantage and that in adopting and implementing the designated sales policy both acted in a way which they knew to be unlawful . While the applicant \u2019s counsel had argued that the applicant had acted in accordance with what they believed to be legal advice given to the council and were accordingly not guilty of wilful misconduct , he relied on the clear findings of the LOC and ORG , who had heard the evidence , that the applicant and PERSON had not pursued the designated sales policy on legal advice . He noted that :", "\u201c First , it is simply not true that [ Mr S , the PERSON \u2019s counsel who gave the advice ] was given access to all relevant information or that [ the applicant ] laid bare her hopes to her legal advisers . Mr S. received no written instructions and gave no written advice . There were CARDINAL questions which the council should have put to him . The first was whether it was lawful to promote a policy of designating council properties for sale in marginal wards for the purpose of securing an electoral advantage for the majority party at the forthcoming council elections . That question was put to Mr S. and he answered it in the negative as he was bound to do . The second , follow - up question should have been whether , if that policy would be unlawful , the policy would become lawful , if , with the same objective , and in order to conceal the targeting of sales in marginal wards , the designated sales policy were extended across GPE . That question was never put . CARDINAL , including [ the applicant ] and PERSON DATE , could have had any doubt at all what the answer would have been if it had . PERSON was never told of the course on which the council proposed to embark or had embarked . The second weakness is found in the history of pretence , obfuscation and prevarication which surrounded the policy from DATE . If the policy was genuinely believed to be lawful , albeit controversial , there was no need for such intensive camouflage . \u201d", "As regarded the alleged inconsistency in allowing the appeal of ORG , GPE and PERSON while rejecting the appeal of the applicant and Mr DATE , Lord PERSON concurred with the unease felt by Lord Justice PERSON in ORG :", "\u201c It is understandable that ORG was reluctant to be excessively critical of officers , who were subject to considerable pressure from elected members ... PERSON conduct does not earn that measure of indulgence . But ORG had the advantage of hearing these CARDINAL witnesses . It was rightly alert to the high standard required before a finding of this gravity could be sustained . It may very well be that PERSON , GPE and PERSON were fortunate to be exonerated , to the limited extent that they were exonerated . But the findings made against [ the applicant ] and Mr DATE were , in truth , very strong . They were the leader and deputy leader of the council , and were respectively the prime architect and midwife of this policy . I am satisfied that no injustice was done to either of them by upholding the findings of the auditor and ORG . \u201d", "Concerning the grounds of appeal raised under the Convention , Lord Hope rejected the argument that the proceedings fell under LAW in the criminal aspect :", "\u201c I consider that the nature of the proceedings under LAW is compensatory and regulatory , not punitive . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that the amount certifiable by the auditor , where it appears to him that a loss has been incurred or deficiency caused by wilful misconduct , is the amount of the loss or deficiency and that both he and the body in question may recover that amount for the benefit of that body . The object of the procedure is to compensate the body concerned , and the measure of the compensation is the amount of the loss suffered . In the present case the amount certified was very large , but the nature of the proceedings does not alter depending on the amount certified . No fine is involved , nor does the section provide for a penalty by way of imprisonment . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides for the respondents\u2019 disqualification from being members of a local authority . But this outcome is similar to where a trustee is removed after being found to have been in serious breach of trust , or a person is disqualified from acting as a director of a company . In my opinion measures of the kind provided for by LAW , which apply to persons having a special status or responsibility and are compensatory and regulatory rather than penal in character , lie outside the criminal sphere for the purposes of LAW . \u201d", "He went on to find that the applicant was nonetheless entitled to the protection offered by LAW concerning civil rights . To the extent that the Auditor was required by statute to act as investigator , prosecutor and judge , this problem was solved in his view by the provision of a complete rehearing by ORG which could exercise afresh all the powers of decision given to the LOC . He agreed with ORG that the ORG had made an error of judgment in making a statement at a public press conference . However while this created the risk of unfair reporting there was nothing in the words the LOC used to indicate that there was a real possibility that he was biased . He noted the LOC was at pains to point out that his findings were provisional and there was no reason to doubt this as his subsequent conduct demonstrated . Looking at the matter objectively , he did not find that it had been demonstrated that there was a real possibility of bias .", "As regards the complaint of unreasonable delay in the proceedings , Lord Hope ( with whose judgment on the issue all the members of ORG agreed ) observed that the period of which complaint was made could be divided into CARDINAL distinct periods : ( a ) that from the receipt of the original objection on DATE to the issuing by the Auditor of his provisional views on DATE ; ( b ) that from CARDINAL DATE to the end of the audit hearing on DATE ; ( c ) that from DATE to the issuing by the Auditor of his decision and the certificates of surcharge on CARDINAL DATE ; and ( d ) that from DATE to the decision of ORG which was given on DATE . Lord PERSON noted that no complaint had been made about any delay after that date .", "As to the proceedings before ORG , Lord Hope held that there was no basis whatever for the suggestion that there had been unreasonable delay at that stage . The Auditor had issued his certificate in DATE . It was not until DATE that the respondents filed their evidence on the main issues . The accounting evidence was not filed until DATE . A procedural hearing was held shortly afterwards in DATE . The case proceeded to a hearing in ORG in DATE , which lasted for DATE and judgment was given on DATE . Having regard to the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence that had to be prepared and presented , the proceedings in ORG had been concluded within a reasonable time .", "As to the proceedings before the LOC , Lord PERSON stated :", "\u201c In my opinion the most striking feature which emerges from all the facts relating to the conduct of the investigation by the auditor is that , far from causing delay by inaction , he was constantly in action . He was seeking out information wherever it could be found , often with considerable difficulty . He was interviewing and re - interviewing many witnesses , recovering and perusing CARDINAL of documents , calculating amounts of loss and expenditure and then gathering all this information together into a decision which eventually extended to CARDINAL pages ... It has been suggested that his investigation was over - elaborate . There are comments to that effect in ORG judgment ... But the auditor had to form his own judgment on this matter . He had to take account of the importance of the exercise to all parties , including those who were at risk of being surcharged , and he was entitled to have regard to its obvious political sensitivity . I would attach particular significance to these factors and to the fact that it has not been suggested at any stage that the auditor caused delay at any stage by inactivity .", "Applying the test described in PERSON v. GPE ... which directs attention to the complexity of the case , the applicant \u2019s conduct and the manner in which the matter was dealt with by the authorities , and leaving aside the question whether the [ applicant and PERSON ] can show that they were prejudiced , I would hold that the proceedings did not exceed the reasonable time requirement which LAW lays down . ... \u201d", "On DATE , the ORG made a formal demand for the applicant to pay the certified sum by DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG issued proceedings in ORG for the certified sum , damages and the audit fees . On DATE , the ORG obtained an ex parte order freezing the applicant \u2019s assets up to a value of ORG CARDINAL . She was required to file an affidavit listing her assets by DATE . The freezing order was renewed on DATE , including limited exceptions for living expenses and a reasonable sum ( not exceeding GBP CARDINAL ) for legal representation .", "The applicant filed a defence , denying liability to pay additional damages or audit fees .", "On DATE , the ORG issued an application for summary judgment against the applicant . The applicant opposed the application at a hearing on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . On DATE , ORG issued summary judgment for payment of the certified sum and damages for breach of trust ( a total sum not exceeding GBP CARDINAL ) . The applicant \u2019s application for a stay pending proceedings in GPE was refused .", "The applicant was granted leave to appeal .
