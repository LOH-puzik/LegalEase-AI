The first applicant had its registered office in GPE . The second applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant was a limited liability company founded by ORG of ORG and registered as a legal entity in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG and ORG founded ORG , GPE newspaper . On DATE it was officially registered as a regional news medium . The official address of its editorial board was the same as that of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , the editorial board of ORG , GPE newspaper was not registered as a legal entity and did not have articles of association . The first applicant was the publisher of ORG , GPE newspaper . The applicants were , however , unable to submit a publishing agreement .", "CARDINAL . According to its articles of association , as amended on DATE , the first applicant \u2019s main activity consisted in issuing PERSON , GPE newspaper . It also carried out publishing and advertising activities . The first applicant was managed by its executive body , the editor - in - chief . That position was occupied at the material time by the second applicant , who was at the same time the editor - in - chief of ORG , GPE newspaper .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , GPE newspaper published an article under the headline \u201c The Chief ORG has brought the media to its knees . But not the businessmen \u201d ( \u00ab \u0413\u0424\u0418 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0443. \u041d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 GPE ) . The article was written by the second applicant , who signed it using his pen - name , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The article concerned a joint press conference held by PERSON , the Chief Federal Inspector for GPE , and PERSON , the Mayor of GPE . The press conference was about the media coverage of the regional project \u201c GPE , cultural capital of the LOC region for DATE \u201d . The article was critical of the cultural value of the events connected with the project and spoke ironically about PERSON \u201c accomplishments \u201d in that field . PERSON was further quoted as saying that the allotted funds were insufficient to finance the work of the project \u2019s organising committee and as criticising local businesses for their unwillingness to sponsor the project , allegedly because the project had not received the Governor \u2019s explicit endorsement . The article then went on as follows :", "\u201c Curiously enough , just before that meeting , I had a chance to talk to some businessmen I know . They told me that the chief federal inspector \u2019s office had literally pestered them with \u2018 ORG for them to become sponsors . However , they do not respond to such \u2018 ORG , not because they fear the Governor , but because they do not want to give money . Some say that [ Mr P. ] is too deeply involved in political games , of which they want no part . Others are , for some reason , concerned that their money might be wasted on the lovers of the collector of funds rather than spent on cultural events . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , in his official capacity as the Chief Federal Inspector , brought an action for defamation against the editorial board of the PERSON newspaper and the author of the article , PERSON . According to his statement of claim , the final paragraph of the contested article had asserted that he was in charge of the collection and distribution of funds for the project , that he was capable of committing a crime by embezzling the funds entrusted to him , and that he had lovers , thereby violating moral and ethical norms . Considering that those statements were untrue and damaging to his honour , dignity and professional reputation , he sought a retraction and compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . PERSON also enclosed the text of the retraction statement that he wished the editorial board of the PERSON newspaper to publish . It contained an apology and an acknowledgement that the last sentence of the paragraph cited above was untrue and damaging to his honour and reputation , a promise to discipline the author of the article and an undertaking to respect the domestic law on the media in the future .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , deputy editor - in - chief of the first applicant , signed a power of attorney appointing PERSON and PERSON to act as its counsel in the defamation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON ORG of GPE decided to sever the claim against the author of the article for adjudication in separate proceedings because the first applicant had refused to disclose his identity . The proceedings against the author were stayed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , sitting in a single - judge formation comprising Judge PERSON , held a hearing . Counsel , Mr PERSON and PERSON , asked that the hearing be adjourned because the second applicant , the newspaper \u2019s editor - in - chief and the only person acquainted with the circumstances relating to the contested publication , was on DATE leave until DATE . The court refused the request .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON and PERSON further submitted that the contested statements did not concern PERSON , who was not the collector of funds for the cultural project . The funds were being collected by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for PERSON submitted that the article had been entirely devoted to PERSON It stated , in particular , that he had \u201c pestered \u201d local businessmen with requests to become sponsors of the cultural project . The last sentence of the article , which concerned the collector of funds , could easily be interpreted as directed at PERSON Such an interpretation had indeed been made by a number of local newspapers , which had also understood the last sentence of the article as referring to PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE granted PERSON claim against the editorial board of the PERSON newspaper in full . The court found that the final paragraph of the article contained false information about the plaintiff , who it had falsely alleged was the collector of funds that might have been wasted on lovers rather than spent on cultural events . The court noted that the defendant had not produced any proof of the truthfulness of that information . It ordered the editorial board to pay the plaintiff MONEY ( RUR ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , and RUR CARDINAL in court fees . It further ordered an immediate publication of the retraction statement as drafted by PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE enforcement proceedings were opened . On DATE , the first applicant applied to ORG for a stay in the enforcement proceedings . It submitted that the court had ordered the enforcement of the judgment against the editorial board of the PERSON newspaper , which had no legal entity status and , accordingly , could not be a defendant in civil proceedings . Furthermore , the order for immediate enforcement was unlawful and violated the first applicant \u2019s right to know the reasons for the judgment ( at that time , the full text of the judgment was unavailable ) and to lodge an appeal against it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Judge PERSON issued CARDINAL interim decisions . By the first decision he refused the first applicant \u2019s request for a stay of enforcement as unsubstantiated . No further reasons were given . The second decision rectified an error in the operative part of the judgment . It held that the defendant \u2019s name was \u201c the limited liability company ORG Vesti Newspaper \u201d rather than \u201c the editorial board of the PERSON newspaper \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Gubernskie Vesti , ORG newspaper published the retraction statement as drafted by PERSON and endorsed in the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of DATE , submitting that the article had not named the collector of funds for the project or suggested that it was Mr P. who had collected the funds . Nor had it stated that PERSON had lovers or that he had embezzled any funds entrusted to him . It was clear from the text that the contested sentence did not concern PERSON at all . The first applicant further complained about ORG unreasoned refusal to adjourn the hearing until the second applicant had returned from leave . The second applicant was the only person who knew the identity of the author of the article and who was able to give an informed response to the statement of claim .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant lodged a statement in support of the appeal . He disclosed that he was the author of the article and stated that the judgment of DATE had been poorly reasoned . Although Mr P. had failed to prove that the contested sentence concerned him personally , ORG had accepted his claim without analysing whether the impugned statements were indeed directed at him .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the proceedings against the author of the article were resumed and the second applicant was summoned to appear before ORG as the defendant in PERSON defamation case instituted on DATE . His case was heard by a bench composed of the presiding judge PERSON and CARDINAL lay assessors . The second applicant lodged an objection against Judge PERSON on the ground that he had already expressed his position in the judgment against the editorial board . Lay assessors examined and rejected the objection , finding that the second applicant \u2019s fears as to PERSON impartiality were not justified .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the second applicant was represented by PERSON as counsel . The second applicant and his counsel both argued that the last sentence of the article did not concern Mr P. It concerned the collector of funds , who had not been identified in the article . The fact that other newspapers had interpreted the last sentence as directed at Mr P. was irrelevant because the second applicant could not be held responsible for the actions of other people . They further submitted that the second applicant had simply repeated the reservations expressed by businessmen with regard to the distribution of the funds collected for the project .", "CARDINAL . Counsel for PERSON repeated the arguments he had advanced at the hearing of DATE , in particular the reasons why PERSON believed that the contested statements were directed at him . He submitted , in particular , that the title and the structure of the article showed that it was entirely about PERSON and that other people had understood the last sentence of the article as concerning PERSON , and this had been proved by articles in other newspapers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a judgment against the second applicant . The court found that the article read as a whole gave the impression that the contested statements concerned Mr P. The same interpretation had been arrived at by other newspapers , which had been unanimous in considering that the last sentence had been about Mr P. The contested statements , which accused PERSON of spending public funds on lovers , were damaging to his honour , dignity and professional reputation . The second applicant had failed to prove the truthfulness of his statements about Mr P. The second applicant was ordered to pay RUR CARDINAL ( approximately CARDINAL euros ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , and ORG in court fees .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant appealed . He repeated the arguments advanced in his statement in support of the first applicant \u2019s appeal . He further argued that the outcome of his case had been predetermined by the judgment against the editorial board . Judge PERSON , who had examined the case against the editorial board , was bound to have had a preconceived opinion on his case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned the examination of the appeals . It established that the interim decision of DATE rectifying an error in the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had been issued in the absence of the interested parties . Moreover , the parties had not received a copy of that decision and had thereby been deprived of an opportunity to appeal . Until that omission had been remedied , the appeal against the judgment of DATE could not be examined , nor could the appeal against the judgment of DATE . Because both cases were based on the same claim , the determination of CARDINAL of them would prejudge the outcome of the other . On that ground , ORG decided that the CARDINAL cases should be joined and all appeals should be examined simultaneously .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant lodged an appeal against the interim decision of DATE . It argued that that decision was unlawful for the following reasons : the rectification had been made by ORG of its own motion ; the decision had been taken in the absence of the parties ; and , in substance , the decision was the disguised substitution of a defendant rather than a correction of a clerical error or an obvious mistake . The first applicant submitted that the limited liability company ORG and the editorial board of the PERSON newspaper were CARDINAL distinct entities : the first was registered as a legal entity , while the second was operating without ORG registration . The fact that ORG had issued a judgment against the wrong entity demonstrated that the adjudication of the case had been superficial and the essential aspects of the case had not been examined properly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , by a new interim decision , confirmed its earlier decision of DATE on the rectification of the error regarding the defendant \u2019s name . The first applicant lodged an appeal repeating the arguments advanced in the appeal statement of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined all the appeals . Both applicants were represented at the hearing by PERSON", "CARDINAL . ORG quashed the interim decision of DATE on the ground that it had been issued in the absence of the parties , but upheld the interim decision of CARDINAL DATE , which , in its view , was lawful . Thus , it found that counsel who had taken part in the hearing of DATE had represented the interests of the first applicant , the limited liability company ORG . It was clear that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE defined the rights of , and imposed obligations on , the first applicant , because no other organisation had been involved in the proceedings . The amendment of the defendant \u2019s name had therefore been no more than a rectification of a clerical error not related to the merits of the case and having no effect on the substance of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG further upheld the judgments of CARDINAL DATE and DATE in substance . In particular , it found that ORG had addressed the applicants\u2019 arguments relating to the existence of an objective link between the contested statements and the plaintiff . It had analysed the tile , structure and contents of the impugned article and had correctly found that its last sentence concerned Mr P. Moreover , it had taken into account that PERSON was not the only one to have understood that the sentence had been directed at him ; other newspapers had also drawn the same conclusion . ORG had therefore correctly required the defendants to prove the truthfulness of their allegations , which they had failed to do . Both applicants had been represented at hearings by counsel , and their procedural rights had therefore been respected . Finally , ORG held that the severance of the claim against the second applicant from the proceedings \u201c had not involved a substantially incorrect determination of the dispute \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , however , that ORG had incorrectly required the first applicant to publish the retraction statement drafted by the plaintiff . The requirement for an apology , a promise to discipline the author and an undertaking to respect domestic law contained in the retraction statement had no basis in domestic law . The order for immediate enforcement had also been unlawful . The court ordered that the first applicant publish an amended retraction statement . It also reduced the award payable by the first applicant to RUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( MONEY ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant published the amended retraction statement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was declared insolvent and dissolved .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Civil Code provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the retraction of statements ( svedeniya ) that are damaging to his or her honour , dignity or professional reputation , if the person who disseminated such statements does not prove their truthfulness . The aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements .", "CARDINAL . ORG Ruling no . CARDINAL of ORG of GPE , adopted on DATE ( as amended on DATE and in force at the material time ) , provided that , in order to be considered damaging , statements had to be untrue and contain allegations of a breach of laws or moral principles ( for example , the commission of a dishonest act , or improper behaviour in the workplace or in everyday life ) . Dissemination of statements was understood as the publication of statements or their broadcasting ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . The burden of proof was on the defendant to show that the disseminated statements were true and accurate ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE adopted Ruling no . CARDINAL , requiring courts hearing defamation claims to distinguish between statements of facts which could be checked for veracity and evaluative judgments , opinions and convictions , which were not actionable under LAW because they were expressions of a defendant \u2019s subjective opinion and views and therefore could not be checked for veracity ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , it prohibited the courts from ordering defendants to make an apology to a plaintiff , because that form of redress had no basis under NORP law , including LAW ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Mass Media Act ( Law no . CARDINAL-I of DATE ) defines an editorial board of a news medium as an organisation , citizen or group of citizens producing and issuing that news medium . An editorial board may start functioning after State registration of the news medium ( section CARDINAL) . An editorial board may \u2013 but is not required to \u2013 obtain legal entity status through ORG registration ( section DATE ) . An editorial board must have articles of association adopted by the general assembly of journalists and approved by the founder of the news medium ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A publisher of a news medium is defined in LAW as a company or business person responsible for the technical , material and logistical aspects of a production process ( section CARDINAL ) . The editorial board or the editor - in - chief and the publisher must conclude a publishing agreement ( section CARDINAL ) . The functions of an editorial board and a publisher may be combined in CARDINAL legal entity ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Founders , editorial boards , publishers and distributers of mass media , as well as journalists and authors of distributed statements may be held liable for a breach of the legal provisions governing mass media ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . Ruling no . CARDINAL of ORG of GPE ( cited in paragraph CARDINAL above ) provides that in cases where articles have been published in a newspaper , the defendants in an action for defamation must be the article \u2019s author and the newspaper \u2019s editorial board . If the author is not indicated , the editorial board will be the sole defendant . If the editorial board does not have legal entity status , the founder of the newspaper will be cited as the defendant ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The RSFSR Code of Civil Procedure ( in force up to CARDINAL DATE ) provided that after pronouncing a judgment , a court could not quash or amend it . However , the court could , of its own motion or at the request of a party , rectify clerical errors or obvious errors in calculation . In such a case the court had an obligation to hold a hearing and notify the parties of its date . The parties could appeal against the rectification order ( Article CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1", "6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
