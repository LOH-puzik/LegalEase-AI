POLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by Mr L. ORG , a lawyer practising in PERSON . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant and his wife divorced . In a divorce judgment , ORG awarded custody of the parties\u2019 DATE son PERSON to the mother and granted the applicant access to the child CARDINAL times per month .", "On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings for denial of paternity . In the light of DNA analysis , it was established that PERSON was the applicant \u2019s biological child . The applicant subsequently recognised his paternity .", "On DATE the applicant obtained a decision of ORG concerning his access to PERSON and modifying the access arrangements determined by the divorce judgment . He was granted access to the child by visiting him at the mother \u2019s address , indicated in the decision , once a month , on DATE of DATE , from TIME , as from DATE .", "On DATE the ORG gave a judgment by which the applicant was divested of his parental authority . The court found that the applicant had not made any efforts to maintain close emotional ties with his child during DATE of his life . The court also observed that the applicant had been evading parental responsibilities and his behaviour had not seemed to have been motivated by the child \u2019s best interests .", "This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "On an unspecified later date the mother moved to GPE with PERSON and married again .", "The applicant repeatedly requested the police to accompany him during his visits to the child \u2019s PERSON house to exercise his rights of access to PERSON as provided in the DATE decision . The police officers on every occasion verified whether PERSON was at home , but invariably found that both PERSON and his mother were absent .", "The applicant instituted enforcement proceedings under the provisions of LAW governing enforcement of judgments imposing non - pecuniary obligations .", "On DATE the ORG gave a decision by which it refused to institute enforcement proceedings in respect of the access decision of DATE . It observed that it provided only for the applicant \u2019s right to have access to his son and specified the access arrangements , but did not determine the mother \u2019s corresponding obligations . Thus , it could not be enforced .", "Following the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision , on DATE ORG upheld the decision , sharing the first - instance court \u2019s conclusion that the judgment could not be enforced .", "The applicant subsequently requested ORG to give an interpretation of its DATE decision . On DATE the court refused to do so , considering that the applicant wished in fact to have original decision amended by setting out the mother \u2019s obligations . This , the court declared , could be done in a new set of access proceedings in which the access arrangements would be reviewed and amended so as to specify the mother \u2019s obligations .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision . The court observed that the applicant \u2019s dissatisfaction with the fact that he could not exercise his access rights determined by the judicial decision had been legitimate and justified . Nevertheless , the court agreed with the conclusion of the decision of CARDINAL DATE that the original access decision had not imposed any obligations on the mother and therefore could not be subject to enforcement proceedings . ORG also observed that ORG had , in its decision of DATE , indicated a way of clarifying the applicant \u2019s situation , i.e. by applying for a modification of the decision of DATE .", "The applicant did not apply to have this decision modified by the court .", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG ( PERSON i PERSON ) provides :", "\u201c In a decision on divorce , the court is competent to issue orders concerning the manner in which the care of the parties\u2019 minor children should be carried out ( ... ) . The court may grant custody rights to CARDINAL parent and limit the custody rights of the other CARDINAL . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure ( Kodeks Post\u0119powania Cywilnego ) provides :", "\u201c The custody court can change its decision if the best interests of the person whom it concerns so require . \u201c", "According to ORG resolution , if a parent called upon by a court decision to respect the other GPE access rights refuses to comply therewith , that decision is liable to enforcement proceedings . The provisions of LAW on enforcement of non - pecuniary obligations are applicable to the enforcement of court decisions on parental rights or access rights ( DATE , III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL , OSNCP DATE CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
