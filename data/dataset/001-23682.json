On DATE the ORG expressed doubts as to the applicant \u2019s competence and the quality of the report .", "PERSON report continued to receive a wide coverage in other media as well . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE extensive excerpts from the report were published in GPE , a bi - weekly for fishermen .", "Over DATE the debate about Mr PERSON \u2019s report died out until DATE , when he gave a press conference in GPE .

PERSON from the film were broadcast by the ORG ( ORG ) DATE and the entire film was broadcast by NORP TVCARDINAL on DATE . During DATE scenes from the film were broadcast by CARDINAL broadcasting companies world - wide , including ORG and ORG .", "On account of various publications of allegations by the applicant to the effect that certain seal hunters had violated ORG issued by ORG and some instance LAW , the CARDINAL crew members of NORP brought , mostly with success , a series of defamation proceedings against the applicant and a number of media corporations and companies , including PERSON and its former editor .", "In the defamation case against the applicant himself , ORG ( byrett ) held in a judgment of CARDINAL DATE that a number of his statements were defamatory and should be declared null and void and ordered him to pay compensation to the CARDINAL plaintiffs .

CARDINAL ) lodged under the LAW , in which the newspaper and its former editor disputed ORG ( herredsrett ) findings of CARDINAL DATE ( against which ORG had refused leave to appeal on DATE ) that its publication of several statements from the applicant \u2019s report ( crew in specific instances \u201c beat to death a female harp seal which was protecting her pup \u201d ; \u201c Seals skinned alive \u201d ; the applicant was \u201c being beaten up by furious hunters , who also threatened to hit him on the head with a gaff if he did not keep quiet . \u201d ) made them liable for defamation and that the statements should be declared null and void : In its PERSON and PERSON v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( [ MONEY ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-III ) , the ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , found that there had been a violation of LAW with regard to the newspaper and the former editor ( see paragraphs CARDINAL of the judgment and point CARDINAL of the operative provisions ) .", "The present application relates to the NORP ORG refusal to prevent the enforcement in GPE ( where the applicant lived ) of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the defamation proceedings against the applicant on account of similar or comparable allegations . For a broader view of the factual background of the case complex , the context of the impugned allegations and also details of NORP defamation law , the ORG refers to paragraphs DATE of its above - cited judgment .", "In DATE the crew members of the ORG had instituted defamation proceedings against Mr PERSON before ORG , referring to statements which he had made about them in respect of the DATE and DATE hunting seasons , in his report of CARDINAL DATE , in a television programme \u201c Antenne CARDINAL \u201d broadcast by ORG on DATE and the film broadcast by the NORP TVCARDINAL on DATE in its programme \u201c LOC \u201d ( Environment pictures ) . They sought the mortification of certain statements imputing reprehensible conduct on the part of the crew . The plaintiffs further requested a prohibition against the publication of the report and of film footage taken by the applicant during the seal hunt on LOC in DATE and DATE .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( extending to CARDINAL pages ) , ORG , after holding an oral hearing DATE , found for the applicant with regard to some of the impugned statements but declared CARDINAL statements in his inspection report null and void under LAW , as well as CARDINAL other statements made by him in television programmes :", "In the report", "i \u201c Finally , it is my firm opinion that every seal in the hunting area was to be put to death \u2013 no matter the cost or risk . \u201d", "ii \u201c The sharp end of the gaff was forcefully driven into the head of the animal by an intoxicated man . \u201d", "ii \u201c Some of these people seem to have an excessive , raw lifestyle . \u201d", "iv \u201c Since I thought the mental health of [ Mr. PERSON ] was unbalanced ( DATE I made the same observation reg . this man ) I found it best to avoid the man for the rest of DATE . \u201d", "v \u201c When the hunter realises that he has failed \u2013 that he is the loosing party DATE he kills the female ... .The hunter always invokes self - defence as an excuse for killing the female \u2013 who is able to prove the contrary ? \u201d", "In the TVCARDINAL programme", "vi \u201c Due to the present conditions , it is a tragedy to the seal , to GPE as a nation it is a scandal \u2013 that the set of rules , as it is drafted by ORG , is violated nearly to PERCENT . \u201d", "In the ORG programme", "vii \u201c I often saw these whitecoats , bluebacks also for that matter , being kicked to death or being stamped to death when they came on board . \u201d", "ORG further prohibited the applicant from making accessible to the relevant public film footage , where the plaintiffs could be identified , and ordered him to pay to each of them ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , plus ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of profits he had obtained through illegal publication of the film , as well as legal costs .", "ORG reasoning , which went CARDINAL pages or so , included a detailed analysis of , inter alia , the contents of the impugned allegations , with an assessment of whether they were defamatory in character ; whether the applicant had adduced sufficient proof to establish the veracity of those allegations that were found defamatory , the justification of the request for a prohibition on publication and compensation .", "The applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal against the judgment was rejected by ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts Kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) on DATE .", "The applicant opposed the execution of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . Since he was residing in GPE , the crew members requested ORG ( kronofogdemyndigheten ) of GPE to execute the award of compensation and costs made in the said judgment . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant to pay certain specified sums . The applicant lodged a judicial appeal against that decision , invoking that the CARDINAL DATE judgment violated his right to freedom of expression under LAW .", "In proceedings to which the CARDINAL crew members were parties , ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tt ) , by a decision ( beslut ) of DATE , rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . It noted that the impugned matter predated the entry into force of the DATE LAW ( on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ) for GPE and GPE ( respectively on DATE and CARDINAL DATE ) , so it fell to be considered under LAW CARDINAL:CARDINAL regarding ORG judgments in the area of GPE , section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of which provided that a judgment which was obviously incompatible with the NORP public order should not be recognised or implemented in GPE . According to the preparatory works this provision should be applied with great caution . In practice it had only been applied in narrowly defined and exceptional circumstances , when there was question of principles fundamental to the NORP legal system and provisions protecting the interests of a weaker party . In this respect ORG observed that the principle of exclusive responsibility on the part of the publisher of an allegation in a periodical or a film was a very important part of the NORP constitutional protection of free speech . That principle did not exist in the NORP legal system , under which several persons might incur liability with respect to the contents of a periodical or a television programme . However , this difference between the NORP and the NORP law , albeit decisive in part for the outcome before ORG , did not amount to an exceptional circumstance warranting the application of the public order provision in LAW . Accordingly , there was no obstacle to recognition and enforcement of ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . Nor could that judgment be said to breach the Convention .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ) of LOC which by a decision of DATE upheld ORG reasoning in the main and its conclusion that public order considerations did not prevent the execution of the NORP court \u2019s judgment in GPE .", "ORG held that it was not for a NORP court to review compatibility with the LAW beyond considering what followed from the NORP public order rules . Of particular interest were the rules on exclusive responsibility of the publisher and the limitations on the possibilities for bringing compensation proceedings against persons other than the publisher of a programme . The question was whether it would be inconsistent with fundamental principles of NORP law to allow enforcement of the compensation award against the applicant for statements with respect to which he would not have been made liable under NORP law . Since the Freedom of the Press Act ( tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordningen , an instrument forming part of LAW ) only applied to printed matters which had been published , it could not apply to the report published by the newspaper without ORG consent . The applicant \u2019s statements during television programmes , on the other hand , were such that they were covered by the principle of the publisher \u2019s exclusive responsibility . The legal grounds on which the applicant was made liable to pay compensation differed in part from the NORP rules . In particular he would not have been liable with regard to the statements made during the television programmes .", "In the assessment of whether execution of the NORP judgment would be obviously incompatible with the fundamental principles of the NORP legal order , ORG had special regard to its consideration that a restrictive attitude ought to be adopted in matters that had particular links to the other ORG . The applicant \u2019s statements concerned NORP matters and an activity in that country which did not concern NORP interests beyond those of public opinion .", "On a further appeal by the applicant , ORG ( ORG domstolen ) , by a decision of DATE , upheld the lower courts\u2019 decision . It gave the following reasons :", "\u201c A first question arising is whether , in a case concerning enforcement , there is an obligation under the Convention for NORP authorities to examine the conformity of a foreign judgment with the Convention .", "ORG has been inclined to consider enforcement proceedings following a judgment as part of the proceedings concerning the determination of civil rights and obligations ( see PERSON , PERSON r\u00e4ttigheter i europeisk praxis pp CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . The ORG \u2019s judgment in GPE v GPE , dealing with an issue of enforcement in GPE of a criminal judgment delivered in GPE , could be interpreted to mean that in cases of flagrant denial of justice in foreign proceedings , a certain review ought to be carried out prior to the execution of a criminal judgment ( see PERSON , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "In these circumstances ORG finds that an examination ought to be made of [ the applicant \u2019s ] submission that ORG judgment must not be executed on the grounds that it violates LAW . It can , however , not be a question of undertaking a complete review of ORG judgment . Such a scheme would cause an excessive burden to the international co - operation aimed at facilitating the execution of judgments in countries other than that where the judgment was delivered ( cp . , PERSON , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It is also apparent that a court in the ORG of origin is normally better placed than an authority in the ORG of enforcement to make certain assessments , for example evidentiary matters and the application of the national law of the ORG of origin . Normally the proceedings in that ORG have been complete and afforded the parties an opportunity to adduce evidence and legal arguments in support for their case . This can be presumed to be the case especially with respect to GPE which have ratified the Convention ( cp . , PERSON , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "In the relations among the Convention States themselves it should normally suffice for the authority in the country of execution to pursue a rather summary assessment in verifying whether the judgment is in conformity with the Convention . However , should there , for example on a claim by a party , emerge circumstances that would make it questionable whether the judgment fulfils the requirements in the ORG , a closer scrutiny must be carried out .", "According to paragraph CARDINAL of LAW everyone has a right to freedom of expression . Pursuant to the second paragraph this right may be subjected to certain limitations , provided that they are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society inter alia for the protection of the reputation of others . If a person has made a defamatory statement against another person and the case is brought before a court , the court has to weigh the former \u2019s interest in enjoying his right to freedom of expression against the latter \u2019s interest in protecting his personal integrity . As a principle , the person who has made a defamatory allegation against another person must be able to prove that the statement is true . This applies in particular if the statement includes an allegation that the person pointed at has committed a criminal offence . The person who has made the statement must however not be imposed with an unreasonable burden of proof ( see ORG judgment in PERSON [ of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ] ) .", "The balance that shall be struck between the interest of freedom of expression and the interest of protecting the reputation of an individual may depend on who is the victim of the defamatory allegation and the accusation \u2019s importance to public debate . A politician , for instance , must be prepared to accept more than a private person . The same holds true for political and other institutions . If the allegation is part of a public debate or serves to enlighten on a question of public interest , that is a factor that carries great weight .", "In the examination of ORG judgment to be carried out in the present enforcement case , ORG finds from the outset that it must be deemed acceptable that ORG has placed the burden of proof on [ the applicant ] with regard to the truth of his statements . ORG further finds no reason to question the establishment of facts made by ORG . It must , amongst other , be taken into account that ORG held an oral hearing of the case DATE and must be assumed to have had ample opportunity to go into the different issues of the case . Finally , as regards to the balancing of interest to be carried out between [ the applicant \u2019s ] right to freedom of expression and each individual seal hunters\u2019 interest in protecting his reputation , regard must be had inter alia to the fact that the subject that [ the applicant ] raised in the debate was of great public interest and that he had the mission to serve as a seal hunting inspector and had special reasons for expressing himself . Against this it should be weighed that the applicant \u2019s statements were not pointed at seal hunters in general but at individual persons and that these persons did not occupy a position suggesting that they should accept to be pointed at in the same way as public persons . Having regard to these circumstances , ORG finds that ORG assessment did not entail a violation of [ the applicant \u2019s ] right to freedom of expression under LAW . There is thus no hindrance under this Article to the enforcement of ORG judgment .", "As regards the question whether there are obstacles to enforcement of ORG judgment in view of public order considerations it should be underlined that , generally speaking , only in exceptional cases can there be question of refusing enforcement of a judgment on such grounds ... This applies especially when there is question of enforcement of a judgment delivered in another NORP country .", "The issue of NORP public order in this case concerns firstly [ the applicant \u2019s ] participation in the film that was shown on NORP television . This participation should be considered against the background of the principles on the freedom to impart information under LAW ( tryckfrihetsf\u00f6rordiningen , an instrument forming part of LAW ) and LAW ( yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen ) . According to this principle everyone is free to provide information for publication by a printed matter , by radio or television broadcast or other medium , which enjoy special constitutional protection . A person who contributes in this way to the creation of for example a television programme ( except in certain circumstances which do not apply here ) , is free from criminal liability and liability to pay compensation , which instead lay on the publisher and , in the case of liability to pay compensation , on the company . LAW is certainly not applicable to the NORP television programme , as it was shown before the entry into force of the constitutional provisions on DATE , though corresponding provisions existed under LAW DATE on ORG .", "The freedom to impart information is a fundamental principle under LAW ... It must therefore be assumed that NORP public order considerations bar the enforcement in GPE of a foreign judgment imposing criminal punishment or an award of compensation , where the establishment of liability on the other country constitutes a circumvention of the NORP constitutional protection of persons who contribute to the preparation of a presentation in any of the constitutionally protected media . However , NORP public order considerations can not go as far as to always protect a person who has contributed to a programme shown on NORP television against the enforcement of a foreign judgment concerning liability for participation in the programme . Thus , a person who defames another person in a programme shown in another country , which is later shown in GPE , can not , as a rule , avoid enforcement of a judgment delivered in the [ first ] country establishing that defamation has occurred there . The conclusion is that in an enforcement matter , the question whether there are circumstances warranting the refusal of enforcement in GPE must be considered on a case - by - case basis .", "As regards the film in question it has been stated that it was shown at press conferences in GPE and GPE , in which [ the applicant ] participated , DATE before it was broadcast on NORP television . On DATE as the press conferences took place , the film was also broadcast by LANGUAGE television . It does not appear clearly from ORG judgment what instances of visioning of the film gave rise to liability , but there is no reason for assuming that it did not concern also those instances that did not occur in GPE . Even if a greater NORP public could view the film only when it was broadcast by NORP television , in the above - mentioned circumstances and the situation as a whole , it can not be considered against NORP public order to enforce the NORP judgment in this point .", "Nor were there any other public order grounds constituting a hinder to the requested enforcement . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
