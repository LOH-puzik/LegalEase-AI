NORP The applicant company is a legal entity registered in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government adopted a resolution establishing ORG for LAW ( hereafter \u201c the development plan \u201d ) . The main objectives of the development plan were published in ORG ( PERSON \u017einios ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The development plan explicitly indicated that the buildings with a former military objective , situated in the adjacent dunes , had to be removed ( nukeliami ) and the natural environment fully restored .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government decided to privatise the former NORP ( DATE GPE ) military buildings , without the land , in Juodkrant\u0117 , GPE , within LAW . There were CARDINAL military barracks , a canteen , a store house and CARDINAL sheds .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG carried out a public auction , at which the applicant company was the only participant and purchased the buildings for CARDINAL NORP litai ( ORG , MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The purchase agreement , which was concluded in DATE , indicated that the applicant company had to lease the land assigned to the buildings ( \u012fsipareigoja i\u0161sinuomoti \u0161iam objektui priskirt\u0105 \u017eem\u0117s sklyp\u0105 ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE decided to prepare a detailed plan of the area where the buildings were sited . The purpose of the plan was to designate a plot of land near the existing buildings , providing an opportunity to renovate the buildings or to build new recreational buildings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the authorities in charge of ORG decided that renovation of the buildings had to meet the requirements applicable to the whole area . The buildings had to be integrated in the landscape ; as they were sited in the forest , the purpose of the use of the land had to be changed .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the LOC department of environmental protection decided that the purpose of the use of the land , on account of its specific location , could only be changed if the projects were approved by those managing protected areas or with the approval of ORG . In DATE the same department rejected a detailed plan submitted by the applicant company , seeking to amend the purpose of the land so that it became a recreational area .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company instituted court proceedings , urging the court to declare unlawful the authorities\u2019 rejection of the detailed plan proposed by the applicant company ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and to oblige them to accept it .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company \u2019s claim was dismissed on DATE by ORG and on DATE by ORG . The courts held that in accordance with domestic law there was no possibility to build new recreational buildings in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The courts thus held that the applicant company \u2019s detailed plan was contrary to the development plan .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant company asked the authorities to conclude a lease agreement in respect of the land assigned to the buildings . The authorities replied that the applicant company had to provide a plan of the land . However , as there was no detailed plan of the area , the land could not be leased . The applicant company was also obliged to pay the land tax .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company instituted court proceedings and complained that it had to pay the land tax but ORG on DATE and ORG on DATE held that it had to pay the land tax because it had been using the land in question .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company asked the authorities to include the land in question in the landscape management recreational zone . In DATE , ORG replied that the development plan of DATE indicated that the buildings had to be demolished . It said that it would formulate provisions in the explanatory report regarding the possibility to compensate the applicant company for the buildings . In this case , the applicant company would be able to acquire other buildings owned by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company proposed that the land under its buildings be included in the recreational zone and that a compensation mechanism be determined for the buildings if the area had to be redeveloped . In DATE the authorities replied that the redevelopment of the area had been determined in DATE and that they could not agree with the applicant company \u2019s proposals . The authorities indicated that any decision regarding the applicant company \u2019s buildings had to be taken by the Government .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company complained about the refusal of its proposal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to ORG . It claimed that it had legitimate expectations that it would be able to use its possessions in an appropriate manner , namely that it would be allowed to reconstruct the buildings without increasing their height . In DATE the ORG replied that when approving ORG ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , a decision on a compensation mechanism and time - limits would also have to be taken .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company examined a draft of ORG and found that its buildings were indicated as objects to be redeveloped ( rekultivuojami objektai ) but that that decision had not been explained . The applicant company asked the authorities to amend the draft so that it included the issue of compensation for the buildings or included the buildings in the landscape management recreational zone .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG and ORG replied that they had set up a working group to determine a compensation mechanism for the property that had to be expropriated .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company asked the authorities to inform it about the conclusions of the working group . In DATE the authorities replied that the working group had to be set up before DATE .", "CARDINAL . The working group was set on DATE and had to provide its proposals before DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company asked the authorities for planning permission to carry out major renovation work on CARDINAL of the buildings , namely the canteen . The authorities replied that they could not issue planning permission and that the applicant company had to provide them with the lease agreement in respect of the land assigned to the buildings . Only after such agreement was provided , the authorities would examine the applicant company \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company lodged a complaint with the domestic courts against the authorities\u2019 refusal to issue planning permission for renovation of the canteen . On DATE ORG allowed the claim , holding that the applicant company had been paying the land tax , which was evidence that it had been using the plot of land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed an appeal lodged by the authorities . It held that the applicant company had not provided any information proving that it was the owner of the plot of land , so the authorities had not been obliged to issue planning permission for renovation of the canteen . The applicant company applied for the reopening of the proceedings . Its request was refused by ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG approved ORG . CARDINAL ( see paragraph DATE below ) and asked ORG to set up a working group to assess the legal grounds for expropriating property for public needs ( d\u0117l darbo grup\u0117s teisin\u0117ms prielaidoms paimti turt\u0105 visuomen\u0117s poreikiams sudarymo ) . The working group was set up on DATE and its proposals were to be submitted by DATE . ORG included the reserve land in DATE , indicating that its purpose was to compensate for the possible losses incurred by lawful owners of buildings that had been earmarked for demolition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a complaint with ORG , urging it to revoke the part of ORG where it had been decided that the buildings at CARDINAL GPE street ( the location of the applicant company \u2019s buildings ) would be demolished and to order the authorities to amend ORG . The applicant company argued that the issue of compensation and the time - limits for the demolition of property had not even been mentioned in ORG . It also argued that clear indications on compensation for the buildings and for the land tax were needed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to examine the claim . The reasons were provided in CARDINAL short paragraphs , which mainly reiterated the provisions of domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The applicant company had complained about the lawfulness of ORG . The court considered that issues as to whether acts adopted by the Government were in accordance with the LAW or laws fell within the jurisdiction of ORG . It stated that it was not within the area of competence of the administrative courts to examine the lawfulness of the activities of , inter alia , the Government ( as a collegial institution ) . As regards an amendment to ORG , the court stated that that was linked to the first part of the claim and thus would not have any legal consequences on the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company lodged a separate complaint and asked ORG to examine the case on the merits . It claimed that the first - instance court had misinterpreted the provisions of ORG , and thus limited the applicant company \u2019s right of access to a court . The applicant company thought that when the Government had approved ORG , it had been implementing the function of public administration , and that that document had had a direct influence on the applicant company \u2019s rights and obligations , and was thus an individual legal act that had to be examined before the administrative courts . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG of DATE . It held that the applicant company had questioned the lawfulness of both ORG and the development plan . ORG held that when the Government had approved ORG , it had been carrying out the function of State power . Moreover , the court had already ruled on the issue of the attribution of ORG to the jurisdiction of the administrative courts and had decided that it had not been attributable to those courts ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court indicated that a legal act could consist of textual and graphic information ( tables , drawings , schemes , plans , symbols , emblems ) . ORG had already held that all parts of a legal act were interrelated and were of equal legal effect ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court further held that the present case was in substance identical to cases already examined by it , and that there were no grounds to reach a different conclusion on the nature of ORG . The court explained that the applicant company could only raise the issue of the lawfulness of ORG in the context of an individual case regarding violation of its specific rights ( by complaining against an individual legal act , by which ORG and the decisions of ORG would be implemented ) . It could then ask the court examining that case to refer the issue to ORG . The applicant company \u2019s request to organise the procedure to amend LAW so that it included the land in question in the landscape management recreational zone was dismissed because the applicant company had failed to address the authorities or the courts after the approval of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company then applied for the reopening of the proceedings . On DATE ORG rejected its application on the grounds that the applicant company \u2019s claims had been dismissed for being outside the administrative court \u2019s jurisdiction and the proceedings could only be reopened if an administrative case had been examined on the merits .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company asked the authorities which documents were necessary for the proposed renovation work . In DATE the authorities replied that it was not clear from the applicant company \u2019s request which building ( \u201c specific , not complex or nonspecific \u201d ( ypatingas , nesud\u0117tingas ar neypatingas ) , as defined in the domestic law ) it was aiming to renovate . The applicant company had indicated major repair work . The authorities stated that a detailed plan was not necessary , the location of the building to be renovated was not important and a document proving ownership of the land ( see paragraph DATE above ) was not necessary either .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE inspected the applicant company \u2019s buildings and held that they were in a state of disrepair . It requested that the applicant company appoint a person responsible for the maintenance of the buildings before DATE , remove the damaged parts of the buildings before DATE and renovate the buildings before CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company asked the authority in charge of ORG to issue planning permission to carry out major repair work in order to renovate the buildings . DATE the applicant company received a response that permission could not be issued because it would be contrary to ORG DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company instituted court proceedings before ORG against the decision of the authority in charge of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It urged the court to order the authority to issue the planning permission required for it to carry out major repair work and to award it EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL in respect of pecuniary damage for the land tax and property tax it had paid DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of proceedings the applicant company submitted a draft friendly settlement agreement to be concluded by the ORG , proposing that the ORG compensate it for the removal of the buildings by providing the applicant company with lease rights to ORG - owned land measuring CARDINAL hectares in GPE with construction rights . The ORG representative refused to agree to the proposal because it was in breach of domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the refusal of the authority in charge of GPE to issue the planning permission required to carry out major repair work was in accordance with the relevant domestic law . The applicant company also asked the court to refer the question of whether ORG was in accordance with LAW to ORG . The court acknowledged that the authority \u2019s decision had lacked a seal of approval but held that that shortcoming could not be regarded as grounds to overrule the decision . The court also held that the authority had not acted unlawfully , so there were no grounds for awarding the applicant company pecuniary damages . Moreover , domestic law did not require that ORG contain a compensation mechanism for the buildings to be \u201c removed \u201d . However , ORG in question indicated that an area in DATE had been designated to compensate for the losses incurred by the lawful owners of the buildings to be removed . Thus ORG provided for the opportunity to compensate for possible losses . As regards the referral to ORG , the court held that the applicant company had mistakenly stated that the decision to remove the buildings had only been indicated in ORG . The court stated that it was a commonly known fact that the applicant company \u2019s buildings had been earmarked for removal at the time the purchase agreement had been concluded , and the applicant company , as a diligent legal entity , should have assessed the legal status of the buildings and the restrictions on their use . The legitimate expectations of the applicant company had not been breached as it had not proved the need to refer the issue to ORG . The court also pointed out that the buildings had not been taken from the applicant company for the needs of society ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , when using them the applicant company had to follow the legal regulations , which established that construction in the area in question was not allowed and that it was attempting to protect its rights in the wrong way . The decision that had had legal consequences for the applicant company had been the decision to privatise the buildings and to sell them to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company appealed and asked ORG to refer the matter to ORG ; to overrule the decision of the authority in charge of LAW of DATE ; to order the authority to issue the applicant company with the planning permission required to carry out major repair work and to award it EUR CARDINAL in respect of pecuniary damage . The proceedings are still ongoing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government adopted Resolution No . CARDINAL approving the start of the amendment of ORG . CARDINAL of the purposes set out in the resolution was to combine the interests of the ORG and municipalities with those of the relevant natural and legal persons .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company submitted its proposals , namely that the area in which its buildings were located be included in the landscape management zone and that the buildings there should not exceed CARDINAL storey with an attic . If the proposal to redevelop the land were maintained , the applicant company wanted a clear decision on time - limits for redevelopment and a compensation mechanism .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG indicated that the land on which the applicant company \u2019s buildings were sited was not affected by the amendment of ORG . It also indicated that the reply could be appealed against to ORG ( \u201c the commission \u201d ) or to ORG in DATE from its reception .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company lodged a complaint with the commission about the reply of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant company stated that it had paid ORG CARDINAL in land tax and ORG CARDINAL in property tax between CARDINAL and DATE . It also stated that although ORG had entered into force in DATE , it had not been proven that removing the buildings was necessary in the interests of society . There had also been no indications about the exact time - limits and procedure for the removal of the buildings . The applicant company thus asked the commission to overrule the decision of ORG of DATE and to order it to amend ORG in accordance with the applicant company \u2019s proposals .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the commission closed the case , stating that the issue was not within its competence . The applicant company appealed against that decision , claiming that it had been formal and lacked reasoning , and that the commission had ignored the fact that ORG reply of DATE had indicated that it was amenable to appeal before the administrative courts or the commission ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s appeal . It held that the applicant company had been represented by professional lawyers and the mere fact that ORG had erroneously indicated that its decisions were amenable to appeal did not discharge the applicant company of the obligation to follow the appeal procedure as laid down in domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court held that the applicant company had to address ORG with its complaint .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant company appealed before ORG . The proceedings are still ongoing ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
