ORG The applicant company , ORG , is a joint stock company ( Aktiengesellschaft ) incorporated and having its registered office in GPE . Its principal business is metal smelting , but at the relevant time it also dealt in gold and silver coins .", "CARDINAL . ORG In DATE , ORG began doing business with a NORP citizen , X. In the course of this business , DATE and DATE , ORG bought from X a large quantity of DATE NORP coinage which had a high content of silver . However , it appears that unbeknown to the company the coins had been illegally exported from GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , CARDINAL DATE , after TIME , X visited ORG \u2019s factory with Y , whom he introduced as a wealthy businessman . Together they asked to make an immediate purchase of CARDINAL PERSON , gold coins minted in GPE , where they are also legal tender , having a value of CARDINAL . The sale was agreed and the coins were loaded into a car bearing GPE number plates . Payment was accepted in the form of an unguaranteed cheque drawn on an LANGUAGE bank . The cheque bore no sign of having been cleared for exchange control purposes . On DATE , DATE , the cheque was handed to ORG \u2019s bank for collection . However , on DATE , the bank notified ORG that the cheque had been dishonoured . The contract of sale contained a provision according to which ownership of the coins remained with ORG until full payment for them had been received by it .", "CARDINAL . ORG Meanwhile , on DATE , the buyers attempted to smuggle the gold coins by car into GPE . The coins were , however , discovered hidden in a spare tyre and were seized by the customs authorities in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the importation of gold coins had been prohibited by the Secretary of ORG , by an amendment to the Open General Import License of DATE . The prohibition was withdrawn on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , criminal proceedings were instituted in GPE against X and Y ; they were charged , inter alia , with fraudulent evasion of the prohibition on importation of gold coins , contrary to section CARDINAL ( b ) of ORG \" LAW \" ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE and again on DATE , ORG requested the ORG and Excise to return the coins on the basis that the company was their rightful owner and had been the innocent victim of fraud .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , officers of the ORG and Excise visited ORG \u2019s factory in GPE to inquire into the circumstances of the sale . ORG continued to co - operate with the ORG and Excise throughout the criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG made a declaration of avoidance of the contract of sale by virtue of which the sale of the coins became void ab initio under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG \u2019s lawyers wrote to ORG , who had taken over responsibility for the case , requesting that the Commissioners exercise their discretion under section FAC of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and return the coins to the company , as they did not constitute goods liable to forfeiture under LAW interpreted in the light of the LAW establishing ORG ( LAW ) , general principles of public international law and LAW , especially LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In their written reply of CARDINAL DATE , the Commissioners inquired whether it was contended by ORG that it had made a valid claim that the coins were not liable to forfeiture . The Commissioners stated that , if so , they would be required to institute condemnation proceedings before ORG under paragraph CARDINAL of the Seventh Schedule to the CARDINAL Act in order to have the coins forfeited . With regard to the company \u2019s contention that the coins were not liable to forfeiture ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the GPE observed , inter alia , that \" there [ was ] no discretion [ vested in the courts ] to refuse condemnation [ of the coins as forfeited ] on the ground of hardship to an innocent owner \" . The coins were not restored .", "CARDINAL . ORG At their trial in DATE , at which ORG \u2019s director Dr. PERSON testified for the prosecution , X and NORP argued that the prohibition on importation of gold coins was in breach of LAW , which guarantees the free movement of goods , and that accordingly the criminal charges brought against them were void .", "CARDINAL . ORG The judge at first instance did not accept this argument ; in his judgment of DATE , he held that the prohibition fell within the \" public policy \" provision of LAW and that the coins were capital rather than goods within the terms of LAW .", "CARDINAL . X and Y appealed to ORG which , on DATE , referred the question to ORG of ORG in accordance with LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG confirmed in its judgment of DATE that the PERSON were capital rather than goods ( case CARDINAL/CARDINAL , [ DATE ] ORG Reports DATE ) . Accordingly , X and ORG appeal failed and they were convicted and fined .", "CARDINAL . ORG When , at the close of the criminal proceedings at first instance , ORG did not return the coins , ORG , on DATE , issued a writ against them in ORG . The statement of claim , in so far as relevant , read :", "\" CARDINAL . ... the provisions of section CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG , and the Seventh Schedule to the said LAW , are to be construed in the light of and subject to the general principle of public international law which prohibits the unjustified confiscation of property belonging to friendly aliens .", "CARDINAL .

ORG On DATE , ORG also issued an originating summons requesting ORG to determine the compatibility with LAW of the prohibition on the importation of GPE into GPE and of their confiscation without compensation . The case was heard on DATE and ORG sought to have these questions referred to ORG of ORG for decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON dismissed the originating summons on DATE and indicated that he would also have dismissed the action on the writ had it been brought before him for determination ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant company nonetheless pursued the latter action . On DATE , Mr. PERSON dismissed the action on the writ and ordered , in accordance with the Commissioners\u2019 counterclaim , that the coins be forfeited as constituting goods liable to forfeiture under section CARDINAL(f ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed to ORG arguing that , as ORG had in the meantime found that the coins were not goods ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , section CARDINAL ( f ) could not be applied , and reiterated its submissions as to LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) and general principles of international law .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Court of Appeal gave its ruling on DATE ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . The main judgment was delivered by Lord PERSON , with whom the other CARDINAL judges , Lord FAC and Sir PERSON , concurred .", "With regard to ORG \u2019s claim that it was entitled to the restoration of the PERSON in view of its alleged innocence , Lord PERSON first made the following observations :", "\" Before going further , I may say that in any event the customs authorities have a discretion in the matter . It happens sometimes that goods are forfeited and then afterwards the true owner comes up and says that he was defrauded of them . If the customs authorities are satisfied of his claim , they may waive the forfeiture and hand them to him . There is a very wide discretion given to the commissioners under s FAC of the CARDINAL Act under which they can forfeit the goods or release them , or pay compensation and so forth . That may arise at a later time . But the NORP company says that in this case the customs authorities had no right to forfeit the goods at all . It would suit the NORP company much better to have the actual PERSON returned to them , when you consider the value of gold itself , instead of compensation at DATE figures . \"", "Lord PERSON thereafter went on to deal with the different objections advanced by ORG against the Commissioners\u2019 contention that the PERSON were liable to forfeiture . Lord PERSON held that the definition of goods in LAW was irrelevant for the purposes of section CARDINAL ( f ) and that there was nothing in LAW No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL ) or general international law prohibiting forfeiture in the instant case . He concluded :", "\" It seems to me that the customs authorities are right . These PERSON are forfeitable to the Crown ... It is entirely a matter for the discretion of the ORG and Excise to consider whether the claim of the NORP company is so good that they should see fit in this case to release them to the NORP company or retain them and pay them some compensation . That is within the discretion of the ORG and Excise . \"", "Lord Justice Bridge added :", "\" If I were satisfied , which I am not , that there is such a principle in international law as that for which the [ NORP company \u2019s counsel ] contends , I should still be wholly unconvinced that it would be open to us to write into LAW DATE the extensive amendments which it would be necessary to introduce in order to give effect to that principle and to make an exception from liability to forfeiture , where there had been a plain case under the language of the statute giving rise to forfeiture , in favour of a foreign owner of goods who could show he had not been a party to the act out of which the liability to forfeiture arose . \"", "Sir PERSON remarked :", "\" If [ a foreign owner ] is innocent of any complicity in the smuggling , it is appropriate that there should be an opportunity for him to apply for the exercise of discretion in his favour , but I can not see that it would be possible so to construe the LAW as to exclude from the forfeiture provision any goods belonging to such a [ foreigner ] . \"", "The appeal was dismissed .", "CARDINAL . ORG did not grant leave to appeal to ORG . On DATE , ORG petitioned ORG for leave to appeal , but such leave was refused .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG \u2019s solicitors again wrote to ORG and Excise requesting the return of the goods . The solicitor for the Commissioners replied in the negative on DATE , without giving any reasons .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW of LAW , goods being liable for forfeiture under , inter alia , section CARDINAL of the Act may be seized or detained by the customs authorities .", "Section CARDINAL reads in relevant parts :", "\" Where :", "...", "( b ) any goods are imported , landed or unloaded contrary to any prohibition or restriction for the time being in force with respect thereto under or by virtue of any enactment ; or", "...", "( f ) any imported goods are concealed or packed in any manner appearing to be intended to deceive an officer ,", "those goods shall be liable to forfeiture ... \"", "CARDINAL .

This paragraph further specifies that \" if the court finds that the [ items were ] at the time liable to forfeiture the court shall condemn [ them ] as forfeited . \" According to established case - law , the courts will only examine whether the seized goods fall into any of the categories of goods mentioned in the law as liable to forfeiture ; they will not examine the question of the owner \u2019s innocence .

ORG Prior to CARDINAL DATE , judicial review of certain decisions by administrative authorities could be obtained by application for a prerogative order ( mandamus , certiorari or prohibition ) in accordance with section CARDINAL of ORG and LAW . In addition , litigants were entitled to bring ordinary actions for declarations , injunctions or damages in appropriate cases .", "In the words of the Government , \" the multiplicity of remedies , each with their own procedural idiosyncracies , was considered to be a real disadvantage to litigants , and an inhibition on the ability of the courts to develop a coherent corpus of law in this area \" . In particular , an application for a prerogative order might not have been effective if the challenged decision did not contain the reasons on which it was based , since the law did not permit the obtaining of evidence on facts or other matters not appearing on the record of the decision ( see Report on Remedies in Administrative Law , Law Commission no . DATE , ORG . ORG ( DATE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Rules of ORG were amended in DATE by ORG so as to provide for CARDINAL specific procedure , now known formally as judicial review , for all litigants seeking relief in matters relating to public law . The amendments came into force on DATE and were thus applicable when the Commissioners took their decision on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to ORG , the new LAW introduced inter alia , the following changes :", "\" - It created a new procedure called \u2018 application for judicial\u2019 review and in this single application , the applicant may apply for any of the prerogative orders , either jointly or in the alternative , without having to select any particular one appropriate to his case .", "- The machinery of interlocutory applications such as discovery of documents and interrogatories and orders for the respondent of an affidavit to attend for cross - examination has been introduced into applications for judicial review and such applications may be heard by a Judge or by a Master of the Queen \u2019s Bench Division .", "- If the claim for relief is an order of certiorari , the ORG is empowered , in addition to quashing the decision , to remit the matter to the authority concerned with a direction to reconsider it and reach a decision in accordance with the findings of the ORG so that the ORG may operate not only as a \u2018 Court of Cassation\u2019 but also as a ORG of review . \" ( Rules of ORG , ORG , DATE , PERSON . CARDINAL , LAW , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL para . CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The procedure whereby an application for judicial review had to be made in CARDINAL stages was left unchanged by the reform . It is first necessary to obtain leave of the ORG , and , according to ORG , \" only if and to the extent that such leave is granted will the ORG proceed to hear the substantive application for judicial review \" . \" Leave should be granted , if on the material then available the ORG thinks , without going into the matter in depth , that there is an arguable case for granting the relief claimed by the applicant \" ( ORG , loc . cit . , p. CARDINAL , para . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The grounds on which judicial review under the new LAW can be granted are the same as those held valid for the earlier applications for prerogative orders . They are stated by ORG to fall under the following main headings :", "\" CARDINAL . Want or excess of jurisdiction ...", "CARDINAL . Where there is an error of law on the face of the record ...", "CARDINAL . Failure to comply with the rules of natural justice ... Broadly the rules of natural justice embody a duty to act fairly ... The rules of natural justice will normally apply where the decision concerned affects a person \u2019s rights , for example where his property is taken by compulsory purchase ... The rules of natural justice can also apply where the applicant for judicial review does not have a right , for example where he is applying for some requisite statutory licence : in such cases , although he has no right to a licence unless and until it is granted , there is a duty to comply with the rules of natural justice and to act fairly because a legal power which affects his interests is being exercised . ...", "CARDINAL . The ORG principle - A decision of a public authority will be liable to be quashed or otherwise dealt with by an appropriate order in judicial review proceedings where the ORG concludes that the decision is such that no authority properly directing itself on the relevant law and acting reasonably could have reached it .... \"", "CARDINAL . ORG The requirement that administrative authorities direct themselves properly on the relevant law and act reasonably has been expounded upon in several cases before LANGUAGE courts ( see also \" Administrative Law \" , H.W.R. PERSON , CARDINALth edition ( DATE ) , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . Thus in ORG [ DATE ] ORG , p. CARDINAL , Lord PERSON stated :", "\" The discretion of a statutory body is never unfettered . It is a discretion which is to be exercised according to law . That means at least this : the statutory body must be guided by relevant considerations and not by irrelevant .

No matter that the statutory body may have acted in good faith ; nevertheless the decision will be set aside . \"", "Due regard must be had , inter alia , to the scope and object of the enactment conferring the power .
