The applicant was of the opinion that her daughter would also have survived had she been promptly transferred to a resuscitation and intensive therapy unit at a children \u2019s hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother , PERSON , sent the following telegram to the President of GPE :", "\u201c ... newborns are dying because of delays in emergency medical treatment . Resuscitation units lack capacity . [ Hospitals ] have waiting lists \u2013 a brutal practice . Thus in ... DATE at ... TIME in FAC no . ... [ my ] grandchildren , twins , ... were born .

The death [ of my granddaughter ] has shocked our family . We could not imagine that it was possible not to provide emergency medical treatment to the newborn child ...

I request that this problem be examined at the meetings of the Government and ORG ... \u201d", "\u201c I am wiring you for the third time about the deaths of premature newborns in GPE ... [ I ] consider the existence of a waiting list for resuscitation treatment a crime ... Waiting for [ your ] response about the action taken ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Administration of the President of GPE forwarded the telegrams to ORG of GPE ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) for examination . ORG asked ORG at GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) to examine the allegations and take the necessary action .", "CARDINAL . The ORG ordered an examination , which was carried out by a panel consisting of the chief neonatologist of the ORG and the head of the paediatrics department at the advanced medical studies faculty of GPE . The examination was carried out on the basis of the applicant \u2019s and the twins\u2019 medical records , which were obtained from the maternity hospital and the children \u2019s hospital . The results of the examination were set out in a report ( \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u044f ) , which mainly concerned the development and treatment of the twin who had died . In particular , the report stated that the infant had been born prematurely in DATE of gestation of an eighth pregnancy and by a first delivery . Her blood test had indicated the possibility of a prenatal viral infection , and she had been clinically diagnosed as premature ( at thirtyone DATE ) , with respiratory distress syndrome and atelectasis . A postmortem examination had revealed moderate interstitial emphysema of the lungs , which had explained the immediate cause of death . It was concluded that she had been born with severe respiratory distress syndrome complicated by an air leak syndrome , and that she had been provided with treatment which had been entirely appropriate , given the seriousness of the condition and the nature of the disease . Such cases carried a risk of death of not PERCENT , in addition to the risk of serious disabilities , and an early transfer to a children \u2019s hospital did not guarantee survival or a favourable outcome . The report also noted that the second twin had suffered from respiratory distress syndrome as well , but to a much lesser extent . The experts did not make any significant observations about the treatment he had received at the maternity hospital or the children \u2019s hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the acting head of the ORG sent the report to the ORG with an accompanying letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to her telegrams , the ORG informed NORP of the results of the experts\u2019 examination of the twins\u2019 medical records by briefly restating the conclusions in the report . ORG noted that the results of the examination of her allegations had been communicated to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG forwarded to the ORG a copy of its reply to NORP and informed the ORG that , according to the conclusion of a commission formed by the maternity hospital where the twins had been born , the reasons for the applicant \u2019s premature delivery had been her compromised obstetricgynaecological history DATE in particular , CARDINAL artificial abortions \u2013 and her urogenital mycoplasmosis infection . The letter of CARDINAL DATE was the subject of proceedings brought by the applicant against ORG , about which no further information is available .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant received a letter from the ORG with similar contents to the letter of DATE that it had sent to NORP , stating , in particular , that her children \u2019s medical records had been examined by the panel of experts . It appears that a request by the applicant for a copy of the report was refused , and that that refusal was the subject of separate proceedings brought by the applicant against the ORG . In the course of those proceedings , on DATE , the applicant received a copy of the report and the ORG \u2019s letter to ORG DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she brought new proceedings against the ORG , seeking a declaration that its actions had been unlawful in that it had collected and examined her medical records and those of her children , and had communicated the report containing her personal information to the Ministry without obtaining her consent . She requested that the report and the letter of CARDINAL DATE be declared invalid . She stated that she had not asked ORG to examine the quality of the medical treatment she and her children had received or to establish the cause of her daughter \u2019s death . She claimed that ORG had interfered with her private life by disclosing \u2013 without her consent \u2013 confidential information to a considerable number of individuals , including staff at ORG who dealt with correspondence and other employees . She relied on LAW , which prohibited the disclosure of confidential medical information without a patient \u2019s consent . She argued that the provisions of LAW contained an exhaustive list of exceptions to that general rule , and that the ORG \u2019s impugned acts had not fallen under any of them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG of GPE dismissed her application . The chief neonatologist , who was examined as a witness , stated that : he had acted within his powers ; he had not been able to verify ORG \u2019s allegations without obtaining the medical records in question ; he had involved medical specialists in the examination of those records ; and no disclosure of the information contained in those medical records had taken place . A representative of ORG denied the applicant \u2019s allegations .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that ORG had asked the ORG to examine the allegations set out in NORP \u2019s telegrams . ORG had had the power to request material from the ORG , which in turn had had a corresponding duty to submit detailed information . The applicant \u2019s medical records had been examined by doctors bound by confidentiality . It was the report prepared as a result of that examination , and not the applicant \u2019s medical records per se , which had been transferred to the Ministry .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the above considerations , ORG held that the applicant \u2019s rights , as guaranteed by LAW , had not been violated .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the applicant had lodged her application on DATE , although she had learned that her children \u2019s medical records had been obtained without her consent on DATE from the ORG \u2019s letter of DATE . ORG saw no reasonable excuse for her failure to lodge her application within the statutory timelimit . Lastly , it rejected her request for a separate ruling to denounce the ORG \u2019s allegedly common practice of obtaining medical records without ORG consent .", "CARDINAL . An application by the applicant for clarification of the judgment \u2013 in particular , for details as to whether her application had been dismissed on the merits or because it had been time - barred DATE was dismissed on DATE by ORG , which considered that the judgment had been clearly formulated and did not allow for different interpretations . The applicant did not appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment , relying on LAW and , in particular , the exhaustive list of exceptions to the general rule of non - disclosure of confidential medical information without a patient \u2019s consent provided therein . She stated that her own medical records and those of her children had been collected and examined without her consent by ORG officials acting ultra vires , and not by her own doctors , who were bound by confidentiality . The report contained confidential medical information and its communication to the Ministry without her consent had been unlawful . The fact that her own personal medical records had been examined in addition to those of her children had become known to her at DATE than DATE . The threemonth timelimit for lodging her application had started running on DATE , when she had received a copy of the report . She had therefore complied with that time - limit .", "CARDINAL .
