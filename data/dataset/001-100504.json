He considered , first , that the words \u201c subject to LAW \u201d in the DATE Regulations meant \u201c unless this is a case where LAW applies \u201d . He found that section CARDINAL clearly did apply in the applicant 's case and continued :", "\u201c ... it is lamentable that the prosecution have been shown to be wanting as far as the custody time limits were concerned and indeed had it also been shown that they were deliberately defalcating [ sic ] on their duty and relying on LAW as a stop gap , believing that they could still persuade the Judge to keep [ the applicant ] in custody come what may , that might in itself and in certain circumstances amount to exceptional circumstances for reconsidering his bail position .", "But I am not satisfied from the chronology and the history of this trial that that is at all the case .

Judge PERSON recalled that he had recently been persuaded to grant a \u201c very long adjournment \u201d to DATE , at the request of the applicant . He indicated that he was of the view that defendants should not be detained for excessively long periods of time before their trials took place , but noted :", "\u201c On the other hand , everything that was done by me on his behalf was for the defendant 's assistance because it was explained that he yet needed to get his independent DNA ; that there were papers missing that have not been properly served upon his defence team and thirdly , since counsel have built up a rapport with the defendant and counsel who have been briefed fairly late in this matter ... had herself commitments that precluded her from safely being able to undertake this work until DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He added :", "\u201c If your client , by my ruling on the bail matter and LAW , feels aggrieved then I would take up [ counsel for the prosecution 's ] suggestion and bring the case forward come what may ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "\u201c ... CARDINAL things strike me of interest . Bearing in mind the sad chronology I also note that the defendant at the outset had suggested that this was a fabricated tissue of lies by the complainant for motives that he would explain to the jury in due course .", "A lot of the disclosure arose because of that and he was offered the opportunity to have his own independent DNA as far back as DATE , an offer that he never took up ... he then spoke in open court ... of automatism , which again left CARDINAL ... curious as to know whether there was a need for DNA and whether he was denying intercourse took place , which of course to an alleged victim of rape is an important issue , which of course she is entitled to be aware of in order that she does not have to go through the ordeal of being accused of being sexually promiscuous or a liar and such things , and we still do not know the answer to that .", "So what is going on ? You have come up with another DNA application . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant responded that she did not have full instructions and could therefore not speak on behalf of the applicant . The judge again reiterated that the trial date for the applicant might need to be reconsidered , a matter on which the applicant 's counsel undertook to seek instructions . The judge expressly pointed out that the effect of his ruling on LAW was that , if the applicant persisted with his request for a DATE trial , he would have to remain in custody for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's counsel appeared before the judge DATE to confirm that the applicant was content that his trial be held on DATE , notwithstanding the section CARDINAL ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant issued a claim for judicial review of the court 's decision of DATE to refuse him bail , arguing that his continued detention following the expiry of the custody time limits was in breach of LAW . The matter was considered on the papers on DATE . It was referred for an oral hearing and permission was granted on DATE . On DATE , solicitors acting for the applicant indicated that he would also apply for a writ of habeas corpus contending that since the expiration of the custody time limit on DATE his custody had been illegal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant 's applications for habeas corpus and judicial review of the decision refusing bail were rejected by ORG . In dismissing the argument of the defence that the amendments to section CARDINAL to allow the grant of bail in \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d were insufficient to restore the judicial control required under the Convention , Kennedy LJ held ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c ... there is nothing offensive or contrary to Convention law about ORG reminding the courts of the risks normally attendant upon the grant of bail to those to whom LAW applies . A reminder can properly be given by creating a statutory presumption against the grant of bail , but if judicial control is to be effective courts must be left free to examine all the relevant circumstances and , in an appropriate case , to override the presumption . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON considered the Convention authorities and accepted ( at paragraph DATE ) that section CARDINAL would not be compatible with the LAW if \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d were too narrowly construed or if the court set too high a threshold at which it would be prepared to conclude that \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d existed . In considering the application of LAW in practice , PERSON explained that :", "\u201c [ LAW ] establishes a norm . The norm is that those to whom it applies if granted bail are so likely to fail to surrender to custody , or offend , or interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice that bail should not be granted . If in fact , taking into account all the circumstances relating to a particular alleged offence and offender he does not create an unacceptable risk of that kind he is an exception to the norm , and in accordance with his individual right to liberty he should be granted bail . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the expiration of the custody time limit , PERSON considered that the custody time limits set out in national law and the \u201c reasonable time \u201d requirement under LAW were not one and the same . Accordingly , in assessing whether the prosecution had acted with \u201c special diligence \u201d as required by the LAW , the finding of the lower court that it was not satisfied that the prosecution had acted with all due diligence as required by section GPE ) of the CARDINAL Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was not decisive . Although PERSON accepted that in a case where the prosecution had not demonstrated all due diligence , a court may well conclude that it had not displayed the necessary \u201c special diligence \u201d required under LAW , he considered that this was not the case here .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in respect of the applicant 's argument under LAW that section CARDINAL operated in a discriminatory manner , PERSON considered that the applicant was not in a situation analogous to a person charged with a serious offence because he also had a previous conviction for a serious offence which was relevant to the risk attendant on a grant of bail . He further found that the distinction made was justified , was based on relevant factors , pursued a legitimate objective and was proportionate .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , he stressed the importance of setting out reasons for refusing bail in order to show that careful and appropriate consideration had been given to the question whether exceptional circumstances exist .", "CARDINAL . Hooper J agreed with ORG in all respects , save that unlike PERSON he considered that section CARDINAL did impose the burden on the defendant to show \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d which , in light of Convention case - law , was inconsistent with LAW . Accordingly , he considered that LAW should be read down in accordance with the obligation in CARDINAL of LAW DATE to impose merely an evidential burden on the applicant to point to or produce material which supports the existence of \u201c exceptional circumstances \u201d , thereby ensuring compliance with the demands of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that once the custody time limit had expired there was , by virtue of the expiry of the time limit itself , a breach of LAW by his continued detention under LAW ; and , in the alternative , that the effect of LAW was to place a burden on the applicant to establish exceptional circumstances required for the grant of bail , which was a breach of the applicant 's Convention rights .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant 's trial commenced on DATE . However , on DATE , the prosecution was permanently stayed as an abuse of process , for reasons which are unclear , and the applicant was released from custody .", "CARDINAL . ORG handed down its judgment in the judicial review and habeas corpus proceedings on DATE . Delivering the leading judgment , Lord PERSON of ORG - under - Heywood considered that an approach under LAW which required the applicant to provide good and sufficient reason for bail would be \u201c irreconcilable with the GPE case law \u201d ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) . However , as regards the operation of section CARDINAL in practice , he continued ( at paragraphs CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Importantly , however , both members of the [ divisional ] court decided that section GPE ) ( subject only to its effect in cases where the custody time limit has expired , the important second issue yet to be addressed ) has no substantive effect upon the way in which bail applications by LAW defendants would in any event fall to be determined under LAW . It serves merely to ' remind ' the courts of the risks normally posed by those to whom LAW applies and ' will merely assist the court to adopt a proper approach ' in relation to bail in their cases . In my judgment they were right in that conclusion and it seems to me unsurprising that the NORP , placed in a similar position by the PERSON judgment , decided against introducing an ' exceptional circumstances ' test , believing that it would ' add nothing to a clear common law position in GPE ' ...", "Whether or not , strictly speaking , section CARDINAL needs to be read down to achieve the agreed result is a question of little moment . I myself , however , have a mild preference for ORG approach . Like him I read the section as placing a burden on the section CARDINAL defendant . He has to rebut a presumption and if he fails to do so is to be denied bail . True it is , as [ counsel for the defendant ] himself accepted , that in the vast majority of cases the court will reach a clear view CARDINAL way or the other whether the conditions for withholding bail specified by Schedule CARDINAL to LAW are satisfied . But just occasionally the court will be left unsure as to whether the defendant should be released on bail \u2014 the only situation in which the burden of proof assumes any relevance \u2014 and in my judgment bail would then have to be granted . That must be the default position . LAW should in my judgment be read down to make that plain . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the lawfulness of the applicant 's continued detention after the expiry of the custody time limit , Lord PERSON reviewed the facts of the case , noting that the applicant had a previous conviction for rape ; indeed , he had CARDINAL previous convictions for a wide variety of offences . He also observed that the applicant had dispensed with his lawyers and had them reinstated on CARDINAL occasions , CARDINAL of which had caused delay . A further DATE delay was caused by the applicant 's decision to reject the offer of a DATE trial date in favour of a date in DATE , to suit his counsel 's convenience . Lord PERSON noted that it was unclear , in the absence of a transcript of the court 's decision of DATE or any further information on the subject , why the lower court was not satisfied that the prosecution had acted with all due diligence and expedition in relation to disclosure . However , he concluded that even where there was a lack of due diligence under domestic law , this was not in itself sufficient to establish the lack of \u201c special diligence \u201d required for a breach of LAW . Lord PERSON concluded ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c By the very nature of things , ORG will be looking at the case in a different way from the domestic court , in particular from a longer and wider perspective . GPE will have the whole picture before it and will take an overall view as to whether the reasonable time guarantee has been exceeded . PERSON illustrates the point well : the ultimate question addressed by the court was whether ' the total length of the detention pending trial appear[ed ] excessive ' . So too in PERSON : the court took account of the trial court 's post - delay offer to increase the rate of the hearings ( akin perhaps to the offer of a DATE trial date in the present case , similarly declined ) . The domestic court , by contrast , is inevitably having to decide a much narrower question and within a shorter time - frame . And it is doing so within the strict confines of section GPE ) which , despite the marked similarity between its language and that used in GPE , in fact imposes a more rigid formula for the extension of custody time limits than GPE does with regard to the reasonable time guarantee under article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . For my part I would not expect there to be many cases where , as here , bail is refused notwithstanding the court 's refusal to extend the custody time limit . But I conclude that there is no necessary inconsistency between the CARDINAL and that LAW is not necessarily breached . Nor , in my judgment , is there any other reason for thinking that this appellant was wrongly refused bail : on the contrary , the case for his continued detention in custody appears to have been a strong one . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In R ( ORG and Others ) v ORG [ DATE ] EWHC Admin CARDINAL , ORG considered the scope for extending custody time limits . Lord PERSON noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The court made plain in ex parte PERSON , as indeed is plain on the face of the statute , that when seeking an extension or a further extension of a custody time limit the ORG must show that there is good and sufficient [ cause ] for making the extension and that it has acted with all due expedition . What , however , was not made plain in ex parte PERSON ( because the question did not arise ) is that these CARDINAL provisions are in my judgment linked . It is not in doubt that the ORG must show proper grounds for keeping a defendant in prison awaiting trial for a period longer than the statutory maximum . But the ORG must also show that such an extension is not sought because it has shown insufficient vigour in preparing the case for trial . Put crudely , the prosecution can not prepare for trial in a dilatory and negligent manner and then come to the court to seek an extension of the custody time limit because the prosecution is not ready for trial . Nor , if the effect of its dilatoriness is to put the defence in a position where the defence is not ready for the trial can the ORG seek an extension and show that it has acted with all due expedition . It is in the ordinary way the business of the prosecution to be ready . If therefore the ORG is seeking an extension of the time limit it must show that the need for the extension does not arise from lack of due expedition or due diligence on its part . It seems clear to me , however , that the requirement of due expedition or due diligence or both is not a disciplinary provision . It is not there to punish prosecutors for administrative lapses ; it is there to protect defendants by ensuring that they are kept in prison awaiting trial no longer than is justifiable . That is why due expedition is called for . The court is not in my view obliged to refuse the extension of a custody time limit because the prosecution is shown to have been guilty of avoidable delay where that delay has had no effect whatever on the ability of the prosecution and the defence to be ready for trial on a predetermined trial date . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
