ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , Mr PERSON , and the second applicant , Ms PERSON , are a married couple and are both NORP nationals . They were both born in DATE and live in GPE ( Genoa ) . Before the ORG they stated that they were also acting on behalf of ORG ( the third applicant ) , a NORP national who was born on DATE and currently lives in GPE . The first CARDINAL applicants signed powers of attorney authorising PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE , to represent them before the ORG . No power of attorney was signed either by the third applicant or by her statutory guardian .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the first CARDINAL applicants submitted a request to the non - governmental association ORG to put up a child from the area affected by the GPE nuclear disaster . On DATE the couple took in the third applicant for the first time . PERSON 's father was unknown , while her mother , who had been deprived of parental responsibility , was dead . PERSON , who had been declared eligible for adoption , was living in an orphanage ( PERSON ) in PERSON ( GPE ) .", "ORG stayed with the first CARDINAL applicants on a regular basis , for DATE and DATE in DATE . The first CARDINAL applicants visited her in GPE for periods of DATE in between her trips to GPE . The couple maintained that they had spent DATE with ORG during DATE , developing a relationship similar to that between parents and their children .", "On DATE ORG declared the first CARDINAL applicants fit for international adoption . However , they were unable to adopt ORG because in DATE GPE decided to suspend all international adoption procedures .", "On DATE GPE and GPE signed a bilateral protocol in which GPE undertook to conclude , by DATE , CARDINAL adoption procedures pending with ORG . The first CARDINAL applicants instructed ORG association to take the relevant steps concerning their application for adoption , while continuing to look after PERSON for DATE . By DATE only forty adoption procedures had been dealt with by ORG .", "According to the first CARDINAL applicants , whenever she arrived to stay with them , PERSON was bruised , had trouble sleeping and her behaviour was bordering on autistic . Those disorders would subside once the child had spent a certain amount of time in GPE , but would reappear as the date of her return to GPE drew nearer . This was confirmed by a report issued on DATE by a psychologist , PERSON , who found , among other things , that the symptoms in question appeared to \u201c demonstrate the child 's extreme suffering as a result of her precarious situation and highlight[ed ] the urgent need to provide her with stable living conditions among the family who have de facto adopted her \u201d .", "Furthermore , in DATE the first CARDINAL applicants had noticed cigarette burns on ORG 's abdomen . Having been advised not to report the matter to the NORP authorities , they simply informed the director of the PERSON orphanage . In DATE PERSON told the second applicant that the oldest boy in the orphanage had forced her and other girls to join in a game in which the girls had been undressed , tied up , kissed and bitten . According to a report drawn up on DATE by PERSON , although the acts of violence suffered by ORG \u201c were not explicitly connected by her to the sphere of sexuality , they at least caused a state of confusion regarding displays of affection \u201d .", "Before leaving for DATE , ORG allegedly told the second applicant on the telephone that she had found a way to remain in GPE : killing herself and becoming an angel . The personnel responsible for taking PERSON from the airport to the first CARDINAL applicants ' home confiscated razor blades in ORG 's possession . According to the first CARDINAL applicants , she was intending to use them to commit suicide . PERSON subsequently attempted to drown herself , but her plan was thwarted when other people intervened .", "During DATE , ORG told the second applicant that on several occasions she had been undressed , tied to a chair or bed , burned with cigarettes or lighters and forced to have oral or anal intercourse . The first CARDINAL applicants suggested that PERSON visit another NORP child named PERSON , who was born on DATE and was staying with a family in the GPE region . PERSON reacted hysterically to that suggestion . She then explained that in the PERSON orphanage she had been sexually abused by several people , including PERSON . It appears that PERSON confirmed that fact . In a report drawn up on DATE Dr B. found the CARDINAL children 's versions of events to be credible . He added that ORG 's suicidal fantasies were not the result of depression but an expression of the child 's \u201c magical thought \u201d in response to her feeling of helplessness .", "A file on the matter was opened by the GPE public prosecutor 's office . A gynaecological examination performed on ORG on DATE revealed slight abnormalities and a doctor noted the presence of \u201c multiple haematomas [ resulting ] from bruising \u201d to the child 's thorax and abdomen . It was suggested that ORG undergo therapy .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants applied to ORG to adopt ORG", "In an order of CARDINAL DATE , the text of which was deposited at the registry on DATE , ORG refused the application . It observed that international adoption was subject to an adoption order by the NORP authorities . The court added that the information of which it had been made aware might have justified urgent measures under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE ; however , such measures already formed the subject of separate proceedings . In any event , the NORP authorities had to be informed of the need to conclude adoption procedures as a matter of urgency where children had been materially and morally abandoned .", "In the meantime , in a memorandum of CARDINAL DATE ORG had expressed strong concern about the \u201c improper conduct \u201d of NORP families seeking to keep NORP children with them . It added that hearings held in the absence of official representatives of the children 's interests ( a ORG - appointed guardian and the NORP Consul ) were unlawful , and demanded PERSON 's immediate repatriation . It also stated that the conduct referred to above was jeopardising the implementation of joint humanitarian projects .", "On DATE ORG asked ORG to order the immediate repatriation of ORG In an appended note ORG criticised the judicial decisions taken by the NORP authorities as being liable to undermine relations between GPE . It asserted that the children had been placed under psychological duress by the host families . If a decision to place ORG in the care of an NORP family had been taken , ORG demanded that it be revoked .", "On DATE ORG ordered that ORG be entrusted to the care of ORG , which was to maintain her placement with the first CARDINAL applicants . The court also instructed the ORG social services and the mental - health and neuropsychiatry departments to \u201c assume responsibility for the child 's situation through assessment , diagnosis and treatment \u201d . In addition , ORG was to submit a report by DATE .", "The court observed in particular that there was strong evidence that ORG had been subjected to \u201c sexual and other forms of violence \u201d at the PERSON orphanage . Furthermore , as indicated by reliable sources , the child 's behaviour gave rise to fears of serious and irreversible consequences if she was not given \u201c immediate therapy \u201d . Accordingly , measures for her protection were required pursuant to LAW .", "On DATE V. met CARDINAL NORP doctors at ORG offices . According to a report by ORG head of social services , ORG arrived at the meeting in the second applicant 's arms and showed signs of stress as soon as the applicant had gone away . PERSON stayed close to the NORP staff , gave very brief replies to the questions and sometimes spoke in NORP . She firmly refused to take her clothes off .", "In a memorandum dated DATE ORG provided ORG with a \u201c comprehensive psychological , educational and medical rehabilitation programme \u201d for ORG The programme , approved by ORG , was to be carried out at ORG in GPE . ORG undertook to inform the NORP Government periodically of the progress of ORG 's rehabilitation .", "The programme in question contained a CARDINAL - page description of the recreational and sports activities planned for ORG , her diet , the health checks and psychological counselling she would receive , and the persons responsible for each stage of her rehabilitation .", "In a memorandum dated DATE ORG informed ORG that the NORP authorities had taken urgent steps to clarify the situation in the PERSON orphanage . They undertook to keep ORG informed of the outcome of their enquiries . ORG would be placed in a specialist rehabilitation centre , thus avoiding a return to the orphanage in question . In addition , a medical and psychological rehabilitation programme had been devised and ORG had been notified of its contents . GPE would be informed of any developments in the programme .", "Moreover , NORP medical specialists had examined ORG and had ruled out the possibility that her repatriation might affect her physical or mental health . She would be accompanied on the journey by specialist personnel .", "In the light of the above factors , ORG considered that there was no objective justification for PERSON to remain in GPE . It requested the NORP authorities to take action by DATE . Failing that , GPE would be obliged to suspend international adoptions with GPE and programmes for visits there by NORP children .", "Before the ORG , the applicants produced a document dated DATE by which ORG had forwarded to ORG the memorandum of DATE from ORG . The document of DATE read :", "\u201c Ministry of Justice PERSON The Minister 's Office", "N. CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG , DATE", "To ORG To ORG PERSON For information : to ORG For information : to ORG For information : to ORG information : to ORG attached to ORG", "Re . : Transmission of memorandum no . CARDINAL dated DATE from ORG", "For information , and fully respecting the powers of [ your ] judicial authority , we hereby forward you memorandum no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL sent DATE to [ our ] Ministry by ORG concerning the cases of the children ... and [ ORG ] , [ who are the subject ] of proceedings pending before the ORG and ORG .", "The memorandum , after recapitulating the requests made by the above judicial authorities , which have apparently been fully satisfied , mentions the possibility of suspending international adoptions with GPE and programmes for the rehabilitation ( risanamento ) of NORP children [ in GPE ] if the CARDINAL children are not returned to GPE by DATE .", "In order to facilitate communication with ORG in GPE and with the authorities to which this [ memorandum ] is being forwarded for information , notification of the decisions taken is expected forthwith . \u201d", "The President of ORG replied to the above letter on DATE . He stated that ORG had on several occasions contacted ORG , which had always informed them of any decisions . The court was aware of the sensitive nature of the matter . On account of ORG 's state of health , the court had entrusted her to the case of ORG . That decision had not been taken in connection with an adoption procedure ; on the contrary , an application for the child 's adoption under LAW no . CARDINAL ( adoption in special cases ) had been rejected . The reply by the President of ORG further stated :", "\u201c As soon as her health allows , in the opinion of the medical team looking after her , the child will return to GPE , with due regard to the relevant provisions and the relations between GPE .", "It should also be noted that the letters we have been sent by the ORG sometimes employ surprisingly peremptory language and indicate some confusion between the issue of adoption and the urgent procedures followed in accordance with ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , cited above .", "While it is aware of the serious implications referred to in the memorandums from ORG , the court is clearly unable to order the transfer of a child against the appropriate medical advice . \u201d", "According to a report drawn up on DATE by a child neuropsychiatrist , PERSON , PERSON was very tense and anxious about her possible repatriation , which she viewed in dramatic terms , mentioning suicidal intentions . She had said that she had been sexually abused in GPE by boys aged DATE who had found their way into the orphanage . PERSON showed that she had a deep relationship of trust with the first CARDINAL applicants , whom she regarded as her own parents . In her opinion , her family was in GPE . PERSON considered it necessary to continue the sessions with the child . Although she was probably fit to be \u201c transported \u201d in physical terms , she was not psychologically fit , because the frustration of her expectations was likely to cause trauma that would be difficult to overcome , resulting in permanent damage to her psychological and emotional stability .", "In a note of DATE to the President of ORG , ORG attached to ORG stated that , while it appreciated and accepted the court 's decision and the initiatives taken by the NORP authorities to protect ORG , it wished to \u201c offer the broadest , most practical means of cooperation to facilitate the repatriation \u201d of ORG After confirming the NORP authorities ' consent to ORG 's being accompanied by an NORP doctor , the commission said that it was awaiting \u201c notification of the decisions taken by the court as regards the steps to be taken to ensure the child 's repatriation on the scheduled date \u201d .", "In an order of DATE , the text of which was deposited at the registry on DATE , ORG set aside its decision of DATE . It stated that the first CARDINAL applicants were authorised to accompany ORG on her journey back to GPE or , failing that , to join her there and remain , with the local authorities ' consent , for \u201c as long as was deemed appropriate \u201d . Lastly , the court asked ORG , ORG to inform it periodically of any developments concerning the child 's treatment and compliance with LAW in her case .", "The court observed firstly that the NORP authorities had devised a detailed programme of treatment for ORG , making it possible for her , at her request , to stay in contact with the first CARDINAL applicants . In addition , GPE had undertaken not to prevent the first CARDINAL applicants and NORP doctors from entering and staying in its territory . Accordingly , the NORP authorities were under an obligation to cooperate with their NORP counterparts in the child 's best interests as guaranteed by LAW , to which both GPE were parties . The court observed at the same time that ORG was \u201c physically fit \u201d to travel to GPE , but that her immediate separation from her host family and doctors might cause her psychological trauma .", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants were contacted by the ORG carabinieri , who reproached them for failing to attend an appointment scheduled for ORG 's repatriation . According to the applicants , they had not been informed of the order of DATE , which was not served on their lawyer until DATE . They also refused to disclose ORG 's whereabouts , for her own protection . Proceedings were instituted against them for false imprisonment of a minor .", "On DATE ORG directed that PERSON was to be found as soon as possible and placed in a care home for as long as was strictly necessary to arrange for her repatriation . In addition , it prohibited PERSON from being entrusted to the care of anyone other than the persons indicated by the NORP authorities , and confirmed that she should be accompanied to GPE by PERSON and PERSON", "On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants appealed against the order of DATE . They sought a stay of execution of the decision in issue , which was immediately enforceable .", "On DATE the carabinieri found PERSON in PERSON , in the company of the first CARDINAL applicants ' mothers . She was transferred to an institution run by nuns in GPE . The first CARDINAL applicants were initially not told the name of the institution and were subsequently not allowed to contact PERSON", "According to the first CARDINAL applicants , pressure was put on them by the ORG Secretary for ORG and the ORG of PERSON ( who claimed to be acting on behalf of the Minister of Justice ) to withdraw their appeal .", "The hearing in ORG was held on DATE . The representative of GPE asserted that it was no longer possible for ORG 's repatriation to take place under the conditions initially set by ORG ; in particular , the first CARDINAL applicants could not accompany ORG or keep in contact with her .", "According to the applicants , at the end of the hearing ORG informed their lawyers that the decision would be delivered \u201c in DATE \u201d . It did not rule on the first CARDINAL applicants ' request for a stay of execution of the order appealed against .", "On DATE at TIME , accompanied by PERSON and PERSON , was taken by taxi to FAC . She was escorted by a car with carabinieri inside . According to the first CARDINAL applicants , the taxi driver said that ORG had been screaming and crying throughout the journey .", "On DATE at TIME the first CARDINAL applicants discovered on television that ORG had been transferred to the airport . They went to the airport , together with their lawyers . They also contacted CARDINAL other lawyers from GPE \u2013 their representatives before ORG asking them to submit a request for interim measures under LAW . The request was duly submitted but it arrived at ORG at TIME , by which time ORG was already on board the aircraft bound for GPE . The applicants subsequently withdrew their request , which the ORG was therefore not required to examine .", "The first applicant was initially informed that a flight for GPE had taken off at TIME In fact , the flight , with ORG on board , did not leave PERSON until TIME After a stop in GPE , it continued its onward journey to GPE at TIME", "On DATE at TIME ORG deposited with the registry an order by which it dismissed the applicants ' appeal . It appears from the case file that that decision had been adopted on DATE .", "ORG observed that the order appealed against had been made by ORG in an unusual factual context . In particular , on DATE ORG had sought ORG 's repatriation . When interviewed the following day by the ORG carabinieri , she had stated that she had been subjected to violence in her own country and did not wish to return there . Furthermore , on DATE ORG had noted , among other things , that ORG showed signs of \u201c profound psychological suffering \u201d . On DATE V. had been examined by CARDINAL NORP doctors , in the presence of NORP specialists including a psychologist . She had replied to the questions in NORP and had refused to take her clothes off ; as a result , only a superficial and external examination had been possible .", "ORG had then stated that the programme of treatment devised for ORG was in her interests and that any refusal to repatriate her would have \u201c serious repercussions \u201d for relations between the CARDINAL countries as regards visits by NORP children to stay with NORP families . At the same time , ORG had suggested extending ORG 's stay in GPE , stating that it was willing to provide the necessary assistance to that end . The neuropsychiatrist who had treated PERSON had said that the sudden removal of the child from what she regarded as her own environment would entail serious risks .", "ORG explained that under the relevant provisions of NORP law , guardianship of ORG was assumed by the director of the institution in which she had been placed .", "The first CARDINAL applicants had agreed , as part of a cooperation scheme between GPE and many other GPE , to take in a foreign child for DATE , for humanitarian purposes . Contact with the foreign care homes had been arranged by non - governmental organisations . ORG had stayed CARDINAL times with the first CARDINAL applicants , a couple who had been declared fit to adopt a foreign child . PERSON had developed excellent relations with the couple in question , to such an extent that she wished to remain in GPE with them and saw them as her \u201c parents \u201d . Indeed , such aspirations were fairly common , since it was natural for children who did not have a family and came from less wealthy countries than GPE to find that NORP couples gave them the comfort and affection they needed . Difficulties thus frequently arose when the time came for the children to return to their own country .", "In the instant case , the ties between ORG and the first CARDINAL applicants were especially intense and this deep attachment , when set against her troubled experiences in the orphanage , had caused the child to attempt suicide in order to avoid being repatriated .", "Those tribulations had aroused strong reactions among the public , but that did not mean that the legal context of the present case could be disregarded . ORG 's trips to GPE had not been intended to provide her with a new family . If the first CARDINAL applicants had wished to take steps to that end , they should have applied to adopt ORG in accordance with the procedure set out in the protocol between GPE and GPE . Failing that , their position was that of assistants to the institution in which ORG had been placed . In such circumstances , they lacked the capacity to appeal against ORG decision , which could have been challenged only by the institution in question , PERSON 's guardian or ORG office . The first CARDINAL applicants did not have any parental responsibility over PERSON and were therefore not \u201c parties \u201d to the judicial proceedings concerning her .", "That fact would have been sufficient to dismiss the appeal . However , in view of the media attention attracted by ORG 's story , ORG considered it necessary to point out that , even assuming that the first CARDINAL applicants had had locus standi , their allegations could not in any event have been upheld .", "ORG was competent to order measures to protect ORG under LAW , provided that the child was in NORP territory and in danger . The NORP judicial authorities ceased to have jurisdiction once GPE had taken the \u201c steps demanded by the situation \u201d . This was borne out by case - law of ORG ( judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) . The relevance and sufficiency of the measures taken by the NORP authorities could be assessed by the NORP courts from a formal standpoint only ; moreover , the courts in question had rightly adjourned consideration of the situation until the experts responsible for examining ORG had submitted their conclusions .", "Nevertheless , under LAW on the Rights of the LAW , all children were entitled to receive such care as was necessary for their well - being and to live in conditions guaranteeing their balanced development . In order to observe those principles , ORG had a duty to ensure that ORG 's repatriation would not be traumatic and that the psychological aspect had been taken into account .", "In the instant case ORG had laid down appropriate arrangements for the child 's repatriation and GPE and GPE had concluded agreements on that basis . ORG thus reaffirmed that CARDINAL NORP specialists should have \u201c planned \u201d the repatriation in conjunction with their NORP counterparts . The first CARDINAL applicants could have been involved in such cooperation in ORG 's interests , in accordance with the procedure suggested by ORG for further elaboration by the NORP and NORP central authorities .", "It was true that GPE had stated that it was \u201c not very receptive \u201d towards the first CARDINAL applicants ; that , however , was not a factor that could alter ORG conclusions . It had not proved necessary to interview ORG , seeing that she had already been interviewed and made her wishes clear . Summoning the child would have caused unnecessary trauma at a later stage .", "ORG stated , lastly , that during the drafting of the statement of reasons for its order , it had learned informally that ORG had already been repatriated on the initiative of the NORP authorities , under different conditions from those set out by ORG . ORG new order , adopted after the first CARDINAL applicants had failed to hand over PERSON , was said to have justified that act . ORG , before which only an appeal against the order of DATE had been brought , was unable to make an assessment in that regard .", "On DATE the doctors who had accompanied GPE to GPE returned to GPE . They submitted a report to ORG stating that the child was in good psychological and physical health . The report was not sent to the first CARDINAL applicants , who learned of its contents through the media . On DATE they asked to be given access to it and to make copies , but their request was refused by ORG on the ground that ORG decision indicated that the first CARDINAL applicants did not have locus standi in the proceedings concerning ORG 's repatriation .", "According to information supplied by the first CARDINAL applicants on DATE , they had not received any news from the NORP authorities by that date as to ORG 's state of health and had been unable to contact her , even by telephone . \u201c Indirect \u201d information had reached them through the NORP authorities . In addition , the director of the orphanage in PERSON had stated that ORG 's allegations of being ill - treated in his institution were false . Accordingly , ORG would be able to return to the orphanage in question after completing her psychological and educational rehabilitation programme .", "Following a request by ORG , the first CARDINAL applicants submitted fresh information on DATE as to ORG 's circumstances . They stated that , since lodging their application , they had had no contact with the child and had not received any news of her health . However , they had learned through the media that PERSON was living with PERSON and PERSON , QUANTITY from GPE . The PERSON family were also looking after PERSON 's DATE brother , PERSON authorities had apparently given the first CARDINAL applicants cause to hope that they might be able to adopt ORG The newspapers had also reported that ORG had been given assurances about her return to GPE , which was said to be imminent . However , the first CARDINAL applicants were not in possession of any evidence that steps to that end had been taken by GPE . In addition , on several occasions PERSON had apparently reiterated her desire to live in GPE with the first CARDINAL applicants ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
