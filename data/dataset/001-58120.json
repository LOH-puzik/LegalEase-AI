The applicants , Ms Azize Mente\u015f , Ms PERSON and Ms GPE and PERSON are NORP citizens of NORP origin from the village of Sa\u011fg\u00f6z ( which is the official NORP name ) or PERSON ( which is the older , NORP or NORP name ) in the Gen\u00e7 district in the province of ORG in south - east GPE . At present they live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Since DATE , serious disturbances have raged in the south - east of GPE between the security forces and the members of the ORG ( Workers\u2019 ORG ) . This confrontation has so far , according to the ORG , claimed the lives of CARDINAL civilians and CARDINAL members of the security forces .", "At the time of the ORG \u2019s consideration of the case , CARDINAL of the CARDINAL provinces of south - eastern GPE had since DATE been subjected to emergency rule .", "CARDINAL . Sa\u011fg\u00f6z is situated in a mountainous area which was subject to significant ORG terrorist activity . Due to the events in the region in DATE and DATE , many of the villages in the district have been evacuated by the villagers and the houses destroyed . By DATE , the village of ORG and its surrounding hamlets were deserted , the villagers having left for ORG , PERSON and other places , and the houses ruined .", "CARDINAL . The NORP village was evacuated as a whole by the villagers in or DATE , following pressure from the ORG in the area . Some of the villagers in the outer hamlets stayed beyond DATE but had all left by DATE DATE due to ORG presence . Shortly after the villagers began leaving , the ORG moved into the empty houses . Clashes with security forces ensued , CARDINAL in DATE or DATE , another in DATE . It is probable that houses in the village were burned or destroyed in the course of these clashes , including possibly through bombing from helicopters . However , whether the ORG or the security forces set fire to the houses intentionally or accidentally is not established .", "CARDINAL . The facts in this case are disputed .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants their houses were burned in the course of an operation by the security forces in DATE . Their version of the events could be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants all lived in hamlets of the village of ORG . Azize ORG , PERSON and PERSON lived in the lower neighbourhood in NORP village and PERSON lived in GPE , a separate hamlet of the village .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an attack was carried out by the ORG on GPE gendarme station . On TIME , the security forces stopped a minibus belonging to PERSON , which regularly took people between PERSON and the ORG area , as it approached the gendarme station . The security forces set fire to the minibus . They subsequently carried out a followup operation in pursuit of the ORG who had attacked the station . On DATE , security forces came to ORG ) village and burned some of the houses .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE , security forces arrived in the area surrounding GPE by helicopter . On TIME DATE , gendarmes entered the village and gathered people from the upper neighbourhood in the area in front of the school . Gendarmes in the lower area carried out a search and then proceeded to burn houses in the lower neighbourhood of NORP village . Villagers pleaded with the gendarmes not to burn their houses but were told to remain quiet or they would be thrown on the flames . When asked why they were burning the houses , the gendarmes told the villagers that it was a punishment for helping the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The house where PERSON lived was burned completely , along with her furniture , firewood , barn and a shed with DATE feed for the animals . PERSON house was burned and the gendarmes threatened to throw her into the burning house if she tried to retrieve some of her children \u2019s clothes . PERSON house was burned , after she and her children had been thrown out and she had been kicked , cursed at and a gun put to her face . In all , CARDINAL houses in the lower neighbourhood were destroyed . The soldiers told the applicants that they were burning their houses because they helped the terrorists .", "CARDINAL . The intention of the gendarmes in NORP village appeared to have been to burn the whole village in revenge for the attack by the ORG on the gendarme station . However , the arrival of a commanding officer at TIME , a colonel who ordered the burning to stop , saved the upper village .", "The house of the applicant PERSON in the hamlet of GPE was burned by the security forces in a separate incident .", "The applicants were forced to leave ORG .", "CARDINAL . Later , in DATE , the remaining population of the village left and in DATE the remainder of the village was burned down . By DATE in DATE , the entire area seems to have been burned , devastated and depopulated .", "CARDINAL . The burning of the applicants\u2019 homes is consistent with a practice of burning houses as part of the policy by the security forces to combat the ORG , especially where the authorities view villages as giving support to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the ORG has sought to use the applicants\u2019 village as a place of shelter and supply base . The villagers were forced by virtue of the incursions of the terrorists to leave the village . The terrorists used the houses from time to time and when the security forces took action against them , the terrorists fled setting the houses on fire .", "CARDINAL . There were no operations by the security forces in the area on DATE . In fact , the applicants had been absent from the village for DATE by that point . They were the close relatives of CARDINAL named individuals who are suspected of being members of the mountains branch of the ORG . They also had relatives who had been detained on charges alleging , inter alia , that they have aided and abetted the ORG terrorist organisation . Other members of the applicants\u2019 families were working for the ORG in rural areas . It was not unlikely that the applicants had been subjected to pressure by their relatives who aid and abet and work for the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Commission conducted an investigation , with the assistance of the parties , and accepted documentary evidence , including written statements , and oral evidence of CARDINAL witnesses taken by CARDINAL delegates of the Commission in GPE from DATE . This included CARDINAL local public prosecutors and CARDINAL villagers whom they had investigated in connection with the ORG allegations ( see paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL below ) ; another villager ; the first CARDINAL applicants ; and the commander of the gendarmerie of the ORG province who had taken up his duties after the alleged events .", "In relation to the oral evidence , the ORG had been aware of the difficulties attached to assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters ( in some cases via NORP and NORP into LANGUAGE ) . It therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance which should be attributed to the statements of witnesses appearing before its delegates . In respect of both written and oral evidence , the Commission was aware that the cultural context of the applicants and the witnesses made it inevitable that dates and other details lacked precision ( in particular , numerical matters ) and did not consider that this by itself impinged on the credibility of the testimony .", "It assessed the evidence and its findings could be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL investigations into the events at ORG had been carried out by the CARDINAL public prosecutors at PERSON , the first by Mr PERSON and the second by PERSON PERSON , both of which had ended in decisions , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively , not to prosecute .", "CARDINAL . The first investigation had been in response to a letter from ORG , apparently motivated by information received when the ORG complaints had been communicated by the ORG to ORG on DATE ( date of letter ) . In reconstructing the investigation , the ORG \u2019s delegates had received little assistance from the public prosecutor who had also been handicapped in not having a copy of his file for reference .", "His decision not to prosecute , which concluded that no incident had occurred on DATE , must have been taken DATE from his receipt of the first notification of the complaints . It seemed likely that the applicants\u2019 names were not known to him at that stage . This decision had been taken solely on the basis of brief statements from CARDINAL villagers , from different hamlets , distinct from ORG , which appeared mainly directed at refuting specific allegations : the bombing by helicopters in DATE ( not in fact alleged in the ORG original application ) and the tying up or beating of the old men . All had referred to terrorist clashes with security forces leading to the ORG departure from ORG ; CARDINAL had attributed the burning of houses to the ORG .", "According to PERSON , the witnesses had been selected at random , but PERSON , muhtar of PERSON , had said that he had been invited to make a statement and to bring other \u201c reliable witnesses \u201d from the village .", "CARDINAL . Also the second investigation had been in response to another letter from ORG . PERSON had based himself on the investigation of his colleague . He referred to the previous CARDINAL statements and summoned the CARDINAL villagers concerned . His decision not to prosecute concluded that the ORG burned the houses in the village , that the alleged incident had not taken place in DATE and that the applicants were close relatives of members of the ORG .", "CARDINAL", "CARDINAL . The Commission observed that there had been no detailed investigation at the domestic level of the events in NORP village and its surrounding hamlets over DATE . It had accordingly based its findings on the evidence given orally before its delegates or submitted in writing in the course of the proceedings .", "It further noted that the Government , despite repeated requests by the ORG \u2019s ORG and the ORG \u2019s delegates , had failed to provide documentary materials , in particular the contents of the investigation files of the CARDINAL public prosecutors who carried out investigations into the alleged incident in GPE . At the taking of evidence in DATE , the ORG had failed to identify and serve with the ORG \u2019s summons the gendarme commander for the area on DATE , his successor , PERSON , appearing instead . No explanation had been forthcoming for this . In this respect , the Commission had had regard to the principle that , in assessing the evidence in a case the conduct of the parties may be taken into account ( see the GPE v. the GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL in fine ) .", "CARDINAL . The Commission was not persuaded by the ORG \u2019s suggestion that the ORG complaints were fabrications resulting from pressure exerted by their relatives in the ORG . ORG found it regrettable that the response from the domestic authorities and the ORG \u2019s allegations made in this case had given the appearance of being directed more at emphasising the ORG links with the applicants\u2019 families than at dealing with the substance of the applicants\u2019 grievances .", "CARDINAL . In establishing the facts , the Commission had regard to the inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence .", "As to the evidence given by the CARDINAL villagers to the public prosecutors , the ORG observed that its tenor had been dogmatic , including blanket denials of any alleged cruelty or burning ever having been committed by NORP soldiers . It had also given some support to the ORG allegation that there was a certain animosity between the other villagers and themselves , which might have encouraged them to give statements contradicting the ORG account . Moreover , the ORG noted that the village muhtar had been instructed by the prosecutor to bring some \u201c reliable witnesses \u201d . In view of the manner of selection of witnesses by the prosecutor , the ORG found it unsafe to rely on their written statements in so far as they were unsupported by other evidence .", "The ORG further noted that there were material differences between the statements of the first CARDINAL applicants , Ms Azize Mente\u015f , Ms PERSON and Ms GPE , as recorded by ORG and their oral statements to the delegates . However , the ORG found that the CARDINAL applicants\u2019 oral evidence , which was supported in material points by a villager PERSON was on the whole consistent and credible . The fact that they had gone to ORG in ORG to complain in DATE was a strong factor weighing heavily in favour of the credibility of their central complaint . On the other hand , the ORG considered that it could not rely on the written statements since it had serious doubts as to the manner in which the association took statements and the extent to which care had been taken to record accurately each individual complaint without contamination from information gathered elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . The Commission was satisfied that PERSON and PERSON were still living in their houses in the lower neighbourhood of the village of PERSON in DATE and were present on DATE . However , as appeared to be a not uncommon pattern of life in this region , these CARDINAL applicants left the village in the DATE for ORG and returned in DATE to tend to their gardens and crops . As regards PERSON , while she probably did not own a house herself , she lived in the house of her fatherin - law when she returned in DATE to the village . The ORG found that on the balance of the evidence , she was also living in the lower neighbourhood on DATE .", "As regards the events in ORG accepted in its principal elements the oral evidence of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON GPE . Considering that their oral evidence was more consistent , more credible and more convincing than the evidence given by the CARDINAL villagers , it found as follows .", "On TIME DATE , a large force of gendarmes had arrived in the vicinity of NORP village . On DATE , the gendarmes had entered both upper and lower neighbourhoods and carried out searches . At some point , the villagers in the upper neighbourhood ( with the exception of the younger men who were out working ) had been gathered in front of the school , probably to be questioned about the ORG in the area . In the lower neighbourhood , the women , including the applicants , had been required by the soldiers to leave their houses and their houses had been set on fire , with all their belongings and property inside , including the clothing and footwear of children . The burning had been restricted to the lower neighbourhood . Around TIME , a helicopter had arrived in the village in the upper neighbourhood , probably bringing a senior officer , a colonel , and his arrival had been associated by the applicants and some of the other villagers with an order to cease the burning . The gendarmes left DATE . Shortly afterwards , the CARDINAL applicants , with their children or other members of their family , had to walk for TIME to the Lice - Diyarbak\u0131r road from where they were given rides in vehicles into ORG .", "CARDINAL . As to the alleged operation by security forces in which the house of the fourth applicant , PERSON , was burned along with others in the hamlet of GPE , no facts have been established in relation to this applicant \u2019s complaints . Due to ill - health she did not appear at the hearings before ORG delegates , unlike the first CARDINAL applicants .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ...", "ORG The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war . The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration , whose responsibility is of an absolute , objective nature , based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of \u201c social risk \u201d . Thus the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the ORG may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety , or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property .", "CARDINAL . The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL of DATE on ORG , which provides :", "\u201c ... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this PERSON are to be brought against the administration before the administrative courts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . LAW makes it a criminal offence", "\u2013 to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty ( Article CARDINAL generally , Article CARDINAL in respect of civil servants ) ;", "\u2013 to oblige an individual through force or threats to commit or not to commit an act ( Article CARDINAL ) ;", "\u2013 to issue threats ( Article CARDINAL ) ;", "\u2013 to make an unlawful search of an individual \u2019s home ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) ;", "\u2013 to commit arson ( Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL ) , or aggravated arson if human life is endangered ( Article CARDINAL ) ;", "\u2013 to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness , negligence or inexperience ( Article ORG ) ; or", "\u2013 to damage another \u2019s property intentionally ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "CARDINAL . For all these offences complaints may be lodged , pursuant to ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure , with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities . The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them , the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated , pursuant to Article CARDINAL of LAW . A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel , they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage , endangering human lives or damaging property , if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned ( non - military ) before the competent authority under LAW , or before the suspected ORG hierarchical superior ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL on the LAW and Procedure of Military Courts ) .", "CARDINAL . If the alleged author of a crime is an agent of the ORG , permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils ( ORG of ORG ) . The local council decisions may be appealed to ORG ; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind .", "CARDINAL . Any illegal act by civil servants , be it a crime or a tort , which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts .", "CARDINAL . Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts , whose proceedings are in writing .", "CARDINAL . Damage caused by terrorist violence may be compensated out of ORG .", "CARDINAL . Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL of the LAW provide for fundamental limitations on constitutional safeguards .", "CARDINAL . Provisional Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides that there can be no allegation of unconstitutionality in respect of measures taken under laws or decrees having the force of law and enacted DATE and DATE . That includes Law no . CARDINAL on ORG DATE , under which decrees have been issued which are immune from judicial challenge .", "CARDINAL . Extensive powers have been granted to the Regional Governor of ORG by such decrees , especially Decree no . CARDINAL , as amended by Decrees nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL , and Decree no . CARDINAL .", "DATE . Decree no . CARDINAL modifies the application of PERSON no . ORG , the Anti - Terror Law ( DATE ) , in those areas which are subject to the state of emergency , with the effect that the decision to prosecute members of the security forces is removed from the public prosecutor and conferred on local administrative councils . According to ORG , these councils are made up of civil servants and have been criticised for their lack of legal knowledge , as well as for being easily influenced by the Regional Governor or ORG who also head the security forces .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of Decree no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE provides as follows :", "\u201c No criminal , financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against ORG or a NORP Governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this decree , and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end . This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the ORG for damage suffered by them without justification . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the submissions of the applicants , this Article grants impunity to the Governors and reinforces the powers of the Regional Governor to order the permanent or temporary evacuation of villages , to impose residence restrictions and to enforce the transfer of people to other areas .
