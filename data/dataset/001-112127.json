NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by ORG , a firm of lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was born in GPE , but subsequently moved to GPE . He became an alcoholic and was convicted of a number of violent offences . On DATE he was arrested and charged with the murder of an DATE youth , his partner \u2019s cousin . On DATE at ORG in GPE he pleaded guilty to the offence of murder and was sentenced to imprisonment for life . On DATE the trial judge , who described the offence as a \u201c sudden unpremeditated attack in a moment of drunken and unreasoned jealousy upon a complete stranger \u201d , expressed the view that the length of detention necessary to meet the requirements of retribution and general deterrence was DATE . On DATE the Lord Chief Justice of GPE and GPE expressed the view that he took a slightly more severe view of the case and recommended \u201c that DATE would be the appropriate minimum \u201d ( hereafter referred to as the \u201c tariff \u201d ) . The Home Secretary duly fixed the tariff at DATE and the applicant was informed of this .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an order pursuant to section CARDINAL ) of MONEY DATE was made , transferring the applicant to GPE to serve the remainder of his sentence . The effect of such an order for a life prisoner was that his release would be regulated by the law and practice of GPE relating to life sentence prisoners . Under the NORP system at that time , ORG , an administrative body whose membership included the Permanent Under - Secretary of ORG and other senior GPE officials , advised the Home Secretary as to when a life prisoner should be released on licence , but had no power to order release . ORG would generally carry out a review after the prisoner had served CARDINAL , then CARDINAL , then DATE in custody , and thereafter at intervals fixed by ORG . This was set out in an explanatory memorandum provided to the applicant . On DATE he signed a transfer document agreeing to the transfer to GPE and acknowledging that the differences between the GPE and ORG had been explained to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG were informed by their NORP counterparts that a tariff of DATE had been set in respect of the applicant and that a first review should take place in DATE . In accordance with the NORP procedure , however , ORG considered the applicant \u2019s case on DATE . The result of that review was communicated to the applicant by letter dated DATE . This stated , inter alia , that ORG had decided that \u201c the appropriate retributive period in this instance would fall at DATE in line with the tariff set by the ORG \u201d . ORG considered that alcohol , drugs and relationships with women were risk factors for the applicant and that a controlled and structured pre - release programme and supervision in the community would be necessary . On that basis ORG recommended that the applicant \u2019s case be referred for consultation with the judiciary with a view to his release on life licence after expiry of the CARDINAL-year period . It considered that the combined consultation and anticipated pre - release phase of DATE would be sufficient to test whether or not the applicant was a suitable candidate for release on licence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed by letter , that on DATE he would join the Pre - Release Scheme . He was reminded that the setting of a provisional release date did not automatically mean that release on licence would follow . He was further informed that his release was subject to his continued good behaviour and to suitable resettlement arrangements being made . Phase CARDINAL of the Pre - Release Scheme began immediately . On DATE the applicant commenced Phase CARDINAL . This involved working at approved jobs and staying in ORG hostel , with extended paroles at DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was due to commence Phase CARDINAL . On that date he failed to attend at an alcohol management programme or to report to work . As a result he was posted as unlawfully at large and remained so for DATE . He was returned to the prison on DATE and formally suspended from ORG . On DATE ORG wrote to the applicant confirming that he had been suspended from ORG . On DATE the decision was taken to restore him to ORG , on the condition that he complete an intensive alcohol management programme . The applicant completed the residential course and moved through Phase CARDINAL of the Pre - Release Scheme . On DATE he commenced Phase CARDINAL . On DATE he failed to report for work and on DATE he was posted unlawfully at large . He was arrested by the police in GPE in an intoxicated state and returned to the prison on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed by letter that he was formally suspended from ORG . He was invited to make written representations to the multi - disciplinary team which would decide whether he should be readmitted to the Scheme . On DATE the applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to ORG , stating inter alia :", "\u201c \u2018 Our client was admitted to ORG by the Secretary of ORG acting through a lawfully constituted body , namely ORG . While our client has not yet received a tariff under the provisions of ORG it is clear that the punishment element of our client \u2019s sentence has been served . To suggest otherwise would be contrary to the findings of the PERSON who found him suitable for the scheme in both DATE and DATE .", "Our client was therefore clearly serving that part of his sentence which relates to the prevention of risk and his perceived dangerousness to , society . To our knowledge it has not been alleged that our client has committed any crime whatsoever . We are instructed that the sole reason for his arrest on DATE was the request by the prison service . This is further supported by the fact that our client has not been charged with any criminal offence and has not been questioned by police in relation to any offence whatsoever .", "Furthermore we would contend that for any decision to be taken to revoke our client \u2019s status on ORG Scheme that any such allegations or offences would have to create a belief that our client was at risk of committing a further violent offence . We contend that any such belief is simply untenable in these circumstances . We would contend that to recall our client to GPE without recourse to a judicial authority is therefore unlawful and in breach of our client \u2019s LAW rights as protected under LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG replied on DATE as follows :", "\u201c Mr PERSON \u2019s continued suspension from the pre - release scheme is primarily because of his risk of violent offending . The key factors in this assessment are :", "CARDINAL . Alcohol was a significant factor in Mr PERSON \u2019s index offence . In spite of the best efforts of the staff at ORG , Mr PERSON admits to drinking alcohol and to being drunk since his completion of the alcohol programme . Indeed , PERSON now admits to drinking alcohol prior to his suspension from the pre - release scheme on DATE , during his subsequent period unlawfully at large , prior to his second suspension from the pre - release scheme on DATE and during his most recent period unlawfully at large .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON had been posted unlawfully at large by ORG on DATE . However , PERSON came to the attention of [ the police ] because of the disturbance he was causing in the street .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was in an intoxicated state when arrested by Police in GPE on DATE . Upon his return to PERSON he became abusive to ORG during a cell search and was later found guilty of assaulting a Prison Officer . He was awarded DATE cellular confinement for this incident , which involved him in pushing his fist into an Officer \u2019s face .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON \u2019s behaviour during periods of temporary release clearly shows a pattern where he can not be trusted to comply with the terms and conditions of his release . He has now been found guilty of being unlawfully at large on CARDINAL occasions as set out below . ...", "These failures , coupled with his alcohol problem , not reporting for work and not attending alcohol management sessions in DATE , raise serious questions about Mr PERSON \u2019s ability to comply with the elements of risk management designed to prevent further violent offences . ...", "Further consideration is required regarding how best to address the risk factors in this case and the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr PERSON \u2019s suspension from the pre - release scheme is also still ongoing . In these circumstances , and for all the concerns listed above regarding Mr PERSON \u2019s potential for relapse and violence , PERSON will remain suspended from the pre - release scheme . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application for judicial review of the decision to return him to prison . He claimed that his recall to prison and detention from DATE was unreasonable , arbitrary and in breach of LAW , since the tariff set in his case by the ORG Secretary had expired in DATE . The applicant contended that he should only have been detained after that date if there were a risk that he would commit violent offences if released , and that the events which led to his recall involved breach of the conditions of ORG , but not violent offending . In addition , he contended that , having served the penal element of his offence , he was entitled to challenge the lawfulness of his continued detention but had been afforded no such opportunity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Life Sentences ( GPE ) Order DATE ( \u201c the Life Sentences Order \u201d ) came into effect , changing the system for the release of life sentence prisoners in GPE . In the case of a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment for life , the trial judge was henceforth required to fix the minimum term the prisoner should serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence . When the prisoner had served this tariff , the Secretary of ORG was required to refer his case to ORG , a new body created under the Order , which would consider whether it was necessary that the prisoner should be confined further for the protection of the public from serious harm and which was obliged and empowered to order his release if it did not consider further detention necessary . A prisoner was entitled to review by ORG on expiry of the tariff and at DATE intervals thereafter . LAW Sentences Order applied the release provisions to life prisoners transferred to GPE . LAW provided that , for existing life prisoners , the tariff would be set by the Secretary of ORG following a recommendation of the Lord Chief Justice . On DATE ORG decided that the Lord Chief Justice \u2019s recommendation was binding on the Secretary of ORG ( Re PERSON [ DATE ] NICA CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in accordance with the provisions of the Life Sentences Order , the applicant was informed that his case would soon be referred to the Lord Chief Justice for him to decide what tariff to recommend to the Secretary of ORG . The applicant was given the opportunity to submit representations , which he declined . On DATE the Lord Chief Justice recommended that the applicant \u2019s tariff be fixed at DATE . The applicant was advised of this and given a further opportunity to make any representations , which he again declined . His case was referred to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s judicial review application was heard by ORG , which delivered judgment on DATE . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s submission that his case was analogous to that of GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIV , where a mandatory life prisoner had completed the tariff part of his sentence and was released on licence , subsequently to be recalled to prison following the commission of an offence unrelated to the index offence of murder . In the applicant \u2019s case , once he had been transferred to GPE , he became subject to the release provisions for mandatory life prisoners which applied in that jurisdiction . He had not been released on licence under LAW ( GPE ) Act DATE , nor was he scheduled for such release . According to the decision of ORG , the pre - licence part of the applicant \u2019s sentence would not be completed until he had successfully passed through a Pre - Release Scheme . As part of that Scheme , he had been allowed out of prison on a temporary basis , subject to conditions , which he understood . The prison authorities were rightly concerned about the applicant \u2019s breach of his temporary release conditions , in particular his drinking . As regards the alleged violation of LAW , the judge noted that at all stages the applicant would have been able to establish the lawfulness of his detention through judicial review proceedings or an application for habeas corpus , although the chances of success in relation to a prisoner lawfully detained following conviction were limited . The Life Sentences Order had introduced a determinate element to the sentences of life prisoners in GPE , following the expiry of which they would only be lawfully detained if this was necessary to protect the public . The procedure under the Order had been slightly delayed because of the need to determine the legal issues raised by the PERSON case , but the applicant \u2019s tariff had now been considered by the Lord Chief Justice and his file had been referred to ORG . The applicant had not established that his detention was unlawful or arbitrary nor that he had been denied an opportunity to challenge its lawfulness . The application for judicial review was therefore dismissed .", "CARDINAL . At ORG hearing on DATE , the Commissioners found that the applicant remained a risk to the public because of his tendency to react to stress by abusing alcohol . They declined to order his release and recommended that he should continue with the therapy he was receiving in prison . The applicant re - entered ORG in DATE , but was unlawfully at large again DATE and DATE . His case came before ORG again on DATE , on which date the hearing was adjourned to DATE in order to obtain psychiatric evidence . Again , the Commission did not direct his release , but recommended that he complete a cognitive self - change programme . At a further hearing in DATE the applicant \u2019s case was adjourned for DATE to permit him to be tested in a ORG Scheme which commenced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG of GPE against the judgment of ORG . His appeal was dismissed on DATE . ORG held that , in the light of recent domestic case - law and the ORG judgment ( cited above ) , the fixing of the applicant \u2019s tariff by the Home Secretary in DATE or DATE had been a sentencing exercise rather than an administrative act . When the applicant was transferred to GPE , therefore , he came as a prisoner sentenced to a mandatory life sentence with a tariff of DATE . At the expiry of this tariff , the applicant became entitled to a review of the need to continue detaining him on grounds of dangerousness by a tribunal compliant with LAW . However , such a review did not take place until DATE , when a review was carried out by ORG . There had , therefore , been a violation of LAW . Nonetheless , ORG underlined that although ORG had not had the power to order release , as required by LAW , it had considered the applicant \u2019s case from DATE until the coming into force of the DATE Order with exemplary care . The applicant was an alcoholic who , at DATE , had murdered a young man in a violent attack motivated by jealousy which was without foundation . Despite all the efforts made to keep him off alcohol and to provide him with a release date he had been unable to control his alcoholism . Inevitably , ORG , and subsequently ORG , had been unable to release him on licence since he remained a serious risk to the public . If an independent tribunal had examined his case in DATE , it would have been bound to reach the same conclusion , namely to require the applicant to complete a ORG , which he had not been able successfully to complete to date . The applicant had , therefore , suffered no damage as a result of the breach of LAW . Furthermore , there had been no breach of LAW as a result of an independent review immediately following the expiry of the tariff , because the detention continued to be justified under the terms of the mandatory life sentence and the delay in fixing the tariff in GPE and carrying out an independent review was not arbitrary . ORG further held that , even if there had been a breach of LAW , the declarations sought by the applicant would have been rejected on the same grounds as under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought permission to appeal to ORG , which was refused by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE , on the grounds that there was no arguable point of law of public importance involved ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
