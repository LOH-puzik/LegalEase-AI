The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in ORG , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at around lunch time , an argument broke out between the applicant and ORG in a residential street . The applicant had been trying to park a car he was driving and had collided with a parked car which belonged to FAC Within TIME of the dispute , a third man , ORG , arrived at the scene equipped with a loaded shotgun and shot PERSON in the back of the head . PERSON survived but suffered permanent brain damage .", "CARDINAL . The ORG case was that ORG had been summoned to the scene by the applicant and another co - accused , GPE , using a mobile telephone belonging to GPE The applicant was charged with attempted murder and making threats to kill . The applicant denied the charges , alleging that he had left the scene at an early stage and gone to a neighbouring house . He disputed allegations that he had played any part in summoning ORG", "CARDINAL . The ORG 's evidence regarding the alleged phone calls came from a number of sources . They pointed to the fact that the applicant was the party involved in the original dispute and that , according to witnesses , he had made threats of violence and of death . An important part of the ORG case involved video recordings from closed circuit television ( ORG ) cameras near the scene . From a combination of video recordings and mobile telephone records for GPE 's telephone , the ORG contended that the applicant could be seen making certain calls . There was also eye witness evidence of him making CARDINAL of the critical calls . In total , the ORG case was that CARDINAL relevant calls were made from GPE 's mobile telephone to ORG or CARDINAL of his associates .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's case at trial was that he had made no calls on ORG 's mobile telephone . He accepted that eye witness evidence and ORG recordings demonstrated that he had used a telephone at certain points . However , he said that he was a drug dealer using his own telephone and that the calls were made for his own criminal purposes and were nothing to do with the summoning of PERSON As regards CARDINAL part of the ORG footage , the applicant denied the ORG contention that it showed him making a call at a relevant time .", "CARDINAL . A compilation of the ORG footage was shown a number of times during the trial . It was played on specialist digital equipment , which was more sophisticated than an ordinary video recorder , specially installed for the trial . It had a number of facilities , including a better capacity to freeze frames , to step forwards and backwards from frame to frame and to coordinate views of different cameras at any particular moment . The machine was operated by a detective constable , Officer M , who had been specially instructed how to use it . Officer M was a member of the investigating team of police officers which had conducted the inquiry into the applicant 's case . He was , formally speaking , a witness in the case in the sense that he had made CARDINAL single paragraph statements recording taking possession of some of the ORG tapes and had made an uncontroversial statement relating to the taking of a mouth swab sample for DNA analysis from one of the other accused in the applicant 's case . Over the period of the trial , which lasted DATE , he had made his services available not only at the trial itself but also to the ORG and the defendants outside the court .", "CARDINAL . There was some early discussion about the possibility that the jury would wish to view the recordings after they retired . Leading counsel for the applicant directed the judge 's attention to short notes in ORG 's Criminal Pleading , Evidence and Practice , an authoritative text on ORG practice and procedure , on the replaying of various different kinds of recording which may figure in trials . The matter was left that there was no reason why the recordings could not be taken into the jury room and played there by the jury if required .", "CARDINAL . At the conclusion of his summing - up , the judge told the jury that should they wish to view the recordings again , they only had to ask . The following dialogue took place :", "\u201c Judge : ' Ladies and gentlemen , it may be that you will want to see the videos again . Have arrangements been made for the jury to see them in their room ? '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' ... It is impossible , as I understand it , in fact , to take this into the jury 's room . There are , therefore , either CARDINAL options : either to watch a ORG video on the normal equipment in their room , or alternatively , there is the higher quality\u2013 '", "Judge : ' The jury must watch what has been shown in court . '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' In that case , I am afraid the position must be that as and when the jury require it , they will have to come back and see it in court . '", "Judge : ' There you are . Any time you want to see the video , you can pass a note ... ' \u201d", "CARDINAL . The jury subsequently retired . On DATE of their deliberations , they indicated their wish to start reviewing the video evidence in the afternoon . Counsel were advised of the jury 's request and the court convened with junior counsel for the applicant among those attending . The following discussion ensued :", "\u201c Counsel for the prosecution : ' ... the only issue that arises as a result of the ORG request is who exactly is present in court when they view the material . It is a matter that we have discussed between counsel , and of course , subject to your Lordship 's view , I think the general view is that if they are able to watch it on their own , it would be much more constructive \u2013 if counsel and your Lordship were not present . In other words , if this was an extension of their jury room\u2013 '", "Judge : ' And then we would have \u2013 what \u2013 just the officer working the machine ? '", "Counsel for the prosecution : My Lord , that is the only outstanding issue , and I am afraid I have not had an opportunity to speak to [ Officer M ] \u2013 who , as your Lordship knows , is the man in charge of DATE as to whether it would be possible for the jury to be shown very briefly how to operate the machinery , or whether that is unrealistic . '", "Judge : ' I should imagine that it is PERSON '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' In which case I understand\u2013 '", "Judge : ' I mean , you have to go backwards and forwards , and you have to catch particular frames , and I think you will probably need [ Officer M ] \u2013 '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' My Lord , I am inclined to agree , in which case it would be my suggestion , on behalf of the ORG , that he remains , and at their instruction operates the machinery\u2013 '", "Judge : ' And does nothing else but to operate the machinery\u2013 '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' Indeed \u2013 and , of course , makes no communication to them or to anyone else \u2013 '", "Counsel for GPE : ' Except where they will want to go backwards or forwards \u2013 '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' Except , of course , to talk to them about operating the machinery . '", "Judge : ' Does anyone have any objections to the court being cleared , along with the defendants and the public gallery , and simply leaving [ Officer M ] there DATE and in that case , I do not think I need ask the jury what they want to see . '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' My Lord , no . '", "Judge : ' That is probably much better . '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' Indeed . Thank you very much . '", "Judge : ' Thank you . Does everybody agree ? '", "Counsel for the prosecution : ' My Lord , yes . '", "Counsel for ORG My Lord , yes . '", "Counsel for GPE : ' My Lord , yes . '", "CARDINAL . No assent was recorded from junior counsel for the applicant but no objections were raised to the course of action proposed .", "CARDINAL . The judge instructed the jury to return and directed them as follows :", "\u201c Ladies and gentlemen , having discussed this matter with counsel , what we are going to do is this : we are going to leave [ Officer M ] in this court with you , and he will play any part of the video that you have seen , and he will play it as you think fit . Remember that there is CARDINAL camera that operates DATE that sometimes you are viewing camera no . CARDINAL , and I think at other times camera no . CARDINAL . [ Officer M ] can not do anything other than operate the video machine , and there is to be no other communication with him DATE or any communication from him DATE than simply asking him to play you what you want to see \u2013 and I think it is probably better , because he was in court DATE and apart from discussing among yourselves , perhaps , what you want to see , any other discussion is in your jury room ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The jury was left alone in the court room with Officer M at TIME to begin reviewing the video evidence .", "CARDINAL . As soon as leading counsel for the applicant , who had been engaged elsewhere during the earlier discussions with counsel regarding the viewing of the video recordings as the applicant 's trial had overrun , was informed of the course of action adopted , a request was made to reconvene the court at TIME The judge agreed to reconvene at TIME as he did not wish to interrupt the jury 's viewing of the video evidence . The jury spent TIME viewing the video recordings in the presence of Officer PERSON", "CARDINAL . When the court reconvened , leading counsel for the applicant directed the judge 's attention to various authorities , including ORG 's Criminal Pleading , Evidence and Practice , and the following discussion took place :", "\u201c Counsel for the applicant : ' The court has , for all purposes , during TIME , whilst the jury have been reviewing the material , really been an extension of the jury room \u2013 '", "...", "Counsel for the applicant : ' And what has happened , in reality , is that an individual \u2013 he happens to be a police officer \u2013 an individual has , in fact , been within that jury room \u2013 '", "Judge : ' There was instructions \u2013 '", "Counsel for the applicant : ' I know that , but the difficulty with that is that the person who would normally be supervising \u201c the sanctity \u201d , if I can put it that way , of the jury \u2013 because , of course , normally there is no problem ; they are in their jury retiring room , and there is no individual who can come near them \u2013 '", "Judge : ' No \u2013 '", "Counsel for the applicant : ' Because the jury bailiff acts in accordance with their oath , as one expects , to prevent that \u2013 by my understanding is that TIME there has been no such person present . '", "Judge : ' But are you saying that if one of the jury bailiffs had been present , that would be all right ? That would have caused other problems . '", "Counsel for the applicant : ' My Lord , I am trying to see a way through it . This is a very unusual circumstance .", "Judge : ' The unusual circumstance is this ... : we can not put the equipment in the jury room ' .", "Counsel for the applicant : ' Yes , I understand that ' .", "Judge : ' And that is the first problem ... The second problem is that the jury could not work the equipment . '", "...", "Counsel for the applicant : ' ... we understand that [ Officer M ] was able , in fact , to instruct another officer how to use this machine in pretty short order . '", "Judge : ' Perhaps , but that is how it was presented to me \u2013 '", "...", "Counsel for the applicant : ' I am merely looking at the peculiar situation that arises here , and the simple fact of the matter , if we boil it down to first principles , is quite simply this : throughout TIME , there has , in fact , been an outsider in the jury retiring room . Your Lordship , of course , has given directions , and so be it . In fact , we can not inquire \u2013 certainly from the jury \u2013 as to whether that was followed , because we have no right \u2013 '", "Judge : ' No , I agree \u2013 '", "Counsel for the applicant : ' And the problem is this : that those who sit behind the dock are essentially put on trust in relation to the police officer 's lack of communication , and as soon as one recognises that , that , essentially , can not be right , because there is no reason why they should , as it were , feel that they can trust the police officer to that extent ... '", "CARDINAL . Counsel for the applicant then suggested that the police officer could continue to operate the equipment but that the presence of a jury bailiff in the jury room would ensure that there was no communication between the parties in light of the oath sworn by the jury bailiff to prevent any communication with the jury . The following exchange took place :", "\u201c Counsel for the applicant : ' If the jury bailiff 's oath is that they are to stop any approach by any outsider to the jury , then any communication as to which section of tape the jury wish to see should , in fact , go through that conduit , and that can be in the same room , but the jury bailiff can ensure that there is no communication directly between the parties . '", "Judge : ' ... You are suggesting that the police officer could operate the machinery \u2013 that is obviously the most convenient way to do it , even if there could possibly be other ways ... \u2013 but the jury bailiff has to be present ? '", "Counsel for the applicant : ' Yes , because the jury bailiff , consistent with his or her oath , is duty bound to stop all communication , and essentially , that communication can only be complained of if it came from the officer . I am not saying for CARDINAL instant DATE for CARDINAL instant DATE that I have reason to believe that that has happened . '", "Judge : ' No . '", "Counsel for the applicant : ' I am merely looking at it from a point of principle ... The system ... has a safeguard within it , and normally that is the jury bailiff , who essentially guards the sanctity of the jury once they have retired . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge observed that there was a need to protect the privacy of the jury while preserving the integrity of the situation . However , he pointed out that \u201c the die had been cast \u201d and that :", "\u201c ... either the procedure in the circumstances of this particular case is acceptable , or it is not . I am not sure I would want to change it now . I mean , counsel can consider all of this overnight \u2013 \u201d", "CARDINAL . He later continued :", "\u201c ... I think I ought to state for DATE and I will DATE precisely what has happened , so that there can be no doubt about it . I will give counsel a chance to consider this matter ... it may be that it is just not sensible to do anything different , and if something has gone wrong , it has gone wrong \u2013 but I will give counsel a chance to consider the matter overnight , and if they want to suggest to me anything \u2013 alternative procedures \u2013 not very different than what we are doing \u2013 but any modified procedures , tomorrow I will listen to them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It was then suggested by counsel for GPE that either the jury themselves be instructed how to use the equipment or that the video be played in open court in the presence of the judge . TIME , a solution was agreed which would allow the jury to operate the equipment themselves , with information provided to assist them in locating the part of the recordings that they wished to view . The judge subsequently advised the jury as follows :", "\u201c We have reconsidered the procedure for your viewing [ the ORG ] footage , and in order to give you complete freedom for discussion amongst yourselves as you view that footage , we propose to give you the opportunity to do so in the absence of any other person .", "What we propose is this : that you should be shown in a moment or CARDINAL in open court , with everybody present , how that equipment works , and you will then be left to it , and you will decide exactly who is to operate it , and what you wish to see .", "Can I remind you that the tape is a composite tape containing footage from CARDINAL cameras . You will be given a sheet of paper \u2013 this one \u2013 containing an index of counter times , which show where footage from each camera begins , and what each camera is focused on ... If you have any problems in working the equipment , let me know , and I will reconsider the position ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The jury subsequently viewed the video recordings alone for TIME . They continued their deliberations for the rest of DATE and into the following TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the jury found the applicant guilty of attempted murder and making threats to kill . He was sentenced to DATE in prison for attempted murder and DATE , to be served concurrently , for making threats to kill . His co - accused , GPE , was found not guilty .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the approach taken to the viewing of the video recordings amounted to a fundamental infringement of the integrity of the jury 's deliberations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The court summarised the matter before it as follows :", "\u201c [ Counsel for the applicant ] contends now , as foreshadowed in his submissions to the judge on his return to court , that the course taken amounted , however unwittingly , to a fundamental infringement of the integrity of the jury 's deliberations . He takes his stand on the point of principle . He contends that when somebody has retired , in effect , with the jury for a substantial period the conviction is , for that reason alone , unsafe . He adds , of course , that in this particular case it was a policeman who was in that position . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Discussing the role of Officer M , the court noted that :", "\u201c The officer in question was a serving police officer . He was a member of the investigating team of police officers which had conducted the enquiry into this case . That was a team which had assembled the evidence , taken the statements , and no doubt planned the investigation . He was , formally speaking , a witness in the case , in the sense that he had made CARDINAL single paragraph statements recording taking possession of some of the close circuit television tapes and he had also made an entirely uncontroversial statement relating to the taking of a mouth swab sample for DNA analysis from CARDINAL of the other accused ... There was no hint of question about the formal statements that he had made . He had not been called as a witness . His credibility was not in any sense in issue . He was a member of the investigating team , but this was not a case in which there was any challenge to the credibility or propriety of any of the police officers . This was not that kind of a case . There was no challenge whatever to the manner of investigation . The issue at the trial was what the evidence , which the police were accepted properly to have gathered , did or did not prove . \u201d", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings , ORG had been invited to receive a witness statement from Officer M which had not been seen by the applicant or his lawyers . However , it concluded on this matter ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c ... we do not think that we should be invited to receive partial evidence of what occurred . We are certainly satisfied that no further enquiry , for example of jurors , would in a case of this kind be proper \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The court examined the trial transcript and , despite the absence of any recorded assent from the applicant 's junior counsel to the jury 's viewing of the ORG footage in the presence of Officer M , stated that it had absolutely no doubt that assent to the presence of Officer M while the jury viewed the ORG footage was given by all counsel concerned , referring to the various , non - verbal manners of expressing assent in such situations .", "CARDINAL . The court agreed that a fair trial required that a jury should not be improperly influenced during its deliberations . The ORG observed that this was not a case where any bias , or apparent bias , was in question . The question was whether the conviction was safe , and in particular whether the unusual course taken meant that there was an unacceptable risk that the jury may have come under improper extraneous influence after the close of evidence in the case . The court accepted that this would include an inquiry into whether there was such appearance of that possibility that a fair minded , independent observer would conclude that there was a real danger or a real possibility of the jury 's decision being compromised by external influence .", "CARDINAL . The court found ( at paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c In DATE our system proceeds upon the basis that jurors can be trusted to heed the very careful injunctions which are given to them throughout the trial process , to try the case upon the evidence heard in court alone and to be scrupulous in not discussing the case with anybody outside their number . Such directions are conventionally given by judges at the outset of the trial . They will have been foreshadowed before that by the instruction given to jurors on attending court . They are always repeated at later stages of the trial and they are invariably endorsed at time of separation , if that necessity arises . Quite apart from that , some jurors need transport for various reasons ; sometimes , but not always , of security . Drivers who are not operating under a bailiff 's oath , hotel staff where appropriate , and many others have dealings with jurors who are in retirement . Once again , the system proceeds on the basis that the jurors treat their task conscientiously and can be trusted to obey the oath that they have taken and not to allow any possibility of extraneous influence to compromise the integrity of their discussions as a group of CARDINAL . The experience of trial judges up and down the country demonstrates that in all but a tiny handful of cases that trust is well placed . Jurors approach what is a difficult and often anxious task with a remarkable sense of duty .", "Now to accept the risk which thus arises of influence from someone unknown and unconnected with the case is not , of course , the same as positively to permit DATE person to be present with the jury after it has retired and whilst it is reviewing part of the evidence in the case . If , therefore , there were in this case an unacceptable risk of compromise to the integrity of the jury 's discussions , the modern practice as to the separation of juries during retirement would not necessarily save it . What the modern practice does , however , is to demonstrate the recognition of the fact that the safeguard of the integrity of the jury system lies in the respect that jurors have for the serious oath that they have taken , reinforced by the directions and warnings that they are given by trial judges , rather than in requiring formal rules attempting to insulate them from contact with the outside world . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the approach adopted in the present case occurred with the authority of the judge and with the consent of all parties , although it emphasised that no question arose as to the applicant 's right to a fair trial being waived . Such a right could only be waived after a full investigation of the facts , in particular as to whether the applicant was fully apprised of the options available . However , the court considered that the agreement of the judge and counsel to the approach adopted was relevant when assessing whether a fair minded observer would have been of the view that there was , as a result of the decision , an unacceptable risk of the jury 's discussions being compromised .", "CARDINAL . The court further referred to the \u201c careful direction \u201d given to the jury that there was to be no communication between them and the officer operating the equipment except for the purposes of finding the correct place on the video . The court noted ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c He directed them , as we have recorded , that they were to preserve their own discussions of what they had seen until they were in private . That direction came on top of , we are quite sure , conventional directions to the jury of the kind which we have already mentioned that is to say as to the necessity to try the case on the evidence , and , on many occasions , to be scrupulous to avoid discussing the case with anybody outside their number . For the reasons which we have explained , the modern practice is to trust jurors to obey injunctions of this kind . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court noted that the suggestion mooted before the trial judge of having a jury bailiff present demonstrated that there could be no absolute prohibition on contact with the jury . It further observed that there was no indication that the jury had been in any way inhibited by the presence of the police officer : they spent considerable time viewing the recordings . In any event , they continued to view the recordings alone TIME and clearly gave further consideration to them .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court considered it significant that the jury had convicted the applicant of attempted murder but acquitted of attempted murder his coaccused , GPE , who was also directly affected by the ORG evidence . The significance was that :", "\u201c ... the jury arrived , after prolonged deliberation , at discriminating verdicts . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court concluded ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c We are satisfied that on the facts of this case , whether or not what occurred should have happened DATE and we will come to that in a moment \u2013 the hypothetical informed and fair minded observer would be aware of all the factors to which we have called attention and he would , we are satisfied , on the facts of this case not believe that there was a real danger , or a real possibility , that the jury 's deliberations had been improperly influenced by an external individual . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the approach adopted to the viewing of the video evidence as a matter of principle , the court stated ( at paragraphs CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c We add this . Although in this case we are satisfied that no harm was done , we firmly suggest that this is a course which is not followed in future with or without the consent of the parties . We are alive to CARDINAL considerations which troubled those who were concerned in this case and we understand how it came about that they resulted in the judge doing what he did with the consent of all the parties . We do not , however , think that anybody needed to be concerned that a jury would betray its thinking by identifying a piece of recording that it wanted to see again . Jurors commonly ask questions on all manner of topics . Some of them call for the jury to be reminded of a particular area of evidence . We do not believe that anybody who has any experience of jury trials supposes that anything can be read into the questions which a jury asks . Such a question may come from all jurors or from one . It may come because the evidence is regarded by someone as of great importance or it may come because the jury collectively thinks it is irrelevant but wants to be sure .", "The second concern , however , namely that the jury ought to be able to view real evidence of this kind , and discuss it as it views it , is of much greater significance . The breadth of close circuit television coverage in places public and private is nowadays so extensive that juries are more and more presented with evidence of this kind . They also have recorded evidence very often in cases of recorded surveillance . There are other examples , of course , as well . It seems to us that it should be regarded as the plain duty of any party , ORG or defence , which is proposing to rely on such recorded evidence to ensure that there is provided equipment not only to play the recording in court , but also such as the jury can use in its retiring room during its retirement . They must , we are quite satisfied , as jurors be entitled to review precisely the same material as has been put in evidence in court . The judge in this case , we are satisfied , was absolutely right not to permit them to be given a substitute poorer quality ORG recording . If the necessary equipment can be provided in any particular court by agreement as to compatibility of machinery between parties and the court , then so much the better . The ultimate responsibility , however , for the presentation of evidence lies not with the court , but with the parties seeking to adduce it . It is not desirable that equipment should be provided which can only be used in open court , because although it may turn out to be possible to proceed as was done here on DATE of viewing , that will often not be possible , and in many courts the courtroom will by then be in use in the next trial . If in the last resort it really is the case that the recorded material simply is incapable of being played on any machinery which the jury can take into the retiring room -- and we take leave to doubt that that will ever be so with a little forethought -- then we think that the normal course should be followed and in that exceptional case any replaying for the jury during retirement ought to take place in open court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was denied leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of ORG in PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , Lord Hope of PERSON endorsed a judgment of ORG , which took into consideration the jurisprudence of this Court , on the question of apparent bias and concluded that :", "\u201c The question is whether the fair - minded and informed observer , having considered the facts , would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In PERSON v Secretary of ORG for ORG and Another ( GPE ) [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , ORG gave further guidance as to the attributes of the \u201c fair - minded and informed observer \u201d . Lord Hope of PERSON explained ( at paragraphs CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c The observer who is fair - minded is the sort of person who always reserves judgment on every point until she has seen and fully understood both sides of the argument . She is not unduly sensitive or suspicious ... Her approach must not be confused with that of the person who has brought the complaint . The ' real possibility ' test ensures that there is this measure of detachment . The assumptions that the complainer makes are not to be attributed to the observer unless they can be justified objectively . But she is not complacent either . She knows that fairness requires that a judge must be , and must be seen to be , unbiased . She knows that judges , like anybody else , have their weaknesses . She will not shrink from the conclusion , if it can be justified objectively , that things that they have said or done or associations that they have formed may make it difficult for them to judge the case before them impartially .", "Then there is the attribute that the observer is ' informed ' . It makes the point that , before she takes a balanced approach to any information she is given , she will take the trouble to inform herself on all matters that are relevant . She is the sort of person who takes the trouble to read the text of an article as well as the headlines . She is able to put whatever she has read or seen into its overall social , political or geographical context . She is fair - minded , so she will appreciate that the context forms an important part of the material which she must consider before passing judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In Goby v Wetherill [ DATE ] CARDINAL PERSON , a civil case , the town sergeant , acting as an usher in the county court , had , through what was described as an excess of zeal , retired into the retiring room with the jury and remained there for TIME whilst they were considering their verdict . ORG held that the action vitiated the verdict , which could not stand .", "CARDINAL . In R v ORG [ DATE ] Crim LR CARDINAL , a criminal case , CARDINAL uniformed police officers acting as jury bailiffs had retired with the jury and remained there throughout the time when the verdict was being arrived at , apparently in ignorance of the fact that it was something that they ought not to do . ORG allowed an appeal against conviction , holding that the retirement of strangers with the jury during their deliberations was an irregularity which was difficult to cure , even if , as in that case , an assurance had been received from the foreman that the bailiffs had taken no part in the deliberations and had not influenced the members of the jury in their decision .", "CARDINAL . In R v PERSON ( DATE ) ORG R DATE , ORG upheld a conviction where the clerk of court had been instructed to go to the jury room and ask them to put a question in writing . The court concluded that it was satisfied that the clerk had not , himself , entered the jury room but :", "\u201c Even if he had , we do not think that that would have been in itself an irregularity , because the court always has power to allow somebody to make a communication to the jury , if it is a communication proper to be made , and if it is made by the direction of the court . Everybody knows that the oath that is given to a jury bailiff is that he ' shall suffer no person to speak to them nor speak to them [ himself ] unless it be to ask whether they are agreed upon a verdict , without leave of the court ' . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the subsequent case of R v PERSON ( DATE ) CARDINAL ORG R DATE , an important part of the evidence was in the form of audio recordings . With the authority of the judge and by consent of counsel , a scheme was devised to enable the jury to hear the tapes in their jury room . The jury were supplied with a loudspeaker in their room which was connected to the recording and transmitting equipment in the courtroom . Anyone from the defence or prosecution could sit in the courtroom and observe the proceedings . The technician in the courtroom who was in charge of the equipment had been sworn as a jury bailiff and when the jury required some part of the tapes to be played , the foreman of the jury would instruct the technician by CARDINAL - way radio . The court , dismissing the appeal against conviction , concluded that :", "\u201c ... in the special circumstances of this case what was done was done by order of the court and with the consent of the parties . As matters exist at the moment we do not see what other method could easily , properly and practically have been adopted to overcome the difficulties which obviously existed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Upon responding to a summons , jury members are sent a leaflet called \u201c Your Guide to Jury Service \u201d . The leaflet explains that jurors ' discussions are private and that jurors should not discuss any aspects of the trial with anyone other than fellow jurors . It sets out that the verdict must be that of the jurors alone and reminds jurors that their role is to reach a verdict on the evidence presented in the court room at trial . The leaflet also notes that it is an offence for anyone outside the jury to try and influence them .", "CARDINAL .
