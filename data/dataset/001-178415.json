At a meeting before the ORG on DATE the \u201c NORP \u201d Attorney General \u2019s representative stated that he had still not received a report concerning the properties that were being claimed by the applicant and he was therefore not in a position to provide an opinion .", "CARDINAL . Further meetings before the ORG scheduled for DATE and CARDINAL DATE were adjourned for the same reason .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , the applicant instructed a law firm to represent him in the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the \u201c NORP \u201d Attorney General submitted his opinion concerning the applicant \u2019s claim . The opinion relied on an affidavit by the \u201c GPE \u201d Director of ORG which stated that \u2212 according to their information \u2212 plots CARDINAL and CARDINAL had been owned by the ORG company in DATE , and plot CARDINAL by PERSON ( the applicant \u2019s mother ) . In the opinion the view was also expressed that the applicant \u2019s claim was excessive .", "CARDINAL . At a directions hearing on DATE the applicant \u2019s representative undertook to provide photographs of the properties and asked the \u201c NORP \u201d Attorney General to provide the relevant land registry search documents for the properties in question . The \u201c GPE \u201d Attorney General \u2019s representative asked the applicant to provide birth certificates for him and his parents , certificates from the head of the local community ( mukhtar ) attesting that the persons who owned the properties in DATE were the applicant \u2019s parents , and documents concerning the history of ownership of the properties after DATE and attesting that there were no liabilities attaching to them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s representative produced the requested documents on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At a preliminary hearing before the ORG on DATE , the \u201c NORP \u201d Attorney General \u2019s representative and ORG informed the applicant and the ORG that no offer would be made in respect of the family house ( plot CARDINAL ) unless the claims made in respect of the CARDINAL commercial properties ( plots CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) were withdrawn . The applicant \u2019s representatives stated that they were trying to find a solution with the \u201c GPE \u201d authorities concerning issues relating to companies and mortgages . They therefore asked for a DATE \u2019s adjournment in order to monitor developments on the matter and stated that if a solution was not reached they would withdraw the request relating to the CARDINAL commercial properties .", "CARDINAL . At a meeting before the ORG on DATE the applicant \u2019s representative explained that they were working on the amendments of the relevant law with the \u201c NORP \u201d authorities and asked for a further adjournment of the examination of the case .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives forwarded further necessary documents to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives submitted a letter to the ORG stating that , without prejudice , they were withdrawing the applicant \u2019s claim in respect of the CARDINAL commercial properties ( plots CARDINAL . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . They explained that before DATE the CARDINAL properties had been registered as the property of a company whose shareholders were the applicant \u2019s parents . Thereafter , the company had terminated its activities and its properties had been transferred to the NORP children ( the applicant and his brothers ) . Later , the company had been liquidated and now no longer existed as a legal entity . The applicant \u2019s representatives also submitted that as the transfer of properties had occurred after DATE and as the relationship between the applicant and the company was not defined as CARDINAL of legal succession within the meaning of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the legislation did not provide the applicant with the possibility of submitting a claim for compensation for that property before the ORG . They considered that this was the reason why the \u201c GPE \u2019s \u201d representative had refused to make an offer for the compensation claim unless the CARDINAL commercial properties were withdrawn . Lastly , they argued that their decision to withdraw the claim was in line with the \u201c GPE \u201d High Administrative Court \u2019s practice in similar cases ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , which showed that the ORG could not be considered as a remedy in relation to a claim concerning the CARDINAL commercial properties .", "CARDINAL .
