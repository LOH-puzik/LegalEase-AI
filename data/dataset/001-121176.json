NORP The applicant , ORG , is a private NORP broadcasting company ( \u201c the applicant company \u201d ) , that was set up in DATE and has its registered office in GPE . The applicant company was represented before the Court by PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which was entrusted with regulating the licensing and monitoring the activities of private television and radio companies , put out calls to tender for band CARDINAL , bands CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , bands CARDINAL and DATE , and band CARDINAL . The applicant company submitted bids for all of the above bands .", "CARDINAL . The ORG awarded all of the licences to other bidders .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company instituted proceedings in ORG against the ORG , contesting the results of the tenders . All the claims were dismissed in the final instance by ORG on DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company and its chairman , Mr PERSON , lodged an application with the ORG ( application no . CARDINAL ) against GPE under LAW . The applicants alleged that the refusal of the state authorities to award a broadcasting licence amounted to a violation of their freedom of expression under LAW . In particular they submitted that the ORG was obliged by law to inform them of the reasons for denying the applicant company a licence . The mere presence of the applicant company \u2019s representative during the presentation of competitive bids and a points - based vote which , moreover , indicated only a total score , did not constitute proper provision of a reasoned decision . The ORG \u2019s letters announcing the outcome of the calls to tender could not be considered as notification of reasons either , since they simply announced the relevant decisions without stating the grounds for them . According to the applicants this rendered the licensing process arbitrary and not as prescribed by law .", "CARDINAL . The application was considered by the ORG , which gave judgment on DATE ( ORG and Movsesyan v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . The ORG first considered that the application , in so far as it concerned the second applicant , was incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the LAW within the meaning of LAW , and therefore limited its examination of the complaints raised in the application to those which concerned the applicant company . In that respect , the Court held that there had been a breach of LAW as the interferences with the applicant company \u2019s freedom to impart information and ideas did not meet the Convention requirement of lawfulness . The ORG noted in particular that a procedure which did not require a licensing body to justify its decisions did not provide adequate protection against arbitrary interference by a public authority with the fundamental right to freedom of expression ( ibid . , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the application of LAW , the ORG awarded the applicant company LAW for non - pecuniary damages together with LAW in legal costs and expenses for the proceedings before ORG ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of the ORG \u2019s judgment , the applicant company applied to ORG for the final CARDINAL judgments given at domestic level to be reviewed on the basis of a new circumstance .", "CARDINAL . In its CARDINAL decisions of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applications to reopen the proceedings . It held in particular that :", "\u201c The complaint of the [ applicant ] Company to ORG was about the failure of the ORG to give reasons for not recognising the [ applicant ] Company as a winner in the competitions held by the ORG , and ORG merely considered and found that the lack of such reasoning was in conflict with the requirements of LAW . Whereas , in [ this ] appeal the applicant [ company ] requested that the decisions recognising other companies as winners be declared void and a new competition be opened . The [ applicant ] Company based the above - mentioned requests on the principle of \u201c restitutio in integrum \u201d .", "The above principle implies restoration of the situation existing before the breach , that is , restoration of everything the person had prior to the violation of his right . However , the complaints raised in the [ applicant ] ORG requests , namely about declaring null and void the decisions on recognising other companies as winners in the competition , recognising [ the applicant company ] as a winner and granting it a licence can not be deemed a restoration of the situation existing before the violation , since the judgment of ORG solely provided that the ORG had failed to reason its decision on not recognising the [ applicant ] Company as a winner . The failure to reason the refusal does not automatically mean that the decision in respect of the winning company should be declared void and a new competition opened since the rights of the [ applicant ] Company ( LAW ) were violated as a result of the failure to provide reasons for not recognising it as the winner and not as a result of recognising the other company as the winner in the competition ...", "... it is not always possible to repair the consequences of violations established by ORG by providing compensation , and the respondent state may be required to adopt individual or general measures in respect of the applicant . In particular , ORG may require a new examination of the case , as it did in the case of PERSON , PERSON and PERSON v. GPE of DATE .", "Meanwhile ... it is necessary to mention that the application of such measures becomes binding only when ORG directly requires the application of such measures . The judgment of ORG in this case , besides the obligation to provide compensation , only mentioned that the unreasoned decisions of the Commission were unacceptable . ORG therefore finds that the claims of the applicant , such as annulment of the decision on recognising the other company as the winner and granting a licence are not in line with the logic of the judgment of ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged an application with ORG seeking to annul LAW applied in its case by ORG .", "CARDINAL . By its decision of CARDINAL DATE no . DCC-CARDINAL ORG terminated the proceedings . In doing so it held in particular that LAW had already been recognised as unconstitutional in its decision no . ORG and no law had been adopted to bring it into conformity with the LAW .", "CARDINAL . Relying on the decision of ORG , the applicant company lodged CARDINAL appeals with ORG seeking the reopening of the cases on the ground of new circumstance , namely the decision of ORG of DATE ( see above \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted CARDINAL decisions dismissing the applicant \u2019s appeals . In doing so , ORG in particular stated :", "\u201c ... relying on the decision no . PERSON of ORG ... ORG notes that its decision of DATE is to be reviewed .", "At the same time ORG states that Article CARDINAL sets out the types of decisions to be taken by the court in the event of revision based on new circumstances , which means that the decision ... no . DCC-CARDINAL relates [ solely ] to the procedural norm applied by ORG in its decision of DATE and does not concern the reasons for dismissing the claims of the [ applicant ] Company from a legal point of view ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
