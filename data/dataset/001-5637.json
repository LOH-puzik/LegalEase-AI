FRANCE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["Mr [ Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric ] Ponsetti , who was born in DATE , lives at PERSON and practises as a bailiff . PERSON [ NORP ] ORG was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is a practising notary . Both are NORP nationals . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a member of the PERSON d\u2019\u00c9tat and ORG .", "The facts , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant failed to file income tax returns for DATE despite receiving demands to do so from the tax authorities . In DATE the tax authorities conducted an audit of his accounts and assessed him to MONEY ( ORG ) in unpaid income tax for the first of DATE , ORG CARDINAL for the second and ORG CARDINAL for the third . They sought recovery of those amounts , to which on DATE , pursuant to LAW , they added default interest and surcharges at the rate of PERCENT of the sum due for DATE ( namely ORG ) and of PERCENT for DATE ( amounting to ORG CARDINAL and FRF CARDINAL ) .", "At the same time the tax authorities lodged a criminal complaint against Mr GPE alleging tax evasion and sought to be joined as a civil party to the proceedings .", "The applicant was charged with \u201c having at Mont\u00e9limar , during DATE , fraudulently evaded assessment of his income tax liability and evaded partial payment of such tax by wilfully omitting to file his return within the prescribed time , by concealing parts of his income liable to tax , by arranging his insolvency or obstructing the collection of the tax by other subterfuges , or by acting in any other fraudulent manner , in the instant case by omitting to file income tax returns for DATE , thus evading payment of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in income tax , being ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for DATE , ORG CARDINAL for DATE and ORG CARDINAL for DATE \u201d , an offence under LAW .", "On DATE , ORG convicted the applicant and imposed a CARDINAL months\u2019 suspended prison sentence and fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL on him . In reaching its verdict it stated : \u201c ... by failing to file income tax returns for DATE , PERSON committed the offence of which he stands accused of tax evasion , contrary to LAW ... \u201d .", "The applicant and the prosecution appealed to ORG . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction and increased the sentence to a suspended term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of ORG CARDINAL . It reached its decision on the following ground :", "\u201c ... the intentional element of the offence of tax evasion is sufficiently made out by the fact that the accused failed to make the tax returns necessary for assessing his liability to tax when :", "\u2013 he was perfectly aware of that requirement , if only as a result of the DATE audit ;", "\u2013 he had been given due notice before the audit to make the returns for each of DATE concerned ;", "\u2013 whatever the truth of his computing problems , the relevant information was available to him , as he had duly filed the DATE turnover figures for the calculation of GPE on time and therefore had only to deduct his professional liabilities in order to determine and declare his income ;", "\u2013 it is plain that he has used the pretext of computing difficulties to draw out matters as long as possible in order to plead the statute of limitations from which he has already partially benefited in DATE .", "The tax authorities\u2019 decision regarding at what level on the scale of surcharges for unpaid tax to impose DATE penalty on PERSON as a result of his conduct is , in law , a separate issue from the decision of the criminal court on whether the intentional element of the offence of tax evasion has been made out ... \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG on the ground that there had been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW in so far as it guarantees the non bis in idem principle . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal in a judgment which read as follows :", "\u201c ... PERSON argued in his defence that as he had already been subjected to tax penalties for the same matters , no further penalties could be imposed on him .", "In rejecting the accused \u2019s submissions and sentencing him to a term of imprisonment and a fine under LAW , ORG stated that the nature and purpose of prosecution for tax evasion , which is aimed at curbing the unlawful avoidance of tax , are different from those pursued by the tax authorities when conducting a tax audit with a view to collecting unpaid tax .", "Having regard to that reasoning , this ORG is satisfied that ORG gave a valid basis for its decision .", "In accordance with the reservations made by GPE regarding LAW No . CARDINAL , the non bis in idem rule enshrined in LAW No . CARDINAL to LAW is applicable only to offences which under NORP law fall within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts and does not prevent tax penalties being imposed concurrently with penalties by the criminal courts .", "It follows that the ground of appeal must be rejected ... \u201d", "The applicant has since DATE been in practice as a notary in Bezons . From DATE , he failed to make his DATE value - added tax ( VAT ) returns with the result that his activity was included on the audit programme of the Val d\u2019Oise d\u00e9partement tax office by the administrative department . The audit , which concerned ORG , covered DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE to DATE .", "A notice advising that the accounts would be inspected was sent to the applicant on DATE and the audit took place at his office between CARDINAL June and DATE . The arrears to be paid by the applicant were assessed on the basis of ORG shown to be due by returns lodged during the audit . They came to a total of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . A demand for that amount was sent to the applicant on DATE . In addition to the ORG , the applicant was required to pay the surcharges laid down by LAW for failure to file returns . They amounted to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( namely PERCENT of the total ) .", "On DATE the tax office of the Val d\u2019Oise d\u00e9partement lodged a complaint with ORG with the approval of ORG dated DATE . The tax authorities , represented by ORG the Val d\u2019Oise d\u00e9partement , lodged a request to be joined as a civil party to the proceedings .", "The applicant was charged with \u201c having at ORG , DATE and DATE , fraudulently evaded assessment of his liability to tax , namely value - added tax , and evaded its payment in whole or in part , by wilfully concealing part of the sums , namely ORG , liable to such tax , on which was due ORG CARDINAL in unpaid VAT ... \u201d", "Before ORG the applicant pleaded the non bis in idem rule , arguing that , since tax penalties had already been imposed on him he could not be prosecuted in the criminal courts for matters arising out of the same facts .", "On DATE ORG dismissed that procedural objection in a judgment which read as follows :", "\u201c It is common ground that an estoppel per rem judicatam constitutes an obstacle to a further prosecution if there is identity of legal basis , subject - matter and parties with a previous prosecution that has ended with an unappealable decision .", "In the instant case , even supposing that the tax proceedings resulted in a decision that could be described as criminal in character , the administrative proceedings involve different parties , a different subject - matter and a different legal basis .", "Firstly , there is no identity of parties between tax proceedings and criminal proceedings as the public prosecutor , who plays no role in the administrative proceedings , acts as the prosecuting party in the court proceedings .", "In the administrative proceedings , however , it is the tax authorities who instigate matters .", "In addition , the subject - matter and legal basis in tax proceedings and in criminal proceedings are different .", "Whereas the purpose of administrative proceedings is to obtain compensation only for the loss sustained by the tax authorities through the non - payment of taxes , the function of criminal proceedings is to remedy the harm caused to society by the actions of the perpetrator of the fraud .", "There is a radical difference in the nature of tax penalties and criminal penalties , as the former may be imposed following a mere unintentional mistake by the taxpayer , without there being any additional harm to society .", "The offence of tax evasion , however , causes additional harm which affects the whole fabric of society . Reparation for that harm is sought by the public prosecutor on behalf of society ; thus , criminal proceedings and tax proceedings have a different purpose .", "That difference in character is likewise demonstrated by the different statutory bases for tax penalties and criminal prosecutions ... \u201d", "As regards the merits , ORG stated \u201c ... in any event , the fact that notices were served on the accused from DATE onwards enables the arguments relating to the absence of intent or to improbable implied agreements with the tax authorities to be discounted ... \u201d .", "ORG found the applicant guilty of the offences of which he was accused and sentenced him to , inter alia , CARDINAL months\u2019 suspended imprisonment and a fine of ORG CARDINAL .", "The applicant , the public prosecutor and the tax authorities appealed against that judgment . Referring to LAW , the applicant repeated his arguments based on the non bis in idem rule . On DATE ORG rejected that argument in a judgment in which it stated :", "\u201c ... the case - law of ORG ... does not require the court concerned to treat fiscal administrative penalties as criminal penalties but to examine whether under domestic law any of the aims of the penalty for the violation of a general rule concerning all citizens \u2013 irrespective of how such penalty is classified under domestic law \u2013 is at once preventive or deterrent and punitive rather than the reparation of damage for the purposes of LAW of LAW ] . That LAW provides : \u2018 In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him , everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [ a ] ... tribunal.\u2019", "In practice , [ the applicant ] could have raised the \u2018 criminal\u2019 character of the penalties imposed for tax evasion by seeking a review ( which he did not do in the instant case ) before a court , namely the administrative court , which would try the issue of the penalties fairly . As matters stand , the case - law of ORG regarding the interpretation of LAW ] requires no more than that .", "Secondly , [ as regards LAW No . CARDINAL ] ... GPE has made the following reservation regarding the application [ of LAW ] : \u2018 ... only those offences which under LANGUAGE law fall within the jurisdiction of the NORP criminal courts may be regarded as offences within the meaning of LAW .", "Fiscal penalties and criminal penalties are different in nature , even though fiscal penalties , which are exclusively monetary , have a penal character for the purposes of the application of LAW of LAW ] . Fiscal penalties are imposed by the authorities subject to review by the administrative courts whereas criminal penalties are imposed by the ordinary courts and may be other than financial , with sentences ranging from alternatives to prison to imprisonment itself and the imposition of additional penalties , none of which are available to the tax authorities .", "Proceedings for the collection of tax and penalties or , as in the instant case , for challenging interest or tax penalties are not criminal proceedings ; there is no determination of \u2018 a criminal PERSON for the purposes of either domestic law or of the international convention ratified , with a reservation , by GPE .", "A criminal prosecution for tax evasion and administrative proceedings for the assessment of the base for tax , interest and penalties ( whatever the stage , including the contentious stage , reached in the contemplated proceedings ) are , both as regards their nature and subject - matter , different from each other and mutually independent .", "Thus , for the purposes of LAW [ No . CARDINAL ] , in the instant case neither the administrative proceedings ( which can not be classified as criminal ) nor the nature of the administrative financial penalty ( whose preventive and repressive character is relevant only as regards the requirement that the fundamental guarantees provided by LAW ] should be applied ) , allow Mr Chesnel to affirm that he has previously been prosecuted in criminal proceedings solely on the ground that penalties were imposed on him in connection with unpaid ORG pursuant to LAW . That is because the statutory basis is different from the one used in criminal proceedings , namely ORG DATE and CARDINAL of LAW .", "The non bis in idem rule can not be applied in the present case . Consequently , Mr ORG can not assert that he has been prosecuted twice on the same basis . ORG upholds the decision of the court below to reject that argument , but does so on different grounds ... \u201d", "On the merits , ORG upheld the impugned judgment finding that the applicant was guilty of the offence of tax evasion , and confirmed each of the penalties imposed by ORG .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . His sole ground of appeal was that there had been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal on the following ground :", "\u201c ... ORG rejected the submissions [ of the applicant ] that , as a fiscal penalty had already been imposed on him , he could not be prosecuted for the same offence , and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment and fine pursuant to LAW . In so doing , it stated that a criminal prosecution for tax evasion , which concerns criminal conduct , and administrative proceedings for the determination of the base of the tax , plus interest and penalties , are different in nature and purpose and independent of each other .", "Having regard to that reasoning , this ORG is satisfied that ORG gave a valid basis for its decision .", "The prohibition on CARDINAL convictions for the same offence contained in LAW ... , is , according to the reservations made by GPE on signing the LAW , applicable only to offences which under NORP law are within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts and does not preclude fiscal penalties being imposed concurrently with the penalties imposed by the criminal courts ... \u201d", "The relevant provisions of LAW are as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Where a natural or juristic person or an association under an obligation to make a return or to lodge a document supplying information needed for the calculation of the base of any of the taxes , duties , charges , dues or other sums assessed or collected by ORG or their payment fails to make such return or lodge such document within the time - limit , interest for late payment calculated in accordance with LAW PERCENT surcharge shall be added to the tax liability imposed on the person concerned or assessed on the basis of the return or document lodged out of time .", "...", "CARDINAL .
