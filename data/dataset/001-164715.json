Mr GPE ( \u201c the first applicant \u201d ) was born in DATE . Mr ORG ( \u201c the second applicant \u201d ) was born in DATE . They live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants have formed a same - sex couple since DATE . They lived in GPE , with the status of unmarried couple , until DATE , when they decided to settle in GPE on grounds of the first applicant \u2019s poor health .", "CARDINAL . During their first period of residence in GPE the second applicant had a student \u2019s temporary residence permit . He subsequently applied for a residence permit for family reasons , under LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ... .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the chief of the GPE police rejected his application on the ground that the statutory criteria were not satisfied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed on the basis of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , requesting that the second applicant be issued with a residence permit for family reasons .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the applicants were recognised as a couple in GPE , the first applicant having been issued with a residence permit in that country for family reasons in his capacity as an unmarried partner . The court found that the applicants\u2019 status as an unmarried couple was not contrary to NORP public policy , as de facto couples received social and legal recognition in the NORP system . In the court \u2019s view , LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ... had to be interpreted in conformity with the principles established by LAW , which meant that a same - sex cohabiting partner should be regarded as a \u201c member of the family \u201d of the NORP national and thus entitled to obtain a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the right asserted by the second applicant also derived from ORG and CARDINAL of Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of QUANTITY DATE of ORG and of the Council ... , which recognised the right of the partner of a citizen of ORG ( ORG ) to obtain a residence permit where the existence of a durable relationship was duly attested .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Minister of ORG appealed against the judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the appeal . It observed that the GPE authorities had recognised that the applicants had the status of \u201c unmarried cohabiting partners \u201d and not that of \u201c members of the same family \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG found , first , that the lower court \u2019s recommended interpretation of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE , according to which the \u201c cohabiting partner \u201d was regarded as a \u201c member of the family \u201d , was not compatible with the NORP legal system , which , according to the court , ascribed a different scope and meaning to those CARDINAL legal concepts . Secondly , ORG pointed out that ORG had repeatedly held that a relationship based on cohabitation alone , and lacking stability and legal certainty , could not in any circumstances be regarded as a legitimate family based on marriage .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that GPE law was not compatible with NORP public policy on the grounds , firstly , that it regarded persons of the same sex as \u201c cohabiting partners \u201d and , furthermore , that it could be construed as conferring the status of \u201c family members \u201d on them for the purposes of granting them a residence permit . Lastly , it added that neither NORP law , particularly Directive No CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC ... , nor the provisions of LAW , obliged the GPE to recognise same - sex relationships .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , the text of which was deposited with the registry on CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed first that , according to the terms of LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ... , the concept of \u201c family member \u201d extended only to spouses , minor children , adult children who were not self - supporting for health reasons , and dependent relatives who lacked adequate support in their country of origin . It pointed out that as ORG had , moreover , ruled out the possibility of extending to cohabiting partners the protection granted to members of a legitimate family , the LAW did not require an extensive interpretation of LAW cited above .", "CARDINAL . ORG also considered that Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention did not require such an interpretation either . In its view , those provisions left a wide margin of appreciation to the GPE regarding the choice of means of exercising the rights they guaranteed , particularly in the area of immigration control . ORG added that there had been no discrimination on grounds of the applicants\u2019 sexual orientation in the present case . It observed in that connection that the non - eligibility of unmarried partners for a residence permit for family reasons applied to opposite - sex couples as well as same - sex partners .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , it held that NORP Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC ... , which concerned the right of GPE citizens to move freely within the territory of the Member GPE other than their ORG of origin , did not apply to the present case , which concerned family reunification with an NORP national resident in his own country .", "CARDINAL . After being notified of ORG judgment , the applicants left GPE in DATE . They moved to the GPE , where the second applicant was issued with a DATE residence permit on DATE as a de facto partner in a long - term relationship with an ORG national .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants married in GPE . They stated that they had chosen to marry for personal reasons and not in order to obtain a residence permit , as the GPE authorities had already issued CARDINAL to the second applicant . They added that the marriage contracted in the GPE did not allow them to live together in GPE . On DATE the second applicant obtained a second DATE residence permit in the GPE , valid until DATE .", "..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
