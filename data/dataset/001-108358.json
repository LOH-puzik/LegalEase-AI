His application was lodged on DATE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr T. Neugschwendtner , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG . ORG were given notice of the application , and they informed the ORG on DATE that they would not exercise their right to intervene in the present case .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant came to GPE in DATE . On DATE he was taken into custody on suspicion of drug trafficking .", "On DATE an NORP court convicted the applicant of offences under LAW ( GPE ) and of attempted use of forged documents , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "It appears that on DATE an exclusion order of unlimited duration ( unbefristetes PERSON ) was issued against the applicant .", "In DATE ORG requested the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE for the execution of CARDINAL sentences - one from DATE for a robbery , and another from DATE for severe bodily harm - and for further criminal proceedings against him on the basis of an indictment of DATE issued by ORG office in LOC relating to charges of dealing in illegal drugs .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON f\u00fcr PERSON ) declared the extradition unlawful .", "On the basis of country reports from the asylum file ( see below ) , which included a report by ORG including GPE , dated DATE ) , a report by ORG on asylum issues regarding GPE and GPE without GPE , dated DATE ) and by ORG GPE and GPE , Country Reports on Human Rights Practices DATE , dated DATE ) , ORG found that whereas the human rights situation in GPE had substantially improved since DATE , ill - treatment by the police could not be ruled out - in particular in prisons and during pre - trial detention . Furthermore , investigations into such ill - treatment were slow and ineffective . It also noted that statements made under duress and torture were still accepted as evidence in court proceedings .", "From the medical reports submitted during the asylum proceedings the court found it credible that the applicant had suffered ill - treatment by the police in GPE in DATE . The documentation showed that the applicant had been treated for DATE for new and acute injuries he had received during police questioning . He still bore CARDINAL - long scars on his right knee , CARDINAL - long scars on his right and left thigh and a CARDINAL - long scar on his left lower leg , which were consistent with his version of what had happened . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s complaints of ill - treatment had only been dealt with in GPE after a long delay , and the proceedings had finally been discontinued . Lastly , ORG had not commented on the events described by the applicant , although it had been explicitly requested to do so by the court .", "Thus , ORG found that even though the general conditions for extradition had been met , the applicant had been subjected to ill - treatment by the police during his detention in GPE in DATE and would continue to be at risk of such treatment . Thus , an extradition would constitute a violation not only of LAW , but also of the guarantees of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request for asylum .", "He claimed that he had been severely ill - treated and tortured by NORP police in DATE in order to obtain his confession to a robbery he had not committed . He had been arrested and taken to another village , where he had been tortured for TIME by police officers . He had been shot in the leg , beaten and suffered a spinal injury . Owing to severe bleeding , he was then taken to hospital . He was kept in custody for DATE .", "In DATE the applicant was convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .

With regard to the events in DATE , the applicant had lodged a complaint of ill - treatment with the public prosecutor and ORG . The applicant then tried to continue living in his home town in GPE , but maintained that he had been continually harassed by the police , and had finally left in DATE and travelled to GPE via GPE and GPE . He claimed that he would be subjected to ill - treatment should he be returned to GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( Bundesasylamt ) refused the applicant \u2019s asylum request and ordered his expulsion to GPE . It found that an isolated incident of ill - treatment by the police did not suffice to establish a substantiated risk of persecution or ill - treatment as required for an asylum claim to be successful . In that context it referred to the period the applicant had stayed in GPE after the attack , the time that had elapsed in GPE before he had lodged a request for asylum there , and the time which had elapsed since the event itself . On the basis of country reports about GPE it considered that there was no longer any real risk of systematic and manifest ill - treatment by police in GPE .", "The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision .", "On DATE ORG ( Asylgerichtshof ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal in the asylum proceedings .", "It noted that according to the information obtained from ORG in GPE , the chief of the police force in GPE , GPE , had been removed ( \u201c abgel\u00f6st \u201d ) from his post in DATE and apparently was now working as a lawyer . It further found that the applicant \u2019s statement about the events in GPE in DATE whilst he was in police custody and detention were credible , but concluded that owing to the time which had elapsed since the events and the general improvement of the security situation in GPE the applicant was no longer at risk of ill - treatment .", "With regard to the general human rights situation in GPE , ORG referred to reports by ORG and GPE , DATE ORG , dated DATE , and GPE , ORG DATE , dated DATE ) and to CARDINAL reports by ORG GPE and GPE , Country Report on Human Rights Practices DATE and DATE , dated DATE and DATE , respectively ) . It cited a report by ORG that noted a decrease in systematic police violence since DATE . However , especially in general and police detention , human rights violations could not be excluded , although they were directed not against political adversaries , but against criminal suspects . In some of those cases police officers had been suspended from active duty , and in a number of cases NORP courts had awarded damages to victims of ill - treatment ( Report on asylum issues regarding GPE and GPE , dated DATE ) . On the basis of the report of ORG , PERSON , on his visit to GPE in DATE ( dated DATE ) , ORG referred to the introduction of a legal framework for complaint procedures in cases of alleged police assault . Lastly , ORG stated that the length of time which had passed between the events in DATE and the asylum proceedings had led to the dismissal of the asylum request .", "With regard to the decision of ORG to declare the extradition unlawful , it found that after DATE following that decision the situation in GPE had further improved . Individual cases of police brutality could not change the overall picture of a much better security situation . It referred again to the country reports on which it had based its evaluation and noted that a ORG for ORG at ORG , and commissions in every region had been introduced to deal with complaints against the police . Lastly , ORG observed that it was not bound by the decision of ORG .", "The applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with ORG ) . On DATE ORG refused to deal with the applicant \u2019s complaint . That decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged the present application with the ORG and requested that an interim measure be granted . On DATE the ORG requested ORG to stay the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE until further notice , pursuant to Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of the ORG .", "ORG from CARDINAL to DATE for an assessment of the overall human rights situation , and published his report on that visit on DATE ( CommDH(CARDINAL)CARDINAL ) . With regard to ill - treatment by the police , he found that various sources had indicated that police ill - treatment had decreased in GPE since ORG on the Prevention of Torture had visited in DATE . While it now appeared that allegations of police violence were the exception rather than the rule , police violence had not yet been completely eradicated . NGOs and representatives from the legal community had pointed out that many people still failed to report incidents of violence for fear of retaliation by the police ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "An ORG had been established as a separate department within ORG by the new police act in DATE to deal with complaints regarding police misconduct . Furthermore , police misconduct was monitored by special commissions established in each of the CARDINAL regions of the Republic . These commissions consisted of CARDINAL members , namely a police officer , a representative of the Sector and a local citizen . DATE until DATE , the Sector had opened CARDINAL formal investigations against police officers , compared with CARDINAL in DATE alone . In the Commissioner \u2019s opinion , the police complaints mechanism was still in its infancy , and its impact in practice could not yet be gauged ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "ORG ( \u201c CPT \u201d ) visited GPE from DATE and published its report on DATE ( ORG ) . It stated that the number of allegations of ill - treatment by the police heard by the ORG \u2019s delegation in the course of the DATE visit was lower , and the ill - treatment alleged less severe , than during the first of the ORG \u2019s periodic visits , in DATE . However , the delegation did receive a number of allegations of physical ill - treatment ( consisting of punches , kicks , blows with a truncheon , blows with a thick book or with a wet , rolled newspaper , and handcuffing to fixed objects in a hyperextended position ) during questioning by police officers , with the aim of obtaining confessions or other information ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG welcomed the legislative and other measures taken to combat ill - treatment by the police . However , it concluded from the information gathered throughout its visit that continued determined action was needed to combat ill - treatment by the police ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . It recommended the systematic and ongoing training of the police , independent agents to investigate any complaints of misconduct , the introduction of procedural rules for judges and prosecutors dealing with complaints of ill - treatment by the police , and thorough record - keeping of medical examinations of newly - arrived remand prisoners ( pages CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "The Serbia DATE Progress Report of ORG ( ORG ) , published on DATE within the framework of the Enlargement Strategy DATE , noted with regard to civil and political rights that there had been only a small amount of progress in further improving the prevention of torture , ill - treatment and the fight against impunity . Police detention procedures were of great concern , as well as the lack of any internal and independent external oversight mechanisms . Additional efforts aimed at preventing any further cases of torture and ill - treatment were needed . The Deputy Ombudsman in charge of the protection of people deprived of their liberty was operational but still not fully effective ( see page CARDINAL ) . The report concluded by stating that overall , the constitutional framework providing for respect for civil and political rights was largely in place . However , full implementation and enforcement remained to be ensured . Further action by the authorities in combating violence of all types was needed ( page CARDINAL ) .", "In DATE ORG published its DATE Report , GPE DATE : Human Rights , Democracy and Violence . In its concluding remarks in the chapter titled \u201c Police : Dynamics without radical change \u201d , the ORG stated that during DATE no further significant steps for reform had been taken with regard to the police in GPE ; that the adoption of a new police act , which was required for the continuation of reforms , had not been announced ; that the police still very often abused their authority , and that there were numerous cases of police torture , especially in the interior of GPE ( see page CARDINAL ) .", "In its report for DATE , published in DATE , ORG acknowledged that ORG had achieved outstanding results and that it could be stated that DATE had been DATE for the NORP police since DATE . However , in the context of police work there were still many abuse cases involving police officers . Furthermore , ORG was withholding information of public importance and police work was not sufficiently transparent . It emphasised that future reform efforts would require the training of police personnel , especially with regard to human rights standards ( pages CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "In its DATE report for DATE , published in DATE , ORG concluded its chapter on the police by stating that although the number of criminal offences and abuses committed by police officers had been significantly lower compared to DATE , it was still very high . The fact that the number of criminal offences with elements of violence committed by police officers was PERCENT higher gave rise to particular concern . The report emphasised that the continuation of reforms and the positive trends in DATE would give rise to expectations that the NORP police would be able to provide full security to all citizens of GPE in the forthcoming period ( page CARDINAL ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
