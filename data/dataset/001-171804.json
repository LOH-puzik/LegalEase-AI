The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the PERSON public prosecutor recommended that the ORG place the applicant under special police supervision ( sorveglianza speciale di pubblica sicurezza ) for DATE , on the basis of Act no . DATE , and impose a compulsory residence order on him during that time . The public prosecutor submitted that the applicant \u2019s previous convictions for drug trafficking , absconding and unlawful possession of weapons showed that he associated with criminals and was a dangerous individual . He also noted that the applicant had been given a \u201c warning \u201d by the police but had persisted in his criminal conduct .", "CARDINAL . In submissions of DATE the applicant challenged the prosecutor \u2019s recommendation . He argued that there had been a case of mistaken identity and that the alleged breaches of the terms of his special supervision concerned a person who shared his first name and surname but had been born in DATE . He further submitted that no criminal charges had been brought against him since a conviction dating back to DATE . Although he had been convicted of absconding in DATE , that was not a decisive factor for the imposition of the measure in question . He argued that there was no need to place him under special supervision .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , served on DATE , ORG placed the applicant under special supervision for DATE . It rejected his arguments , finding that the statutory requirements for the imposition of the measure were indeed satisfied , there being no doubt that he was dangerous .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the applicant had \u201c active \u201d criminal tendencies and that the evidence before it showed that he had derived most of his means of subsistence from criminal activity .", "CARDINAL . The court observed , in particular :", "\u201c The subject was issued with a \u2018 verbal warning for public ORG on DATE , but this did nothing to improve his conduct ; he continued to associate regularly with key figures in the local underworld ( malavita locale ) and carried on committing offences ( see statement of charges pending : breach of supervision order on DATE ; breach of supervision order on DATE ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG further held :", "\u201c The findings of the investigation ( see documents and certificates in the case file ) show that Mr PERSON remains personally involved in various criminal activities , among which the greatest threat to public order and safety is posed by offences against property and weapon- and drug - related offences .", "This negative picture is compounded by the contents of the recent report issued by the ORG carabinieri on DATE , from which it appears that far from having receded , the subject \u2019s criminal tendencies are still thought to be active and operational . The evidence in the file indicates that he has no fixed and lawful occupation ( having declared himself available for employment from DATE ) and that the serious offences under consideration are such as to warrant the conclusion that he has , up until now , derived a significant part of his means of subsistence from criminal activity , by repeatedly resorting to crime either alone or in association with habitual offenders ( whether in his municipality of residence or elsewhere ) . To ensure more thorough monitoring , it is therefore necessary to order not only special police supervision for DATE ( a measure deemed reasonable on account of the subject \u2019s character as clearly emerges from the acts attributed to him ) , but also compulsory residence for the same duration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The preventive measure imposed the following obligations on the applicant :", "\u2013 to report once DATE to the police authority responsible for his supervision ;", "\u2013 to start looking for work within DATE ;", "\u2013 to live in GPE and not to change his place of residence ;", "\u2013 to lead an honest and law - abiding life and not give cause for suspicion ;", "\u2013 not to associate with persons who had a criminal record and who were subject to preventive or security measures ;", "\u2013 not to return home TIME or to leave home before TIME , except in case of necessity and only after giving notice to the authorities in good time ;", "\u2013 not to keep or carry weapons ;", "\u2013 not to go to bars , nightclubs , amusement arcades or brothels and not to attend public meetings ;", "\u2013 not to use mobile phones or radio communication devices ; and", "\u2013 to have with him at all times the document setting out his obligations ( carta precettiva ) , and to present it to the police authority on request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prefecture ordered the withdrawal of the applicant \u2019s driving licence .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , served on the applicant on CARDINAL DATE , ORG allowed his appeal and quashed the preventive measure ex tunc .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal observed , firstly , that for a preventive measure to be imposed it was necessary to establish that the individual posed a \u201c current danger \u201d , which was not necessarily linked to the commission of a specific offence , but rather to the existence of a complex situation of a certain duration indicating that the individual had a particular lifestyle that prompted alarm for public safety .", "CARDINAL . In ORG view , the requirement of a \u201c current \u201d danger to society implied that the relevant decision should relate to the time of the assessment and should remain valid throughout its implementation ; any previous circumstances could be taken into account only in relation to their impact on the \u201c current \u201d element .", "CARDINAL . The court found that at the time the measure had been imposed , the applicant \u2019s dangerousness could not have been inferred from any criminal activity .", "CARDINAL . It then observed that in several final judgments delivered between DATE and DATE the applicant had been convicted of tobacco smuggling . He had subsequently changed his sphere of activity and until DATE had been involved in drug trafficking and handling illegal weapons , offences for which he had been sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment in a judgment of DATE , which had become final on DATE ; he had served his sentence from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG accordingly noted that the applicant \u2019s most recent illegal activities relating to drugs dated back to DATE before the preventive measure had been imposed . All that the court could hold against him was an offence of absconding , committed on DATE ( while he had been subject to a compulsory residence order ) .", "CARDINAL . The court also pointed out that the breaches of the terms of special supervision committed on DATE and DATE concerned a different person , who had the same first name and surname as the applicant but had been born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that ORG had omitted to assess the impact of the rehabilitation purpose of the sentence on the applicant \u2019s personality .", "It observed in particular :", "\u201c While it is true that the application of special supervision is compatible with the status of detention , which relates solely to the time of the execution of the sentence , the assessment of dangerousness is inevitably even more significant in the case of an individual who has fully served his sentence and has committed no further offences after his release , as is the case for PERSON .", "The note of DATE in which the carabinieri mentioned that PERSON associated with convicted offenders ( to whom he had been caught speaking ) does not appear sufficient to establish his dangerousness , bearing in mind that PERSON has not been the subject of any further judicial proceedings since the decision to impose the preventive measure .", "Lastly , ORG notes that the material produced by the defence before ORG and at the hearing before this division indicates that , notwithstanding the typically casual nature of work as a farm labourer , the subject has , at least since his release from prison in DATE up to the present day , consistently been in lawful employment providing him with a respectable source of income .", "In conclusion , in DATE there were no specific facts from which to infer persistent dangerousness on the part of the subject , who , after serving his lengthy sentence of imprisonment , has not displayed any conduct justifying the assessment made in the judgment appealed against , which is therefore to be quashed . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "P4"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P4-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P4-2-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6", "P4"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "P4-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P4-2-1"]}
