On DATE Mr Dzhabarov , PERSON and a friend of theirs were travelling in a car in PERSON . At TIME they were stopped by a police patrol , arrested , and , at TIME , taken to a local police station .", "CARDINAL . The police issued an order for Mr Dzhabarov \u2019s detention for TIME at TIME . The order said that he was being detained under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) in conjunction with LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , which criminalise burglary and theft committed by using a motor vehicle , technical means or a special technique .", "CARDINAL . The police issued an order for Mr PERSON \u2019s detention for TIME at TIME That order likewise said that he was being detained under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the ORG , but in his case in conjunction with CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Criminal Code DATE , which criminalises robbery .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE Mr Dzhabarov sought judicial review of the order for his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the order . It noted that Mr Dzhabarov had been detained under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the ORG . However , the order had not specified the offence of which he was suspected . That was both a breach of the rules of procedure and an indication that there did not exist a reasonable suspicion that Mr Dzhabarov had committed an offence . The lack of such suspicion was also demonstrated by the absence of any evidence in the police file . CARDINAL police reports , drawn up later and suggesting that Mr Dzhabarov had been detained with a view to elucidating whether he was implicated in the robbery of a petrol station and a number of burglaries , could not ex post facto justify his detention ; they moreover contained discrepancies and were based on investigative steps carried out after Mr Dzhabarov \u2019s arrest . The court went on to say that the order had been issued TIME after Mr Dzhabarov \u2019s de facto arrest , which was out of line with the object and purpose of the law . The court partly allowed Mr Dzhabarov \u2019s claim for costs , awarding him MONEY ( ORG ) ( CARDINAL ( ORG ) ) in ORG fees and ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in court fees .", "CARDINAL . NORP The police appealed on points of law . Mr Dzhabarov did not ask ORG to vary its ruling in relation to costs , as was possible under the applicable rules of procedure .

It held that the detention order , which had been issued at TIME on DATE , was chiefly tainted by the undisputed lack of contemporaneous evidence that Mr Dzhabarov might have been implicated in an offence . The court did not mention Mr Dzhabarov \u2019s claim in respect of the costs incurred in the appeal proceedings . Mr Dzhabarov did not ask it to supplement its judgment by doing so , as provided under the applicable rules of procedure .", "CARDINAL . In DATE Mr Dzhabarov brought a claim under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the State and ORG DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) against ORG . He alleged , inter alia , that his detention had been unlawful and had caused him psychological trauma . He sought ORG CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) in non - pecuniary damages and , under the head of pecuniary damages , reimbursement of the remainder of the costs that he had allegedly incurred in the judicial review proceedings : ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim . It held that Mr Dzhabarov had failed to prove that he had suffered non - pecuniary damage \u2013 such as negative emotions , stress or discomfort \u2013 as a result of his detention . He had not provided any evidence , in particular medical expert reports , on that point . The statement of PERSON , who had been called by PERSON to testify , only contained information about the events surrounding their arrest and detention . The court went on to say that it was not possible to seek costs incurred in proceedings for judicial review of a detention order by way of a claim for damages under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Mr Dzhabarov appealed on points of law . He argued , inter alia , that it was logical to presume that a person who had been unlawfully detained had endured mental suffering on account of that , and that he was entitled to compensation because his detention had been in breach of his fundamental rights .", "CARDINAL .

It held that claimants in proceedings under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act bore the burden of making out all elements of the tort , including the existence of damage , and that the only evidence that could be used to prove non - pecuniary damage in the form of mental suffering was medical expert evidence , not witness evidence . The court went on to agree fully with the lower court \u2019s ruling in relation to the claim for costs in the judicial review proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON sought judicial review of the order for his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the order . It noted that PERSON had been detained under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the ORG . However , the order for his detention , while formally valid , was out of line with the object and purpose of the law . The police were given the power to detain persons suspected of offences with a view to being able to investigate those offences . That is why the law did not require conclusive evidence of an offence but simply information enabling the police to form a reasonable suspicion in that regard . The police detention log showed that PERSON had been brought to the police station at CARDINAL a.m. on DATE , whereas the CARDINAL witness statements submitted by the police in the judicial review proceedings in support of their contention that PERSON was suspected of an offence spoke of a robbery of a petrol station committed at TIME This showed that , at the time of PERSON PERSON \u2019s arrest , the police did not have a reasonable suspicion of him committing an offence . It was also striking that although PERSON had in fact been arrested at TIME on DATE , the order for his detention said that his detention had started at TIME DATE . The court partly allowed PERSON claim for costs , awarding him ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in lawyers\u2019 fees and ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) in court fees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police appealed on points of law against that judgment . PERSON did not ask ORG to vary its ruling in relation to costs , as was possible under the applicable rules of procedure .

On DATE the proceedings were stayed pending the determination of the appeal against ORG judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE the proceedings were resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim . It held that PERSON , who bore the burden of proof in that respect , had failed to show that he had suffered non - pecuniary damage DATE such as negative emotions , stress or discomfort \u2013 as a result of his detention . He had not provided any evidence , in particular medical expert evidence , on that point . The evidence of PERSON and the other person with whom PERSON PERSON had been detained , who had been called by PERSON to testify , and the expert evidence on the lawfulness of those conditions adduced in the course of the proceedings , gave information about the material conditions in the detention facility but not about PERSON state of mind or subjective perceptions . These could only be established on the basis of medical expert evidence , which had not been provided . The court went on to say that it was not possible to seek costs incurred in proceedings for judicial review of a detention order by way of a claim for damages under LAW .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed on points of law . He argued , inter alia , that it was absurd to hold that the mental suffering flowing from unlawful detention could only be established on the basis of medical expert evidence . It was natural to presume that a person unlawfully deprived of his liberty for TIME would endure such suffering .", "CARDINAL .

It held that claimants in proceedings under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act bore the burden of proving all elements of the tort , including the existence of damage , and that the only evidence that could be used to prove non - pecuniary damage in the form of mental suffering was medical expert evidence , not witness evidence . The statements of the witnesses called by PERSON had established the conditions in the detention facility and the attitude of the police officers towards him , but could not serve as proof of negative changes in his physical , psychological or neurological status .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON was working as head of the audit unit of the ORG division of ORG . She was in charge of , among others , the towns of PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At TIME CARDINAL September CARDINAL , PERSON went to the Sandanski office of ORG , according to her to practise filling in tests on the ethical duties of tax officials . She said that , on her way there , she ran into an acquaintance of hers , PERSON , who asked her whether she could run a check on the identities of certain persons that he needed for court papers that he was about to file in connection with the registration of ORG as a political party . PERSON decided that there was no legal impediment to that and together with Mr PERSON went inside the ORG \u2019s office . However , their entry set off the alarm and shortly after that QUANTITY police officers came to the office and found PERSON and Mr PERSON inside , checking the personal data of certain individuals in the ORG \u2019s computer database . The officers asked the CARDINAL of them to produce their identification papers and to accompany them to the local police station .", "CARDINAL . PERSON and Mr PERSON , under police escort , arrived at the police station at TIME PERSON was asked to draw up a written explanation of her presence in the ORG \u2019s office . In the meantime , CARDINAL plain - clothes officers arrived at the station ; it later transpired that they were officers of ORG . They interviewed PERSON without identifying themselves and without explaining the reasons why she was detained . PERSON was released at about QUANTITY p.m. It appears that , in the meantime , at TIME , she was briefly taken by the police back to the office of ORG to be present while the police drew up a record , and then returned to the police station .", "CARDINAL . Following this incident , the prosecuting authorities opened criminal proceedings against PERSON on charges that she had knowingly divulged confidential information to which she had access by virtue of her position as a tax administration official , contrary to LAW . However , on CARDINAL DATE ORG decided to discontinue those proceedings . It noted that while PERSON had indeed misused her office to divulge confidential information \u2013 the personal data of QUANTITY persons DATE to which she had access by virtue of her position , LAW required , in addition , that this divulgation give rise to prejudice for the ORG or a private person . There was no evidence , however , that the applicant \u2019s act had prejudiced the ORG or those QUANTITY persons , both of whom , when interviewed , had stated that they had not suffered any negative consequences as a result of the applicant \u2019s divulging their personal data to Mr ORG", "CARDINAL . Shortly after the incident , PERSON and Mr PERSON complained to the military prosecuting authorities about the actions of the police officers who had detained them . On DATE the Sofia Military Prosecutor \u2019s Office refused to open criminal proceedings pursuant to those complaints . Its decision was upheld by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE PERSON brought a claim under LAW DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) against ORG of ORG and ORG . She alleged that her detention had been unlawful because it had not been based on a written order as required under section CARDINAL ) of the ORG . She also alleged that the deprivation of liberty and the pressure to which she had been subjected by the police had caused her stress and humiliation and had aggravated her health , and sought ORG ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in nonpecuniary damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the claim . It noted that it was not disputed that TIME and TIME on DATE PERSON had been detained by officers of the Sandanski police . That was further proved by the register of detainees kept by the Sandanski police station and the statements of the officers concerned . However , a claimant in proceedings under LAW CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) had to make out all elements of the tort under that provision : a wrongful act or omission by officials , damage , and a sufficient causal link between the CARDINAL . The claimant bore the full burden of proof in relation to each of those , and the lack of any element meant that the claim should fail . However , PERSON had not categorically shown that she had suffered non - pecuniary damage as a result of her arrest and detention . There was no evidence that the officers concerned had done anything to hurt her dignity . Their testimony , which was internally consistent and matched the rest of the evidence , showed that ORG had not been subjected to any physical or psychological abuse . PERSON evidence that one of the officers had acted rudely was contradicted by the evidence of all officers and was vague ; it could not therefore be credited . It was not supported by the statement of Mr PERSON either . PERSON assertions in respect of the damage that she had allegedly suffered were in addition very general and could not be upheld . The police had been apprised of a possible offence and had detained her for CARDINAL to elucidate the case , as possible under section CARDINAL of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Had the detention lasted CARDINAL , the outcome of the case would probably have been different .", "CARDINAL . PERSON appealed on points of law . She argued , inter alia , that the court had not clarified under which point of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG she had been detained , or commented on the fact that her detention had not been sanctioned by a written order . She also argued , by reference to LAW , that the mere fact of unlawful detention gave rise to non - pecuniary damage because it was an infringement of the fundamental right to liberty , guaranteed by , inter alia , LAW . Since she had been detained unlawfully , she was entitled to non - pecuniary damages in relation to that .", "CARDINAL .

It fully agreed with all of the lower court \u2019s findings , including that PERSON had been placed under police detention within the meaning of QUANTITY CARDINAL of the ORG , but did not mention LAW CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Convention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-5"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["5-1-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
