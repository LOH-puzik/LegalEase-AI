BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Sverre Erik Jebens;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a private company with headquarters in LOC , GPE . It was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , lawyers practising in PERSON . ORG GPE ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Deputy Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant company had a right of allocation with respect to a flat in LOC ( as explained below , the allocation right holders were socially owned enterprises and other public bodies which administered socially owned flats in the former ORG ) . On DATE it initiated administrative proceedings for the eviction of ORG who had remained in the flat after the death of his grandfather .", "On DATE the competent first - instance administrative body ruled that the occupancy right over the flat could not be transferred to ORG from his late grandfather and , accordingly , ordered his eviction . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , respectively , the competent second - instance administrative body and ORG of ORG upheld that decision . PERSON was evicted on DATE .", "On DATE PERSON complained to ORG , a domestic human - rights body , about the outcome of the administrative proceedings mentioned above , relying on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of , and LAW No . CARDINAL to , LAW .", "On DATE ORG ( the legal successor of ORG ) found a violation of GPE \u2019s right to respect for his home , quashed the ORG decision of DATE and ordered that he be reinstated in the flat . The applicant company was informed of that decision through the housing authorities on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG , pursuant to the ORG decision , quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE and ruled against the applicant company .", "It would appear that the applicant company has subsequently agreed to the privatisation of the flat by ORG under LAW ( see below ) .", "In the former ORG practically all flats were under the regime of \u201c social ownership \u201d . They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees , who became \u201c occupancy right holders \u201d . The rights of both the allocation right holders ( public bodies which nominally controlled the flats ) and the occupancy right holders were regulated by law ( LAW DATE , which is still in force in GPE ) .", "In accordance with this LAW , an occupancy right , once allocated , entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent , lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee . When occupancy right holders died , their rights transferred , as a matter of right , to their surviving spouses or registered members of their family households who were also using the flat ( see sections DATE and CARDINAL of that Act ) . In practice , these provisions on transfer meant that occupancy rights originally allocated by public bodies to their employees could pass , as of right , to multiple generations for whom the initial employment - based link to the allocation right holder no longer existed ( for more information about socially owned flats see PERSON GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "The concept of \u201c social ownership \u201d was abandoned during the DATE - CARDINAL war . As a result , socially owned flats were effectively nationalised . Under LAW , which entered into force on DATE , the occupancy right holders were entitled to purchase their flats . Furthermore , the role of the allocation right holders changed . They are now obliged to agree to the privatisation of flats if the occupancy right holder so requests ( see section CARDINAL of that Act ) , or , in the absence of such a request , to let out the flat ( section CARDINAL ) of that Act ) . In both cases , the proceeds ( that is , the purchase price or the rent ) are to be paid to ORG ( sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) of that Act ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
