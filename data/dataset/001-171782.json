The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in PERSON ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) issued a warrant to search the applicant \u2019s flat for a mobile telephone , which had been reported stolen . The relevant part of the ruling read :", "\u201c Acting investigator has applied to the court with a request to authorize search of the dwelling of [ the applicant ] ... with a view to locating a mobile telephone \u201c NokiaCARDINAL \u201d stolen from private entrepreneur [ K. ] ... [ theft ] having taken place on DATE at night .", "During the hearing , the acting investigator and the prosecutor have supported their request ...", "Having heard the acting investigator [ and ] the opinion of the prosecutor , and having examined the material of the criminal case , the court concludes that ... [ it ] has been provided with sufficient data indicating a possibility that the ORG mobile telephone may be at the [ applicant \u2019s ] place of residence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police searched the applicant \u2019s flat in his presence and seized CARDINAL mobile telephones , which , according to the applicant , belonged to him and his family members . As appears from a poorly legible copy of the list of the seized items prepared by the police , CARDINAL of these telephones were apparently of ORG and DATE of ORG make . According to the applicant , on an unspecified date the seized telephones were returned , and neither he nor any of his family members were ever indicted or involved in any other way in the criminal proceedings giving rise to the search warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an administrative complaint with ORG , alleging that his home had been searched arbitrarily and seeking moral damages for breaching inviolability of his home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to examine the above complaint , citing a lack of jurisdiction . It noted that all complaints regarding the unlawfulness of procedural actions by law - enforcement authorities taken in connection with a criminal investigation had to be lodged within the framework of relevant criminal proceedings based on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , then in force .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against that decision . He alleged that there was no meaningful opportunity for him to obtain redress on the basis of the ORG provisions , since a criminal court could only examine complaints concerning the actions of investigation authorities in the context of its examination of a criminal case . In the applicant \u2019s situation , such a remedy would not be effective , since he had no procedural status in the criminal proceedings at issue , and had never been informed of the progress of those proceedings . Moreover , it was not certain whether or when the case would reach trial stage . However , as the applicant considered himself to have been a victim of an arbitrary search , regardless of the outcome of the relevant criminal investigation , he also considered that he had standing to bring an administrative complaint under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Administrative Justice of GPE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal by the applicant , having essentially endorsed the findings of the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed in cassation . He reiterated the arguments raised in his ordinary appeal and additionally submitted that his claim against the police for non - pecuniary damages could not be examined and resolved within the framework of criminal proceedings against a third party .", "CARDINAL .
