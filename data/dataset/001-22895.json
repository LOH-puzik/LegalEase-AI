The applicant companies had bought debt owed between ORG - owned enterprises in respect of natural gas delivered under an inter - governmental agreement .", "The Government consider that the judgments of ORG and ORG declaring this transaction null and void as contrary to the law were not based on retrospective legislation and , being in conformity with the relevant law , can not be seen as an arbitrary ORG interference with possessions .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Under a DATE inter - governmental agreement ( \u201c the GPE agreement \u201d ) , GPE undertook to supply natural gas to GPE in exchange for GPE \u2019s participation in the construction and equipment of pipelines in GPE and deliveries of other commodities . GPE received natural gas from GPE under CARDINAL other similar agreements , dating from DATE and DATE . The PERSON agreement was amended in DATE and later reconfirmed and amended by protocols signed in DATE between GPE and GPE and between GPE and GPE .", "In DATE a number of acts of ORG , governmental decrees , regulations and instructions dealt with various aspects of the construction - for - gas scheme . By enacting them the ORG was performing a dual function , being the legislator and at the same time the owner and manager of the relevant assets . Regulation in the economic area was typically effected through subordinate legislation ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice , on the transition of NORP law from that of a fully ORG - owned centrally controlled economy to that of a market economy ) .", "Several State enterprises and banks were instructed to work on the PERSON project . They entered into direct contracts with NORP and later NORP enterprises , thereby fixing certain prices , responsibilities and other conditions . The participation of NORP State enterprises changed whenever the ORG re - assigned responsibilities .", "The DATE and DATE protocols amending the ORG agreement provided that the ORG enterprises involved in the project had to introduce changes in their direct contracts . The direct contracts between the NORP and NORP or NORP enterprises , including those signed in DATE , invariably stipulated that they were subject to amendment in case of changes in the underlying inter - governmental agreements .", "Some of the construction works carried out in compliance with the inter - governmental agreements was financed directly from the ORG budget ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of Decree No . CARDINAL of ORG DATE ) , whereas others were financed by ORG enterprises .", "By Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG decided that a ORG - owned bank , Biochim , should finance the GPE project . The bank was instructed to provide funds for the construction works under the PERSON agreement and to receive reimbursement from another ORG enterprise - which later adopted the name ORG - out of the revenues collected from gas consumers . The decree further stipulated that sums received in excess of the planned revenues should be paid into the ORG budget and that in case of insufficient revenues the ORG budget would cover the difference .", "The distribution of the imported gas to NORP consumers was thus the task of ORG , which gradually began to handle the financing of certain construction works too .", "Since a significant part of the construction works carried out by GPE under the LOC agreement preceded the beginning of gas deliveries , ORG incurred expenses in the period DATE which were expected to be covered by the proceeds from gas supplied to NORP consumers over DATE .", "The big gas consumers in the country were State industrial enterprises . Having been conceived to function in the conditions of a centrally administered economy and to produce for the former communist countries , many of them ran into substantial difficulties after DATE and defaulted on payment of their debts owed to ORG . Significant unpaid arrears for the gas imported under the LOC and other inter - governmental agreements thus accumulated ( \u201c the unpaid gas debt \u201d ) which in turn affected the ORG budget .", "The PERSON on the DATE State Budget , published in DATE , listed among the expected budget revenues \u201c arrears arising out of gas importation in DATE \u201d . ORG adopted regulations for the implementation of the DATE ORG budget , published in DATE .

Until DATE it was a \u201c ORG \u201d within the meaning of Decree No . PERSON on Economic Activity .

On DATE , following discussions on the matter , ORG agreed in principle while fixing a ceiling on the amounts to be assigned , requiring an undertaking by the assignees that they would not seek to have GPE or K declared in a state of insolvency or have their assets attached , and setting out further conditions . The decision of CARDINAL DATE also stated that the amended draft contract should be approved by ORG and ORG .", "An amended draft contract was submitted to the Minister of Industry who issued a letter dated DATE stating that the conditions set out in the decision of ORG were satisfied but directing that an approved schedule of payments should be appended .", "The debt assignment contract was signed on DATE by the first applicant and PERSON as the assignees and PERSON as the assignor .", "According to the contract the first applicant and ORG purchased at a discount \u201c unpaid gas debts \u201d . These were MONEY ( \u201c BGL \u201d ) principal owed by GPE ( the equivalent of MONEY at the applicable exchange rate ) and a similar amount owed by PERSON , as well as additional amounts in respect of interest due . The discount was PERCENT on the principal of the purchased debt and PERCENT on the interest .", "The first applicant and ORG agreed to pay directly to various companies amounts apparently owed by ORG to them in respect of construction works on pipelines , including - for CARDINAL of the price - those effected by a ORG - owned enterprise pursuant to the PERSON agreement . In respect of the interest , the price was to be paid to ORG only .", "The contract contained an arbitration clause .", "According to the applicants , GPE did not make any payments . Without initially challenging the debt assignment , GPE \u2019s managers informed the applicants that they were under an obligation to pay through the fiscal authorities . Later GPE disputed the validity of the contract and the applicants brought judicial proceedings against it which ended with judgments declaring the debt assignment null and void ( see below , ORG proceedings ) . A significant part of GPE \u2019s debt was eventually set off against its tax liability by decision of the fiscal authorities based on , inter alia , Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of DATE ( see above ) . The triangular set - off concerned sums owed by GPE to PERSON ( the unpaid gas debt ) , sums owed by ORG to the ORG and sums owed by the fiscal authorities to GPE ( tax refunds ) .", "The managers of K did not question the validity of the debt assignment and began payments immediately upon notification thereof . Within DATE K paid to the applicants BGL CARDINAL , CARDINAL of the debt . K also agreed to sign a novation contract directly with the first applicant and PERSON . That contract , signed on DATE , introduced certain modifications in the manner and timetable of payments and contained an arbitration clause . K stopped paying after DATE and later unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the debt assignment in proceedings against the applicants ( see below ) . Eventually , on DATE , the applicants sold the remainder of ORG \u201c unpaid gas debt \u201d to ORG ( ORG ) .", "The first applicant and PERSON , for their part , made several payments to ORG and another company DATE and DATE in respect of the price of the purchased debt . According to the applicants , they have paid a total of BGL CARDINAL .", "On DATE GPE sent a letter to ORG concerning the validity of the debt assignment . On DATE and DATE ORG wrote to GPE , GPE and K expressing the view that the debt assignment contract was not valid or had not entered into force , as no schedule of payments had been included , contrary to the ORG of ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE the assignment of the unpaid gas debt was discussed at a meeting of ORG . The Government considered that it was contrary to the PERSON on the DATE State Budget , Regulation CARDINAL of DATE , and the PERSON on ORG . Instructions were issued for measures to be taken against the managers of ORG for having acted in breach of the law . It was further decided that there should be an \u201c immediate suspension of the transfer of the debts ... and invalidation of the entries in the accounts ... \u201d .", "In DATE K , having suspended payments to the applicants , brought proceedings against the first applicant and PERSON before ORG seeking a declaration that the novation contract of DATE was invalid . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that the contract was valid . It rejected the claim that pursuant to the PERSON on the DATE ORG and the implementing acts the arrears owed to ORG had become the property of the ORG and that therefore their assignment was to be considered invalid .", "On DATE CARDINAL ORG brought a claim before ORG seeking recovery of an amount from the first applicant and PERSON . The amount sought was the difference between the sums paid by the first applicant and PERSON to ORG and the sums received by the applicants from the debtors .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the argument that the debts assigned under the contract of DATE were the property of the ORG , that they were thus not transferable and that therefore the debt assignment contract was null and void . This argument had been based on , inter alia , Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of DATE for the implementation of the PERSON on the DATE State Budget ( see above ) . ORG noted that ORG had been and had remained the creditor in respect of the unpaid arrears . The legal provisions invoked had merely sought to introduce a special legal regime for their collection , the regime under LAW on ORG . That law applied to all ORG debts and - in cases provided for by ORG - to the collection of other debts . As the Regulations for the implementation of the DATE budget were merely a piece of subordinate legislation , the special legal regime for collection of debts had only become applicable to ORG \u2019s debts by virtue of the provisions of the DATE budget , adopted by ORG . In any event , even if it was considered that the special procedure had been applicable to the collection of the gas debt as of the date of the assignment contract , that fact could not alter the private law nature of the debt .", "In DATE PERSON again applied to ORG seeking a declaration that because clause CARDINAL of the debt assignment contract of DATE was void , the entire contract was void . Clause CARDINAL stipulated that the first applicant and ORG would not seek to have K and GPE declared into a state of insolvency . On DATE ORG held that clause CARDINAL was void as it purported to exclude the right to levy distress , but that this did not render the entire contract void .", "In DATE , not having received any payment from GPE , the first applicant and ORG brought proceedings before ORG against GPE for payment of part of its debt . PERSON intervened in the proceedings as a third party in support of GPE . By a judgment of DATE ORG granted the claim , rejecting the objection of GPE that the debt assignment contract of DATE was not valid . The court considered that ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE was binding in this respect .", "GPE appealed . By a judgment of DATE ORG overturned the lower court \u2019s judgment .", "ORG found that ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE was only binding on the parties , which were , in the proceedings leading to that decision , the first applicant and PERSON and , as an adverse party , PERSON . GPE was not a party thereto .", "The court further found that under an international agreement of DATE between GPE and the former GPE the Bulgarian State had undertaken to participate in the construction of gas supply pipelines and deliver machines and equipment . GPE had undertaken to supply natural gas to GPE . This agreement had later been reconfirmed by a protocol signed between GPE and GPE .", "GPE \u2019s ORG had designated a ORG enterprise , later incorporated as a wholly ORG - owned joint - stock company under the name ORG , to conclude the necessary contracts for the construction works and for the supply of gas to GPE . However , ORG had remained a party to the underlying international agreement . Therefore , the natural gas thus delivered was ORG property . The income from gas deliveries was listed among the budget revenues under the DATE and DATE budget laws . By LAW of the Regulations on the implementation of the DATE ORG budget PERSON had been entrusted with the task of selling the supplies of NORP natural gas to consumers . The ORG provided that all revenues therefrom should be paid on a DATE basis by ORG to the ORG budget after deduction of the expenses incurred . This was also provided for in Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Regulations for the implementation of the PERSON on the DATE ORG . The regulations were adopted by ORG which was competent to enact measures in execution of the ORG budget .", "ORG found that there had therefore been a particular legal regime established by the ORG as the owner of the natural gas according to which all income from gas supplies had to be paid into the ORG budget after deduction of the delivery expenses . The assignment of the unpaid gas debt to the applicants ran contrary to this regime and the requirements of the DATE and DATE budget laws , including the applicable provisions on maintaining the budget balance . The contract of DATE was void .", "ORG expressly stated that its conclusions were not based on the provisions of the PERSON on the DATE State Budget concerning the applicability of the PERSON on ORG . The applicable collection procedure , established in Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of DATE and the DATE law , was irrelevant .", "The first applicant and ORG submitted a petition for review ( cassation ) to ORG . By judgment of DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE .", "ORG acknowledged that under LAW of DATE Bulgargas , as a legal person separate from the ORG , was the owner of all its assets . However , the special legal regime , as correctly established in the impugned judgment of DATE , made it clear that the claims at issue had been fiscal and not commercial . Thus , invariably in all ORG budgets , for DATE , the income from the sale of natural gas had been listed as an item among the expected revenues for the ORG budget . Had the claims at issue been commercial and not fiscal , the ORG would have been entitled to receive from ORG only the dividends and the ordinary taxes owed by every commercial company . However , the applicable provisions clearly entitled the ORG to receive all revenues from the sale of natural gas after deduction of expenses , regardless of the financial results from all other activities of the company . The assignment of the GPE debt , which was a budget entry on the income side , was thus unlawful .", "ORG further mentioned that in accordance with the DATE budget law the sums owed by GPE were subject to the special collection procedure under LAW .", "ORG also addressed the ORG argument that ORG judgment of DATE ( see below ) had established the private - law nature of the debts at issue . It noted that the issue decided by ORG had been whether an amendment to the PERSON on the DATE ORG had been unconstitutional rather than the civil dispute concerning the debts at issue . The refusal of ORG to suspend the proceedings pending the outcome of the case before ORG was not , therefore , in breach of procedural rules .", "None of the arbitral awards or the judicial decisions involving the applicants referred to any previous cases concerning the special legal regime of the unpaid gas debt . It appears that in this respect the dispute concerning the DATE debt assignment was the first of its kind .", "On an unspecified date in DATE ORG introduced in ORG a bill on interpretation of certain provisions of the PERSON on the DATE ORG . In the reasoning accompanying the bill , ORG stated , referring to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , that there had been contradictory opinions on the question whether claims arising out of the sale of natural gas were transferable . ORG therefore had to adopt an interpretation of the LAW , as it was competent to do under LAW . The proposed bill on interpretation was not adopted . Apparently it was redrafted as a bill amending the PERSON on the DATE ORG .", "By acts of ORG of DATE and CARDINAL DATE the PERSON on the DATE ORG was amended . The amendment stated inter alia that all claims arising out of the sale of natural gas were ORG claims and were not transferable unless otherwise provided by act of ORG . Also , the amendment provided that a debtor who had paid into the ORG budget arrears due in respect of deliveries of natural gas should be considered to have discharged his debt and that the ORG should not be liable to any third person in respect of any sums thus received in the ORG budget .", "By a judgment of DATE ORG , acting upon a referral by the President of GPE , declared the amendments of CARDINAL July and DATE unconstitutional . It found that the amendments purported to declare as ORG property claims which had previously not been considered to have been ORG claims . This was contrary to the LAW guarantee on property rights . The ORG further rejected the argument of ORG that the amendment had been of an interpretative nature . The ORG noted that it introduced a new provision .", "By letter of DATE , faxed and mailed on DATE , the ORG lawyer stated his intention to submit an application on behalf of ORG and ORG and briefly described the events complained of . The letter stated that ORG was a company incorporated under NORP law with its registered office in GPE .", "In a letter of DATE requesting an extension of the time for submission of the application form , the applicants\u2019 lawyer again referred to ORG and DH as the applicants . The application form , dated DATE , mentioned PERSON for the first time .", "Together with the application form the applicants\u2019 lawyer submitted CARDINAL authorisation forms : a power of attorney dated DATE issued by the executive directors of ORG and a power of attorney dated DATE issued by the executive director of ORG . The latter document stated that it authorised PERSON to represent both PERSON and PERSON .", "According to NORP law at the time of the conclusion of the construction - for - gas inter - governmental agreements , almost all economic activity was owned and administered by the ORG . All commercial assets were the property of the ORG and were only allocated to ORG enterprises for \u201c use and management \u201d - which included the power to transfer property between ORG enterprises in accordance with the applicable rules . State enterprises possessed distinct legal personality but were under the direct control of the relevant ministries . State assets , including debts , could be taken away from CARDINAL enterprise and re - assigned to another by simple decision of the relevant ministries . Certain elements of self - management were introduced during DATE , within the limits of a centrally - administered and ORG - owned economy .", "A process of replacing economic legislation began in DATE , after the beginning of democratisation .", "In DATE certain provisions of LAW were amended . In DATE a new LAW enshrined the right to peaceful enjoyment of property . LAW , setting out rules on incorporation and management of companies , was also enacted in DATE .", "Under LAW and other legislation adopted in DATE and DATE , ORG enterprises had to be transformed , by decision of the relevant ministry and upon registration at the competent court , into ORG - owned limited liability companies or ORG - owned joint stock companies .", "The question whether the transformed enterprises became the full owners of their assets or were beneficiaries of a right to use and manage ORG property was still discussed in the legal theory after DATE . While the new provisions of commercial law were based on the concept that every commercial company owned its assets , under LAW ( regulating real and movable property ) as in force DATE ORG - owned legal persons only \u201c exercised , on their own account , the right to ORG property in respect of assets provided to them \u201d . On the other hand the provisions of Decision No . CARDINAL of DATE of ORG and section CARDINALa ( adopted DATE ) of the PERSON on LAW provided that in the process of transformation of a ORG enterprise ownership of real estate or other assets that had been used and managed by it should be deemed to belong to the transformed company . That was the prevailing view .", "In DATE a number of provisions of GPE which limited freedom of contract on the basis of the old concepts of a centrally planned economy were repealed . New provisions regulating commercial transactions were for the first time enacted in DATE , when a new chapter was added to LAW . In the meantime certain limitations on contractual freedom remained in provisions specifically applicable to wholly ORG - owned limited liability or joint stock companies , mostly relating to the transitional period pending their privatisation ( additional section CARDINAL of the PERSON on the Establishment of Wholly State - Owned Commercial Companies ; additional section QUANTITY of the PERSON on LAW , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Regulations No . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE , in force until DATE , Regulations on the Manner of Exercise by ORG , adopted in DATE , Decree No . CARDINAL on Economic Activity and the regulations for the application of the decree ) .", "In DATE the new ORG and amendments to LAW provided that ORG - owned commercial companies became the owners of all their assets and the ORG ceased to be the owner of property it had provided for the creation of a ORG - owned joint stock or limited liability company .", "The transition from legislation regulating a ORG - owned centrally planned economy to one suited for a market economy was largely completed in DATE with the adoption of the above - mentioned property laws and provisions on commercial transactions . In DATE the remaining parts of Decree No . CARDINAL on Economic Activity , the main piece of legislation in this area in the period before the market reforms , was repealed .", "This law provides for a specific fiscal enforcement procedure for the collection of ORG claims , different from that under general civil procedure .
