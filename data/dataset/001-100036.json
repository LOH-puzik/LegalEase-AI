The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery . While remanded in custody the applicant was held in FAC , ORG and other remand establishments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG authorised the applicant 's remand in custody until DATE . In ordering the detention , the court referred to the nature and gravity of the charges against the applicant , and stated that \u201c it was likely that the applicant could attempt to abscond from investigators and the trial as well as obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case \u201d . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the term of the applicant 's detention until DATE due to the fear \u201c that he would abscond \u201d . The applicant 's lawyer was present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that ruling .", "CARDINAL . Having received the appeal on DATE , on DATE ORG dismissed it , arguing that the applicant \u201c had been charged with a serious crime and if released would obstruct the investigation and the establishment of the truth \u201d . The applicant 's counsel was present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the term of the applicant 's detention until DATE . Having briefly summed up the charges against the applicant the court stated that \u201c the applicant had been charged with a serious crime , therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he could attempt to hide from investigators and the court , obstruct the establishment of the truth and commit fresh crimes \u201d . The applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the order to extend his detention . On CARDINAL DATE the appeal was received by ORG , which on DATE dismissed the applicant 's appeal , his defence counsel being present . The court again stated that \u201c the applicant had been charged with a serious crime , therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he could attempt to hide from investigators and the court and would obstruct the investigation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the \u0160iauliai City District Court extended the term of the applicant 's detention until CARDINAL DATE . Listing the charges against the applicant the court stated that \u201c the applicant had been charged with a serious crime , therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he would try to abscond from the investigators , commit fresh crimes and influence witnesses \u201d . The applicant and his lawyer were present .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the term of the applicant 's detention until DATE on the ground that \u201c he had been charged with a serious crime , therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he would commit fresh crimes and obstruct the establishment of the truth \u201d . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing . The applicant appealed , stating , inter alia , that he had to undergo surgery .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE , with his defence counsel present . The court stated that \u201c the applicant had been charged with serious crimes , he had not confessed and his guilt was based on statements by numerous witnesses , therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he would try to influence witnesses and would obstruct the establishment of the truth in this case \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the term of the applicant 's remand in custody until DATE . The court again listed the charges against the applicant and stated that \u201c the applicant had been charged with a serious crime . There is a reason to believe that if at liberty he would obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case and would commit fresh crimes \u201d . The applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing that the investigation had been delayed and that the authorities had not exercised due diligence in investigating the case . The applicant also submitted that he had no criminal record and had a permanent place of residence . There was no evidence that he would try to abscond from the investigation or commit fresh crimes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant 's appeal against the order of DATE was dismissed by ORG , with the applicant 's defence counsel being present . For the court , the reasons for extending the applicant 's detention were that \u201c the evidence in the case allowed the conclusion that the applicant had committed the crimes he had been charged with . Given that the applicant denied his guilt , the lower court had correctly concluded that if released the applicant would obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case that is to say he could influence witnesses , either himself or through others . He might also abscond from the investigation or commit fresh crimes \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the term of the applicant 's detention until DATE . Stating the charges against the applicant in CARDINAL sentences , the court noted that \u201c the applicant was accused of CARDINAL crimes , CARDINAL of which was serious . The data in the case file allowed the presumption that the applicant had committed those crimes . Given that the applicant denied his guilt , it was reasonable to believe that , if at liberty , he could obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case and influence witnesses and co - accused , either himself or though third parties . He might also hide from investigators or commit other crimes \u201d . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , reiterating that he had a permanent place of residence and that there were no grounds to believe that he might abscond or obstruct the course of justice . The charges had already been presented to him . Moreover , notwithstanding the requirements of LAW to demonstrate the need to keep a person in detention , the prosecutor had presented no such evidence to the court . As regards the applicant , the fact that he had not confessed to the crimes he had been charged with was not a reason to assume that he would commit fresh crimes or attempt to obstruct the establishment of the truth in his case . Lastly , he mentioned that he had no prior convictions and had a permanent place of residence , his parents ' flat .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal , endorsing the reasons given by the lower court . The applicant 's lawyer was present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The \u0160iauliai Regional Court further extended the term of the applicant 's detention by the following orders :", "- order of CARDINAL DATE : until DATE ;", "- order of DATE : until DATE ;", "- order of CARDINAL DATE : until DATE .", "For that court , the reasons to keep the applicant in detention were that the applicant , if released , would \u201c attempt to obstruct the establishment of the truth in his case \u201d , \u201c influence witnesses \u201d , \u201c hide from investigators \u201d and \u201c commit fresh crimes \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at all the hearings at which his detention was extended .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution approved the bill of indictment concerning the charges of armed robbery against the applicant and CARDINAL other co - accused . The case was sent to court .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the ORG requested ORG to ensure that GPE and GPE , CARDINAL of the applicant 's accomplices who had testified against him and had been released from criminal liability by the prosecutors , were brought before the court for questioning . On DATE and DATE ORG and ORG informed the prosecutors that , according to the information they had gathered , PERSON and PERSON had left GPE and their place of residence was unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of complicity in armed robbery ( Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . The court based its conclusion , inter alia , on the evidence given by GPE and GPE , whose statements as recorded during the pre - trial investigation were read out . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , towards which the court counted the period from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , when the applicant had been in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that the proceedings were unreasonably long . He also alleged that the trial court should not have admitted the submissions of PERSON and PERSON in evidence , as he had not been afforded an opportunity to challenge these witnesses in open court . The applicant alleged a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Invoking LAW of the LAW the applicant also submitted that he had already been in pre - trial detention DATE and DATE ( from DATE ) and argued that the detention had been extended on numerous occasions without lawful grounds . The prosecutors had joined his case to other cases and disjoined it later . During all that time he was detained , the courts would dismiss his appeals to impose another , milder remand measure . Given that on DATE ORG had acquitted him [ in the second set of criminal proceedings ] and he had been released from pre - trial detention only on DATE , in its judgment of DATE ORG had wrongly assessed the time which needed to be counted towards the punishment .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered ORG to bring PERSON and PERSON to court for questioning . However , the police informed the court that it was not possible to summon PERSON and PERSON as they had left GPE . Moreover , the relatives of GPE and PERSON had moved house , therefore it was not possible to question them in order to establish where the former were living .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Court of Appeal inquired of ORG as to whether GPE and PERSON had crossed the State border and whether they had returned to GPE . On DATE ORG informed ORG that GPE and PERSON had left the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction . It noted that the trial court had based its conclusion on various pieces of evidence , namely the submissions of the applicant 's co - defendant and a witness , both of whom had been questioned at the trial . In the opinion of the appellate court , PERSON and PERSON had only provided information which was also known from other sources . Having analysed those other sources at length and in depth , alone and against each other , ORG concluded that even without the testimony of GPE and GPE there was sufficient proof of the applicant 's guilt .", "Lastly , ORG concluded that the trial court was impartial towards the applicant , given that it had substituted the charges against the applicant with a lesser charge , by convicting him as a person who had merely assisted in the commission of a crime and not as the organiser .", "CARDINAL . In contrast , ORG agreed with the applicant 's argument that all the time he had spent in pre - trial detention should be counted towards his sentence :", "\u201c The chamber notes the not entirely correct nature of the information given in the bill of indictment , to the effect that L. PERSON was arrested on CARDINAL November CARDINAL , remanded in custody on DATE and the detention continued only until DATE ; and that afterwards detention was imposed in another criminal case , adjudicated by ORG .", "From supplementary information ORG has received ( DATE ruling of ORG ) it transpires that in another criminal case , in which NORP Bal\u010di\u016bnas was convicted and acquitted ( ... ) [ paragraphs CARDINAL hereinafter ] , new pre - trial detention has not been imposed on the applicant ; it was the detention of CARDINAL DATE which was being continued . \u201d", "ORG upheld the applicant 's sentence of DATE imprisonment . However , the applicant was deemed to have completed the sentence in view of the time spent remanded in custody DATE from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a cassation appeal , complaining that his conviction had been based on the submissions of witnesses who had not been questioned by him or the courts . He also alleged that ORG had not examined the issue concerning the allegedly excessive length of the proceedings and the lawfulness of his remand in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's cassation appeal . The cassation court noted that the evidence leading to the applicant 's conviction had been properly handled and assessed by the lower courts . His guilt had been based to a substantial degree on the evidence given by a witness and CARDINAL of his co - defendants , who had all been examined in open court . The trial court was entitled to refer to the submissions by PERSON and PERSON , which had been recorded during the pre - trial investigation . The authorities had taken all the necessary measures to summon PERSON and PERSON to the hearing , but had failed to obtain their attendance in view of the fact that their place of residence was unknown . ORG acknowledged that the appellate court had not answered the applicant 's allegation that the investigation and his pre - trial detention had lasted an unreasonably long time . It noted however that these circumstances did not constitute sufficient grounds to find that ORG had failed to respect the relevant procedural requirements . Lastly , ORG noted that ORG had rectified the trial court 's mistake and correctly counted the period of pre - trial detention towards the time of the punishment .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , another set of criminal proceedings was instituted against the applicant . In particular , it was suspected that he had been a member of a criminal organisation , and that in DATE he had been involved in organising CARDINAL explosions in public places , causing a number of injuries to others . CARDINAL other persons were charged alongside the applicant ; the charges related to events which took place in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon approval of the bill of indictment , the case was transmitted to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant 's detention to be \u201c continued \u201d until DATE , referring to the risk that he would abscond , commit new offences and obstruct the investigation . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . However , on DATE ORG dismissed his appeal , referring to the gravity of the charges against the applicant . The applicant 's counsel was present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the applicant 's detention was extended by court orders of DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE and of CARDINAL May , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL October CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyer was present at the hearings . The courts referred to the risk of the applicant reoffending , influencing witnesses and obstructing the investigation . All his appeals were unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered ORG office to summon PERSON and PERSON to the hearing for questioning .", "CARDINAL . By the same ruling ORG extended the term of the applicant 's detention until DATE on the ground that he might influence witnesses and commit fresh crimes . The applicant 's lawyer was present at the hearing . The applicant appealed , requesting a variation of the remand . He submitted , inter alia , that the lengthy stay in custody had negatively affected his health . He also alleged that the pre - trial investigation had been concluded , and that there were no grounds to believe that he might abscond from the trial or influence witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal , endorsing the grounds indicated in the order of DATE . The court acknowledged that the applicant had been in detention \u201c for a long time already \u201d and observed that after the case was transferred to court , some delays had been caused by \u201c organisational matters of the court \u201d . Nonetheless , in the view of ORG , the length of the applicant 's detention was justified by the complexity of the case ( multiple charges against several co - defendants , numerous victims and witnesses ) and a voluminous case file . The case had been adjourned several times at the request of the defence to examine certain additional evidence , or due to the failure by certain witnesses or defence lawyers to appear at the hearing . The circumstances justifying the applicant 's detention persisted . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG further extended the applicant 's detention until DATE on the same grounds . The applicant 's lawyer was present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , requesting a variation of the remand . He argued , inter alia , that the pre - trial investigation had been terminated , most of the victims and witnesses had been questioned in court , and it remained only for the court to evaluate the evidence and pass a judgment . Thus it was not likely that the applicant would influence witnesses or obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case , given that he had not done so for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal against the order of CARDINAL DATE . The court acknowledged that the applicant had been detained for a prolonged period . However , in view of the circumstances , such as the complexity and volume of the case and the number of charges against various co - defendants , the court concluded that the applicant 's continuing detention was justified . The grounds for the applicant 's detention thus continued to persist - it was necessary in order to guarantee that he would appear before the court , as well as to prevent the commission of new offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of being a member of a criminal organisation which possessed explosives ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) , illegal possession of explosives ( LAW ) , attempts at aggravated murder ( Articles LAW , QUANTITY , DATE , DATE , DATE ) , and destruction of property ( LAW ) . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and fined , and his property was confiscated .", "DATE . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant . The court noted that the conviction was based to a decisive extent on the submissions of CARDINAL witnesses , PERSON and PERSON , who had not been examined in open court . The applicant was released in the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the prosecution .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the applicant lodged a complaint with the ORG , arguing that the conditions of his detention at ORG were inadequate . In particular , the applicant contended that the facility was overcrowded and that the cell he had been placed in was constantly damp , the mats were wet and a sanitary unit did not work properly .", "CARDINAL . In the report of CARDINAL DATE the ORG partly agreed with the applicant 's complaints , noting that ORG suffered from overcrowding ( QUANTITY persons were held there , the limit being CARDINAL ) and from a shortage of properly set up sanitary units . In the report the ORG also observed that :", "\u201c the fact that the applicant was detained for CARDINAL and a half years could demonstrate a significant risk that a violation of his right to a trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial , that is to say a violation of LAW , would be found . It could be said that a lengthy period of detention during judicial proceedings could have a disproportionate impact on his other rights : for example , the restriction on longer visits for those in pre - trial detention , no opportunity to take exercise , and other restrictions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In the operative part of the report the ORG urged the responsible authorities to resolve the problem of overcrowding and to evaluate the hygiene conditions at FAC .", "\u201c Detention on remand shall be used only ... in cases where a statutory penalty of DATE imprisonment is envisaged . ...", "The grounds for the detention shall be specified . The grounds ... shall be the reasonable suspicion that the accused will :", "( CARDINAL ) abscond from the investigation and trial ;", "( CARDINAL ) obstruct the determination of the truth in the case [ influence other parties or destroy evidence ] ;", "( CARDINAL ) commit new offences ... whilst suspected of crimes provided in ORG ...
