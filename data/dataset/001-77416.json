PERSON asked for the issue of custody of his daughter to be determined at the same time as that of the religious dissolution of the marriage . That request conferred full jurisdiction ipso jure on ORG to rule on the issue of custody rights .", "In his pleadings PERSON expressed the fear that his daughter would emigrate from GPE , which , judging by his wife \u2019s conduct , would sever all his ties with his daughter .", "...", "On DATE ORG made CARDINAL orders .", "In the first one it ordered PERSON to bring her daughter back to GPE within DATE , failing which her action would be deemed \u201c wrongful removal of the child \u201d within the meaning of LAW ( \u201c LAW ) . The first applicant was informed of the order by telephone , and subsequently by fax and mail , and was given DATE in which to reply .", "Before giving its ruling , ORG found it to be established that after their marriage the couple had elected GPE as the family \u2019s fixed place of residence , and that PERSON , although a NORP national , had continually lived in GPE , had obtained a driving licence and work permit in that country and had opened a bank account there . Pointing out that the child was a minor , of NORP nationality and resident in GPE , ORG noted that the mother had taken the child to GPE on DATE supposedly for DATE , but had never returned .", "The order in question authorised the father to confiscate the child \u2019s passport , once she crossed the NORP border , and to \u201c use all means \u201d to safeguard his parental rights .", "In the second order ORG also imposed a prohibition on PERSON and her daughter leaving NORP territory .

PERSON is represented in those proceedings by CARDINAL members of ORG .", "As a first step , PERSON lodged a criminal complaint in GPE against his wife for child abduction . The PERSON public prosecutor \u2019s office took no action , however , on the ground that the case fell to be dealt with under LAW and should be brought before the bodies having jurisdiction to deal with it .", "Mr Chelouche therefore applied to ORG of his country , designated as ORG ( \u201c GPE \u2019s ORG \u201d ) , for assistance in securing his daughter \u2019s return to GPE , in accordance with the procedure laid down in DATE .", "On DATE , for the purposes of those proceedings , GPE \u2019s ORG sent the CARDINAL aforementioned orders of ORG to its NORP counterpart , namely , ORG at ORG ( \u201c GPE \u2019s ORG \u201d ) .", "On DATE GPE \u2019s ORG instructed the PERSON public prosecutor ( \u201c the public prosecutor \u201d ) to ascertain the child \u2019s current address , apply to ORG for an order prohibiting her from leaving NORP territory , and to summon PERSON in order to obtain a statement from her about the alleged abduction .", "On DATE the ORG decided , in case no . CARDINAL , to issue the order requested by the public prosecutor , and gave instructions for the border posts to be informed accordingly .", "On DATE GPE \u2019s ORG was sent CARDINAL further applications by the NORP authorities claiming that , under LAW , custody rights should be withdrawn from PERSON as ORG had found her liable for \u201c child abduction \u201d .", "GPE \u2019s ORG then instructed the public prosecutor to raise a preliminary question in case no . CARDINAL pending before ORG , requesting the court not to rule on the custody of the child pending the outcome of the dispute regarding her return to GPE . On DATE the ORG followed the public prosecutor \u2019s advice and withdrew PERSON custody of her daughter .", "On DATE friendly - settlement negotiations , conducted at the request of GPE \u2019s ORG and under the aegis of ORG , failed after PERSON insisted on his daughter \u2019s repatriation .", "On DATE GPE \u2019s ORG sent PERSON lawyer a request from the NORP authorities regarding the arrangements proposed by PERSON for visiting his daughter in GPE .", "On DATE the public prosecutor brought proceedings in ORG for the return of the child to her father ( case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "ORG held CARDINAL hearings in the case .", "At the hearing on DATE the parties submitted their preliminary observations . Counsel for PERSON argued that LAW was inapplicable in a number of respects to the case in hand and produced in support of that submission private legal opinions by NORP professors of private international law and NORP lawyers .", "With a view to proving that the child was socially integrated in GPE and had ties there , PERSON also relied on numerous documents and witness statements , and asserted that the girl had gone with her to GPE with the father \u2019s consent and could not therefore be regarded as having been abducted .", "PERSON , for his part , disputed those submissions and called CARDINAL witnesses : his uncle and mother .", "At the end of the hearing the court fixed the father \u2019s visiting DATE . The visits were to take place at the mother \u2019s home in the presence of a social worker , but without the mother being present .", "At the following hearing , on DATE , which was the last one , ORG first took formal note of the documents produced by GPE \u2019s ORG in support of Mr Chelouche \u2019s application . These were statements from nurseries and paediatricians in GPE . Also produced in the proceedings was an official record of the dates on which the child had gone in and out of GPE during the period DATE , drawn up by the GPE city authorities and the NORP and NORP border police .", "During the proceedings Mr Chelouche , referring in particular to the information provided by ORG , claimed that his daughter had spent PERCENT of her life in GPE . He submitted that his right was established and that a ruling had to be made expeditiously , since LAW required proceedings to be disposed of within DATE .", "The court then heard evidence from Mr Chelouche \u2019s mother and uncle and from the defendant \u2019s CARDINAL witnesses . According to the latter , the child and her mother had mainly spent their time in GPE , with the father \u2019s knowledge . The first applicant also produced a written statement to that effect by Mr PERSON , an NORP importer known to the couple .", "PERSON relied further on photocopies of her passport , declaring that she had never stayed in GPE for DATE out of CARDINAL and had always had her daughter with her . She also submitted several ORG opinions questioning PERSON \u2019s ability to assume custody of his daughter .", "In addition , PERSON challenged the participation of a public prosecutor in the proceedings and complained that the plaintiff was attempting to influence the court by referring to observations of ORG that were not based on any final judicial and binding decision awarding custody of the child to the father , that right having previously been exercised jointly by the parents in GPE .", "Lastly , PERSON submitted a list of further witnesses . The public prosecutor opposed her application to call them , arguing that the case was ready for decision and that , in the light of the evidence , the court should find in favour of Mr Chelouche .", "In accordance with LAW b ) , second paragraph , of LAW , ORG did not hear the second applicant on account of her young age .", "At the end of the proceedings ORG decided that the child should be returned to her father in GPE , and maintained the prohibition on her leaving GPE until the judgment became final .", "The court found that , whilst the parties to the dispute had joint custody of their daughter , PERSON had assured Mr Chelouche that she would go to GPE on DATE , as usual , and return on DATE , which she had not done in the end , contrary to the father \u2019s wishes . Having regard in particular to the official record provided by GPE \u2019s ORG , the court found that , during the period DATE , that is , until PERSON was removed , she had spent DATE outside GPE .", "The other relevant passages from the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c ... The ORG can not accept the argument submitted by the defendant and her representative that the child \u2019s habitual place of residence is not GPE . In the light of the CARDINAL - page official document issued by ORG ... setting out the dates of the child \u2019s entry into and exit from GPE DATE ... and the other documents ... , it is established that , from her birth onwards , the child spent most of her life in GPE . The assertion regarding the habitual place of residence is therefore inadmissible , particularly when regard is had to the fact that the defendant declared on DATE before the PERSON public prosecutor that she had lived in GPE for DATE that elapsed following the marriage . The child \u2019s habitual place of residence , prior to her removal , was therefore GPE , notwithstanding the contrary statements by the defendant \u2019s witnesses , which are not based on established facts and are contradicted by the official documents filed in the proceedings .", "Nor can the ORG accept the final submission of the defendant \u2019s representative , based on LAW b ) of LAW , according to which the conditions for ordering the child \u2019s return are not satisfied on account of the state of war affecting GPE . It would appear that life in GPE pursues its normal course regarding , among other things , teaching , education , business , tourism , etc . , and that the conflict and disorder in the country are confined to certain specific regions . Moreover , the conflict , which is not new and has been going on for DATE , did not stop the parties from continuing to live in GPE . Furthermore , the existence of a grave risk , within the meaning of LAW ( b ) of LAW , that her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation has not been established . Thus , the conditions for refusing to return the child , as specified in the said LAW , have not been made out . \u201d", "The judge of ORG concluded as follows :", "\u201c ... After hearing the parties\u2019 submissions , I consider it established that PERSON was taken to GPE by her mother and subsequently removed ... from her father , contrary to the latter \u2019s wishes , in breach of LAW ... I also consider it established that the requirements regarding the time - limit stipulated in LAW of [ that convention ] are satisfied , but that the conditions capable of justifying a refusal to return the child in the light of LAW and DATE are not . \u201d", "On DATE , following the divorce proceedings instituted by her husband , PERSON applied to ORG ( ORG ) , using an NORP lawyer . The application , which was lodged on PERSON behalf , sought to challenge the jurisdiction of the religious courts on the ground that the mother was not an NORP national and did not reside in GPE .", "However , after a thorough examination of the case another lawyer convinced the first applicant that the application \u201c stood no chance of success \u201d , and she withdrew it on DATE .", "On DATE PERSON final application for reinstatement of custody of her daughter , in case no . CARDINAL , was dismissed by ORG , having regard to the order for the child \u2019s return in case no . CARDINAL - CARDINAL .", "On DATE PERSON appealed on points of law against the decision to return the child to her father . Relying on the concept of the \u201c best interest of the child \u201d , she maintained that her daughter \u2019s habitual residence was in GPE . In her submission , a child could have several places of residence , under the rules of international law , and , in any event , LAW could not be applied merely by calculating DATE the child had spent in GPE .", "The first applicant argued that the child could not therefore be considered to have been abducted , especially as the father had knowingly agreed to the child gradually settling in GPE ; PERSON had neither a fixed place of residence nor regular work commitments in GPE , and had himself been keen to settle elsewhere .", "According to PERSON , he had in fact acted in bad faith in order to have the child \u2019s habitual residence established arbitrarily , deliberately referring the matter to a rabbinical court , which \u2013 despite having no jurisdiction \u2013 had ruled in the absence of the mother on the basis of religious tenets and with total disregard for the principles of equality of arms and adversarial process .", "Lastly , PERSON lawyer referred to the prosecution \u2019s participation in the proceedings before ORG , alleging that this had considerably swayed the mind of the single judge of ORG .", "...", "On DATE ORG held a hearing at which it heard submissions from both parties\u2019 representatives . On DATE it upheld all the provisions of the impugned judgment .", "The applicant then lodged an application for rectification of a judgment .", "On DATE , at the request of its NORP counterpart , GPE \u2019s ORG instructed the public prosecutor to take the necessary measures to prevent PERSON from leaving with the child .", "On DATE PERSON application for rectification was refused and the judgment ordering the child \u2019s return thus became final .", "On DATE Mr Chelouche brought enforcement proceedings for the return of his daughter .", "Enforcement of the judgment was stayed , however , in accordance with the interim measure indicated in the case by ORG under Rule CARDINAL of the Rules of Court .", "A report drawn up on DATE by the social worker responsible for overseeing the parental visits noted that PERSON had made efforts to ensure that the child \u2019s meetings with her father were conducted smoothly and in a warm atmosphere . A second report , filed in the proceedings on DATE , on the date when the judgment at first instance was delivered , still referred to a harmonious relationship between the child and her father .", "However , the many further reports drawn up by social workers after that judgment were increasingly critical of the father .", "On DATE , when visiting the child at PERSON flat , Mr ORG allegedly attacked the social worker present , insisting that he wanted to talk to his daughter alone . He allegedly also caused damage in the flat . A complaint lodged in connection with those events led to the institution of criminal proceedings , which are still pending .", "It appears that relations deteriorated still further after that incident , and on DATE , at PERSON request , a second indictment was filed against Mr Chelouche .", "Following a series of psychiatric examinations carried out in DATE and DATE , in the appropriate departments of CARDINAL university hospitals , the second applicant was diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
