The first applicant , her husband and the other CARDINAL applicants were holders of a specially protected tenancy concerning a flat in GPE ( nosioci odnosno korisnici stanarskog prava ) , GPE , where they lived .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant and her husband divorced and the former was granted custody of the other CARDINAL applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant obtained a decision from ORG ( PERSON u GPE ) declaring her the sole holder of the specially protected tenancy on the family \u2019s flat . In addition , her former husband ( \u201c the respondent \u201d ) was ordered to vacate the flat DATE from DATE when the decision became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision of ORG was upheld on appeal by ORG ( ORG u GPE ) and thereby became final .", "CARDINAL . Given that the respondent did not comply with the court order to vacate the flat , on DATE the first applicant instituted a formal judicial enforcement procedure before ORG .", "CARDINAL . The enforcement order was issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiffs attempted to evict the respondent together with his new wife and minor children but the eviction was adjourned because he threatened to use force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE they tried again , this time assisted by the police , but apparently the planned eviction was adjourned for the same reason .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant bought the flat and became its owner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bailiffs and the police once again failed to evict the respondent who kept threatening the first applicant in their presence and bore arms on his person . There also appear to have been additional weapons , ammunition and even a bomb in the flat at the time . The police took the respondent to their station but released him shortly afterwards without pressing charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE another CARDINAL scheduled evictions failed , the latter due to the \u201c respondent \u2019s request for the provision of social assistance \u201d in respect of his minor children .", "CARDINAL .

In DATE another eviction was attempted but failed . In the presence of police officers , fire fighters , paramedics , bailiffs and the enforcement judge herself , as well as his wife and their children , the respondent threatened to blow up the entire flat . His neighbours also seem to have opposed the eviction , some of them apparently going so far as to physically confront the police .", "CARDINAL . NORP Throughout DATE the first applicant complained to numerous ORG bodies about the non - enforcement of the judgment rendered in her favour , but to no avail .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE and DATE , respectively , the enforcement judge sent letters to ORG , seeking assistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge was told , at a meeting with the police , that the eviction in question was too dangerous to be carried out , that the respondent could blow up the entire building by means of a remote control device , and that the officers themselves were not equipped to deal with a situation of this sort . The police therefore proposed that the applicants be provided with another flat instead of the CARDINAL in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the enforcement judge urged ORG to secure the kind of police assistance needed for the respondent \u2019s ultimate eviction .", "CARDINAL .
