THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 11 - Freedom of assembly and association (Article 11-1 - Freedom of association)", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson;George Nicolaou;Lech Garlicki;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was employed by ORG ( \u201c Serco \u201d ) from DATE to his dismissal on DATE . Serco provided transport to local authorities , including ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , who is white NORP , was employed formerly as a driver \u2019s escort and latterly as a driver . As such , he was responsible for transporting children and adults with physical and/or mental disabilities within the GPE area . The majority of his passengers were NORP in origin . There had been no complaints about his work or his conduct at work and his supervisor , who was of NORP origin , had nominated him for the award of \u201c first - class employee \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a local newspaper article published in GPE and the surrounding areas identified the applicant as a candidate for ORG ( \u201c the BNP \u201d ) in the forthcoming local elections . On DATE , the applicant was temporarily assigned to deliver mail to local council offices .", "CARDINAL . At the relevant time the ORG only extended membership to white nationals . According to its constitution it was :", "\u201c wholly opposed to any form of integration between NORP and non - NORP peoples . It is therefore committed to stemming and reversing the tide of non - white immigration and to restoring , by legal changes , negotiation and consent , the overwhelmingly white makeup of the NORP population that existed in GPE prior to DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE UNISON , the public sector workers\u2019 trade union , sent a letter to PERSON stating that many of its members found the applicant \u2019s continued employment a \u201c significant cause for concern , bearing in mind the ORG \u2019s overt and racist / fascist agenda . \u201d The letter advised Serco that PERCENT of its customer base and PERCENT of its workforce were of NORP origin . ORG asked that Serco take immediate action to ensure its members were not subjected to racial hatred . Another trade union , ORG , and a number of employees also made representations to ORG about the applicant \u2019s continued employment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was elected as a local councillor for the ORG . After taking legal advice PERSON summarily dismissed him on DATE . PERSON cited , inter alia , potential health and safety risks as the applicant \u2019s continued employment would give rise to considerable anxiety among passengers and their carers . It also expressed concern that the applicant \u2019s continued employment could jeopardise its reputation and possibly lead to the loss of its contract with ORG .", "CARDINAL . Ordinarily , DATE service is required before an employee can bring an action for unfair dismissal under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , although this qualifying period does not apply where the dismissal was on grounds of pregnancy , race , sex or religion . The applicant therefore lacked sufficient continuous service to bring an action for unfair dismissal . However , on DATE he lodged a statutory claim of race discrimination in the ORG pursuant to LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that he had been unlawfully discriminated against as his dismissal constituted less favourable treatment on racial grounds . The racial grounds relied on were those of the passengers and employees of Serco who were of NORP origin . He further argued that since the ORG was a \u201c whites - only \u201d party , his dismissal also constituted indirect racial discrimination .", "CARDINAL . The Employment Tribunal gave judgment on DATE . It noted ORG \u2019s concerns that the applicant \u2019s continued employment might lead to difficulties with other employees ; damage its relationship with the unions ; lead to attacks on ORG \u2019s minibuses which would jeopardise the health and safety of ORG \u2019s staff , its vulnerable passengers , and the applicant himself ; cause considerable anxiety amongst Serco \u2019s passengers and those relatives / carers entrusting vulnerable passengers to its care ; and damage its reputation so as potentially to place at risk existing contracts and future bids for work in the public sector and elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the claim of direct discrimination as it was satisfied that if any discrimination existed against the claimant it was not on racial grounds but rather on health and safety grounds . The ORG also dismissed the claim of indirect discrimination on the ground that the applicant \u2019s dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim , namely the maintenance of health and safety .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG . On DATE his appeal was upheld on the ground that the ORG had erred in its construction of the phrase \u201c on racial grounds \u201d by failing to interpret its meaning broadly and had not indicated how it had come to the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving the aim of ensuring health and safety because , inter alia , there had been no consideration of any alternatives to dismissal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was granted permission to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed ORG \u2019s appeal and restored the order of ORG . ORG found the applicant \u2019s submission that he had been subjected to direct race discrimination to be wrong in principle and inconsistent with the purposes of the legislation .", "CARDINAL . In rejecting the claim of direct discrimination , ORG noted that :", "\u201c Mr PERSON was treated less favourably not on the ground that he was white , but on the ground of a particular non - racial characteristic shared by him with a tiny proportion of the white population , that is membership of and standing for election for a political party like the BNP . PERSON was not adopting a policy which discriminated on the basis of a dividing line of colour or race . PERSON would apply the same approach to a member of a similar political party , which confined its membership to black people . The dividing line of colour or race was not made by Serco , but by the ORG which defines its own composition by colour or race . Mr PERSON can not credibly make a claim of direct race discrimination by Serco against him on the ground that he is white by relying on the decision of his own chosen political party to limit its membership to white people . The ORG can not make a non - racial criterion ( party membership ) a racial one by the terms of its constitution limiting membership to white people . Properly analysed Mr PERSON \u2019s complaint is of discrimination on political grounds , which falls outside the anti - discrimination laws . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In rejecting the claim of indirect discrimination , the following was noted :", "\u201c For indirect discrimination ... it is necessary to identify a \u2018 provision , criterion or ORG which ORG has applied or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or colour . ... Mr PERSON ... failed to present the tribunal with a case , which satisfied the requisite elements of a claim for indirect race discrimination and upon which the tribunal could properly make a finding of indirect race discrimination ....", "The employment tribunal appears to have attempted itself a version of a \u2018 provision , criterion or ORG in paragraph CARDINAL of its decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , it is formulated too narrowly ( membership of the BNP ) to be meaningful . A provision of \u2018 membership of the BNP\u2019 could not be applied to a person who was not of the same colour as Mr PERSON , because only persons of the same colour as him ( white ) are eligible to be members of the BNP . A more general and meaningful provision along similar lines would be one applying to membership of a political organisation like the BNP , which existed to promote views hostile to members of a different colour than those that belonged to the organisation . If such a provision were applied , however , it would not put persons of the same race as Mr PERSON \u2018 at a particular NORP when compared with other persons within section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) of LAW . All such political activists would be at the same disadvantage , whatever colour they were . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , with regard to the applicant \u2019s contention that he had been subjected to less favourable treatment arising from membership of a political party contrary to his Convention rights under Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE and that this should have been taken into account in deciding whether indirect discrimination had been justified , ORG stated that :", "\u201c LAW does not assist PERSON in this case . He is not entitled to make a claim under it as Serco is not a public authority . LAW does not assist , as there is no respect in which the relevant provisions of LAW are incompatible with the Convention rights . As for justification under LAW I have already explained that it does not arise , as no case of indirect discrimination has been made out . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was refused leave to appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , an employee has the right not to be unfairly dismissed by his employer . By section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , an employer must show a reason for a dismissal falling within a category set out in section PERSON ) , which includes \u201c conduct \u201d or \u201c some other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the dismissal of an employee holding the position which the employee held \u201d .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) deals with fairness :", "\u201c Where the employer has fulfilled the requirements of subsection ( CARDINAL ) , the determination of the question whether the dismissal is fair or unfair ( having regard to the reason shown by the employer ) \u2013", "( a ) depends on whether in the circumstances ( including the size and administrative resources of the employer \u2019s undertaking ) the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably in treating it as a sufficient reason for dismissing the employee , and", "( b ) shall be determined in accordance with equity and the substantial merits of the case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , paragraph CARDINAL provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) LAW does not apply to the dismissal of an employee unless he has been continuously employed for a period of not less than DATE ending with the effective date of termination . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW provides a wide variety of exceptions from the DATE qualifying period , many of which derive from GPE implementation of ORG legislation in the field of employment . These exceptions include situations in which an employee has been dismissed on grounds of pregnancy or taking parental leave , refusing to comply with a requirement imposed in contravention of ORG , or where the employee has made a public interest disclosure against the employer . Moreover , applicants alleging that they were dismissed on account of their race , sex or religion are also exempt from the DATE qualifying period .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE states the following :", "\u201c A person discriminates against another in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if-", "( a ) on racial grounds he treats that other less favourably than he treats or would treat other persons . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL A of the Race Relations Act DATE states :", "\u201c A person also discriminates against another if , in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision referred to in subsection ( ORG ) , he applies to that other provision , criterion or practice which he applies or would apply equally to persons not of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other , but", "( a ) which puts or would put persons of the same race or ethnic or national origins as that other at a particular disadvantage when compared with other persons ;", "( b ) which puts that other at that disadvantage , and", "( c ) which he can not show to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["11-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
