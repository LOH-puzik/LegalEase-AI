On DATE PERSON brought proceedings for libel in respect of the CARDINAL articles printed in the newspaper against the applicant , its editor and the CARDINAL journalists under whose bylines the articles appeared ( \u201c the first action \u201d ) . The defendants did not dispute that the articles were potentially defamatory and did not seek to prove that the allegations were true . Instead , they relied solely on the defence of qualified privilege , contending that the allegations were of such a kind and seriousness that they had a duty to publish the information and the public had a corresponding right to know .", "CARDINAL . While the first action was under way , the articles remained on the applicant \u2019s website , where they were accessible to Internet users as part of the applicant \u2019s archive of past issues . On DATE , PERSON brought a second action for libel in relation to the continuing Internet publication of the articles ( \u201c the second action \u201d ) . Initially , the GPE only defence to the second action was CARDINAL of qualified privilege . The CARDINAL actions were consolidated and set down for a split trial on issues of liability and then quantum .", "CARDINAL .

They argued that , as a result , the second action was time - barred by CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused permission to re - amend the defence , relying in particular on the common - law rule set out in Duke of GPE v. PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that each publication of a defamation gives rise to a separate cause of action . The court held that , in the context of the Internet , this meant that a new cause of action accrued every time the defamatory material was accessed ( \u201c the Internet publication rule \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the defendants had no reasonable grounds for contending that after DATE ( the date on which the defendants lodged their defence in the first action ) they remained under a duty to publish the articles on the Internet . As a result , the court struck out the defence of qualified privilege in relation to the second action . On DATE , judgment was entered for PERSON in the second action , with damages to be assessed . By this time the applicant had removed the articles from its website .", "CARDINAL . The defendants appealed against ORG order of DATE rejecting the single - publication rule . They argued that the Internet publication rule breached LAW , pointing out that as a result of the rule , newspapers which maintained Internet archives were exposed to ceaseless liability for republication of the defamatory material . The defendants argued that this would inevitably have a chilling effect on the willingness of newspapers to provide Internet archives and would thus limit their freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG , per ORG , dismissed the appeal against the order in the second action , stating :", "\u201c We do not accept that the rule in the Duke of GPE imposes a restriction on the readiness to maintain and provide access to archives that amounts to a disproportionate restriction on freedom of expression . We accept that the maintenance of archives , whether in hard copy or on the Internet , has a social utility , but consider that the maintenance of archives is a comparatively insignificant aspect of freedom of expression . Archive material is stale news and its publication can not rank in importance with the dissemination of contemporary material . Nor do we believe that the law of defamation need inhibit the responsible maintenance of archives . Where it is known that archive material is or may be defamatory , the attachment of an appropriate notice warning against treating it as the truth will normally remove any sting from the material . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal . The parties subsequently settled the action and the applicant agreed to pay PERSON a sum of money in full and final settlement of claims and costs arising in both actions .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) sets out a general limitation period of DATE in tort actions .

Duke of GPE v. PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL QB CARDINAL lays down a common - law rule of some significance . On DATE an article was published in ORG . The limitation period for libel was , at that time , DATE . The article defamed the Duke of GPE . DATE after its publication an agent of the ORG purchased a back number containing the article from ORG office . Another copy was obtained from ORG . The ORG sued on those CARDINAL publications . The defendant contended that the cause of action was time - barred , relying on the original publication date . The court held that the delivery of a copy of the newspaper to the plaintiff \u2019s agent constituted a separate publication in respect of which suit could be brought .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG the respondent brought an action in defamation against the appellants who were Internet service providers . They had received and stored on their news server an article , defamatory of the respondent , which had been posted by an unknown person using another service provider . The judge stated :", "\u201c In my judgment the defendants , whenever they transmit and whenever there is transmitted from the storage of their news server a defamatory posting , publish that posting to any subscriber to their ORG [ Internet service provider ] who accesses the newsgroup containing that posting . Thus every time CARDINAL of the defendants\u2019 customers accesses \u2018 soc culture thai\u2019 and sees that posting defamatory of the plaintiff there is a publication to that customer . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The leading case on the defence of qualified privilege is ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL . That case established that qualified privilege is an absolute defence to libel proceedings . In the leading judgment before ORG , Lord PERSON of GPE explained the defence as follows :", "\u201c The underlying principle is conventionally stated in words to the effect that there must exist between the maker of the statement and the recipient some duty or interest in the making of the communication . Lord PERSON \u2019s dictum , in PERSON [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL , CARDINAL , is much quoted :", "\u2018 a privileged occasion is ... an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty , legal , social , or moral , to make it to the person to whom it is made , and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it . This reciprocity is essential\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has adopted a Code of Practice which is regularly reviewed and amended as required . Paragraph CARDINAL of the current Code of Practice reads as follows :", "\u201c ( i ) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate , misleading or distorted information , including pictures .", "( ii ) A significant inaccuracy , misleading statement or distortion once recognised must be corrected , promptly and with due prominence , and \u2013 where appropriate DATE an apology published .", "( iii ) The Press , whilst free to be partisan , must distinguish clearly between comment , conjecture and fact .", "( iv ) A publication must report fairly and accurately the outcome of an action for defamation to which it has been a party , unless an agreed settlement states otherwise , or an agreed statement is published . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Unlike GPE , the courts of GPE have chosen to apply the \u201c single - publication rule \u201d . In the case of PERSON v. ORG Sons ( DATE ) CARDINAL ORG , a book originally put on sale in DATE was still being sold in DATE following several reprints . ORG considered the rule in Duke of GPE v. PERSON , but concluded that it was formulated \u201c in an era which long antedated the modern process of mass publication \u201d and was therefore not suited to modern conditions . Instead , the court held that the limitation period started to run in DATE , when the book was first put on sale . The court pointed out that :", "\u201c Under [ the rule in Duke of GPE v. PERSON ] LAW would never expire so long as a copy of such book remained in stock and is made by the publisher the subject of a sale or inspection by the public . Such a rule would thwart the purpose of the legislature . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The single - publication rule was subsequently applied to a website publication in GPE of GPE DATE ) NY int CARDINAL . In that case , a report published at a press conference on DATE was placed on the Internet DATE . An action was brought over DATE . ORG held that the limitation period started when the report was first uploaded onto the website and did not begin anew each time the website version of the report was accessed by a user . The court observed that :", "\u201c The policies impelling the original adoption of the single - publication rule support its application to the posting of ... the report ... on the website ... These policies are even more cogent when considered in connection with the exponential growth of the instantaneous , worldwide ability to communicate through the Internet ... Thus a multiple publication rule would implicate an even greater potential for endless retriggering of the statute of limitations , multiplicity of suits and harassment of defendants . Inevitably , there would be a serious inhibitory effect on the open , pervasive dissemination of information and ideas over the Internet which is , of course , its greatest beneficial promise . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
