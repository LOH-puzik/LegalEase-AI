The action was aimed , among other things , at obtaining the equivalent of QUANTITY ( ORG ) in damages .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the action was dismissed and this decision became final and binding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a claim to ORG for the remuneration of his services in the above - mentioned action in the amount equivalent to some ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . The applicant based his claim on the premise that the action of his client was pecuniary in nature and that its value for the purposes of calculating the amount of his costs was the amount of the damages sought ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim except for an amount equivalent to some LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the action of the applicant \u2019s client was by definition without a pecuniary basis and that , consequently , the amount of the applicant \u2019s remuneration was to be determined under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of DATE Decree on Remuneration and Compensation of Advocates ( Ministry of Justice Decree no . PERSON . ) with reference to an economic index rather than the amount of his client \u2019s claim .", "CARDINAL .
