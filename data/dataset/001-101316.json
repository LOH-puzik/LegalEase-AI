LIECHTENSTEIN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time)", "JUDGES": "Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant , Mr PERSON , was born in DATE , PERSON PERSON was born in DATE , Mr PERSON in DATE , Mr PERSON in DATE , Mr PERSON in DATE , Mr PERSON in DATE , Mr PERSON in DATE , Mr PERSON in DATE , Mr PERSON in DATE and PERSON PERSON in DATE . They live in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE a land development plan ( GPE ) was adopted by referendum in GPE . According to that plan , the main part of a plot of land owned jointly by the applicants fell within a zone in which the construction of buildings was not authorised .", "CARDINAL . By submissions dated DATE the first applicant lodged an objection with GPE which received these submissions on DATE . He contested the lawfulness of the land development plan and of the procedure by which it had been approved and requested that the plot of land in question be designated as building land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Municipality of GPE dismissed the first applicant \u2019s objection . It found , in particular , that the applicants\u2019 plot of land had not been classified as building land prior to the adoption of the land development plan either . The decision was issued and sent to the first applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint made by the first applicant on DATE about the municipality \u2019s decision . That decision was issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE the first applicant informed ORG that he intended to pursue his complaint lodged on DATE regarding the ORG \u2019s decision in person , his counsel having informed him that his complaint had no sufficient prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , having held a hearing on DATE in which it heard a witness and inspected the locus in quo , dismissed the ORG complaint . It noted that the first applicant , following doubts expressed by it regarding his standing in the proceedings , now brought the complaint both on his own behalf and on behalf of CARDINAL further joint owners ( CARDINAL of whom are applicants before this Court ) . The latter had also authorised the previous proceedings instituted by the first applicant alone ( a written authorisation dated DATE was submitted in the hearing ) . ORG found that the municipality \u2019s decision not to incorporate the applicants\u2019 plot of land into an area designated as building land had not been arbitrary , particularly when compared to the classification of other plots of land in the land development plan . The applicants\u2019 plot of land had not previously been in an area classified as building land and was not suitable for construction for lack of water installations .", "CARDINAL . By submissions dated DATE , which were received at ORG ) on DATE , the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG in respect of the decision taken by ORG . Relying on the principles of legality and proportionality , the prohibition of arbitrariness and the right to property , they argued , in particular , that their plot of land , designated as non - building land , had been treated less favourably than other plots of land in a comparable situation .", "CARDINAL . The final deliberations in private fixed for DATE had to be cancelled as , following the withdrawal of several judges , there was an insufficient number of judges available to hear the case .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE both the first applicant and GPE informed ORG that they had entered into negotiations following which the constitutional complaint might later be withdrawn . ORG deliberations in private fixed for DATE were accordingly cancelled . On DATE the Municipality informed that court that it had included a part of the applicants\u2019 plot of land in the area designated as building land . The applicants did not , however , withdraw their constitutional complaint thereupon .", "CARDINAL . By submissions dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ORG new counsel requested ORG to join the ORG complaint to that of PERSON and to hold a hearing . They further submitted that their right to an independent and impartial tribunal established by law under LAW had been breached in that the relevant provisions of LAW ( Gemeindegesetz ) did not clearly determine the body competent to decide on land development plans and as the citizens had adopted the plan . The land development plan of GPE was void as it had been set up in violation of the provisions for the protection of property . Furthermore , their right to property under LAW no . CARDINAL had been breached as the relevant provisions of LAW ( Baugesetz ) were not a sufficiently clear legal basis for the adoption of land development plans which interfered with the right to property . The adoption of the land development plan at issue had excluded the applicants\u2019 plot of land from the area designated as building land and amounted to an illegal and arbitrary restriction of the use of their property without payment of compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having deliberated in private , decided to adjourn its decision in view of the voluminous observations and requests to take evidence submitted by the applicants\u2019 counsel DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having deliberated in private , refused to join the ORG complaint to that of PERSON and , taking into consideration the ORG request made DATE , adjourned its decision and decided to hold a public hearing .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG held a public hearing . In its deliberations ( in private ) , it then decided to dismiss as inadmissible the applicants\u2019 request to declare void the vote of CARDINAL and DATE in GPE as the applicants had failed to lodge a separate complaint in respect of that vote with the Government . It further rejected the remainder of the applicants\u2019 complaints as ill - founded ( case no . PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that there had been no violation of the applicants\u2019 constitutional right to equality or of the prohibition of arbitrariness as it had not been unreasonable not to include the applicants\u2019 entire plot of land in an area designated as building land . Nor had the applicants\u2019 right to property been violated . The refusal to grant the applicants a privilege by not including their plot of land in an area designated as building land did not interfere with their property rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG judgment was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment adopted on DATE concerning a complaint brought by PERSON , ORG held that LAW had been breached in the proceedings before it ( file no . PERSON ) . ORG found that the length of the proceedings at issue , which equally concerned the land development plan of GPE and had been pending for DATE and DATE before it , had been excessive . The fact that PERSON had repeatedly asked to adjourn the proceedings shortly before the date fixed for the final deliberations did not justify the duration of the proceedings , in particular because ORG had remained inactive for a longer period of time after having held an oral hearing ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
