The applicant was born in DATE and lived until his arrest in the town of ORG , in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of attempted murder . The prosecution \u2019s case was that the applicant had shot Mr CARDINAL times in the course of a property dispute . DATE an investigator of ORG issued a wanted notice in respect of the applicant as he had allegedly left his place of permanent residence and gone on the run .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and was served with a bill of indictment . The charge of attempted murder was joined with another criminal charge against the applicant , of aggravated theft . On DATE a police investigator asked ORG GPE ) to remand him in custody . The investigator argued that the applicant had been charged with a particularly serious criminal offence , that he could reoffend or influence witnesses , and that he was likely to abscond , given that he had already gone on the run once and a wanted notice had been issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the request , having adopted the investigator \u2019s reasoning . In CARDINAL lines ORG stated that the gravity of the charges and the likelihood that the applicant would abscond or reoffend , as well as interfere with witnesses , warranted his placement in custody . The applicant \u2019s arguments that he had not absconded from the investigation , that he had not received any summons or notifications from investigating authorities although he had not left his place of permanent residence , and that he was seriously ill , were dismissed as unsubstantiated .", "CARDINAL . The detention order was upheld on appeal by ORG of GPE on DATE . The appeal court did not see any reasons to doubt ORG conclusions .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the prosecution authorities amended the charges , having additionally accused the applicant of several counts of aggravated theft and attempted theft and unlawful possession of firearms .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s detention was extended on a number of occasions . In particular , on DATE ORG , holding that the applicant was charged with grave criminal offences and was likely to abscond , extended his detention until DATE . On DATE , with identical reasoning , it extended the detention until CARDINAL DATE . Another extension followed on CARDINAL DATE , when ORG mentioned the gravity of the charges and the risk that the applicant would abscond and interfere with witnesses who had testified against him . The final detention order , identical to the CARDINAL previous ones , was issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was committed to stand trial before ORG . However , DATE ORG returned the case file to the investigating authorities for certain defects in the bill of indictment to be eliminated . ORG decision was quashed on appeal and the case was sent back to ORG for examination on the merits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of unlawful possession of firearms and several counts of attempted theft , and dismissed the remaining charges . The applicant was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . That judgment was quashed on appeal by ORG of GPE on DATE and the case was sent for a fresh examination . At the same time ORG , without providing any reasons , remanded the applicant in custody until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant asked ORG to release him on his own recognisance , arguing that his state of health , in particular the fact that he was suffering from ORG \u2019s disease and could not receive the medical treatment he needed in the detention facility , warranted his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the application for release and extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , confirming that his detention had been authorised correctly in view of the gravity of the charges against him , his personality and the fact that a search warrant had been issued during the pre - trial investigation . ORG also noted that , despite the fact that by virtue of the NORP law the applicant \u2019s illness could warrant his release after the conviction , the domestic law did not provide for a possibility to release a detainee on health grounds while the investigation or trial were still pending . By the same decision the court scheduled the first trial hearing for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the decision of DATE , endorsing ORG reasoning .", "CARDINAL . During the trial hearing on DATE the applicant , who had been carried to the court - house on a stretcher , complained to ORG that he was experiencing severe back pain and was unable to get off the stretcher and take part in the hearing . He asked the court to stay the proceedings and to authorise his release on his own recognisance , given his state of health . While the prosecutor supported the request for an adjournment , he asked ORG to extend the applicant \u2019s detention . ORG agreed that the applicant \u2019s health precluded him from appearing at the trial hearings , stayed the proceedings and extended the detention until DATE , citing the same reasons as in the previous detention orders .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , complaining that there were no reasons justifying an extension of his detention . He argued that the risk of his absconding was negligible , as he was suffering from ORG \u2019s disease , which significantly impaired his movement and was accompanied by severe pain . This was confirmed by a medical panel comprising specialists from ORG which had examined him in a courtroom on DATE . Relying on medical reports , the applicant submitted that his illness was incurable and progressed rapidly . The facility where he was detained did not have means , medical specialists or medicines to provide him with the medical care he needed , which could have reduced the severity of his symptoms . Citing various internal regulations of ORG and ORG , the applicant further argued that the domestic law listed his illness among those which relieved a convict from serving a sentence of imprisonment . At the same time , the conditions of detention in remand facilities were far worse than those in correctional GPE . In the applicant \u2019s opinion , it was only logical to relieve him from being detained in worse conditions in a remand facility , taking into account the state of his health . He also noted that he had never attempted to abscond from the investigation , and the warrant for his arrest had been issued without any valid reasons .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the decision of DATE , noting that the grounds which had warranted the applicant \u2019s detention were still present .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings were resumed on DATE . On DATE ORG again extended the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE , until DATE . The reasoning employed by ORG was identical to that of the previous detention orders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , having examined the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and authorised the applicant \u2019s release on bail of MONEY ( RUB ) . ORG reasoned as follows :", "\u201c The presented materials indicate that [ the applicant ] is suffering from ORG \u2019s disease and , given the state of his health , he can not be detained in a temporary detention facility . He is unable to receive the necessary medical assistance in the prison hospital .", "This is corroborated both by the decision of [ ORG ] by which the proceedings had been stayed until [ the applicant \u2019s ] recovery , and by medical documents enclosed with [ the applicant \u2019s ] statement of appeal .", "By virtue of the criminal procedural law the gravity of the charges ... is to be taken into account when a detention is extended , however , the gravity of the charges by itself can not warrant detention for such a long period .", "The case file materials indicate that [ the applicant ] has been detained since DATE .", "Neither the investigator \u2019s requests [ for extension of the detention ] nor the court decisions cite any real circumstances and evidence ... on the basis of which the investigating authorities and the court concluded that , if released , [ the applicant ] could abscond from the investigation and trial and reoffend .", "The presented materials indicate that [ the applicant ] has a permanent place of residence , has no previous convictions , has positive reports on his character , and is the caregiver for CARDINAL minor children .", "In these circumstances , the court finds it possible to change [ the applicant \u2019s ] measure of restraint to bail . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the bail was posted and the applicant was released . DATE he was admitted to ORG for inpatient treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of several counts of aggravated theft and attempted theft and unlawful possession of firearms , acquitted him of an attempted murder charge and sentenced him to DATE of imprisonment to be served in a correctional colony . The applicant was taken into custody in the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE , acting on appeal , quashed the judgment in the part concerning the applicant \u2019s acquittal , sent the matter for reconsideration by the trial court and upheld the remaining part of the conviction .", "CARDINAL . By way of a supervisory - review procedure , the Presidium of ORG quashed the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and sent the case to the appeal court for a fresh examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial judgment of DATE became final , with ORG fully upholding the trial court \u2019s findings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant provided the ORG with a large number of medical reports and certificates , describing in detail his medical condition , medical history and the medical assistance rendered to him .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the medical documents indicate that in DATE , during his service in the army , the applicant was diagnosed with reactive arthritis . From DATE he experienced increasing pain in the lower back . When he sought medical assistance he was diagnosed with ORG \u2019s disease . The applicant had treatment in various hospitals on a number of occasions . His condition is characterised by serious and constant pain in the spine , neck , chest , lower part of the back and hip joints , occasional pain in the knee and shoulder joints and hands , frequent shivering , and tightening of the chest , impairing breathing .

The disease has intense clinical activity and is progressing rapidly .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also produced a number of medical certificates issued DATE by civilian doctors , noting that his treatment was impossible in a detention facility .

On DATE a medical assessment panel declared that the applicant was suffering from a Category CARDINAL disability .", "CARDINAL . A medical certificate issued on CARDINAL DATE by a doctor at the IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL facility , where the applicant had been detained since DATE , indicates that the facility did not have the medicines which were prescribed for the applicant by a rheumatologist . A similar certificate was issued by the head of the medical unit of detention facility no . IZ-CARDINAL/CARDINAL on DATE . According to the applicant , in an attempt to replace the absent medicines required for treating him the facility medical personnel provided him with cheaper drugs , which led to an impairment of his hearing and eyesight , kidney and liver damage and loss of the ability to move . He provided the ORG with copies of CARDINAL payment receipts , as well as a number of letters to the head of the detention facility bearing handwritten notes by facility employees , showing that his relatives had regularly bought medicines and given them to the facility authorities , and that the authorities had handed the medicines over to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Relying on a copy of the applicant \u2019s medical file , the ORG submitted that following the applicant \u2019s arrest he was examined by a medical assistant . Given that he was suffering from ORG \u2019s disease . he was prescribed diclofenac , an anti - inflammatory drug , and arava , a drug for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant continued to complain of severe back pain , prison medical staff examined him on a number of occasions DATE and DATE , and added the following medicines to his regimen : aspirin , omez , tempalgin , duovit , movalis , an anti - rheumatic gel and PERSON \u2019s balsam . The record shows that the applicant \u2019s relatives provided the majority of those medicines . On DATE a doctor made an entry in the record stating that the applicant should be sent for a comprehensive medical examination to decide whether to release him on parole . On a number of occasions the attending prison doctors also noted that it was necessary to transfer him to a prison hospital , given the highly progressive nature of the illness .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant was mostly seen by a prison nurse or medical assistant . The prison doctor visited him twice , checking whether the applicant had received medicines from his relatives .

Further requests by the applicant for admission to a hospital for inpatient treatment were addressed by the introduction of another painkiller and a herbal sedative to his regimen .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was admitted to a correctional colony hospital on DATE , where he underwent a number of tests and continued receiving treatment . He was transferred back to the detention facility DATE , on DATE , with a recommendation that he undergo regular and frequent clinical testing and continue with the treatment .

The applicant \u2019s medical file also shows that the facility \u2019s medical staff attempted to amend the applicant \u2019s treatment , given that the medicines prescribed for the applicant were too expensive , and therefore the facility did not have the resources to provide them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was again transferred to the colony hospital , where he remained until DATE .
