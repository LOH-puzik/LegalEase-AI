Subsequently , a complaint by the applicant concerning long - term visits was accepted for review by the ORG \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered his opinion , which was not binding on the domestic authorities . He noted that the application of section CARDINAL of LAW was not uniform among the domestic authorities , but that in FAC , in particular , long - term visits were often refused in the form of a simple reply using vague phrases such as \u201c to be refused in accordance with the law \u201d or \u201c impossible to determine the visit \u2019s usefulness \u201d . The refusal in the applicant \u2019s case had been given in CARDINAL sentence , informing him that PERSON was not considered to be a close family member of his . No other options had been considered , such as , for example , whether the applicant could receive a long - term visit by PERSON in another capacity ( and not only on the basis of their relationship centred on PERSON ) . No individual assessment had been made in his case , which had breached the rules of administrative procedure .", "CARDINAL . On the one hand , the ORG observed that even if the applicant had complained to ORG and the administrative courts about the refusal of long - term visits , it was most likely that he would not have been granted such visits ; rather , he could only have received compensation .

On DATE the applicant applied to the administrative courts with his complaint concerning long - term visits .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant \u2019s compensation claim for CARDINAL NORP lati ( ORG ) was not admitted , as he had not lodged such a claim with ORG ( in contrast to his complaint concerning an action of a public authority ) . The applicant lodged an ancillary complaint against this decision with ORG , which was rejected on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined and dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . The applicant was present during the hearing and submitted that his relationship with PERSON and PERSON had broken down owing to the refusal by the prison authorities to allow long - term visits . The district court found that the applicant had on numerous occasions asked for permission to receive long - term visits by PERSON and PERSON It considered that the authorities\u2019 refusals to allow such visits had constituted an interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW and as also established by LAW . Notwithstanding that , the district court held as follows :", "\u201c The court notes that the applicant could prove his father - daughter relationship by showing the birth certificate of PERSON , where he is recorded as her father . The defendant [ ORG ] confirmed during the hearing that the applicant could receive a long - term visit by his daughter , if he produced her birth certificate . The applicant , for his part , considered that he did not need to prove anything .", "The court finds that the prison administration has not set an insurmountable obstacle by asking the applicant to provide documents attesting to his family relationships . The case file shows that the applicant has received several short - term visits by his partner , PERSON , and her daughter , PERSON , during which they could [ in principle ] have complied with the formal requirement to show PERSON \u2019s birth certificate in order to receive a long\u00adterm visit [ by her ] .", "In view of the above , the court concludes that the applicant and the people from whom he has asked to receive a long - term visit have not taken minimal steps to prove the applicant \u2019s relationship with PERSON This created doubts that the applicant had a family relationship with PERSON Thus the defendant \u2019s refusal to allow long - term visits by PERSON and PERSON was justified . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against this ruling , which was refused on several occasions on formal grounds ( failure to pay court fees and failure to provide a translation of the statement of appeal in NORP ) . After several unsuccessful ancillary complaints about these procedural decisions , on DATE ORG examined his appeal against the first - instance court \u2019s refusal to exempt him from the payment of court fees .

This decision was sent to the applicant \u2019s address in prison in GPE , as he had not informed the district court that he had been transferred to a prison in GPE ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the applicant had not paid the reduced court fees for lodging an appeal and had also not informed it of his transfer to another prison . As the applicant had failed to rectify the procedural shortcomings in his appeal ( he had not paid the reduced court fees ) , his appeal against the CARDINAL DATE ruling was therefore considered as not submitted .
