The court also relied on the self - incriminating statements obtained from the applicant during the investigation , having noted that the reliability of the verbatim records of the applicant \u2019s questioning at the pre - trial stage had been confirmed by the investigator and the lawyer who had represented the applicant at that stage , that the material evidence had been collected in accordance with procedure and that the crime scene reconstruction had been carried out in the presence of the applicant \u2019s lawyer and CARDINAL attesting witnesses .

As to the applicant \u2019s complaints of police torture and the investigator \u2019s bias , the court noted that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had raised such complaints at the pre - trial stage and held that they had been disproved by the results of the ORG inquiry .", "CARDINAL . The court also noted that during the proceedings the applicant had made inconsistent and contradictory statements concerning the events .", "CARDINAL . The court further relied on the statements of a number of other witnesses questioned during the trial , including the owner of the applicant \u2019s rented house who had stated that a gasoline can had been missing from the house and the father of CARDINAL of the victims , who had stated that his late son had had an affair with the applicant \u2019s wife .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal in cassation with ORG . Subsequently , the applicant amended it on several occasions . In his appeal the applicant focused his arguments on his disagreement with the factual findings of the first - instance court and stated that his wife had given false statements against him . The applicant also stated that that his colleagues could have confirmed that he had brought the jacket with him from work in GPE on DATE and that his other clothes had also smelt of smoke . According to the applicant , this would have demonstrated that the blood - stained jacket should not have been used as evidence of his guilt . The applicant noted that those witnesses had not been questioned during the trial .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further complained that during the pre - trial proceedings he had not been allowed to choose his lawyer and that the lawyer appointed to represent him by the investigator had had a \u201c preconceived \u201d attitude towards his duties and had not been \u201c interested in defending \u201d him . The applicant stated that no lawyer had been present during the search of his rented house on DATE and that his lawyer had not attended a number of unspecified investigative actions .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also complained that his self - incriminating statements made at the pre - trial stage had been obtained under torture and that he had not signed verbatim records of his questioning because his arms had been injured as a result of the \u201c lom \u201d ill - treatment . According to the applicant , the investigator had attached a pen to CARDINAL of his arms with adhesive tape and had manipulated the arm in order to reproduce the applicant \u2019s signatures on the documents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the conviction , having found , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s allegations of breaches of criminal procedure were unfounded .", "CARDINAL . A prosecutor was present at that hearing . According to the applicant , the authorities had failed to escort him to ORG , although he had asked to attend the hearing . The applicant did not provide any documents or further details in that regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to ORG to serve the remainder of his sentence .", "CARDINAL .
