MOLDOVA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "Giovanni Bonello;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Lech Garlicki;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Stanislav Pavlovschi", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Government of GPE submitted to ORG a bill \u201c On the Privatisation Programme for DATE \u201d . ORG adopted the LAW in DATE . The annex to the LAW listed the ORG property to be privatised , which included the CARDINAL - star \u201c FAC \u201d hotel . The Act established that ORG ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) would organise the privatisation of the property listed in the annex .", "CARDINAL . The ORG created ORG . In DATE ORG published an advertisement for privatisation of the hotel and set a reserve price of CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . In order to be allowed to participate in the auction , each participant was required to deposit MDL CARDINAL million in the ORG \u2019s account .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company \u2019s predecessor , \u201c QUANTITY \u201d ( \u201c S. \u201d ) , participated in the auction and on DATE was announced as the winner , having offered MDL CARDINAL . In order to be able to pay that amount , PERSON concluded a contract with an NORP company , \u201c ORG \u201d , for a loan of ORG CARDINAL . According to the terms of the contract , PERSON was to repay the loan within DATE and to pay PERCENT interest during that time . Failure to repay the loan would result in a penalty of PERCENT of the outstanding debt for DATE of delay ( subject to any eventual prolongation of the period of repayment ) , while a failure to pay the interest would result in a penalty of PERCENT of the outstanding debt for DATE of delay .", "CARDINAL . At S. \u2019s request , on DATE ORG decided to extend the period for the payment of the auction price until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE S. obtained a certificate from ORG confirming the credit agreement with \u201c ORG \u201d . It transferred ORG CARDINAL to the ORG budget within the new deadline established by ORG . On DATE it concluded a contract with ORG for the purchase of the hotel .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE S. was re - registered as \u201c GPE S.R.L. \u201d ( the applicant company ) . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant company purchased from the PERSON municipality the QUANTITY of land on which the hotel was situated , for MDL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant company , in DATE following the purchase of the hotel large sums of money were spent on its renovation and the purchase of new furnishings and equipment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG initiated a criminal investigation into the alleged unlawfulness of the hotel \u2019s privatisation . It established that no criminal act had been committed and closed the investigation on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE \u201c ORG \u201d assigned its credit rights in respect of the loan to the applicant company to the NORP company \u201c GPE \u201d ( PERSON ) . On DATE the applicant company pledged the hotel and the land as a guarantee for the loan from ORG In view of the applicant company \u2019s failure to repay the loan , ORG claimed in court the right to become the hotel \u2019s owner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in PERSON accepted that claim and ordered the transfer of the hotel to ORG requested the annulment of that order . On DATE the ORG annulled the order of DATE in light of the judgments of ORG of DATE and ORG of DATE ( in the annulment proceedings described below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG initiated court proceedings in the interest of the ORG ( namely , the State Chancellery , a subdivision of the ORG which was the former administrator of the hotel ) against PERSON and the ORG , seeking the annulment of the hotel \u2019s privatisation and repayment to the applicant company of the price paid .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the Prosecutor General requested the court to designate the applicant company as respondent in the case , since the respondent it had previously designated in its claim ( S. ) had ceased to exist . On DATE ORG accepted that request and ordered that the applicant company be summoned to its next hearing .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor General did not pay any court fees to initiate those proceedings , by virtue of an exemption provided for by law for court actions initiated by him in the interests of the ORG . In respect of the limitation period , he referred to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted ORG request and annulled ORG decision of DATE and the contract of CARDINAL DATE for the sale of the hotel . The applicant company was ordered to return the hotel to ORG and ORG was ordered to repay to the applicant company MDL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL at the time ) .", "CARDINAL . The reasons given by ORG for finding that the privatisation had been unlawful were : ( a ) the State Chancellery , as the former administrator of the hotel , had not given its agreement to the sale ; ( b ) PERSON ( the applicant company \u2019s predecessor ) had failed to pay the entire amount within DATE of winning the auction , as required by the auction regulation ; and ( c ) the price paid was some MDL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) lower than the hotel \u2019s real value . The court found that ORG decision to extend the period during which S. could pay for the hotel had been taken ultra vires . However , the court did not annul the decision to extend the time - limit or the decision setting the reserve price at MDL CARDINAL , nor did any other authority . The court also noted that S. had been the only participant in the privatisation auction , but did not indicate whether this was contrary to any law .", "The court ordered the ORG to return to the applicant company the price paid for the hotel in DATE ( MDL CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court finally ordered that each of the parties pay CARDINAL of the court fees , that is , MDL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , finding that both the authorities and the applicant company had acted in bad faith because of the above - mentioned failure to follow the auction procedure correctly . In particular , the applicant company was accused of contributing to reducing the hotel \u2019s privatisation price .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed to ORG , arguing that it had been a good faith buyer and had complied with all the requirements set by the ORG authorities during the privatisation , and that the court action brought against it by ORG was out of time since it had been lodged DATE after the relevant events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG noted that the applicant company had paid MDL CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in court fees out of the MDL CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) required . The court requested payment of the full amount of fees . The applicant company asked for permission to pay in instalments over a DATE period , but was granted DATE . It submitted documents confirming its inability to pay and relied on the fact that all of its assets had been seized by the authorities . On DATE the court refused to examine the appeal because of the failure to pay the entire amount of the court fees . That decision was final .", "CARDINAL . The Prosecutor General initiated new proceedings \u201c in the interests of the ORG \u201d requesting the annulment of the contract concluded between the applicant company and the municipality for the purchase of the land on which the hotel was situated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted that claim and annulled the contract for the purchase of the land because the land could not be separated from the hotel itself .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of \u201c FAC \u201d S.R.L. to the ORG began its activity in order to enforce the judgment of DATE . By DATE the hotel was transferred to its new owner , ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company sent the warrant for the enforcement of the judgment of DATE to ORG . It continued to write to various authorities about the non - enforcement of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . ORG requested an interpretation of the text of the judgment of DATE . The applicant company also requested an interpretation and a re - evaluation of the amount it had been awarded by that judgment , in order to take account of the effects of inflation on the value of the award .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG gave an explanatory decision in which it identified ORG as responsible for repaying the applicant company the price of the hotel . It also rejected the applicant company \u2019s claim for re - evaluation of the award since the hotel had been bought in GPE lei and not in any foreign currency and the law did not provide for compensation for the effects of inflation in cases such as that under consideration . The court informed the applicant company of its right to lodge a separate claim for any investments made for the repair and furnishing of the hotel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment . However , it annulled , as exceeding the powers of interpretation of judgments , the lower court \u2019s explanation that part of the judgment of DATE could be enforced even if the applicant company had not been repaid any of the hotel \u2019s price . The hotel remained in the possession of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in view of the apparent lack of resources in the ORG budget which was preventing enforcement of the judgment in its favour , the applicant company requested that ORG enforce the judgment by selling the \u201c LOC \u201d hotel and the underlying land .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the warrant for the enforcement of the interpretative judgment of DATE was sent to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The judgment of DATE was fully enforced in instalments in the period DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company initiated court proceedings against the Government ( including ORG and ORG ) claiming compensation for damage caused to it as a good faith buyer of the hotel . The damages sought MDL CARDINAL ( equivalent to ORG CARDINAL ) included the value of repairs and new equipment , the penalties for the delay in repaying the loan to ORG , sums of money taken from the hotel when it was transferred to the ORG and interest for the use of MDL CARDINAL over DATE , as well as compensation for the effects of inflation on that amount . The above amount included a deduction of amounts corresponding to the applicant company \u2019s profits from the hotel during the relevant period . It submitted that the ORG had committed the errors referred to in the judgment of DATE and that the ORG should therefore bear the consequences of those mistakes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected these claims . The court found that the applicant company could not claim to have been a good faith buyer , since it had failed to pay for the hotel within DATE as prescribed by the auction regulations . The court also found that the judgment of DATE had established the applicant company \u2019s complicity in \u201c contributing to reducing the hotel \u2019s price \u201d ( without giving any details ) , thus excluding the applicant company \u2019s good faith as a basis for claiming compensation , and that this also applied in respect of the claim for interest on its money in the ORG \u2019s possession .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the argument that the ORG had obtained unjust enrichment since there was a legal basis for the increase in its assets \u2013 the contract with the applicant company for the purchase of the hotel . The argument that the ORG had offered for sale an object affected by hidden legal impediments was also rejected as unfounded , despite the authorities\u2019 failure to observe certain rules during the privatisation of the hotel ( such as obtaining ORG agreement ) . Since the applicant company had known from the hotel \u2019s by - laws that the Chancellery was its founder and since the latter had not given its approval for the privatisation , the applicant company could not claim that it had not known of the legal impediment at issue .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed but was unable to pay the court fees MDL CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . It requested a court fee waiver until after the judgment , in view of the fact that it had transferred to its creditor all the money received from ORG after the judgment of DATE and that it had no alternative sources of income , as confirmed by relevant bank statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company \u2019s request for a court fee waiver . It informed the applicant company that the appeal could not be examined on account of the failure to pay the court fees . The new time - limit for paying the court fees was DATE ; the applicant company did not meet this deadline .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant provisions of LAW , in force at the relevant time , provide :", "\u201c Article CARDINAL", "The general limitation period for protection through a court action of the rights of a [ natural ] person is DATE ; it is DATE for lawsuits between ORG organisations , collective farms and any other social organisations .", "The competent court ... shall apply the limitation period whether or not the parties request such application .", "Expiry of the limitation period prior to the initiation of the court proceedings constitutes a ground for rejecting the claim .", "If the competent court ... finds that the action was not commenced within the limitation period for well - founded reasons , the right in question shall be protected .", "The limitation period does not apply :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) to claims by ORG organisations regarding the restitution of ORG property found in the unlawful possession of ... other organisations ... and of citizens ; \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
