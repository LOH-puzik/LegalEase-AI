NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE . He is represented before the Court by Mr Bo Johansson , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he entered GPE on DATE . However , the NORP authorities did not become aware of his existence until DATE , when the police happened to ask him for his personal documents . As he was residing illegally in the country , the police prepared for his immediate expulsion . The following day the applicant applied for asylum , a residence permit and a work permit .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( Migrationsverket ) held an initial short interview with the applicant on DATE , and a more extensive CARDINAL on DATE .", "CARDINAL . During the first interview the applicant stated that he grew up in the town of PERSON , but moved to GPE in DATE , after he had finished high school . His oldest brother lived in GPE and was not allowed to return to GPE . The applicant was arrested by the police and sometimes subjected to torture .", "CARDINAL . During the second interview the applicant , represented by counsel , explained , among other things , that his eldest brother moved to GPE in DATE to look for work and he married an NORP woman there . Since DATE the NORP authorities suspected that the brother belonged to a terrorist organisation and constituted a danger vis - \u00e0 - vis GPE . The last time the brother visited GPE was in CARDINAL . Due to these suspicions , several times the applicant had been detained for DATE , during which time he was interrogated about his brother \u2019s whereabouts , beaten and tortured . The first time this happened was in DATE . He could not specify how many times he had been interrogated . He lived in PERSON until DATE . He lived in GPE from DATE until DATE and subsequently moved to GPE where he lived until DATE . Thereafter , he moved to PERSON , but returned to GPE CARDINAL and lived there until he left the country . Every time he was in PERSON to visit his mother he was taken to the police station for interrogation . This also happened in GPE , the last time being at DATE . He showed marks on his head and arm which allegedly were from the torture carried out in DATE . He stated that those were the only physical injuries he had suffered .", "CARDINAL . Neither he , nor anyone else in his family had been politically active . His brother was not politically active in GPE and the applicant did not believe that his brother was active in GPE either since \u201c he was not that kind of person , who was politically active \u201d . All the applicant \u2019s problems were caused by the fact that his brother moved to GPE and was suspected of NORP terrorist activities .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had not been granted a passport , but had managed to arrange for CARDINAL via contacts . Since he arrived in GPE he had stayed with his sister , helping out with her gravely handicapped daughter , born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , the applicant \u2019s counsel stated that TIME the second interview were correctly recorded , but added that the applicant had also had a difficult social situation in his home country , including been subjected to social repression . Furthermore , the applicant suffered from serious psychological problems , such as nightmares , anxiety , depression and insomnia .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant asylum . It found that the fact that the applicant had waited DATE before he applied for asylum indicated that he did not consider himself to be in strong need of protection . Moreover , it found the veracity of the applicant \u2019s story questionable , notably since he had not himself been politically active and had not been able to submit the name of the organisation to which the NORP authorities accused the applicant \u2019s brother of belonging . There was no reason to believe that the applicant was of any particular interest to the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) , before which he repeated that he had been persecuted because the NORP authorities considered that his brother was a terrorist and that consequently , the applicant had been arrested CARDINAL times , during which he was tortured . His injuries were still visible although DATE had passed since the last time he had been ill - treated . The applicant also invoked bad health and a strong family attachment between him and his niece . He explained that the reason why he had not submitted his asylum application upon entry into GPE was that he feared being returned to GPE immediately .", "CARDINAL . In a submission of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel added that the applicant had been prohibited from leaving GPE and that according to new information from the applicant there was now a judgment against him for violating a travel ban . Thus , if he returned to GPE he would be arrested , tortured and risk being killed . Counsel thus requested an extension to submit the said judgment . Subsequently , at DATE , the applicant submitted fax copies of CARDINAL documents in LANGUAGE ( appendix nos . I , II , and III ) to ORG . CARDINAL of them was allegedly the said judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at a court hearing regarding reconsideration of a detention order against the applicant , a translator was present , whom counsel asked about the CARDINAL documents , notably whether CARDINAL of them was a judgment concerning a travel ban . The translator replied in the negative , but stated that CARDINAL document concerned a judgment imposing a DATE prison sentence on the applicant for membership of a forbidden organisation and another document was a summons to a court hearing .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , counsel invoked the judgment as proof of the ill - treatment to which the applicant had been subjected and the risks he would face upon return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG informed the applicant and his counsel that the documents , including the alleged judgement , would not be formally translated or checked for authenticity since they had been transmitted only as fax copies as opposed to originals . It further noted that the applicant had not provided a satisfactory explanation as to why and how he had been sentenced as alleged or why he had not previously mentioned or submitted the judgment . In reply , on DATE counsel maintained that the applicant \u2019s relatives had tried in vain to obtain an original of the judgment , according to which the applicant had been accused of being politically active in an illegal organisation called CARDINAL . However , the court refused to release the judgment in the applicant \u2019s absence and the reason why the judgment had not been mentioned before was that it had been passed in the applicant \u2019s absence on DATE after the court had asserted that the applicant was abroad .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , finding that none of the circumstances invoked by the applicant were strong enough to give him asylum status or to grant him a residence permit , ORG upheld ORG decision . More specifically as to the alleged strong family attachment between the applicant and his niece , ORG pointed out that the applicant had never lived with his sister in GPE , before she was granted a permanent residence permit in GPE in DATE , nor had he applied for asylum or a residence permit with reference to his family link when he arrived in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a so - called new application for a residence permit to ORG , adding that he had been active in the forbidden NORP organisation an - Nahdha and that ORG had not given sufficient weight to the judgment against him . He also referred to the human rights situation in GPE and emphasised that his attachment to his niece had become very strong , notably after his sister divorced her husband due to domestic violence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , again ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s application . As to the alleged judgment , referring to its previous finding , the ORG gave it little weight as evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant submitted a second so - called new application to ORG , enclosing a letter of DATE , repeated on DATE , by a NORP organisation called ORG ( PERSON ) , and a fax copy of a letter of DATE by ORG . The latter read as follows :", "To whom it may concern ,", "I , PERSON , Chairman of GPE ( ORG of GPE confirm that Mr. PERSON ( GPE ) is a sympathiser of our party . He came under threat because of his thoughts and political activities .", "Given the present situation in GPE , we consider Mr. PERSON to be a grave risk of arrest , imprisonment and torture if returned to GPE .", "Therefore , I would be very grateful if you positively consider his application for political asylum .", "CARDINAL . NORP By decision of CARDINAL DATE , ORG refused anew to grant the applicant a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , immediately before the implementation of the deportation order , the applicant lodged the present application and requested that the ORG applied Rule CARDINAL of ORG . On DATE , following an indication given by the ORG , the applicant \u2019s deportation was stayed until further notice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted further information to the ORG and enclosed a translation of the aforementioned appendix no . II , which stated as follows :", "Ministry of Justice", "ORG in GPE", "Ref . no . CARDINAL", "To LOC ORG", "Referring to LAW , you are requested to communicate to", "PERSON ,", "That he has been convicted in absentia by ORG in GPE by judgment of CARDINAL pursuant to LAW , and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for membership of an illegal party .", "The Registrar ( unreadable signature )", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG examining the applicant \u2019s case on its own initiative , in accordance with a temporary provision of LAW , found that the applicant could not be granted residence permits under the temporary wording of LAW , section CARDINAL b of LAW . Before it the applicant had submitted a summons for questioning of DATE , in LANGUAGE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant once again applied for a residence permit under the temporary provision of LAW . The application was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Before the ORG the applicant alleged , inter alia , that he was introduced to PERSON through his older brother at DATE , and that his brother had to flee to GPE by the time the applicant got involved in the party . He worked for the party by distributing messages , mail and leaflets . He was regularly arrested for periods DATE and ill - treated . At some point there was a nationwide warrant against him and in DATE he was detained for DATE . In DATE he moved to the country side around GPE and had agricultural jobs . Thereafter , he was no longer politically active but he remained in contact with some of the NORP party members . At DATE he contemplated leaving the country but did not do so until DATE . Before the ORG , the applicant also submitted the original of the letter of DATE by ORG . It had been difficult to obtain the NORP documents . They were not acquired by the applicant but by his sister and brother - in - law living in GPE , with the assistance of ORG , and with the help of a lawyer hired by the applicant \u2019s mother . Thus , the documents were transmitted by fax . It was not possible to send the original by mail until later .", "CARDINAL . Providing various examples , the Government pointed out that most of the applicant \u2019s statements before the ORG were new to them and not consistent with the information submitted previously before the NORP migration authorities .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , in DATE , the ORG requested ORG in GPE to provide certain information regarding the documents submitted by the applicant and allegedly issued by NORP authorities . Via an attorney in GPE , who submitted a report on DATE , the following was submitted among other things . Under NORP procedural law it was prohibited for any person ( irrespective of his or her occupation or authority ) , who was not a party to the lawsuit or who had not intervened during the legal case ( as an expert or a lawyer of CARDINAL of the parties to the legal matter ) to have access to the legal file . Hence , it was not possible to verify or disprove by this means , whether the invoked documents existed de facto . However , there were several irregularities in the documents invoked by the applicant . More importantly , as regards the CARDINAL documents invoked by the applicant before ORG , it was established that none of them was a judgment . Instead appendix I , II , and III were respectively a summons to a court hearing , an order of service and a certificate of service of a judgment . The CARDINAL latter documents contained references to a judgment against the applicant regarding membership of a forbidden organisation .", "CARDINAL . A new Aliens Act ( SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , replacing the DATE LAW , entered into force on DATE . The Act established a new system for examining and determining applications for asylum and residence permits . While ORG continued to carry out the initial examination , an appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision was determined by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL new migration courts . ORG was the court of final instance . It examined appeals against the decisions of the migration courts , provided leave to appeal was granted . Upon the entry into force of LAW , ORG ceased to exist . ORG acted as the alien \u2019s opposing party in proceedings before the courts .", "CARDINAL . The provisions mainly applied in the present case were to be found in the DATE LAW , now repealed . In accordance with the LAW , an alien staying in GPE for DATE had to , as a rule , have a residence permit ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . A residence permit could be issued , inter alia , to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , was to be allowed to settle in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . Serious physical or mental illness could , in exceptional cases , constitute humanitarian reasons for the granting of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . An alien who was considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection was , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d referred to an alien who was outside the country of his nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who was unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country . This applied irrespective of whether such persecution was at the hands of the authorities of the country or whether those authorities could not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . An \u201c alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d denoted , inter alia , a person who had left the country of his nationality because he had a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . By making that a separate ground for granting a residence permit , the legislature had highlighted the importance of such considerations . The correspondence between national legislation and LAW had been emphasised as a result .", "CARDINAL . In enforcing a decision on refusal of entry or expulsion , the risk of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment was taken into account . In accordance with a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien could not be sent to a country where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . In addition , he could not , in principle , be sent to a country where he risked persecution ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE an alien who was to be refused entry or expelled in accordance with a decision that had gained legal force could be granted a residence permit if he filed a so - called \u201c new application \u201d with ORG based on circumstances which had not previously been examined in the case concerning refusal of entry or expulsion . A residence permit could then be granted if the alien was entitled to a residence permit under LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW or if it would be contrary to the requirements of humanity to enforce the refusal - of - entry or expulsion decision ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , in its wording before DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Amendments to chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , of the DATE LAW entered into force on DATE , whereby a new legal remedy of a temporary nature was introduced . The new procedure for obtaining a residence permit replaced the rules relating to new applications for a residence permit laid down in chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , in its previous wording . Furthermore , the amendments to the DATE Act introduced additional legal grounds for granting a residence permit to aliens against whom a final expulsion order had been made . The object of these temporary amendments was to grant residence permits to aliens who , inter alia , had been in GPE for a very long time or where there existed \u201c urgent humanitarian interests \u201d ( humanit\u00e4rt angel\u00e4get ) . Special consideration was given to the situation of children . The temporary provisions remained in force until the new LAW entered into force on DATE . ORG continued , however , to examine applications which it had received before that date but had not yet determined .", "C. Relevant background material", "CARDINAL . ORG , GPE , Country Reports on ORG , DATE , stated , inter alia , of relevance to the present case :", "\u201c ... The government continued to commit serious human rights abuses . There were significant limitations on ORG right to change their government . Members of the security forces tortured and physically abused prisoners and detainees .

Lengthy pre - trial and incommunicado detention remained a serious problem . The government infringed on ORG privacy rights , continued to impose severe restrictions on freedom of speech and of the press , and restricted freedom of assembly and association .

According to ORG ( AI ) , police and prison officials used sexual assault and threats of sexual assault against the wives of NORP prisoners to extract information , intimidate , and punish .", "Charges of torture in specific cases were difficult to prove . Authorities often allegedly denied victims of torture access to medical care until evidence of abuse disappeared . The government maintained that it investigated all complaints of torture and mistreatment filed with the prosecutor \u2019s office and noted that alleged victims sometimes accused police of torture without filing a complaint , which is a prerequisite for an investigation .", "According to defense attorneys and local and international human rights groups , police routinely refused to register complaints of torture . In addition , judges dismissed complaints without investigation and accepted as evidence confessions allegedly extracted through torture . The government has the ability to open an administrative investigation of allegations of torture or mistreatment of prisoners without a formal complaint ; however , in those cases the results have not been made public or available to the lawyers of affected prisoners .", "Consistent with an effort to extract information or coerce confessions , reports of torture were more frequently associated with the initial phases of interrogation / investigation and pre - trial detention centers more than prisons .
