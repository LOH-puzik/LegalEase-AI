{"ITEMID": "001-71689", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "UTTLEY v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr S. GPE of PERSON , solicitors in GPE .", "The applicant committed a series of sexual offences before DATE : CARDINAL rapes , CARDINAL indecent assaults , CARDINAL act of sexual intercourse with a girl DATE , CARDINAL acts of gross indecency with a child , and CARDINAL offences involving photographs or pseudo - photographs of a child . He was tried and convicted in DATE , and on DATE was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment on CARDINAL count of rape and to CARDINAL periods of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment on the other CARDINAL counts . On each of the CARDINAL counts of indecent assault on a woman he was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . On the count of sexual intercourse with a girl under DATE he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment , and on CARDINAL of the counts of committing gross indecency with a child he was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , and on the other to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . On the count relating to the taking of the indecent photograph of a child he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment and he was also sentenced to DATE imprisonment on CARDINAL of the CARDINAL counts relating to distribution of such a photograph . All the above periods of imprisonment were to run concurrently . In respect of the second of the counts relating to distribution of such a photograph he was sentenced to DATE imprisonment to run consecutively to the other offences . The overall effect was that he was sentenced to a total of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . No appeal against sentence was made .", "At the time when the applicant committed the various acts , they all constituted offences under their respective statutory provisions , and at that same time the court would have been entitled to impose periods of imprisonment for the offences which exceeded the periods actually imposed in DATE . In particular , by reason of section GPE ) of , and \u00a7 CARDINAL(a ) of Schedule CARDINAL to , LAW DATE , the maximum sentence for rape in DATE was life imprisonment . The maximum sentence at the time for distributing an indecent photograph or pseudo - photograph of a child was DATE imprisonment . The position remained the same for both offences in DATE .", "At the time the applicant committed the offences the combined effect of section GPE ) of the Prison Act DATE , rule CARDINAL of the Prison Rules DATE and section CARDINAL of LAW DATE meant that a person sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment would have been entitled , provided he had been of good behaviour , to be released when he had completed CARDINAL of his sentence , and the sentence would then have expired . Release on licence would have been possible after expiry of CARDINAL of the sentence , that is , after DATE .", "As a result of the relevant provisions of LAW DATE , which entered into force in DATE , release on licence is an entitlement after CARDINAL of the sentence , and the licence remains in force until DATE of the sentence . In the applicant \u2019s case , this meant that he was released on licence on DATE , when he had completed CARDINAL of his DATE sentence , and the licence remained in force until DATE . During that period , he was liable to be recalled to prison if he failed to comply with the conditions . After the end of the licence period , he could be required to serve , in whole or in part , the remainder of DATE sentence if convicted of an imprisonable offence .", "The applicant took the view that the changes brought about by LAW DATE , which had the effect of imposing licence conditions on release for DATE , with a continuing residual liability to serve the outstanding term if convicted of further offences , amounted to a heavier penalty than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offences were committed . On DATE he therefore applied for judicial review on that ground , referring to LAW .", "The claim was considered by Mr Justice PERSON in the High Court on DATE . PERSON held that the purpose of the licence was \u201c to enable the prisoner to stay out of trouble for his own benefit and for the benefit of the community ... True it is that , if he breaches the licence , he is at risk of recall , but the licence is itself designed to avoid the risk of further offences and a return to prison \u201d . The court held that the imposition of a licence as part of the sentence did not amount to a penalty , and dismissed the claim .", "On DATE ORG held that LAW had been violated and made a declaration that the relevant sections of the DATE Act were incompatible with the applicant \u2019s LAW . Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c ... a sentence which includes a period of licence inevitably extending beyond CARDINAL of the term imposed is , in my judgment , a heavier penalty than a sentence without that requirement . The fiction that the penalty is DATE in custody in each case must not be allowed to obscure the reality of the effects of the licence . While licence conditions vary , and in some cases will be more onerous than others , it is not and can not be disputed that conditions will inevitably be imposed which are impediments on the offender \u2019s freedom of action . Moreover , the conditions create a potential liability to serve a further substantial period in custody , as to the provisions dealing with the effects of reconviction . Arguments that the purpose of the licence conditions is rehabilitative and preventative , as they undoubtedly are , do not detract from their onerous nature when viewed as part of the sentence . Whatever the purpose , the effect is onerous . \u201d", "In ORG , the Secretary of ORG made CARDINAL principal contentions :", "- That the penalty imposed was well within the maximum allowed by law in DATE ;", "- That the applicant was complaining about early release provisions , which concern the administration of sentences and are not covered by LAW ;", "- That the trial judge was required , by a Practice Statement which was issued on DATE when the DATE Act came into force ( Practice Statement : ( Crime : Sentencing ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL ) , to take changes in early release provisions into account when sentencing , and", "- That licensing provisions are not a penalty , but are designed to assist the offender in his rehabilitation and to protect the public against the risk of his re - offending .", "ORG allowed the Secretary of ORG \u2019s appeal on DATE . Referring to PERSON and PERSON v. GPE ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL/CARDINAL , GPE and CARDINAL , \u00a7 MONEY , ORG CARDINALVII ) , the ORG considered that the contention that they had to resolve was whether the word \u201c applicable \u201d in the second sentence of the first paragraph of LAW to the sentence that would have been actually applied at the time , or the maximum sentence that was available in law . They concluded that LAW only prohibited a retrospective increase in the maximum penalty that was available following conviction and not a particular penalty that might be awarded within that maximum . Lord PERSON summarised the position thus :", "\u201c It follows that LAW will only be infringed if a sentence is imposed on a defendant which constitutes a heavier penalty than that which could have been imposed on the defendant under the law in force at the time the offence was committed ... The maximum sentence that could be imposed for rape at the time the respondent committed the rapes for which he was committed was life imprisonment . That was the applicable penalty for the purposes of LAW . The sentence of DATE imposed on the respondent would seem manifestly a less heavy penalty than life imprisonment . \u201d", "\u201c Rules made under LAW may make provision whereby , in such circumstances as may be prescribed by the rules , a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for such a term as may be so prescribed may be granted remission of such part of that sentence as may be so prescribed on the ground of his industry and good conduct , and on the discharge of a person from prison in pursuance of any such remission as aforesaid his sentence shall expire . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment for a term of DATE may , on the ground of his industry and good conduct , be granted remission in accordance with the provisions of this Rule :", "Provided that nothing in this Rule shall authorise the reduction of the term which the prisoner is serving to DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) Remission granted under this Rule shall not exceed CARDINAL [ of the sentence ] ... .", "( ... )", "( CARDINAL ) This Rule shall have effect subject to any disciplinary award of forfeiture of remission and shall not apply \u2013", "( ... )", "( b ) to a prisoner serving a sentence of imprisonment for life . \u201d", "In practice , remission was invariably granted of a period of CARDINAL of the sentence , subject to the power of a governor to award loss of remission for commission of a disciplinary offence .", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The Secretary of ORG may , if recommended to do so by ORG , release on licence a person serving a sentence of imprisonment , other than imprisonment for life , after he has served not CARDINAL of his sentence or DATE thereof , whichever expires the later . \u201d", "A long term prisoner ( that is , a prisoner serving DATE or more ) is entitled to apply for early release once he has served CARDINAL ( not one third ) of his sentence ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "By section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , a long term prisoner is entitled to be released as soon as he has served CARDINAL of his sentence . Such a prisoner must be released on licence , and the licence ( like a licence under LAW ) remains in force until the expiry of CARDINAL of the sentence .", "A long term prisoner who is released on licence and recalled must be re - released as soon as he has served DATE of the sentence ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG ) Act DATE , which replaces section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act , empowers a court to make an order returning an offender to custody to serve the balance of his sentence if he commits an offence after his release but before the date on which the sentence would have been served in full ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
