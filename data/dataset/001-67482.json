It recommended that ORG ask each member state to advise it of the period within which it undertook to comply with the principle of non - discrimination .

The ORG had already examined the issues raised by the choice of family name by married couples in DATE as a follow - up to Recommendation no . CARDINAL of the XIIIth Conference of NORP Ministers of Justice .

The ORG reconsidered the question in DATE and then in DATE after ORG had transmitted the CARDINAL recommendations by ORG . The examination of the issue was entrusted to ORG . Experts from different countries were asked to submit observations on the legal position and practice in their country .

The reforms promoted greater clarity and complete equality between men and women before the law regarding their surname .", "CARDINAL . The ORG examined these observations in the light of ORG ( CARDINAL ) DATE and Recommendation R ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL of ORG . While noting that the solutions provided by the resolution were still valid , it found that implementation of the resolution by some countries was still incomplete even if most had eliminated all discrimination concerning the surname of spouses . Although the existence of different customs and traditions precluded a unique solution , paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL provided a large choice of non - discriminatory solutions . The committee proposed , lastly , that ORG fix a time - limit for undertaking legislative reforms .", "CARDINAL . ORG reconsidered the matter on the basis of that opinion . In DATE it noted that certain GPE did not meet the conditions contained in the resolution regarding , among other things , the joint name of married couples ( Extract from the report of the CARDINALth meeting of the ORG , ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL , Appendix III ) and asked them to re - examine their laws on this subject . It also encouraged them to implement the principle contained in paragraph CARDINAL of LAW on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women ( adopted by ORG of ORG on DATE , Treaty Series , vol . CARDINAL , DATE , no . ORG , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) and to withdraw the reservations made to this provision . In its conclusions the ORG considered that the diversity of customs and local traditions should be respected , but that the GPE concerned should be requested to take all necessary steps to avoid such discrimination between men and women ( nos .

In its draft opinion sent to ORG in DATE the ORG found that several GPE had recently amended their domestic laws in this respect , but that others had not yet done so ( no . CARDINAL ) . It considered that the diversity of customs and local traditions should be respected and that there was no reason to impose a uniform system . LAW ( CARDINAL ) DATE already provided a large choice of solutions ( no . CARDINAL ) .

The Government raised CARDINAL preliminary objections based , respectively , on the applicant \u2019s lack of victim status and the failure to comply with the DATE time - limit .", "CARDINAL . The Government disputed that the applicant was a victim within the meaning of LAW . They observed that at the time of her marriage the applicant , who was a trainee lawyer , was not qualified to practise as a lawyer . When she began practising she had already taken her husband \u2019s name . The Government therefore maintained that the applicant \u2019s change of name following her marriage could not have created problems in her professional life .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that it was during their legal training that trainees established their first professional links and that this period could not be dissociated from the rest of their career . She also submitted that , beyond the professional aspect , a person \u2019s name was particularly important in the construction of their identity . The obligation on the applicant to change her maiden name as a result of her marriage had thus given rise to an irreversible severance with her past .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is not required to determine whether the obligation on the applicant to change her surname as a result of marrying when she was a trainee lawyer may adversely affect her subsequent professional life . It reiterates that besides professional or business contexts , the surname concerns and identifies a person in their private and family life regarding the ability to establish and develop social , cultural or other relationships with other human beings ( see , mutatis mutandis , Niemietz v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The ORG considers that in the instant case the refusal to allow the applicant to use just her own surname , PERSON , by which she claimed to have been known in private circles and in her cultural or political activities may have considerably affected her non - professional activities .", "The applicant is therefore a victim of the impugned decisions ( see , to the same effect , PERSON GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government pleaded failure to comply with the DATE rule . In their submission , given that the situation complained of flowed from the domestic law the national courts were not in a position to accede to the applicant \u2019s request . In these conditions the application should have been lodged within DATE of her marriage , that is , by DATE at the latest .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that where no domestic remedy is available in respect of an act alleged to be in violation of the LAW , the DATE time - limit in principle starts to run from the date on which the act complained of took place or the date on which an applicant was directly affected by such an act . However , special considerations might apply in exceptional cases where applicants first avail themselves of a domestic remedy and only at a later stage become aware of the circumstances which make that remedy ineffective . In such a situation , the DATE period might be calculated from the time when the applicant becomes aware of these circumstances ( see ORG v. GPE ( dec . ) , nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIII ( extracts ) ) .", "CARDINAL . In the instant case it is true that the position complained of before the ORG was actually in conformity with the provisions of LAW . However , the ORG notes that in the proceedings before them the domestic courts could have directly applied the provisions of the LAW , which forms an integral part of the domestic law by virtue of LAW , or raised an objection that LAW was unconstitutional ( under LAW ) and , lastly , they could have granted the applicant \u2019s request . Consequently , even if it is accepted that the remedy offered only a remote prospect of success , as alleged here , it was not a futile step . Accordingly , it had the effect at least of postponing the beginning of the DATE period ( see , mutatis mutandis , NORP v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-B , LAW ) .", "This preliminary objection of the Government must therefore be rejected .", "II . ALLEGED BREACH OF LAW TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAW", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that the national authorities\u2019 refusal to allow her to bear only her maiden name after her marriage amounted to a breach of LAW , read alone and in conjunction with LAW .", "LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence .", "CARDINAL . There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well - being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [ the ] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex , race , colour , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , association with a national minority , property , birth or other status . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP In view of the nature of the allegations made , the Court considers it appropriate to examine the case directly under LAW taken together with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Government disputed the applicability of LAW in the present case . They maintained that the choice of name was not entirely a matter of a person \u2019s individual choice and that the States had a wide margin of appreciation in the area . In their submission , the legislation on assigning names had to remain within the ORG \u2019s domain and did not come within the scope of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that LAW does not contain any explicit provisions on names , but as a means of personal identification and of linking to a family , a person \u2019s name nonetheless concerns his or her private and family life . The fact that there may exist a public interest in regulating the use of names is not sufficient to remove the question of a person \u2019s name from the scope of private and family life , which has been construed as including , to a certain degree , the right to establish relationships with others ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The subject - matter of the complaint thus falls within the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant complained that the authorities had refused to allow her to bear only her own surname after her marriage whereas NORP law allowed married men to bear their own surname . She submitted that this resulted in discrimination on grounds of sex and was incompatible with Article CARDINAL taken together with LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Government acknowledged that it amounted to a difference in treatment on grounds of sex but argued that this was based on objective and reasonable grounds which prevented it from being in any way discriminatory .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the PERSON judgment cited above , they submitted that there was a link between family unity and the family name and that by providing that families should take the husband \u2019s surname the NORP legislature had opted for a traditional arrangement whereby family unity was reflected in a joint name . In the Government \u2019s submission , family unity was a public policy consideration and private life ceased where the individual entered into contact with public life .", "CARDINAL . Referring to the Constitutional Court \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE ( E CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON , see above ) , the ORG argued that the difference of treatment on grounds of sex was justified in view of the social reality in GPE . Pointing out that \u201c PERCENT of women had very limited economic freedom \u201d , the Government argued that a joint surname \u2013 reflected through the husband \u2019s surname \u2013 was designed to strengthen the wife \u2019s position in the family .", "CARDINAL . The Government reiterated that since LAW had been amended on DATE married women could now keep their maiden name in front of their family name .", "CARDINAL . The Government also pointed out that major difficulties would be occasioned by a change in the system of keeping registers of births , marriages and deaths .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that LAW affords protection against discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the other substantive provisions of the LAW . However , not every difference in treatment will amount to a violation of LAW . It must be established that other persons in an analogous or relevantly similar situation enjoy preferential treatment and that this distinction is discriminatory ( see , for example , ORG , ORG and FAC v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG \u2019s case - law a difference of treatment is discriminatory within the meaning of LAW if it has no objective and reasonable justification . The existence of such a justification must be assessed in relation to the principles which normally prevail in democratic societies . A difference of treatment in the exercise of a right laid down by the Convention must not only pursue a legitimate aim : Article CARDINAL is likewise violated when it is clearly established that there is no \u201c reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised \u201d ( see , for example , PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and PERSON and Others v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In other words , the notion of discrimination includes in general cases where a person or group is treated , without proper justification , less favourably than another , even though the more favourable treatment is not called for by the Convention ( see ORG and NORP v. GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Article CARDINAL does not prohibit distinctions in treatment which are founded on an objective assessment of essentially different factual circumstances and which , being based on the public interest , strike a fair balance between the protection of the interests of the community and respect for the rights and freedoms safeguarded by the Convention ( see , among other authorities , ORG and GPE v. GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment in law . The scope of the margin of appreciation will vary according to the circumstances , the subject - matter and its background ( see PERSON v. GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and Inze v. GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . However , very weighty reasons have to be put forward before a difference of treatment based on the ground of sex alone can be regarded as compatible with the Convention ( see ORG v. GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Since the ORG is first and foremost a system for the protection of human rights , the ORG must however have regard to the changing conditions in GPE and respond , for example , to any emerging consensus as to the standards to be achieved ( see , mutatis mutandis , GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINALIV ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s complaint concerns the fact that , legally , married women can not bear their maiden name alone after they marry whereas married men keep the surname they had before they married . This is undoubtedly a \u201c difference in treatment \u201d on grounds of sex between persons in an analogous situation .", "CARDINAL . The factual differences between the CARDINAL categories ( married men and married women ) to which the Government refer , that is , those relating to their social situation and their economic independence respectively , do not lead the ORG to a different conclusion .", "It is precisely this distinction which is at the heart of the issue whether the difference in treatment complained of is justifiable .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s submission , the interference in question pursued the legitimate aim of reflecting family unity through the husband \u2019s surname and thereby ensuring public order . The applicant refuted that argument .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterates that although GPE have a certain margin of appreciation under the Convention regarding the measures to be taken in reflecting family unity , LAW that any such measure , in principle , applies even - handedly to both men and women unless compelling reasons have been adduced to justify a difference in treatment .", "In the present case the ORG is not persuaded that such reasons exist .", "CARDINAL . ORG reiterates in the first place that the advancement of the equality of the sexes is DATE a major goal in the member ORG . CARDINAL texts of ORG , namely , ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL of DATE on equality of spouses in civil law and Recommendation R ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE on legal protection against sex discrimination , are the main examples of this . These texts call on the member states to eradicate all discrimination on grounds of sex in , among other things , choice of surname . This objective has also been stated in the work of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) and ORG ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On an international level , developments in ORG concerning the equality of the sexes are heading in this specific area towards recognition of the right of each married partner to keep his or her own surname or to have an equal say in the choice of new family name ( see paragraphs DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the ORG notes the emergence of a consensus among GPE of ORG in favour of choosing the spouses\u2019 family name on an equal footing .", "Of the member states of ORG is the only country which legally imposes DATE even where the couple prefers an alternative arrangement \u2013 the husband \u2019s name as the couple \u2019s surname and thus the automatic loss of the woman \u2019s own surname on her marriage . Married women in GPE can not use their maiden name alone even if both spouses agree to such an arrangement . The possibility made available by the NORP legislature on DATE of putting the maiden name in front of the husband \u2019s surname does not alter that position . The interests of married women who do not want their marriage to affect their name have not been taken into consideration .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes , moreover , that GPE does not position itself outside the general trend towards placing men and women on an equal footing in the family . Prior to the relevant legislative amendments , particularly those of DATE , the man \u2019s position in the family was the dominant CARDINAL . The reflection of family unity through the husband \u2019s surname corresponded to the traditional conception of the family maintained by the NORP legislature until then . The aim of the reforms of DATE was to place married women on an equal footing with their husband in representing the couple , in economic activities and in the decisions to be taken affecting the family and children . Among other things the husband \u2019s role as head of the family has been abolished . Both married partners have acquired the power to represent the family . Despite the enactment of LAW in DATE , however , the provisions concerning the family name after marriage , including those obliging married women to take their husband \u2019s name , have remained unchanged .", "CARDINAL . The first question for the ORG is whether the tradition of reflecting family unity through the husband \u2019s name can be regarded as a decisive factor in the present case . Admittedly , that tradition derives from the man \u2019s primordial role and the woman \u2019s secondary role in the family . Nowadays the advancement of the equality of the sexes in the member states of ORG , including GPE , and in particular the importance attached to the principle of non - discrimination , prevent GPE from imposing that tradition on married women .", "CARDINAL . In this context it should be recalled that while family unity can be reflected by choosing the husband \u2019s surname as the family name , it can be reflected just as well by choosing the wife \u2019s surname or a joint name chosen by the couple ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The second question that the ORG is asked to address is whether family unity has to be reflected by a joint family name and whether , in the event of disagreement between the married partners , CARDINAL partner \u2019s surname can be imposed on the other .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observes in this regard that , according to the practice of GPE , it is perfectly conceivable that family unity will be preserved and consolidated where a married couple chooses not to bear a joint family name . Observation of the systems applicable in LOC supports this finding . The Government have not shown in the present case that concrete or substantial hardship for married partners and/or third parties or detriment to the public interest would be likely to flow from the lack of reflection of family unity through a joint family name . In these circumstances the ORG considers that the obligation on married women , in the name of family unity , to bear their husband \u2019s surname \u2013 even if they can put their maiden name in front of it \u2013 has no objective and reasonable justification .", "CARDINAL . The Court does not underestimate the important repercussions which a change in the system , involving a transition from the traditional system of family name based on the husband \u2019s surname to other systems allowing the married partners either to keep their own surname or freely choose a joint family name , will inevitably have for keeping registers of births , marriages and deaths . However , it considers that society may reasonably be expected to tolerate a certain inconvenience to enable individuals to live in dignity and worth in accordance with the name they have chosen ( see , mutatis mutandis , PERSON v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVI ) .", "DATE . Consequently , the objective of reflecting family unity through a joint family name can not provide a justification for the gender - based difference in treatment complained of in the instant case .", "Accordingly , the difference in treatment in question contravenes Article CARDINAL taken in conjunction with Article CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to that conclusion , the ORG does not consider it necessary to determine whether there has also been a breach of LAW taken alone .", "III . APPLICATION OF LAW", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleged that she had sustained non - pecuniary damage which she assessed at CARDINAL ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government disputed that claim .", "CARDINAL . ORG considers that it is for ORG to implement in due course such measures as it considers appropriate to fulfil its obligations to secure to each married partner , including the applicant , the right to keep their own surname or to have an equal say in the choice of their family name in compliance with this judgment .", "While there is no doubt that the applicant has suffered distress and anxiety in the past , it is the inability of married women under NORP law to keep their maiden name which lies at the heart of the complaints in the instant case . The ORG does not therefore find it appropriate to make an award to the applicant , seeing that in the circumstances of the present case the finding of a violation , with the consequences which will ensue for the future , may be regarded as constituting just satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed ORG CARDINAL for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the ORG . She referred to resolution no . CARDINAL of DATE of the executive committee of ORG ( rate applicable from DATE to DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the information before it and to its relevant case - law , the ORG awards the applicant ORG CARDINAL .", "DATE .
