NORWAY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The application was lodged by CARDINAL applicants , namely Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , both NORP nationals , PERSON , a NORP national , and PERSON PERSON Dennis Bell , a national of GPE . They were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON Menno T. Kamminga , professor of law .", "The facts of the case , as described mainly in the judgments of the national courts , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE ORG conducted , with CARDINAL of its vessels FAC and ORG , registered in the GPE , and fast rubber dinghies stationed on board the ships , a campaign against NORP whaling in the exclusive economic zone south - west of LOC . The first applicant was Director of ORG in the GPE , and formally in charge as campaign leader on board the Solo as from DATE . The other CARDINAL applicants were respectively captain , deckhand and assistantengineer on board that vessel . For a month they followed the movements and catching activities of a whaling ship , the PERSON . According to its captain , the campaign had had as a consequence that the hunt was prolonged by a fortnight . The PERSON was the only vessel pursuing whales in the area in question on DATE , the dates on which the incidents giving rise to the present case occurred .", "The Solo arrived in the area where the PERSON was hunting in TIME DATE , just after the ORG had been put under arrest by the ORG ) . TIME a whale was shot from the PERSON . While it was lying on deck being cut up , a new whale was observed . The PERSON then manned the harpoon gun and followed the whale . This was observed by the applicants on board the Solo . Shortly thereafter , a dinghy was launched from the LAW and positioned in front of the bows of the PERSON where it drove in zigzag and otherwise consistently manoeuvred towards the last place where the whale had been seen on the surface .", "The Coastguard forced the dinghy away , and the Solo therefore launched another one with the third and fourth applicants on board , together with a camera man from a NORP television company . The ORG seized the second dinghy immediately but the third and fourth applicants were allowed to board the Solo again . They then launched a third dinghy ( this time without the cameraman ) on the other side of the Solo , unhindered by the FAC . The third applicant was navigating and she manoeuvred the dinghy up to the starboard side of the PERSON , then alongside until it was positioned across the bows of the ship . The distance to the PERSON during these manoeuvres varied from CARDINAL - CARDINAL to QUANTITY . The third and fourth applicants kept the dinghy in position in front of the bows and in so doing forced the PERSON to change course . The noise of the dinghy 's engine was such as to frighten the whale away .", "On TIME DATE , the second applicant , the Solo 's captain , acting on the instructions given by the first applicant as the responsible campaign leader , manoeuvred the Solo in such a way as to force the ORG to change course when chasing a whale which it had observed . Moreover , the Solo 's water canons were used in a manner impeding visibility from the PERSON and thereby shielding the whale . The intended purpose and effect of these measures was to prevent the ORG from shooting the whale .", "Following the above incidents the CARDINAL applicants were arrested and were held in detention on remand for DATE before being released .", "After hearings on CARDINAL and DATE , ORG ( herredsrett ) , by judgments of DATE , convicted the applicants , under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of FAC CARDINAL ( LAW of DATE No . CARDINAL ) and LAW of DATE , for having obstructed lawful whaling . It sentenced the first and second applicants to pay a fine of respectively ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL , or CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default . Moreover , under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL C of LAW , it ordered the confiscation of a dinghy belonging to the first applicant . The third and fourth applicants were each sentenced to pay a fine of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , or CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment in default .", "The second applicant then appealed on points of law and sentencing , while the other applicants sought to obtain a new trial before ORG ( lagmannsretten ) , or alternatively to appeal on points of law and sentencing to ORG ( PERSON ) . The first applicant also challenged the confiscation order . ORG ( kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) refused the request for a new trial but allowed a joint appeal on points of law and sentencing , as well as the appeal against confiscation .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the applicants ' convictions but limited the sentences to the fines imposed . It also upheld the confiscation of the dinghy .", "In upholding the applicants ' convictions , ORG observed that it was satisfied that the measures had a legal basis in Sections DATE , as extended by LAW of DATE . This was not prevented by DATE LAW on the Law of the LOC , which did not contain a general prohibition on whaling . Nor was it prevented by the moratorium in DATE for all whaling or the moratorium in DATE to classify minke whale as a threatened species , decided by ORG established under the DATE International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling . In accordance with Article V no . CARDINAL of the Convention , GPE had protested and exempted itself from these decisions by way of reservation , as ORG noted , on the ground that there was no scientific basis for upholding a total ban .", "ORG further considered whether the convictions were compatible with Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . While leaving open whether the acts concerned , in particular those by the first and second applicants , could be regarded as falling within the notions of freedom of expression in LAW in LAW , ORG found that the conditions for restricting these freedoms under the second paragraphs of these provisions had been fulfilled . Firstly , it was satisfied that the requirement of lawfulness had been fulfilled , as the interference not only had a legal basis but the law in question was also accessible and foreseeable . LAW of DATE had in fact been aimed at the specific campaign conducted by ORG ; the matter had attracted media attention and , according to the findings of fact made by ORG , the applicants had been aware of the amendments in question . Even if they had not , one could have expected them to acquaint themselves beforehand with the relevant legislation , under which the proscribed conduct was illegal even before the decree . Moreover , the measure had been necessary in a democratic society in order to protect the rights of others . ORG had demonstrated against whaling over a long period with a large amount of media attention , but its freedom to demonstrate had not been impaired by the disputed measures which related to CARDINAL isolated incidents where attempts had been made to protect the whalers ' lawful exercise of their right to catch whales .", "As regards sentencing ORG recalled that , under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of FAC , prison sentences should not apply to offences committed by foreign vessels in the exclusive economic zone , and that , under LAW ) of the DATE United Nations Convention on the Law of the LOC , prison sentences should not be imposed for contraventions of fishery legislation . It further observed that GPE had not ratified this LAW . Nonetheless , having regard to the preparatory work for LAW ( CARDINAL ) of FAC , which referred to the provision of LAW , ORG quashed the sentences in so far as they imposed imprisonment in default of the payment of the fines .", "As regards the confiscation of the dinghy belonging to the first applicant , ORG recalled that this had been used by the third and fourth applicants in connection with the acts leading to their arrest . On CARDINAL occasions they had , by the manner in which they had manoeuvred the dinghy in front of the PERSON , hindered the exercise of lawful whaling . Although a special provision on confiscation was contained in LAW , ORG was satisfied that LAW were applicable . The confiscation was also justified in the interests of ensuring the effective enforcement of LAW of FAC .", "According to LAW , vessels in a fishing zone must not manoeuvre so as to damage or needlessly endanger catching gear or reduce catching opportunities . This provision applies to all vessels , not only fishing and catching vessels .", "Under LAW , LAW , a person who by intent or negligence violates the provisions of the LAW may be liable to fines and , in the event of a previous conviction under the LAW or aggravating circumstances , up to DATE imprisonment . LAW , LAW , authorises the confiscation of , inter alia , vessels used in violating the provisions of the LAW . General provisions on confiscation of objects used in the perpetration of crime are contained , inter alia , in LAW of LAW . Under LAW such confiscation may be effected with regard to the possessions of foreigners who are not resident in GPE if it is deemed reasonable .", "Pursuant to LAW of DATE , LAW of ORG should apply to sealing and whaling activities and the provisions in , inter alia , Sections CARDINAL and DATE in LAW of the LAW should , as appropriate , apply to all activities other than fishing .", "According to LAW , its provisions do not affect the right of navigation in the exclusive economic zone under LAW DATE , and are subject to the limitations which follow from public international law and agreements with other GPE .", "In the proceedings the applicants referred to the following provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea , which entered into force in DATE and which were ratified by GPE in DATE :", "Article CARDINAL", "Rights , jurisdiction and duties of the coastal ORG in the exclusive economic zone", "\" CARDINAL .
