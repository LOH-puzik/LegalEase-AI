The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant went to Mu\u015f prison during visiting TIME to see her brother , who was being held there in connection with a case related to the ORG , an illegal armed organisation .", "CARDINAL . The staff responsible for body searches found on the applicant \u201c close to the left side of her abdomen \u201d , a piece of paper that had been folded several times and wrapped in tape . It was an unsigned letter dated DATE , written by a member of the ORG and addressed to another member .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was taken into police custody on DATE and questioned in NORP by the gendarmes the following day . During the interview she stated that she had picked up the object in question in PERSON at the bus stop where she was waiting for the bus to GPE . She had thought that the object might have some value and had intended to remove the wrapping once she was alone .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she gave a statement to the same effect before the public prosecutor and then before ORG . As she was illiterate , she signed the statements with her fingerprint .", "CARDINAL . She was remanded in custody after being examined and was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of Van acquitted the applicant , considering her version of events to be credible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant visited her brother again in Mu\u015f prison during a religious festival . After the visit she was taken into police custody .", "CARDINAL . The police report drawn up that DATE stated that the staff responsible for body searches had discovered , hidden in the lining of the applicant \u2019s dress , a CARDINAL - page document consisting of rolled - up onionskin paper protected by adhesive tape . According to the report , the document contained , in particular , information about the ORG \u2019s strategy and its activities in prisons , about the conduct to be adopted vis - \u00e0 - vis the prison authorities and about prison staff .", "CARDINAL . She was questioned in NORP by QUANTITY gendarmes on DATE . The report stated that she had been reminded of her right to the assistance of a lawyer but had waived that right . As to the facts , she had stated that she had seen a wrapped object in the prison waiting room and had picked it up out of mere curiosity , placing it in her bra . She added that , during the search , the prison officers had discovered the object and had unwrapped it . She had noticed pieces of paper covered in writing . During her visit to her brother she had told him about the incident but he had not said anything about it . The gendarmes had then arrested her as she was leaving the prison .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a question about her personal status , she replied that she was married to G.I. on the basis of a religious marriage , not a civil one , and that they had had CARDINAL children together . Her husband had another partner with whom he had had CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . When asked whether she worked for the ORG , she replied in the negative . She added that , on the first occasion , she had picked up the object thinking it might contain gold and that it was with the same thought in mind that she had taken the paper in the waiting room .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to a question about CARDINAL pieces of gold discovered on her during the search , she stated that CARDINAL of them belonged to her daughter and CARDINAL were hers .", "CARDINAL . After she had been questioned , the public prosecutor called for her to be remanded in custody . As a result she was brought before ORG judge .", "CARDINAL . Finding that she did not speak NORP with sufficient fluency , the judge asked a member of the applicant \u2019s family who was waiting in the corridor outside the courtroom to act as interpreter . The relative accepted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated once again that she had found the document in question in the waiting room . Immediately afterwards , she claimed that this statement , and the CARDINAL previously taken by the gendarmes , concerned events that had occurred DATE ; that no document had been discovered on her person when she last visited the prison ; that she had thought the gendarmes were questioning her about earlier events ; and that , not being able to read or write , she had signed the police report with her fingerprint without knowing what it said . When she was informed of the report \u2019s content she disputed its veracity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after the hearing , the applicant was remanded in custody and criminal proceedings were brought against her before ORG of Van for membership of an illegal armed organisation and , in the alternative , for aiding and abetting such an organisation .", "CARDINAL . At the various hearings before that court the applicant was assisted by a lawyer and an interpreter .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings , the defence disputed the prison ORG version of events . Counsel argued that no document had been found on the applicant , adding that , according to her , a document had certainly been found on a female visitor during the search carried out on entering the LOC and that person had nevertheless been authorised to visit on the grounds that it was a public holiday . The prison officers had failed to arrest her when she left the prison on account of the large number of visitors that day . Having realised that the visitor in question had evaded their control , the officers had decided to arrest the applicant instead , because they knew that a similar accusation had already been made against her . In addition , the defence stated that in her statement to the gendarmes the applicant had said that the impugned object had been found in her bra , whereas the record of the incident indicated that it had been found in the lining of her dress .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL female prison officers were interviewed on the basis of a warrant . The first , ORG , stated that she had personally found the impugned document in the lining of the applicant \u2019s dress during the body search . The second , PERSON , confirmed this version and stated that she had been called immediately by her colleague after the discovery .", "CARDINAL . Testimony was also taken from a number of defence witnesses . CARDINAL women who were visiting the prison on DATE of the incident stated that they did not know if the applicant had been searched on entering the prison . Another testified that she had entered the prison at the same time as the applicant but not had seen her being searched . CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s brothers testified that he had arrived at the prison with her but that they had become separated during the body search before coming together again to visit their brother . In their conversation with the latter , the applicant had never mentioned any incident during her body search .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was given a prison sentence of DATE and DATE for aiding and abetting an illegal armed organisation . In its reasoning , ORG observed that , in the first case , the applicant had claimed to have found the impugned document at a bus stop in GPE , and that , in the second , she had stated during the investigation that she had found the document in the prison waiting room . It noted that the applicant had reiterated this statement to a district judge before claiming that she had been talking about the first case and that no document had in fact been found on her during the body search of DATE . The court took the view that there were some serious inconsistencies in the applicant \u2019s explanations . It noted that if she had really believed that the questioning by the gendarmes and the district judge concerned the events of DATE she should logically have stated that she had found the impugned document not in the waiting room of Mu\u015f prison but in PERSON . It concluded that the version of events given by the applicant and the defence witnesses was not credible , and it accepted the testimony of the CARDINAL prison officers , which confirmed the findings in the relevant police report . The court thus found the applicant guilty as charged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment on a procedural ground .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant again and handed down the same sentence . Moreover , taking into account the time she had already served , it ordered her release .", "CARDINAL . That judgment was quashed on DATE on an appeal on points of law by the applicant . ORG took the view that the offence with which she was charged had been incomplete and had remained at the attempt stage . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s other grounds of appeal on points of law , including the question of the absence of an interpreter in police custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sentenced the applicant to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for attempting to aid and abet an illegal armed organisation . It adopted the same reasoning as that of its previous judgments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG referred the case back to the first - instance court stating that , in accordance with PERSON no . CARDINAL , setting out the rules and procedures for the application of the new LAW which had recently entered into force , the case had to be re - examined in the light of that new code to determine whether the applicant could be granted the benefit of a more lenient provision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( formerly ORG ) convicted the applicant once again , adopting the same reasoning as that of its previous judgments , and specifying that the provisions of the former code were more lenient .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment , submitting in particular that she had not been assisted by an interpreter while in police custody .", "CARDINAL . Her appeal was dismissed on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-e"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
