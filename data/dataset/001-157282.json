De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had been employed as head of the sub - division in charge of sanctioning misuse of housing property ( GPE ) in ORG since DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a meeting of the staff of ORG took place in the presence of the Deputy Mayor for ORG , W. , an elected official who , inter alia , governed ORG , and of a number of staff and trade union representatives . Following a short address on the issue of the expiry of the regulation on misuse of housing property by DATE given by PERSON , the applicant took the floor and accused PERSON of having committed perversion of justice ( PERSON ) by ordering the issue of an unlawful demolition permit for a block of flats in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s head of division requested the applicant to substantiate his allegations in writing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted several pages of written comments , in which he repeated several times ( using bold characters ) his allegations that PERSON had committed perversion of justice by ordering the issue of a demolition permit in DATE without , at the same time , imposing compensation payments for the loss of housing space caused by the demolition . According to the applicant , PERSON had \u201c ruthlessly pursued politico - economic interests \u201d . He further submitted that all staff members of his sub - division considered that PERSON had deliberately discredited their work . Furthermore , PERSON had unlawfully attempted to dissolve the sub - division , thus putting at risk its staff \u2019s employment . The statement made by PERSON during the staff meeting had been degrading and cynical and had contained halftruths and lies . PERSON had not assumed any personal responsibility and did not show any concern for finding a socially acceptable solution to the problems arising from the dissolution of the sub - division .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL March CARDINAL GPE dismissed the applicant with effect from DATE . The dismissal was primarily based on the applicant \u2019s statement during the staff meeting . According to the letter of dismissal , the applicant \u2019s accusations against PERSON had been unjustified . By making these accusations in front of a large number of staff members and representatives of the staff committee and of the trade union , the applicant had damaged his superior \u2019s reputation and thus irrevocably destroyed the mutual trust which was necessary for effective cooperation . It was further observed that the applicant had not availed himself of the possibility of submitting his concerns to his superior or to the Mayor . Finally , it was noted that the applicant had been reprimanded for disloyal conduct on CARDINAL previous occasions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a local newspaper published a letter to the editor in which the applicant expressed the opinion that the Deputy Mayor PERSON lacked any competence for resolving problems relating to housing issues .", "CARDINAL . NORP By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( Arbeitsgericht ) established that the employment contract had not been terminated by the dismissal since this could not be justified under LAW ( GPE , see relevant domestic law , below ) . ORG did not find it necessary to decide whether the applicant \u2019s allegations had been correct , as they were , in any event , covered by the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the appeal lodged by GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Bundesarbeitsgericht ) , upon the ORG \u2019s appeal on points of law , quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case to ORG ( no . CARDINAL AZR CARDINAL ) . Under the case - law of ORG , gross insults directed against the employer or the employer \u2019s representative , which constituted a serious violation of the concerned person \u2019s honour , could justify dismissal on grounds relating to the employee \u2019s conduct . In order to establish the seriousness of the violation of honour , it had to be established whether the applicant \u2019s allegations were based on objective facts . Account also had to be taken of whether the criticism had been made among staff members or whether other persons had been present . Finally it had to be considered that employees of the public service had to respect specific obligations under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Federal Labour Court confirmed that the right to freedom of expression always had to be taken into account when assessing inappropriate language in a workplace context and that the applicant \u2019s allegations fell within the scope of his right to freedom of expression . Accordingly , the court had to weigh this right against the protected legal interest with which there had been an interference .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that ORG , when weighing the competing interests , had failed to establish correctly the seriousness of the applicant \u2019s allegations and of the violation of the Deputy Mayor \u2019s personality rights . Under LAW , perversion of justice was a crime subject to up to DATE imprisonment . In case of a criminal conviction under this provision , a deputy mayor would automatically lose his office . The conduct of a public service employee had to be measured against a stricter yardstick than that of an employee in the private sector . In particular , the employee was under an obligation to behave in such a way as not to interfere with his public employer \u2019s reputation . Under LAW , the employee had to exercise special restraint when openly criticising a superior \u2019s decisions . A public allegation of perversion of justice directed against a superior , in particular if it was unfounded , very seriously violated the superior \u2019s personality rights and interfered , as a rule , with the employee \u2019s professional duties .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , in order duly to weigh the competing interests in the light of the right to freedom of expression , ORG would have to examine whether the applicant \u2019s allegations had been justified or not . It had further to be taken into account that the allegations had been made during a staff meeting . While it was true that criticism made in this context could occasionally be exaggerated or polemic without giving the employer a ground for dismissal , this right was limited by the obligation not to disturb peace in the office . It had to be taken into account in the applicant \u2019s favour that the staff meeting concerned the suppression of the applicant \u2019s field of work and that the atmosphere had been rather tense . However , this did not justify neglecting the fact that the allegation of perversion of justice did not concern the subject matter of the staff meeting , but a single incident which dated back DATE and had not been mentioned by the applicant since DATE . The applicant did not make use of the possibility of informing the Mayor about his legal concerns regarding the Deputy Mayor \u2019s decision . At the time of the staff meeting , the decision dated back such a long time that an attempt to put the decision into question must have lacked the prospect of success . Accordingly , it appeared that the applicant \u2019s statement was rather aimed at attacking the Deputy Mayor .", "CARDINAL . It had also to be taken into account that the statement was made in the presence of persons who were not necessarily bound by confidentiality . Accordingly , there was the risk that the applicant \u2019s allegations would leak out of this close circle and be made known to a wider public . ORG finally observed that the applicant \u2019s statement had to be seen in the wider context of his conduct and that the applicant had further exacerbated the conflict by the content of his written comments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Saxon Labour Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of ORG dated DATE and dismissed the applicant \u2019s action .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s dismissal had been justified because the applicant , in his statement at the staff meeting and in his subsequent written submissions , had seriously insulted and slandered the Deputy Mayor by accusing him of perversion of justice . Based on a detailed examination of the factual and legal situation in DATE , ORG considered that the decision taken by the Deputy Mayor at that time had been lawful . The applicant \u2019s written submissions of CARDINAL DATE demonstrated that he was not willing to accept and implement politically legitimate decisions , if they concerned sanctions for misuse of property by house owners . The content of the letter to the editor ( see paragraph CARDINAL , above ) contained value judgments which did not amount to insult . However , the Deputy Mayor could not be expected to maintain DATE co - operation with the applicant after reading this letter in which he had been described as incompetent . ORG further observed that the applicant had not revised his opinion during the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the employer did not have any milder means at its disposal . In particular , it would not have been sufficient to reprimand the applicant and to transfer him to another working position . The court observed that the applicant was currently working in ORG and that there was no negative information about his conduct . This was temporary employment which the applicant had obtained by court order in separate proceedings . The applicant had expressed his readiness to accept employment even at a lower level . However , ORG considered that the applicant would not have changed his attitude without his dismissal from office . The Municipality could reasonably expect that the applicant would have carried on with his self - righteous attitude if he had not been dismissed . ORG finally considered that the applicant \u2019s chances of finding new employment were low . Nevertheless , the employer \u2019s interest in terminating the employment outweighed the applicant \u2019s interests .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to be granted leave to appeal on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , without providing reasons ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
