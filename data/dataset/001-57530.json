In criminal proceedings , the courts must use the services of an interpreter whenever the accused is not conversant with NORP . The first sentence of section CARDINAL para .

This text has not been interpreted and applied by the NORP courts in a uniform way . Certain courts read it as embodying an obligation for the ORG to bear the costs in question for all time and in all cases ; other courts , including some higher courts , consider on the contrary that while Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( e ) ( article DATE ) - like LAW - exempts an accused ( that is , a person \" charged with a criminal offence \" ) from paying in advance for the expenses incurred by the use of an interpreter , it does not prohibit such expenses being awarded against a convicted person .", "CARDINAL .

It is not the aim of the provision to place foreigners in a more favourable position than NORP nationals . This , however , would be the case if a foreign convicted person was not required to pay the interpretation costs . For example , under the NORP law of procedure and costs , a deaf - and - dumb convicted person against whom proceedings can not be taken without a special interpreter must pay the costs of interpretation .

The court ordered the applicant to bear the costs of the proceedings \" with the exception , however , of the costs occasioned by the assistance of the LANGUAGE - language interpreter , which costs are to be borne by the ORG \" .

On an \" immediate appeal \" by the public prosecutor \u2019s department , ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) , in a fully reasoned decision delivered on DATE , set aside ORG judgment insofar as it related to the interpretation costs . ORG stated :", "\" On [ its ] wording , it is controversial whether ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( e ) ) ( article DATE ) forbids a convicted person \u2019s being charged with the costs of interpretation under the above - cited provisions relating to costs or whether - in the case of criminal proceedings in NORP courts DATE it merely means that the assistance of an interpreter may not be made dependent on an advance payment by the accused . ...", ".....", "The object of the ORG is to secure human rights and fundamental freedoms against arbitrary ORG action and to place them under the protection of supranational law . ... It is not its purpose to go further and alter the national legal systems ... The list of procedural guarantees in DATE ( article CARDINAL ) of the LAW shows that the intention was to enshrine rights of the citizen and duties of the ORG which ensure a fair trial . This obviously means that the accused ( or person charged ) should be able to call for the assistance of an interpreter if he does not understand or speak the language used in court and that such assistance should be in no way dependent on the question of costs . But it certainly does not mean that even a convicted person may not have the costs of interpretation awarded against him . A fair trial is guaranteed in this respect insofar as the accused must be assisted by the interpreter he needs . The question whether he may later be required to bear the costs is not of the same order as the problem of guaranteeing human rights and fundamental freedoms but , both in theoretical and practical terms , is of lesser moment . It can not be assumed that the ORG is intended to provide a piecemeal solution of the question of costs in criminal proceedings . Nor does the consideration that a foreigner should not receive worse treatment in the matter of costs than a national , dictate the conclusion that permanent exemption from costs is necessarily implied by the object of LAW The Convention would not have come appreciably nearer to achieving its aim by prohibiting a financial disadvantage of such a kind . \"", "On DATE , Mr. PERSON applied to ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) which , DATE , declined to hear the application on the ground that it did not offer sufficient prospects of success .", "CARDINAL .
