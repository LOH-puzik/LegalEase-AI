They claim to be the owners of an estate named PERSON , which is the subject of their application under LAW .", "A further applicant is ORG ehf . ( Ltd. ) , a private limited - liability company , incorporated under the laws of GPE , registered at GPE , in GPE , and whose executive director is Mr PERSON ( DATE ) , ORG . The applicant company 's complaints under the ORG relate to its claim to be the owner of CARDINAL of an estate named PERSON .", "The applicants are represented by Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , who are both lawyers practising in PERSON .", "On DATE a new LAW ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on public lands and the determination of the boundaries of private land , public land and upland ranges ( hereinafter referred to as the \u201c LAW \u201d ) , entered into force . Prior to this all land that had not been subject to private ownership was regarded as res nullius . The purpose of LAW was to change this . Thus , its section CARDINAL provided that ORG was the sole owner of any land which was not the private property of any natural or legal person . Moreover , ORG ( PERSON ) was established ( section CARDINAL ) , vested with powers to determine the boundaries between land that was regarded as the private property of a natural or legal person and land that was not , and was therefore the property of the ORG . In the latter event the ORG would also rule on whether a natural or legal person had any rights of use in respect of the land in question .", "On DATE ORG announced its intention to examine a certain area within the commune of GPE . Subsequently the Minister of Finance published the claims of ORG to all land that ORG regarded as not being private property owned by any natural or legal person .", "In the proceedings before ORG , the applicants claimed that they were the legal owners of the disputed land , arguing :", "( i ) that the disputed land was their property and was protected by LAW ;", "( ii ) that the disputed land had been the private property of individuals since the settlement of GPE in DATE and therefore the conditions of section QUANTITY of the CARDINAL Act had not been fulfilled ;", "( iii ) that their ownership , or the ownership of former owners , had never been challenged by ORG or others . On the contrary , before the entry into force of LAW , ORG had on several occasions treated the applicants and former owners of the disputed land as being the private owners of the land in question ; in particular they had paid taxes in respect of their properties and they held written title deeds for the properties which had been acknowledged by ORG ;", "( iv ) that they and the former owners of the land had for DATE made use of the disputed land by all feasible means at any given time , e.g. herding sheep out on to the disputed land to graze .", "In the alternative , the applicants relied on adverse possession as a means of establishing their ownership .", "In the further alternative the applicants called for a declaratory decision to the effect that they owned the grazing rights to the disputed land .", "On DATE ORG found in favour of the applicants and held that the boundaries of public lands and private lands in the region should follow the edge of the glacier Vatnaj\u00f6kull in its state on the entry into force of LAW and that all land above this limit should be considered as public land and all land below as private land .", "Subsequently , ORG , appealed against ORG decision to ORG ) , claiming that the disputed land should be regarded as ORG property in accordance with LAW .", "In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld ORG decision . Although it did not find it established that the applicants held direct title to the land at issue , ORG was satisfied that they had fulfilled the conditions for adverse possession in respect of the land ( section CARDINAL of the Act No . CARDINAL on Adverse Possession ) .", "The NORP State appealed against ORG judgment to ORG , which by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE overturned ORG finding that the applicants had acquired ownership of the land in question by way of adverse possession , but held that they possessed the right to customary use of grazing land in the disputed areas ( section CARDINAL of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "In its examination of the case , ORG relied on its earlier case - law expounded in a judgment of DATE ( case No . CARDINAL ) . According to that judgment , it was not in the power of land owners to use a boundary deed to extend their land or other rights ; a boundary deed was therefore not in itself sufficient but had to be supported by other evidence in order for ownership to be established .", "Thus , in relation to CARDINAL group of respondents before it ( other than the applicants ) , ORG found that their title to a specific area of disputed land , in addition to being supported by a boundary deed from DATE , was corroborated by certain public acts . This included a deed of conveyance , issued by owners to the Minister for Education in DATE in connection with the creation of a national park and the determination of boundaries for division of land by an arbitration tribunal in DATE , according to which a large part of the disputed land was allocated to the owners ( and where the ORG , as a party , had not made objections to title ) . It also comprised a declaration of DATE by ORG in connection with the establishment of a new farm in the area . ORG therefore upheld ORG finding that the respondents in question should be exempted from the ORG 's claim in respect of the relevant land .", "As regards the first CARDINAL applicants ' claim regarding the farm PERSON , ORG extensively considered a number of sources , notably accounts in the Book of Settlements ( Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k - old NORP manuscript describing in detail the settlement of GPE by the NORP in DATE A.D ) , chartularies of FAC at Hof from DATE and CARDINAL ; entries made in DATE , DATE and DATE in episcopal visitations books ; ORG of a Mr FAC of DATE , ORG \u00e1 \u00cdslandi by a Mr PERSON , published in DATE ; the book of records of the land assessors in the ORG counties dating from DATE ; an official declaration of title by the owners of GPE dated DATE , the protest by the owners of the farm Fell in PERSON and the ensuing settlement of DATE between the owners of Hof and Fell respectively .", "ORG also took note of the records of ORG in GPE from DATE stating the following about Hof :", "\u201c The farm owns grazing land [ Upprekstrarland ] : ORG , which is far away , rising up from central PERSON , surrounded by glacier . ... \u201c The farm owns driftage shores : The shores of GPE and GPE , and in addition the shore of Fjall below Brei\u00f0amerkursandur . \u201d", "In addition , ORG had regard to a boundary deed of DATE and reasoned as follows :", "\u201c A boundary deed was then prepared for Hof on DATE , which stated , inter alia , the following : ' Furthermore the farm owns all of FAC and land on LOC , in the west the boundaries are as follows : The top of the peak PERSON on ORG to bear on the cleft in GPE on the same mountain . ' It also says : ' The farm owns these shores : ... The shore of PERSON between these boundaries : In the west : The top of the peak PERSON on NORP shall bear on the cleft in GPE on the said mountain . In the east : The higher mound of GPE shall bear east on ORG which is foremost to the east on GPE and the land boundaries shall be the same . ' This boundary deed was endorsed as regards ' the shore and boundary between ORG and the land of PERSON ' by FAC , who at that time appears to have been the head of the NORP of FAC , together with CARDINAL men who are said to be ' the owners of CARDINAL of PERSON ' and by the said PERSON ' as regards the eastern boundary between the lands of PERSON and Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk . '", "In the case there are no further earlier or more recent officially registered sources of evidence concerning title to this land other than the last - mentioned boundary deed for GPE dating from DATE . The value of such sources as evidence is discussed earlier in this judgment as regards the boundaries of private land with other land , and the same must apply to the value of boundary deeds as evidence of title to land . In assessing whether any other factors have emerged which could support the claim of the respondents in this part of the case to PERSON , it should be noted that in their pleadings before the court it was maintained that the church at Hof was from the beginning a farm - owned church and therefore subject to the custodianship of the landowners , but that its possessions accrued to the farm no later than DATE , when the church as such became the possession of the congregation . As this was not contested by the appellant , equal account must be taken of the cited sources concerning the ownership rights of ORG and the owners of the farm in the land of PERSON .", "When the sources concerning the ownership rights to this land are considered it can be assumed from the cited chartularies for ORG from DATE and DATE that it came into the possession of the farm of PERSON during this period and this may have occurred at about the time that the farm was abandoned , as surmised pursuant to the above . It can only be assumed from the phrasing of the earlier chartulary that direct ownership of the farm was involved . After the writing of DATE , however , DATE passed until the next available source of evidence , PERSON , was written . It includes no reference to the ownership by the church at Hof of the farm of PERSON , but it is specified that the church owned driftage and other easements from ancient times . The cited phrasing in the visitation book of Bishop PERSON dating from DATE can only be understood to mean that it is discussing only the easements of PERSON in the land of PERSON , which , more specifically , included the littoral rights , together with grazing rights in PERSON [ ORG ] and Brei\u00f0amerkurfjall . The CARDINAL later visitations , dating from DATE and DATE , cite the earliest visitation record to the effect that PERSON ' owns ' ORG , in addition to littoral rights . In light of the fact that these are based on the substance of the earliest visitation record , which in this context referred to easements , it can not be maintained that the later sources provide independent support for the direct ownership rights of ORG . In this context it must also be kept in mind that the rights are said to concern CARDINAL delimited parts of the land together with the shore , not the land as a whole , as would have been most logical if the farm as such had been considered the property of the church . The same applies to the discussion of the abandoned farm of PERSON in ORG of DATE , although it says that ' its entire property ' accrued to the church at GPE , but that of this property only GPE remained , surrounded by glacier and of little use , together with ORG and PERSON [ ORG and shore ] . ORG also says of the farm Hof , that to it was attributed ' ORG in the land of LOC ' , together with PERSON [ the PERSON shore ] , but from the context it can only be surmised that ' fjall ' [ mountain ] in that context referred to the mountain FAC . ORG dating from DATE referred to the fact that ORG dating from DATE referred to PERSON as ' an abandoned smallholding ' of Hof . This account can hardly have any significant value as evidence when it is kept in mind that it is clear from ORG of DATE that houses and cultivated land at ORG had at that time already disappeared and that use of other land was virtually non - existent , and from the available information it can only be surmised that the glacier advanced still further after that down to DATE . When the owners of Hof publicly declared their rights of title in DATE , their rights to the land of PERSON were entered among easements , but their agreement with the owners of Fell in DATE said that the former should ' enjoy the full use ' of that land ' as far west as they trust themselves to stake a claim ' . These last cited words are not consistent with the assumption that the discussion concerns the use of land which is subject to the direct ownership of the owners of Hof . Finally , it should be noted that in DATE , the boundary deed for PERSON was endorsed for the owners of Hof as regards the approval of littoral boundaries , but not the boundaries of GPE and PERSON , and that a real estate assessment in DATE refers only to the grazing rights [ GPE on GPE and the littoral rights to PERSON , as in the land assessment of CARDINAL .", "Even though it can be regarded as adequately demonstrated that the farm PERSON came into the possession of the church at Hof during the period between PERSON and DATE , there is in general principle no firm evidence of anything other than easements belonging to the church or the owners of GPE after that time until a boundary deed was prepared for Hof in DATE . The possibility can not be excluded that in the period from CARDINAL the church may have divested itself of the farm PERSON while retaining littoral and grazing rights . Whatever the case may be , sources dating from CARDINAL down to DATE can only be understood to mean that the owners of Hof themselves , for DATE , considered themselves only to possess rights of use to the land of PERSON and ceased to assume direct ownership of the land and thereby relinquished it , if indeed the ownership was not disposed of in another manner . For this reason , the boundary deed of DATE can not be said to provide sound evidence of the direct title of the respondents in this part of the case to the land in question . There is no evidence to support the contention that these respondents had any possession of the land of PERSON which could result in their direct title through adverse possession . Since no other parties have made any claim to such rights to the land , and nothing in the documents of the case gives any indication that any such claim could be made by anyone , it must be assumed that pursuant to LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL the land is public land subject , however , to the customary grazing and littoral use by the respondents of the land in accordance with LAW . As regards the boundaries of the public land , this is laid down in the adjudication , but in light of the limited rights of use declared in favour of the respondents , there is no reason to specify its boundary with the public land on the glacier . \u201d", "As regards the tenth applicant 's claim regarding CARDINAL of the farm of NORP , ORG again extensively assessed the evidence before it , including a number of items , notably the PERSON saga ( NORP epic from DATE ) containing the earliest accounts of habitation at NORP , ORG , chartularies of the church of PERSON at GPE from GPE and DATE . ORG further observed that CARDINAL of the farm had apparently accrued to the King , according to a judgment of the court of law , L\u00f6gr\u00e9tta , in DATE . Regard was also had to ORG of a Mr FAC of DATE , ORG of DATE , ORG of a Mr PERSON of DATE , records of the land assessors in the counties of ORG dating from DATE ; the above - mentioned public declaration made by owners of GPE on DATE and the subsequent settlement of DATE , a deed of conveyance of CARDINAL and another such deed of DATE issued on behalf of the owners of \u201c PERSON and lands by ORG ( who held the combined offices of Country and GPE [ Land- og b\u00e6jarf\u00f3geti ] ) ; and a deed of conveyance of CARDINAL DATE .", "ORG went on :", "\u201c Included in the case documents is a boundary record for the farm Fell , prepared by the aforementioned PERSON on DATE , where boundaries and shore boundaries in the west were described as being located on a further specified parish boundary . These are the same boundaries as those referred to as the eastern boundary of the farm PERSON . This boundary record was not endorsed as regards the boundaries with LOC . Also included in the case documents is a ' boundary record between Fell in the NORP of GPE and NORP in GPE , which is signed on CARDINAL DATE by the heads of both parishes , PERSON and PERSON . In this record the boundary of land and shore between Fell and PERSON is once again described in the same manner , and it is stated that the boundaries of the CARDINAL parishes are also the same . This document is not endorsed by any other parties .", "A deed of conveyance was issued on DATE for CARDINAL of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk and CARDINAL of the Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk shore , which includes the following passage : ' In that I , the undersigned , former commissioner ORG , have since DATE , without objection , collected rent from the land of CARDINAL of NORP in GPE in GPE , as it was in ancient times , as well as rent from CARDINAL of the Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk shore , which is CARDINAL [ i.e. CARDINAL ] QUANTITY in length DATE from the tenant , PERSON at ORG , an agreement has been reached between myself and him DATE that he should come into possession of this land , together with CARDINAL of the shore of LOC with driftage rights , for the sum of DATE hundred \u2013 kr\u00f3nur . ' The persons who appear to have derived their rights from PERSON issued on DATE a deed of conveyance for the same property to the defendant ORG ehf .", "According to the documents of the case , the cited boundary records dating from DATE were officially registered , as well as the deeds of conveyance dating DATE , on which the defendant PERSON ehf . bases its rights . From the ruling of ORG it can be inferred that the cited deed of conveyance to PERSON for the shares of his cousins in the PERSON shore was officially registered with a proviso relating to title rights to the sold property . It can also be inferred that the descendants of PERSON [ Run\u00f3lfsson ] and the parties deriving their rights from him officially registered certain declarations concerning rights to the NORP shore , and to some extent the land of LOC , in DATE , but these documents were variously registered with a proviso concerning defects in rights of title or without such provisos . Evidence of this is not available in the case in other respects . The respondents in this part of the case , other than ORG ehf . , as recounted earlier , apparently derive their rights from PERSON . This has not been specifically contested by the appellant , even though there is no evidence in the case in support of this contention . The respondents have also submitted documents confirming that they are registered as the owners of the NORP shore in ORG .", "Looking at the evidence concerning the title to the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk it is clear that the farm was for a long time a possession of the ORG and that it was administered by the PERSON at PERSON until it was sold in DATE . On that sale , a part of the littoral rights relating to major driftage was separated from the land and retained for ORG at PERSON , while minor driftage remained attached to the farm . Before the farm was abandoned in DATE , half of it had become a possession of the king , while the other CARDINAL was referred to as a farmers ' holding . The share of the king is believed to have been sold in DATE , but there is no record of who might have come into possession of it . From DATE there are records that a CARDINAL share of ORG was believed to be attached to GPE , and it appears to have been surmised that his part was previously the king 's possession . A public declaration of title to GPE dating from DATE , however , referred to the right to LOC only in the enumeration of easements . In a settlement made in DATE for the resolution of a dispute resulting from this declaration of title , the boundaries between the land of GPE and the farm Fell in PERSON were determined . Since the time of the conclusion of this settlement there is no evidence that the owners of Hof claimed title to the land or interests in the land . No evidence has been submitted in the case to indicate that the owners of Fell felt that by this settlement they came into possession of a part of LOC from the owners of GPE , and indeed later sources do not indicate that the former conducted themselves as if they were the owners of the land in part or in full . There is therefore no further evidence in the case concerning the fate of the CARDINAL of the land which purportedly belonged to the king until DATE .", "In DATE , the owners of Fell , the Reverend ORG and PERSON purchased the major driftage rights from the Church at PERSON . It must be assumed that PERSON , by contract with the descendants of ORG and PERSON in DATE , came into possession of the major driftage rights , but there is no evidence that he thereby acquired any other rights to the land of LOC , as it is clear from the letter from PERSON of DATE that the attempts of PERSON to purchase such rights DATE had proved fruitless . The respondents in this part of the case , other than ORG ehf . , derive their rights from PERSON . Accordingly , they can not claim the rights to the land of LOC other than a part of the NORP shore , and it appears to be undisputed in the case that this corresponds to a CARDINAL share .", "It then remains to be resolved what became of the rights to the half of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk which apparently continued to be farmer - owned after the other half accrued to the king . Following the sale of the major driftage rights from the Church at PERSON , where ORG , Country and GPE , had represented the seller , he recounted in the letter cited above to the Reverend ORG of DATE that he could not provide ' the least information ' who could have owned CARDINAL of the land against the king , then or later . As recounted earlier , it is specified in the land assessment of DATE that this CARDINAL was owned by PERSON . From the cited letter from PERSON of DATE , it does not appear to have been regarded as certain that ORG did not subsequently dispose of this share , but , on the other hand , it can be inferred from the letter that his descendants still believed themselves to own rights to the land , which were referred to as an easement . There is no further information as to who these descendants were . PERSON , who issued the cited deed of conveyance to the owners of PERSON on DATE for CARDINAL of the land of GPE and half of the shore of GPE , apparently was PERSON son in law . There is no evidence available that PERSON owned any rights to the sold property , nor that his wife , who was not involved in the contract , could in this respect have had any precedence over other descendants of PERSON . Accordingly , this proof of title , to which the defendant PERSON ehf . traces its rights , is entirely untenable . For all of these reasons it can not be seen that anyone can claim direct title to CARDINAL of the Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk , and there is no evidence to support the contention that the owners of ORG must be regarded as having had the control of it which could lead to such ownership by adverse possession . The appellant , on the other hand , has not protested that the defendant , PERSON ehf . , and the parties from whom PERSON ehf . derives its right , have had the use of CARDINAL of the Brei\u00f0am\u00f6rk shoreline in addition to using the land of Brei\u00f0\u00e1rm\u00f6rk for grazing for the time required to acquire ownership of these rights by adverse possession . It must therefore be assumed that the defendant owns such rights of use to the land , as there is no evidence that any other parties could have earned such rights .", "According to the above , and with reference to LAW No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the land of GPE is public land , but subject to the rights of the defendant NORP ehf . to its customary use of the land as grazing land and subject to the littoral rights of all the respondents , as provided in LAW . As regards the delimitation of the public land , this is laid down in the adjudication , but in light of the limited rights of use declared for the respondents , there is no reason to specify its boundary with the public land on the glacier . \u201d", "LAW no .
