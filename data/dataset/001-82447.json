AZERBAIJAN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . By an order of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) of DATE , the applicant was issued , under the state housing policy , an occupancy voucher ( ya\u015fay\u0131\u015f orderi ) to a CARDINAL - room apartment in a state - owned residential building in GPE . The applicant did not move into her new apartment at that time , because the construction of the building had not been completely finished and the tenants had to undertake the repair works in their respective apartments at their own expense .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , pursuant to an oral agreement , the applicant allowed NORP , an acquaintance of hers , to use the apartment temporarily , free of charge . Under the arrangement reached by the parties , NORP was to use the apartment in exchange for certain repair works that he would perform using the materials provided by the applicant . In addition , NORP agreed to vacate the apartment whenever the applicant made such a demand .", "CARDINAL . Some unspecified time later , in breach of the existing oral agreement , NORP allowed his relative PERSON and his family ( hereinafter to be collectively referred to as \u201c H. \u201d ) to move into and live in the apartment . H. were internally displaced persons ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) from PERSON , a region under control of NORP military forces following the NORP - Azerbaijani conflict over GPE - Karabakh .", "CARDINAL . When the applicant found out that her apartment was occupied by people unknown to her , she requested that they vacate it . However , H. refused to do so , stating that they had no other place to live . The applicant filed a lawsuit , requesting the court to evict PERSON from the apartment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant 's request . The court found that , prior to moving into the disputed apartment , PERSON had been living in GPE and in LOC where they had been registered as IDPs . They did not dispute the fact that they had settled in the apartment in DATE . The court further found that the applicant was the lawful tenant of the apartment and , as such , had a right to demand PERSON to vacate it . The court ordered that ORG be evicted . PERSON appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the district court 's judgment . The court held that ORG 's order to issue an occupancy voucher to a partly constructed building had been in breach of the requirements of the domestic law . The court further held that the applicant had not concluded a social tenancy agreement concerning the apartment and , therefore , she could not have a valid claim to it . The court therefore quashed the first - instance court 's order to evict PERSON from the apartment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal in cassation . On DATE ORG reversed ORG judgment and partially upheld the applicant 's request . ORG found that ORG erred in judging on the validity of the applicant 's occupancy voucher . It held that the applicant 's tenancy rights were undisputed and that the proceedings only concerned PERSON 's right to remain in the applicant 's apartment . ORG quashed ORG decision in this part .", "CARDINAL . ORG further ruled that PERSON should vacate the applicant 's apartment . However , taking into account the fact that H. could not return to their permanent place of residence in PERSON and , in the meantime , had no other place in which to reside , the Court held that the execution of its decision should be postponed until they could return to PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter , based on the applicant 's additional cassation appeal , the proceedings were reopened and on DATE the ORG of ORG quashed ORG decision of DATE . The ORG noted that , having found errors in ORG judgment , ORG had no competence under civil procedure law to deliver a new judgment on the merits and , instead , was obliged to quash ORG judgment and refer the case for re - examination by ORG . Accordingly , the ORG found that , although the conclusions reached by ORG were essentially correct , it had breached the procedural rules by delivering a new judgment on the merits . The ORG remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment identical to ORG decision of DATE . It ruled that PERSON should vacate the applicant 's apartment . It further held as follows :", "\u201c ... the claim of PERSON must be upheld ; however , having regard to the fact that the defendants are internally displaced persons from LOC and do not have another place in which to reside , the execution of the judgment shall be postponed until GPE is liberated from occupation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At present , PERSON remains under the control of NORP forces and the GPE - Karabakh conflict remains unresolved . At the time of the latest communication with the parties , PERSON was still living in the applicant 's apartment .", "CARDINAL . The Housing Code provides that NORP citizens are entitled to obtain a right of use of apartments owned by the ORG or other public bodies , under the terms of a tenancy agreement ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . A decision on granting an apartment is to be implemented by way of issuing the citizen with an occupancy voucher ( ya\u015fay\u0131\u015f sah\u0259si orderi ) from the local executive authority ( LAW . The voucher serves as the sole legal basis for taking possession of the apartment designated therein ( LAW ) and for concluding a tenancy agreement ( ya\u015fay\u0131\u015f sah\u0259sini icar\u0259 m\u00fcqavil\u0259si ) between the tenant and the housing maintenance authority ( LAW .", "CARDINAL . The right of use of apartments is granted for an indefinite term ( LAW . The tenant can terminate the tenancy agreement at any moment , with the consent of his or her family members ( LAW ) . The landlord ( the housing maintenance authority ) can terminate the agreement only on the grounds provided for by law and on the basis of a court decision ( Articles DATE ) . If the agreement is terminated because the house is no longer fit for living in , the tenant and family must be provided with a substitute apartment with full amenities ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Tenants or members of their family can be evicted without provision of substitute accommodation only if they \u201c systematically destroy or damage the apartment \u201d , \u201c use it for purposes other than residence \u201d or \u201c systematically breach the [ generally accepted rules of conduct ] , thus making cohabitation with others impossible \u201d ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Individuals residing , pursuant to a tenancy agreement , in apartments owned by the ORG and other public bodies have a right to transfer these apartments into their private ownership ( LAW . Such privatisation is voluntary and free of charge ( LAW . The right to privatise a ORG - owned apartment free of charge may be exercised only once ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the PERSON provides as follows :", "\u201c Persons displaced from the places of their permanent residence in the territory of GPE to other places within the territory of the country as a result of foreign military aggression , occupation of certain territories or continuous gunfire , shall be considered as internally displaced persons subject to the provisions of this PERSON . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE the PERSON provides as follows :", "\u201c The relevant executive authority [ the Cabinet of Ministers , ORG on ORG and local executive authorities , within the scope of their respective competence ] shall deal with the housing of internally displaced persons . Residential , administrative and auxiliary buildings , as well as other buildings , shall be used for such housing purposes . Where there is no possibility to house internally displaced persons in such buildings or where the density of population in a specific settlement does not allow such a possibility , they shall be settled in camps specially set up for internally displaced persons . ...", "The internally displaced persons may be allowed to temporarily settle on their own only if the rights and lawful interests of other persons are not infringed . Otherwise , the relevant executive authority must ensure re - settlement of the internally displaced persons to other accommodation ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE Regulations provides :", "\u201c In order to prevent the eviction of the internally displaced persons from dwellings in which they settled during DATE , the legal force of the occupancy vouchers issued by the relevant authorities to individual citizens in respect of those dwellings shall be temporarily suspended ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In cases where the temporary settling of internally displaced persons breaches the housing rights of other individuals , the former must be provided with other suitable accommodation ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .
