The applicant was born in DATE . He is serving a life sentence in prison .", "CARDINAL . According to an extract from the register of convictions provided by the ORG , the applicant had CARDINAL criminal convictions and CARDINAL misdemeanour punishment on record . He was serving a life sentence on the basis of his conviction in DATE for the murder of CARDINAL people and attempted manslaughter of another person . Furthermore , he had several convictions for attacking prison officers and other prisoners . In addition , a large number of disciplinary punishments had been imposed on him in prison , including for disobeying orders of and threatening prison officers . In the individual action plans ( kinnipeetava individuaalne t\u00e4itmiskava ) drawn up in FAC and in FAC , the applicant was characterised as a dangerous person lacking in self - control and capable of physically attacking others .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed by prison guard ORG that he would be transferred to a punishment cell in the evening in order to serve a disciplinary punishment . The applicant was dissatisfied , as he had been led to understand that he would not have to serve the punishment in question until the resolution by the Chancellor of Justice ( \u00d5iguskantsler ) of his complaint related to the matter . He said that he would not gather his belongings until he could clarify the situation with a security officer . PERSON told him that if he continued to object to going to the punishment cell , he would be taken there by force . The applicant replied that he would defend himself if unlawfully attacked .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , together with CARDINAL further guards , GPE and ORG , went to the applicant \u2019s cell . ORG had a plastic shield and GPE and ORG wore flak jackets and helmets . PERSON moved towards the applicant , keeping the shield in front of him . GPE and ORG followed him .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , PERSON came up to him and pressed the shield into his chest while the CARDINAL other guards added pressure from behind . The applicant tried to push back against the shield , while GPE and ORG tried to grab his hands . Then ORG let the shield fall and tried to grab the applicant \u2019s neck . The guards twisted his arms behind his back and ordered him to lie down on the floor . The applicant was brought down and PERSON pressed his neck so strongly that he lost his breath . According to the applicant , PERSON pinched his nose with his fingers , covered his mouth with his palm , pressed his knee into his neck and poked him in the eyes with CARDINAL fingers . While on the floor , the applicant was handcuffed and kicked in the ribs so hard that he felt his left rib cracking . He was then raised up and escorted to the punishment cell . In the corridor the applicant lost his breath , cried that he could not breathe and asked for permission to straighten up but the guards pressed him down and continued on their way .", "CARDINAL . According to the prison guards , the applicant attempted to hit them and had a scuffle with ORG , in the course of which the latter sustained minor injuries . They denied having kicked or strangled the applicant and submitted that he had subsequently threatened to kill them CARDINAL by CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In the punishment cell , CARDINAL nurses came to examine the applicant . They suspected a broken rib and told him to lie still until an X - ray image was taken ( for the medical evidence in the case , see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL below ) . A guard told them that a medical certificate was required to keep a mattress in the punishment cell around the clock . According to the applicant a nurse confirmed that such a certificate would be drawn up .", "CARDINAL . At TIME guard OV entered the applicant \u2019s cell and told him to hand in the mattress . The applicant explained that the nurses had drawn up a certificate stating that he needed the mattress around the clock because his rib was broken . The guard left .", "CARDINAL . At TIME guards ORG , ORG , ORG and OV came to the applicant \u2019s cell and told him to hand in the mattress . They had a discussion of some length , in the course of which the applicant requested that senior duty officer ORG be called . Guard ORG warned the applicant that force would be used if necessary . According to the statements of ORG given in the subsequent criminal proceedings , the applicant threatened to kill them . The guards left and returned after TIME . According to the Government the guards had in the meantime checked with the medical service that the applicant had not in fact been authorised to keep the mattress in the punishment cell .", "CARDINAL . At around TIME CARDINAL guards arrived at the applicant \u2019s cell . ORG and ORG entered , CARDINAL further guards remained in the corridor or stood at the door to the cell .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , ORG came up to him , grabbed his left hand and told him that they were going to take the mattress from him . The applicant pulled his hand away and VG \u2013 unexpectedly and without any notice \u2013 sprayed pepper spray in his face while ORG was attempting to twist his arm . The applicant ran out of the cell into the corridor , covering his face with his hands . Several guards attacked him from behind and he was forced down on the floor . He was repeatedly hit on the back after handcuffs had been put on him . After the applicant shouted that he could not breathe ORG struck him a couple more times . He was then raised up off the floor , bent down and guided to the security room . According to the applicant , he fainted several times on the way because his injured rib caused him serious pain when being bent down .", "CARDINAL . The Government relied on the statements of the prison guards given in the subsequent criminal proceedings . All CARDINAL prison guards present were interviewed in the criminal proceedings , either as suspects or witnesses . According to ORG and ORG , the applicant pushed ORG when he attempted to take the mattress . Then ORG used pepper spray . According to the statements of the guards , the applicant resisted strongly and was forced down on the floor in the corridor . According to ORG , he struck the applicant , who was on all fours , CARDINAL times with a telescopic baton in order to overcome his resistance and handcuff him . ORG and ORG were unable to give details about the blows inflicted by ORG . Nor was OV initially able to provide such details , but at a second interview he stated that by the time he closed the handcuffs , the applicant had not yet been hit with the telescopic baton . ORG thought that the applicant had probably been handcuffed while he was being hit by ORG . According to AT , the applicant had been handcuffed but had forcefully struggled and pushed ORG with his shoulder , after which the latter had struck him CARDINAL or CARDINAL times without much force .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was then strapped to a restraint bed in accordance with the orders of duty officer ORG , as he was still behaving aggressively and offering physical resistance to the officers .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant he was suffocating from the pepper spray in his throat but the guards pressed him to the bed , strangled him and did not let him spit . Finally he was allowed to spit and given the water he had asked for .", "CARDINAL . According to a report on the use of the restraint bed , the applicant was strapped to the bed from TIME to TIME His condition was monitored once an hour , when the necessity of the continued use of the means of restraint was assessed on the basis of his behaviour .", "CARDINAL . NORP The report contains the following entries . At TIME , TIME , QUANTITY a.m. and TIME : \u201c [ use of the restraint measures ] to be continued , [ the applicant is ] aggressive \u201d . At TIME : \u201c [ use of the restraint measures ] to be discontinued , [ the applicant is ] calm . \u201d The report also contains an entry according to which medical staff checked on the applicant ; the time of the medical check - up recorded on the copy of the report on file is illegible .", "CARDINAL . According to a medical certificate dated DATE medical staff had been asked to establish the applicant \u2019s injuries in the punishment cell . It was stated in the certificate that the applicant had no visible injuries but there was crepitation in the area of the seventh rib on the left side . A rib fracture was suspected .", "CARDINAL . According to CARDINAL medical certificates dated DATE the applicant was examined by nurse GPE at TIME and at TIME after his release from the restraint bed . It is stated in the certificates that the applicant had no visible injuries and did not need medical assistance . According to the applicant these certificates were \u201c fabricated \u201d in order to cover up his beating and were in contradiction with other medical evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant underwent an X - ray examination which revealed no clear traumatic changes . Photographs were taken of the haematomas ( described below ) on the applicant \u2019s body . He gave a urine sample . Urine test results , dated DATE , showed red blood cells in the urine .", "CARDINAL . According to a medical certificate dated DATE the applicant had CARDINAL haematomas measuring CARDINAL by QUANTITY on his back , a haematoma with a diameter of QUANTITY on his right upper arm , a haematoma with a diameter of QUANTITY on the right shin , swelling to the left wrist , crepitation in the region of the eighth and the ninth ribs on the left side . The applicant complained that he had been beaten on the back by the guards , complained of pain in his back and said that his urine had been red . The doctor considered that providing the applicant with a mattress was justified .", "CARDINAL . An ultrasound scan of the applicant \u2019s kidneys performed on DATE revealed no signs of disease .", "CARDINAL . According to a medical certificate concerning the applicant \u2019s examination in a punishment cell on DATE , there were haematomas on the applicant \u2019s back and ribs . The applicant did not allow the doctor to touch him , was aggressive and demanded a mattress . However , the doctor considered that the applicant \u2019s chronic lower back pain did not serve as a reason for him to have a mattress . She made a recommendation \u201c for further referral to a psychiatrist \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In a written explanation to the prison director by nurse GPE , dated CARDINAL DATE , she submitted that she had been asked to examine the applicant , who had been strapped to the restraint bed on DATE . The applicant had complained , as he had already done on DATE , of pain in the chest under the ribs . The nurse and guards , as well as the applicant himself , had wiped his eyes with wet napkins . The nurse had issued a medical certificate stating that she had discovered no injuries on the applicant . At TIME on DATE , upon the applicant \u2019s release from the restraint bed , she had again been asked to examine him . He had no complaints , save for the previously known complaint of pain in the lower part of his chest . The nurse had issued a certificate stating that she had not discovered any injuries and that the applicant had not needed medical treatment . On both occasions the examination had been carried out visually and the nurse had asked the applicant about his complaints . She had only noticed the haematomas on the TIME of DATE . She had not noticed them before and had not carried out a more detailed examination because this had not been requested by the applicant . Based on her earlier experience with the applicant , the nurse had known that he was very demanding in respect of medical treatment . Thus , she had assumed that the applicant was not suffering from any serious conditions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG started a criminal investigation into the applicant \u2019s allegations of abuse of authority by prison guards . The investigation was carried out by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed as a victim . Between CARDINAL and DATE CARDINAL guards ( ORG , GPE , ORG and ORG ) were interviewed as suspects . CARDINAL further prison officers ( including OV ) , a prison doctor and a prisoner were interviewed as witnesses . Reports on the use of the special equipment and means of restraint ( shield , helmets , flak jackets and handcuffs on DATE and handcuffs and restraint bed on DATE ) , and written explanations to the prison director from prison officers involved in the incidents were also included in the criminal case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE prison guard OV was interviewed for the second time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police requested additional information from the prison administration , including the applicant \u2019s medical records and information about the telescopic batons used in the prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police ordered a forensic expert examination of the applicant \u2019s injuries . The expert completed his report on DATE . He relied on the written materials in the criminal case file , including a report of the applicant \u2019s interview , medical documents and photos of the haematomas on the applicant \u2019s body . He was of the opinion that the stripe - shaped haematomas on the applicant \u2019s back had resulted from blows struck with a blunt instrument such as a stick or a baton , possibly on DATE . The haematomas on the applicant \u2019s upper arm and shin had resulted from blows struck with a blunt instrument or from the applicant \u2019s body being slammed against it . The haematoma and crepitation in the region of the eighth and the ninth ribs may have resulted from a rib fracture , but that diagnosis could not be confirmed without an X - ray examination . The expert concluded that the injuries in question were not life threatening and usually caused short - term health damage lasting from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed for the second time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police ordered a forensic expert examination of video recordings from prison security cameras . The expert completed his report on DATE . Having obtained QUANTITY magnified and processed images from the video recordings , he concluded that it was not possible to establish the exact time at which the applicant was hit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police investigator discontinued the criminal proceedings . She considered that the use of force by the prison guards against the applicant on CARDINAL and DATE had been lawful , since he had not complied with their orders and had behaved in an aggressive manner . On DATE he had refused to gather his belongings for his transfer to the punishment cell and had threatened to resist if force was used . On DATE he had refused to comply with the prison \u2019s internal rules and hand in his mattress . The guards had not denied that they had used force but had asserted that this had been the only way to overcome the applicant \u2019s resistance . The applicant had attempted to escape and run out of the cell . Thus , the use of force had had a legal basis . It did not appear that ORG had used the telescopic baton to deliberately cause injuries to the applicant . Nor could it be established that the force used by ORG , ORG , GPE and ORG had been excessive . They had countered an imminent attack after a more lenient response had not proved effective and the applicant had continued his resistance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police investigator \u2019s decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings was approved by a circuit prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It considered that the use of force , special equipment and means of restraint had been caused by the applicant \u2019s behaviour , that is to say his failure to comply with the orders given to him and his physical and verbal aggressiveness towards the prison officers . It relied on the applicant \u2019s handwritten letter of explanation to the prison director , in which he had confirmed having said on DATE that if the prison officers unlawfully attacked him , he would strike back . Furthermore , according to prison guard GPE the applicant had threatened to kill them if force was used to transfer him to the punishment cell . Considering the applicant \u2019s extremely aggressive resistance , it had been proportionate to use force to bring him down to the floor and to hold him there .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the events of CARDINAL DATE ORG referred to the statements of the suspects and witnesses , according to which the applicant had threatened the prison officers . It had been established that guard ORG had used pepper spray after the applicant had pushed ORG . The applicant had been engaged in an unlawful attack and the use of pepper spray against him had been lawful . Although the applicant \u2019s subsequent running into the corridor could not be seen as an attempt to escape , it had still been possible that the situation might have got out of the prison ORG control and they had had grounds to believe that the applicant would continue attacking them . To prevent such a scenario , the prison officers had legitimately acted in a quick and decisive manner , including through the use of the telescopic baton by ORG . The incoherent statements of the witnesses as to the issue of whether the blows with the telescopic baton had been delivered before or after the applicant \u2019s handcuffing did not allow for a firm conclusion to be made on that point . Nevertheless , based on the witness statements , the prosecutor considered it probable that the applicant had been hit before handcuffing . She also referred to the principle that any reasonable doubt should benefit the accused and considered that it had not been established that the prison guards had unlawfully used a weapon , special equipment or force against the applicant . In respect of the applicant \u2019s being strapped to the restraint bed , ORG concluded that the video recordings showed that after being handcuffed the applicant had remained aggressive and had offered physical resistance to the prison officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against the decision of ORG . It found that it had been established that the applicant had offered resistance to the prison officers and therefore the use of special equipment and means of restraint had been legitimate . The court agreed with the position expressed in the decision of ORG that the special equipment had been used to the extent it had been necessary to overcome the applicant \u2019s resistance . Thus , there were no grounds to continue the criminal proceedings in respect of the prison officers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a claim for non - pecuniary damage with the prison administration for his inhuman and degrading treatment on CARDINAL and DATE . The claim was dismissed and the applicant filed a complaint with ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG found for the applicant . It declared the use of the means of restraint , special equipment and service weapons in respect of the applicant unlawful . The court found that although the applicant \u2019s failure to comply with the orders given to him had undeniably constituted a threat to the general security of the prison , the use of handcuffs and his immobilisation had nevertheless not been justified , as there was no evidence and it had not been argued that the applicant had been armed or equipped with a dangerous item or that he had intended to escape or attack anyone . However , the court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation , considering that the use of means of restraint and special equipment had been caused , to a large extent , by the applicant \u2019s own behaviour . He had disputed the ORG orders , engaged in an argument with them , voiced threats and offered physical resistance . In these circumstances the finding of the unlawfulness of the prison \u2019s actions constituted sufficient just satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . Both parties appealed against ORG judgment . The applicant claimed monetary compensation and the prison administration contended that the prison officers had not acted unlawfully .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of ORG on DATE the applicant submitted , inter alia , that on DATE he had been kicked in ribs once and that on DATE he had been hit with a telescopic baton after he had already been handcuffed . Video recordings concerning both QUANTITY and DATE were played at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It found that the use of the means of restraint , special equipment , physical force and service weapons had been lawful . The court considered that the prison had been authorised to use preventive measures in case of a probable threat . It noted that the applicant was serving a life sentence and had CARDINAL further convictions for attacking prison officers . In DATE he had also threatened to kill a prison officer .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the events of DATE ORG noted that there was no dispute that the applicant had repeatedly refused to comply with the prison ORG order to go to a punishment cell . Furthermore , he had offered physical resistance and caused minor injuries to ORG . Therefore , physical force and handcuffs had been used . Considering the applicant \u2019s unlawful and aggressive behaviour , threats to the prison officers and to the general security in the prison , as well as the short duration ( TIME ) of the use of the handcuffs , ORG found that the use of handcuffs had not been unlawful . In respect of the use of force , the court found that there was no evidence to prove that the applicant had been kicked , strangled or poked in the eyes with fingers . According to the medical evidence there had been crepitation but no fractures of the ribs . The court considered that pain in the applicant \u2019s chest that he had complained of could have resulted from his resistance , which had led to a scuffle and his being forced on the floor for handcuffing .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the events of CARDINAL DATE ORG considered it established that the applicant had displayed disobedience and threatened the prison officers . He had offered physical resistance against the guard who had attempted to take the mattress . Thus , the use of pepper spray had not been disproportionate or unlawful . Since the subsequent use of physical force had proved not effective , it had also been justified to use the telescopic baton in order to have the applicant handcuffed . The fact that the applicant had been aggressive at the time he was strapped to the restraint bed had also been proven by the video recording shown at the court hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to hear the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( Karistusseadustik ) stipulates that abuse of authority , that is unlawful use of a weapon , special equipment or violence by an official while performing his or her official duties , is punishable by a fine or by one to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Relevant domestic law and practice concerning the use of special equipment and means of restraint in prison has been summarised in the judgement of GPE v. GPE ( nos .

The ORG entered into force with regard to GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the CPT \u201d ) has expressed its concerns over the use of such agents in law enforcement . For example , in the report on its visit to GPE and GPE ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) it noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Pepper spray is a potentially dangerous substance and should not be used in confined spaces . Even when used in open spaces the ORG has serious reservations ; if exceptionally it needs to be used , there should be clearly defined safeguards in place . For example , persons exposed to pepper spray should be granted immediate access to a medical doctor and be offered an antidote . Pepper spray should never be deployed against a prisoner who has already been brought under control . Further , it should not form part of the standard equipment of a prison officer .", "The ORG recommends that the authorities of GPE and GPE draw up a clear directive governing the use of pepper spray , which should include , as a minimum :", "- clear instructions as to when pepper spray may be used , which should state explicitly that pepper spray should not be used in a confined area ;", "- the right of prisoners exposed to pepper spray to be granted immediate access to a doctor and to be offered an antidote ;", "- the qualifications , training and skills of staff members authorised to use pepper spray ;", "- an adequate reporting and inspection mechanism with respect to the use of pepper spray . \u201d", "Similar observations and recommendations were made by the ORG in paragraph CARDINAL of the report on its visit to GPE ( ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
