NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the Court by Mr S. Cottingham of O.H. Parsons & Partners , a firm of solicitors practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG ( \u201c ICO \u201d ) uncovered a database managed by an organisation known as ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . The database held details of the trade union membership and trade union activity of CARDINAL industrial workers , predominantly from the construction sector .", "CARDINAL . NORP In return for an annual fee , companies who subscribed to the database could access the workers\u2019 details and add information to it . The database was therefore used to \u201c blacklist \u201d workers . In other words , companies could use it to vet job applicants and refuse employment to those listed on it . The workers on the database were named , but the companies who provided or accessed the information were listed by code number . The ICO has identified and released some of the names of these companies but not all of them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a bricklayer who has worked in the construction industry for DATE . During that time he was an active member of an independent trade union and DATE he served as a union shop steward representing his fellow workers\u2019 interests vis - \u00e0 - vis their employer and organising industrial action .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant discovered that his name was on the ORG database .", "CARDINAL . The first entry is dated DATE . It notes that on DATE a company identified as \u201c CARDINAL \u201d reported the applicant to be a \u201c militant troublemaker \u201d . The same DATE entry records that on CARDINAL DATE another company identified only as \u201c CARDINAL \u201d also reported the applicant to be a \u201c militant troublemaker \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The next entry , which is also dated DATE , records that a company identified as \u201c CARDINAL \u201d checked the applicant \u2019s details and that \u201c QUANTITY informed company \u201d .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL further entries on DATE and CARDINAL DATE record that the applicant \u2019s details were checked by companies identified as \u201c CARDINAL \u201d and \u201c CARDINAL \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ICO was unable to identify the companies referred to as DATE . Nor could it confirm the identity of CARDINAL . However the CARDINAL companies that checked the applicant \u2019s details in DATE were identified .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant had been out of work . During this time he had applied for jobs with both of the companies identified by the ICO . In both cases his application was unsuccessful .", "CARDINAL . There is no record of any contemporaneous complaints about the applicant \u2019s work , professional performance or conduct .", "CARDINAL . Following the ICO disclosure the applicant brought a claim against the CARDINAL identified companies under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) on the ground that they had unlawfully refused to offer him employment because of his trade union activities and/or membership .", "CARDINAL . Both respondent companies submitted , inter alia , that the claim was brought out of time as LAW required all claims to be brought within DATE of the relevant incident , unless the limit was extended by ORG .", "CARDINAL . The application was heard on DATE . At the hearing the respondents raised a further argument : that section CARDINAL of the DATE Act had only come into force on DATE and , as such , the actions complained of had not been unlawful at the material time . The applicant \u2019s representative conceded the point and the claim was struck out on that basis . The applicant was ordered to make a contribution towards the respondents\u2019 costs of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought leave to appeal against the order to ORG ( \u201c EAT \u201d ) . In the application he alleged that there had been a violation of his rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The application for leave to appeal was refused on the papers on CARDINAL DATE . The judge held that :", "\u201c The argument in LAW was not raised before ORG and can not therefore be raised on appeal .", "In any event , the failure [ if it be that ] on the part of the Government to legislate to give effect to an LAW right could not give the [ applicant ] a cause of action against the Respondent . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not pursue any further appeal , although the possibility did exist for a further oral hearing under Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the EAT Rules .", "CARDINAL . Limited protection was first introduced under LAW DATE which made it unlawful to refuse a person employment on the grounds of their membership of a trade union . This provision was consolidated in ORG DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , the relevant provisions of which came into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act it is unlawful to refuse a person employment for reasons related to the fact that he or she is a member of a trade union . Pursuant to subsection ( CARDINAL ) any person who alleges that he or she was unlawfully refused employment can complain to an ORG . Section CARDINAL of the DATE Act allows ORG to order such a remedy as it considers \u201c just and equitable \u201d , including the payment of compensation or a recommendation to the respondent employer .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act a complaint under section CARDINAL must be presented to ORG before DATE from the date of the conduct to which the complaint relates . The ORG has a power under subsection ( CARDINAL ) to extend the period by any further period that it considers reasonable . This power may be exercised where the ORG is satisfied that it was not \u201c reasonably practicable \u201d for the claimant to present the complaint before the end of the DATE period .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , a person can bring proceedings against a public authority for acting incompatibly with a Convention right . However , such proceedings can not be brought in ORG . Moreover , the ORG does not have jurisdiction to make a declaration of incompatibility under LAW . Nevertheless , pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW the Tribunal is required \u201c so far as possible \u201d to read and give effect to primary legislation in a way which is compatible with Convention rights . Furthermore , it is required to take into account any judgment , decision or opinion of the ORG insofar as it is relevant to the proceedings when determining a question which has arisen in connection with a LAW right ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) , and it is unlawful for the ORG , as a public authority , to \u201c act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right \u201d ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
