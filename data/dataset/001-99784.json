The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was born out of wedlock . His mother , grandmother and everyone around him always considered GPE as his father . GPE never married or had other children .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Paternity Act came into force . The transitional provisions in LAW state that paternity proceedings with regard to a child born before the entry into force of the law had to be initiated within DATE , that is , before DATE . Moreover , no claim could be examined after the death of the father . No such restrictions exist for children born after the entry into force of LAW .", "CARDINAL . GPE was placed under guardianship in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) to establish paternity . The court ordered DNA tests , which established with PERCENT certainty that GPE was the applicant 's biological father .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's claim . It found that as the applicant was born before the entry into force of LAW , he should have lodged his claim within the time - limit of DATE , that is , before DATE . As he had lodged his claim only in DATE , his claim was time - barred .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) claiming , inter alia , that the paternity of GPE could not be established otherwise as , due to his state of health , he could no longer make a legally valid acknowledgement of paternity with respect to the applicant . This fact would place the applicant in a worse position vis - \u00e0 - vis the children who were born after the entry into force of LAW . ORG 's guardian supported the claim to have paternity established .", "CARDINAL . N.S. died in DATE while the case was pending before ORG . The inventory of his estate was made in DATE . The estate , worth MONEY , was divided among GPE 's siblings and their heirs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , reiterating his grounds of appeal already presented before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . The LAW of Finland ( perustuslaki , grundlagen , Act no . GPE ) , Article CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL , guarantees to everyone equality before the law and forbids discrimination of any kind :", "\u201c Everyone is equal before the law .", "No one shall , without an acceptable reason , be treated differently from other persons on grounds of sex , age , origin , language , religion , conviction , opinion , health , disability or other reason that concerns his or her person . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the LAW guarantees to everyone the right to have one 's case dealt with by a court of law :", "\u201c Everyone has the right to have his or her case dealt with appropriately and without undue delay by a legally competent court of law or other authority ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW gives a court of law the right to give primacy to LAW when the application of an Act would conflict with LAW :", "\u201c If , in a matter being tried by a court of law , the application of an Act would be in evident conflict with the LAW , the court shall give primacy to the provision in LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL of the LAW Born out of Wedlock ( laki avioliiton ulkopuolella syntyneist\u00e4 lapsista , lagen om barn utom \u00e4ktenskap , Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , a child born out of wedlock had a father , if a man acknowledged paternity , but paternity could not be established against a man 's will . According to section CARDINAL of the same Act , such defendant was deemed to be the person liable to provide child support to the child if he had had sexual intercourse with the child 's mother at the time when the child was possibly conceived . However , such an action was to be dismissed if it was manifestly improbable that the child was conceived as a result of that sexual intercourse .", "CARDINAL . As the children born out of wedlock were put in a substantially worse position than the children born in wedlock , there was a need to guarantee equal treatment of all children before the law ( see government proposal HE MONEY ) . This became the main aim of the new LAW of DATE ( isyyslaki , lagen om faderskap , Act no . DATE ) which repealed LAW of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Paternity Act provides that paternity is established either by acknowledgement or by a court decision . According to section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , the child has a right to institute proceedings with a view to having paternity established .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of LAW of LAW ( laki isyyslain toimeenpanosta , lagen ang\u00e5ende inf\u00f6rande av lagen om faderskap , Act no . DATE ) provides that the provisions of the LAW shall also apply if the child was born before the entry into force of the LAW , unless otherwise provided below . LAW provides that if a man , pursuant to LAW out of PERSON , enacted before the entry into force of LAW , has committed or been obliged by a final judgment to pay child support to a child born out of wedlock who has not the status of an acknowledged child , the provisions in sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of this Act shall apply to the investigation of paternity , actions for the establishment of paternity and the exercise of the child 's right to be heard .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW of LAW provide as follows :", "\u201c The child welfare supervisor shall attend to the investigation of paternity as provided in LAW , if a child born before the entry into force of this LAW has not reached DATE and the mother or the legal guardian of the child has expressed a wish that the child welfare supervisor attend to the investigation of paternity . After a man has acknowledged his paternity , the provisions in LAW ; section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ; and section CARDINAL of the LAW shall apply to the obligation of the child welfare supervisor to attend to the investigation of paternity , and to the enforcement of acknowledgement . \u201d", "\u201c A child or his or her legal guardian shall have the right of action for the establishment of paternity as provided in LAW . The child welfare supervisor shall not be entitled to exercise the child 's right to be heard without a separate authorisation . Proceedings for the establishment of paternity must be initiated within DATE from the entry into force of LAW . However , no proceedings may be instituted if the man is deceased . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It appears from the drafting history of LAW ( see Report of ORG PERSON , p. CARDINAL ) that considerations of legal certainty underlay the decision to restrict the right of action . The entry into force of the LAW opened up an opportunity to initiate proceedings that did not exist at the time when the children in question were conceived . The legislator considered that putative fathers ' legal security required rapid elimination of uncertainty about possible claims being brought against them on the basis of LAW . The restriction that a man 's death prevented the initiation of proceedings was justified by the argument that in such cases it was usually no longer possible to obtain sufficient evidence of the man 's paternity .", "CARDINAL . ORG has held on several occasions that the DATE time - limit in question is to be strictly applied ( see for example ORG CARDINAL ) . An exception has been made in a case where the paternity of the mother 's husband had to be annulled first and , as a result of that , the child would have become fatherless if the time - limit had been strictly respected ( see PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In its precedent case ORG CARDINAL-II-CARDINAL ORG considered that the DATE time - limit in section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW was not such a time - limit that could be restored by seeking extraordinary remedies ( menetetyn m\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4ajan palauttaminen , \u00e5terst\u00e4llandet av f\u00f6rsutten fatalietid ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
