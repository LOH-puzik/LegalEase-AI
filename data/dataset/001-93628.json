The applicant , ORG , is a company incorporated in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , in accordance with the PERSON on the Privatisation Programme for DATE , the Government put up for sale their portion of the shares ( CARDINAL shares , representing PERCENT ) in FAC and ORG ( \u201c the quarry \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company participated in the auction and , having offered the highest price , purchased the stock in DATE at a price of CARDINAL NORP lei ( MDL ) per share . The total price of the purchased stock was MDL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG carried out a check on the privatisation activity of the Government and in a decision of DATE found that in DATE the quarry had received from a third ORG - owned company CARDINAL railway carriages without any title and that those carriages had remained in the quarry 's possession throughout its subsequent existence without ever being included in the accounting documents .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE ORG initiated proceedings for unjust enrichment against the quarry , claiming compensation for the railway carriages . The proceedings ended with a final judgment of ORG of DATE , by which the quarry was ordered to pay the State MDL CARDINAL , representing the cost of the carriages as established by an expert report . The judgment was enforced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c NORP \u201d ) initiated criminal proceedings in respect of the privatisation of the quarry . The activity of the quarry was blocked as a result of the seizure of the accounting documents , the refusal to extend licences for extraction of granite and gravel , and other measures taken against the quarry by the ORG authorities . It appears that the criminal investigation is still pending before the ORG and that the case has never been brought before the courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG initiated , on behalf of the Government , court proceedings against ORG and the applicant company , seeking the annulment of the contract of sale of the ORG - owned stock . It argued that since at the date of the sale of the shares the quarry had not included the CARDINAL carriages in its accounting documents ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) , the price of each share had been fixed at only MDL CARDINAL , whereas it should have been MDL CARDINAL . ORG did not make reference to the proceedings which ended with the judgment of ORG of DATE . In its pleadings before the court , ORG argued that its action was not time - barred since the time - limit did not apply to its court actions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its observations and pleadings , ORG disagreed with ORG action and argued that the applicant company had participated in an auction organised by the Government and had won it by offering the highest price for the shares . The auction was organised in accordance with the relevant regulations . The question of the carriages which had not been included in the quarry 's accounting documents in DATE had been resolved by ORG by way of civil proceedings which ended with the judgment of ORG of DATE in favour of ORG . That judgment was enforced in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its observations and pleadings , the applicant company argued that ORG action was time - barred . It was contrary to the principle of legal certainty and equality of arms to allow ORG to challenge administrative acts in the courts without the latter being subject to any time limitations . In any event , the provision of the old LAW exempting ORG from complying with the general DATE time - limit only referred to claims against kolkhozs ( collective farms ) , non - governmental organisations , cooperatives and citizens . The applicant company did not fall within any of those categories . Finally , the dispute over the carriages had already been resolved by a final judgment of ORG of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG action and found the arguments adduced by him to be well - founded . Referring to the applicant company 's objection concerning LAW , the court found that the DATE time - limit was applicable to ORG court action . At the same time , according to the court , the time - limit was to be calculated from the date when ORG found out or must have found out about the problem with the carriages . In the court 's opinion , that date was DATE , the date of ORG decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Accordingly , the action was lodged within the DATE limit . As to the applicant 's objection concerning the existence of a final judgment concerning the same dispute , the court found that objection ill - founded because the first set of proceedings had concerned the issue of compensation while the second concerned the issue of the annulment of the privatisation . ORG ordered the annulment of the contract of sale of shares , the return of CARDINAL shares to the ORG and the return to the applicant company of the price paid for them , ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed against this judgment and argued , inter alia , that ORG had on its own initiative come up with a solution for ORG problem with the time - limit . Furthermore , the applicant disagreed with this solution and argued that the time - limit should be calculated from the date when the shares were bought . It submitted that there were no impediments preventing ORG from finding out about the problem of the carriages before ORG had issued its decision in DATE and relied in this connection on the official commentary to LAW . The applicant company also submitted that there had been no impediments to ORG conducting its investigation earlier , and argued that accepting ORG line of thinking amounted to accepting that ORG could challenge transactions concluded DATE by arguing that it had just found out about their illegality . The applicant company further submitted that the dispute was identical to that which ended with the judgment of ORG of DATE and that the judge of ORG who had examined the case had been influenced by the Government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company 's appeal and upheld the reasoning given by the lower - instance court . The judgment became final and an enforcement warrant was issued , under which the applicant company was obliged to transmit to the Government CARDINAL shares in the quarry .", "CARDINAL . During the enforcement proceedings , the ORG realised that in spite of the favourable outcome of the proceedings for them , they had not gained control over the quarry . Notably , they learned that in DATE the quarry had issued CARDINAL new shares as a result of the applicant company 's adding new extraction equipment worth MDL CARDINAL to its assets . The new shares were registered by ORG on DATE . As a result , the ratio of the shares in the quarry 's stock obtained by the Government after the proceedings had ended with the judgment of CARDINAL DATE represented PERCENT and the applicant company maintained control over the quarry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on behalf of the Government , applied to ORG for a supplementary judgment . It argued that the meaning of the judgment of ORG of DATE had been to put the parties in the position they had been prior to DATE , when the ORG held PERCENT . However , that was not possible because of the issue of new shares in DATE . Accordingly , the court was requested to annul the decision of the quarry 's shareholder 's meeting concerning the issue of CARDINAL shares and the decision of ORG Values on DATE concerning the registration of the new shares .", "CARDINAL . In its submissions to ORG the applicant company argued that ORG , acting on behalf of the Government , had not requested the annulment of the issue of CARDINAL shares in its initial court action . According to LAW , a supplementary judgment could be issued only if the court had omitted to rule in respect of a claim made by one of the parties to the proceedings . Since ORG only sought the annulment of the sale of CARDINAL shares , his new request could not be treated in a supplementary judgment . In any event , the issue of the new shares took place in DATE and , therefore , ORG action was time - barred . The approach taken by the court in respect of the time - limit in the main proceedings was inapplicable to the new request of ORG because ORG did not refer to the problem of the issue of new shares in its judgment of DATE . Accordingly , the ORG could not claim to have found out about that only in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG action . Referring to the applicant company 's objection that no claim about the annulment of the issue of new shares had been made during the proceedings which had ended on DATE and that the new request could not be examined in a supplementary judgment , the court found that the claim was implicit in ORG Office 's action , seeking that the ORG be reinstated in its right of ownership of PERCENT of the quarry 's shares . According to the court , it was impossible to make such a reinstatement without annulling the shares issued in DATE . Since the court failed to rule on that problem , it was necessary to treat it in a supplementary judgment . The court ordered the annulment of the new shares arguing that otherwise the Government would own PERCENT of the quarry 's stock , a situation contrary to the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , where it was ordered that the ORG be reinstated in its right of ownership of PERCENT of the shares . The court did not refer to the applicant company 's objection based on the time - limit .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company appealed against the judgment and argued , inter alia , that in its initial action ORG had requested the annulment of the sale of the shares in DATE but not the reinstatement of the ORG in its right of ownership of PERCENT of the quarry 's shares . In support of this submission the applicant company cited parts of ORG application before the first - instance court . It argued that ORG had misrepresented the prosecutor 's claims . The applicant company also submitted that the first - instance court had failed to address its LAW objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company 's appeal . It found that since the sale of the shares of DATE had been declared void , the parties had to be reinstated in their initial position , namely the position before the act of sale when the ORG owned PERCENT of the shares . Therefore , it was correct for ORG to adopt a supplementary judgment clarifying the situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company applied to ORG and requested it to explain how the judgment of DATE was to be enforced in terms of restitution of its contribution as a result of which the quarry had issued new shares in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a new judgment explaining that the applicant company was to be paid by the Government MDL CARDINAL , the value of the shares issued in DATE . The ORG appealed against this judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG 's appeal , quashed the judgment of DATE and ordered a re - examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG re - examined the applicant company 's request . It did not order that the value of the shares issued in DATE be returned to the applicant but that the latter be returned the extracting equipment which had been added to the quarry 's assets in DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicant company appealed and argued that the solution given by ORG was contrary to domestic legislation . However , the appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since the mining equipment had been used and was useless to the applicant company , it has not been recovered by it from the quarry .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW , in force at the relevant time , provide :", "The general limitation period for protection through a court action of the rights of a [ natural ] person is DATE ; it is DATE for lawsuits between ORG organisations , collective farms and any other social organisations .", "The competent court ... shall apply the limitation period whether or not the parties request such application .", "The limitation period starts running from DATE on which the right of action arises . The right of action arises on DATE when a person comes to know or should have come to know that his right has been breached ...", "Expiry of the limitation period prior to initiation of court proceedings constitutes a ground for rejecting the claim .", "If the competent court ... finds that the action has not commenced within the limitation period for well - founded reasons , the right in question shall be protected .", "The limitation period does not apply :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) to claims by ORG organisations regarding restitution of ORG property found in the unlawful possession of ... other organisations ... and of citizens ; \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the new Civil Code , in force after DATE , read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The civil law does not have a retroactive character . It can not modify or suppress the conditions in which a prior legal situation was constituted or the conditions in which such a legal situation was extinguished . The new law can not alter or abolish the already created effects of a legal situation which has been extinguished or is in the process of execution . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ( case nr . CARDINAL ) ORG dismissed the plaintiff 's contentions based on the provisions of the new Civil Code on the ground that the facts of the case related to a period before the entry into force of the new Civil Code and that , therefore , the provisions of the old Civil Code were applicable ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
