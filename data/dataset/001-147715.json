NORP The applicant , J.L. , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The President granted the applicant \u2019s request for her identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . She was represented before the ORG by PERSON of ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of the Foreign and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was married to an army officer . He was an alcoholic who had been violent towards her and had abused CARDINAL of her twin daughters . In DATE he resigned from the army following a court martial which found him guilty of ungentlemanly conduct . The army therefore no longer had any duty to house the applicant but on compassionate grounds , because of her husband \u2019s misconduct towards her and her family , it was arranged that she should move to ORG accommodation in GPE where her daughters , then aged DATE , were attending boarding school .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and her daughters moved into the accommodation in GPE in DATE as \u201c irregular occupiers \u201d . However , the accommodation in GPE was supposed to be temporary until the applicant was able to obtain housing through the local council and her licence to occupy was terminated on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG was granted a possession order in DATE and attempts were made to find alternative accommodation for the applicant and her children . However , the applicant has a history of spinal surgery , osteoarthritis , poor mobility and chronic pain . She is currently registered disabled and has to use a wheelchair . When an offer of alternative accommodation was made , it was refused because it was not suitable for wheelchair use .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a letter was sent from the headquarters of LOC of the army stating that the applicant was ill - advised to reject the offer because she had removed herself from ORG priority housing list and the only alternative was to rent or purchase in the private sector . It was asserted that the applicant had been rejecting all attempts to provide help and advice and , in the absence of a specific plan to obtain alternative accommodation , there was no alternative but to apply for a warrant of possession .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a further letter was sent indicating that the army would do everything they could to help in a difficult situation . The letter also asked for a medical report and an indication of what steps would be taken . Nothing appears to have happened following receipt of the letter and the applicant and her family remained in occupation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG sold its property to a company called ORG and leased it back . In DATE it was said that the applicant \u2019s dwelling was surplus to requirements for ORG and should be handed back to ORG . On DATE a fresh notice to quit was served on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . There was a further delay and on DATE a warrant for possession was sought based on the order made in DATE . The court refused to grant the order as it concluded that a fresh tenancy had been granted since DATE .", "CARDINAL . Due to a shortage of ORG housing in the GPE area , a further notice to quit was served in DATE . In DATE ORG Assistant Director of Housing met with ORG . At the meeting social services offered to write to the applicant to provide help and advice on re - housing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG commenced possession proceedings in ORG . On DATE the applicant served a defence and counterclaim in which she asserted that the claim for possession was unlawful and would constitute a breach of her rights under LAW . At the time the applicant was living in the property with her QUANTITY daughters . CARDINAL daughter suffered from mental health problems while the other daughter had a young son who suffered from Crohn \u2019s disease .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was transferred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made a possession order in favour of ORG . It observed that following PERSON and others v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL the applicant could only challenge the decision to bring possession proceedings and not the proceedings themselves . In the present case there had been no obligation on the authority to enquire into the personal circumstances of the applicant and even if it were aware of her circumstances , personal disability would not generally provide a proper basis for declining to take proceedings . Moreover , while ORG had not always acted in a way which lived up to the proper standards of good administration , there was no reason to doubt that there was a real need for the property . As the Ministry \u2019s need for available accommodation overrode the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW , it followed that she could not stay in the property forever and therefore could not have security . Possession had to be attained in due course , although it fell to ORG to consider the question of rehousing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicant leave to appeal . Following renewal of the application , permission was again refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant introduced her complaints to ORG on DATE . At that time the possession order had not been executed as suitable alternative accommodation had not been identified .", "CARDINAL . DATE ORG handed down its judgment in ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . In that judgment ORG considered that in order for domestic law to be compatible with LAW , where a court was asked by a local authority to make an order for possession of a person \u2019s home , the court had to have the power to assess the proportionality of making the order and , in making that assessment , to resolve any relevant dispute of fact .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Secretary of ORG decided to take action to enforce the possession order . He applied for and obtained a writ of possession issued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently issued domestic proceedings , requesting that the decision to enforce the possession order made against her be judicially reviewed in light of the judgment in GPE . In particular , she submitted that Article CARDINAL entitled her to a single proportionality review of the eviction process and following PERSON this review had to be conducted when the domestic court was deciding whether or not to make a possession order . As a consequence , such a right could not arise at the enforcement stage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG adjourned the application pending the outcome of the domestic proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The High Court handed down its judgment on DATE . It held , inter alia , that there was no reason to doubt that Article CARDINAL remained engaged at the enforcement stage , as enforcement itself involved a significant and direct infringement of the tenant \u2019s occupation of her home . That being said , the court held that it would not be in every case that a proportionality review would be appropriate at the enforcement stage . Indeed , where the question of proportionality had been raised and addressed at the possession stage , or where it could have been raised and addressed , it would be difficult for the tenant successfully to invoke it at the enforcement stage absent a marked change in circumstances or some other exceptional reason justifying its consideration . In the vast majority of cases where enforcement took place within DATE or DATE of the possession order , it would be unlikely that such justification could be established . In the present case , the court noted that the domestic courts had been unable to consider LAW in making the possession order , and concluded that in such circumstances she was entitled to a proportionality review at enforcement stage .", "CARDINAL . The High Court therefore conducted a proportionality review in the applicant \u2019s case . It considered her longstanding mobility and ill - health difficulties ; her daughter \u2019s longstanding psychiatric disorder and the impact a forced eviction would have on her ; the family \u2019s need for particular and accessible accommodation ; and the hardship they would face if required to move . However , given the Secretary of ORG legitimate aim in seeking possession ( his right to do so under domestic law and his public law duty effectively to manage ORG resources ) , and in light of the high threshold identified by ORG in both GPE of GPE v Powell and Others [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL and PERSON ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , the court held that the applicant \u2019s circumstances did not render it disproportionate to seek enforcement of the possession order .", "CARDINAL . In reaching this conclusion , the court found the following considerations to be of particular relevance : the high threshold that applied to an LAW in possession proceedings applied with even more force at the later stage ; ORG did not have the public function of providing social housing generally ; ORG had such a public function , and it had awarded the applicant the highest level of priority possible ; even if the family had to be placed in temporary accommodation pending the identification of a suitable permanent home , they would be placed together in accommodation that suited their needs ; the applicant had been warned that she could not remain in the property indefinitely ; the Secretary of ORG had refrained from seeking to enforce the possession order for DATE after it became enforceable to give the applicant an opportunity to find alternative accommodation ; no one could say with any certainty that the applicant \u2019s situation would be different within any fixed time - frame ; and finally , there was no evidence to suggest that the eviction would be more detrimental now than in the future .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG , which dismissed the appeal on DATE . In doing so , it agreed with ORG that while in the overwhelming majority of cases the occupant \u2019s LAW could be appropriately and sufficiently respected by the provision of a proportionality review during the possession proceedings themselves , in exceptional cases such as the present the raising of LAW at enforcement stage would not be an abuse of process . It also accepted that in the present case such a review could only have taken place at enforcement stage and the judge had been correct to carry it out when she did . It found that the judge had carried out a careful and sympathetic analysis of the consequences for the applicant and her family of the threatened eviction and her conclusions on proportionality could not be faulted .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , in order to evict a tenant a landlord must first serve a notice to quit , giving the tenant CARDINAL GPE notice . If the tenant does not leave the property voluntarily , the landlord must apply to court for an order for possession . If the court grants the order , it will specify the date on which the tenant must give up possession of the property . If the tenant does not give up possession on that date , the landlord must apply to court for a warrant of possession ( see LAW CCR Order CARDINAL , as set out in PERSON to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . For a general summary of domestic proceedings prior to DATE regarding the right of defendants to rely on LAW in the context of a defence to possession proceedings , see the ORG \u2019s judgment in PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Notably , in PERSON and others v. GPE of GPE and others ; and ORG v. Price and others [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL , Lord Hope of PERSON clarified the CARDINAL \u201c gateways \u201d via which a defendant in possession proceedings could challenge his eviction :", "\u201c ... Where domestic law provides for personal circumstances to be taken into account , as in a case where the statutory test is whether it would be reasonable to make a possession order , then a fair opportunity must be given for the arguments in favour of the occupier to be presented . But if the requirements of the law have been established and the right to recover possession is unqualified , the only situations in which it would be open to the court to refrain from proceeding to summary judgment and making the possession order are these : ( a ) if a seriously arguable point is raised that the law which enables the court to make the possession order is incompatible with article CARDINAL [ \u201c gateway ( a ) \u201d ] , the county court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under LAW DATE should deal with the argument in CARDINAL or other of CARDINAL ways : ( i ) by giving effect to the law , so far as it is possible for it do so under LAW , in a way that is compatible with article CARDINAL , or ( ii ) by adjourning the proceedings to enable the compatibility issue to be dealt with in ORG ; ( b ) if the defendant wishes to challenge the decision of a public authority to recover possession as an improper exercise of its powers at common law on the ground that it was a decision that no reasonable person would consider justifiable [ \u201c gateway ( b ) \u201d ] , he should be permitted to do this provided again that the point is seriously arguable ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON of PERSON - under - Heywood referred to the amendment to the DATE Act allowing ORG to suspend , for DATE at a time , any possession order in respect of a local authority caravan site and noted :", "\u201c ... Now , therefore , the county court would be entitled to suspend the order made against someone in Mr Connors\u2019 position ; previously , it was not .", "By the same token moreover that the county court judge would have been unable , under the pre - existing law , to decline or postpone a possession order in the case of someone in Mr Connors\u2019 position , so too in my judgment he is unable in other cases to give greater effect or weight to the occupier \u2019s right to respect for his home than is allowed for under domestic law ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He added :", "\u201c The difficulty with such [ a public law ] defence , however , is that it would be well nigh impossible to make good , the challenge necessarily postulating that under domestic property law the claimant authority was entitled to possession . Accordingly the argument could only be that no reasonable public authority could properly invoke that domestic law right . This would be a more stringent test than would apply were the court ... under a primary duty to reach its own judgment on the justifiability of making a possession order .", "For my part I think that such an argument could perhaps have been mounted successfully in ORG : having regard to the great length of time ( most of DATE ) that that gypsy family had resided on the site , it was unreasonable , indeed grossly unfair , for the local authority to claim possession merely on the basis of a determined licence without the need to make good any underlying reason for taking such precipitate action ...", "It is difficult to suppose , however , that a defence based on a public law challenge of this character to a public authority \u2019s decision to pursue its domestic law rights could properly succeed except in such an infinitely rare case as ORG itself ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The subsequent case of PERSON and others v. ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL considered the PERSON gateways . As regards the scope of gateway ( b ) , Lord Hope clarified :", "\u201c DATE . ... [ T]he speeches in PERSON show that the route indicated by this gateway is limited to what is conveniently described as conventional judicial review ...", "CARDINAL . NORP ... [ I]t will be open to the defendant by way of a defence to argue under gateway ( b ) that the order should not be made unless the court is satisfied , upon reviewing the respondent \u2019s decision to seek a possession order on the grounds that it gave and bearing in mind that it was doing what the legislation authorised , that the decision to do this was in the PERSON sense not unreasonable ...", "...", "CARDINAL . I think that in this situation it would be unduly formalistic to confine the review strictly to traditional ORG grounds . The considerations that can be brought into account in this case are wider . An examination of the question whether the respondent \u2019s decision was reasonable , having regard to the aim it was pursuing and to the length of time that the appellant and his family have resided on the site , would be appropriate . But the requisite scrutiny would not involve the judge substituting his own judgment for that of the local authority . In my opinion the test of reasonableness should be , as I said in para CARDINAL of PERSON , whether the decision to recover possession was one which no reasonable person would consider justifiable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges in ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( \u201c Pinnock \u201d ) considered the application of Article CARDINAL to a claim for possession brought against a demoted tenant under LAW V of LAW DATE ( as inserted by paragraph CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL to the Anti - social LAW DATE ) . Following a review of the case - law , ORG considered the following propositions to be well established in the jurisprudence of this ORG :", "\u201c ( a ) Any person at risk of being dispossessed of his home at the suit of a local authority should in principle have the right to raise the question of the proportionality of the measure , and to have it determined by an independent tribunal in the light of DATE , even if his right of occupation under domestic law has come to an end ...", "( b ) A judicial procedure which is limited to addressing the proportionality of the measure through the medium of traditional judicial review ( i e , one which does not permit the court to make its own assessment of the facts in an appropriate case ) is inadequate as it is not appropriate for resolving sensitive factual issues ...", "( c ) Where the measure includes proceedings involving CARDINAL stage , it is the proceedings as a whole which must be considered in order to see if article CARDINAL has been complied with ...", "( d ) If the court concludes that it would be disproportionate to evict a person from his home notwithstanding the fact that he has no domestic right to remain there , it would be unlawful to evict him so long as the conclusion obtains \u2013 for example , for a specified period , or until a specified event occurs , or a particular condition is satisfied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG thus considered that in order for domestic law to be compatible with LAW , where a court was asked by a local authority to make an order for possession of a person \u2019s home , the court had to have the power to assess the proportionality of making the order , and , in making that assessment , to resolve any relevant dispute of fact .", "CARDINAL . In terms of the practical implications of this principle , ORG noted that if domestic law justified an outright order for possession , the effect of DATE could , albeit in exceptional cases , justify granting an extended period for possession , suspending the order for possession on the happening of an event , or even refusing an order altogether .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the court observed that the need for a court to have the ability to assess the LAW proportionality of making a possession order in respect of a person \u2019s home might require certain statutory and procedural provisions to be revisited .", "CARDINAL . In GPE of GPE v Powell and Others [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , handed down on DATE , ORG held that the principle in PERSON applied not only to demoted tenancies but to all cases where a local authority was seeking possession in respect of a property that constituted a person \u2019s home for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope observed that following PERSON the court had to have the ability to assess the LAW proportionality of making a possession order in respect of a person \u2019s home , even if his or her right to occupation had come to an end . The question of whether the property in question constitutes the defendant \u2019s \u201c home \u201d was likely to be of concern only in cases where an order for possession was sought against a defendant who had only recently moved into accommodation on a temporary or precarious basis . Therefore , in most cases it could be taken for granted that a claim by a person who was in lawful occupation to remain in possession would attract the protection of article CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the proportionality assessment , Lord Hope stated that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The basic rules are not now in doubt . The court will only have to consider whether the making of a possession order is proportionate if the issue has been raised by the occupier and it has crossed the high threshold of being seriously arguable . The question will then be whether making an order for the occupier \u2019s eviction is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The threshold for raising an arguable case on proportionality was a high one which would only succeed in a small proportion of cases . However , if the threshold was crossed , the court would have to consider whether making an order for possession was a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim . Lord Hope continued :", "\u201c The proportionality of making the order for possession at the suit of the local authority will be supported by the fact that making the order would ( a ) serve to vindicate the authority \u2019s ownership rights ; and ( b ) enable the authority to comply with its public duties in relation to the allocation and management of its housing stock . Various examples were given of the scope of the duties that the second legitimate aim encompasses \u2013 the fair allocation of its housing , the redevelopment of the site , the refurbishing of sub - standard accommodation , the need to move people who are in accommodation that now exceeds their needs and the need to move vulnerable people into sheltered or warden - assisted housing . In GPE and ORG ) ( unreported ) given DATE , para CARDINAL the GPE court indicated that the first aim on its own will not suffice where the owner is the ORG itself . But , taken together , the twin aims will satisfy the legitimate aim requirement .", "So , as was made clear in GPE , para CARDINAL , there will be no need , in the overwhelming majority of cases , for the local authority to explain and justify its reasons for seeking a possession order . It will be enough that the authority is entitled to possession because the statutory pre - requisites have been satisfied and that it is to be assumed to be acting in accordance with its duties in the distribution and management of its housing stock . The court need be concerned only with the occupier \u2019s personal circumstances and any factual objections she may raise and , in the light only of what view it takes of them , with the question whether making the order for possession would be lawful and proportionate . If it decides to entertain the point because it is seriously arguable , it must give a reasoned decision as to whether or not a fair balance would be struck by making the order that is being sought by the local authority : PERSON and ORG , para CARDINAL .", "...", "In the ordinary case the relevant facts will be encapsulated entirely in the CARDINAL legitimate aims that were identified in GPE , para CARDINAL . It is against those aims , which should always be taken for granted , that the court must weigh up any factual objections that may be raised by the defendant and what she has to say about her personal circumstances . It is only if a defence has been put forward that is seriously arguable that it will be necessary for the judge to adjourn the case for further consideration of the issues of lawfulness or proportionality . If this test is not met , the order for possession should be granted . This is all that is needed to satisfy the procedural imperative that has been laid down by the GPE court . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
