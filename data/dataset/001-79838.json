{"ITEMID": "001-79838", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "LTU", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "KALPOKAS AND KALPOKAS v. LITHUANIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , Mr PERSON , and the second applicant , Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born , respectively , in DATE and DATE , and live in Gaili\u016bnai . They were represented before the ORG by Mr T. Urbaitis , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants\u2019 father owned QUANTITY of land . The property was nationalised following the NORP occupation of GPE in DATE . After GPE regained its independence in DATE , the applicants applied for the property to be returned to them in kind , pursuant to the DATE legislation on the restitution of property rights . The applicants were advised that parts of the land which they claimed had been assigned to certain private persons and therefore could not be returned to them .", "On DATE the applicants applied to a court , alleging that the disputed parts of their father \u2019s former land had been occupied unlawfully . They requested restitution in kind of the entire plot .", "On DATE ORG accepted the applicants\u2019 action in part . It held that parts of the land were legitimately occupied by other private persons and , under the legislation on the restitution of property , could not therefore be recovered . However , the court ordered that the regional administration adopt , within DATE , a decision to restore the applicants\u2019 property rights to the land which had not been occupied .", "On DATE that decision was upheld by ORG and entered into force .", "In execution of the decision , on DATE the local authorities commissioned planning experts to delimit the land due to the applicants . That work began on DATE . The applicants were invited to take part , but they did not do so .", "On DATE CARDINAL of the persons occupying part of the former land of the applicants\u2019 father refused the new plot assigned to him . This development necessitated a fresh delimitation and re - evaluation of the land to be returned to the applicants .", "Furthermore , on DATE another such refusal was recorded by the administrative authorities , which had to arrange for the land to be delimited and evaluated de novo . The applicants , however , again refused to take part in the delimitation work .", "On DATE a third person refused a plot located within the original boundaries of the land originally owned by the applicants\u2019 father ; hence , again , delimitation work had to be carried out . The applicants still refused to participate .", "On DATE a fourth person refused a plot located on the original land .", "On DATE the regional authorities restored the applicants\u2019 rights to the land . The first applicant was given title to QUANTITY of land and QUANTITY of the forest area , while the second applicant was entitled to QUANTITY of land and QUANTITY of the forest area . It appears that the authorities did not add the plot refused by the fourth person to the land due to the applicants . The applicants were repeatedly informed that occupied parts of their father \u2019s land could not be returned in kind , and would be compensated subsequently .", "On DATE the regional administration amended its decision of ORG , inter alia , reducing the plots assigned to the applicants .", "The applicants , dissatisfied with the above decisions , on DATE lodged a complaint , requesting their nullification . They also claimed title to their ORG original land in its entirety .", "ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 action on DATE . However , on DATE ORG granted it in part . It was established that the decision of DATE to restore the applicants\u2019 property rights was defective since the administrative authorities had not assessed all the relevant circumstances . While they had tried to remedy the situation by adopting amendments to that decision , they had acted ultra vires , since such a power was not granted to them by the law . The court quashed the decisions of ORG and DATE , and ordered the authorities to adopt a fresh decision regarding the restitution of the applicants\u2019 property rights .", "Neither the Government not the applicants have provided any further information about the actions taken since DATE to implement the decision of CARDINAL DATE , when submitting their observations ( respectively , on DATE and DATE ) or thereafter .", "ORG Nuosavyb\u0117s teisi\u0173 ... atk\u016brimo \u012fstatymas ) ( amended on numerous occasions ) provides for CARDINAL forms of restitution : the return of property in certain circumstances and compensation in others . Normally , the land is returned in kind except in cases where , e.g. , it is classified as the ORG \u2019s redeemable land . The land is considered to be redeemable if , inter alia , it was allocated to other private persons and is used as a farm .", "On DATE ORG examined the issue of the compatibility of the LAW with the domestic law on the restitution of property rights . It held , inter alia , that possessions which had been nationalised by the NORP authorities since DATE should be considered as \u201c property under the de facto control of the ORG \u201d . ORG also stated that , \u201c The rights of a former owner to particular property have not been restored until the property is returned or appropriate compensation is afforded . The law does not itself afford any rights until it is applied to a concrete person in respect of specific property . In this situation the decision of a competent authority to return the property or to compensate has the legal effect that , only from that moment , does the former owner obtain property rights to the specific property . \u201d Moreover , ORG held that fair compensation for property which could not be returned was compatible with the principle of the protection of property .", "In decisions of DATE and DATE , the ORG emphasised that the notion of the restitution of property rights in GPE essentially denoted partial reparation . In this respect ORG noted that the authorities of GPE , as a re - established ORG in DATE , were not responsible for the NORP occupation DATE ; nor were they responsible for the consequences of that occupation . ORG held that , since DATE , many private persons had bought , in accordance with the legislation applicable at the material time , various properties which had previously been nationalised . The denial of these factual and legal aspects was impossible , and the domestic legislation on the restitution of property rights duly took into account not only the interests of the former owners , but also the interests of private persons who had occupied or purchased property by way of lawful contracts .", "On DATE ORG held that the choice by ORG of the partial reparation principle was influenced by difficult political and social conditions , in that \u201c new generations had grown , [ and ] new proprietary and other socio - economic relations had been formed during DATE of occupation , which could not be ignored in deciding the question of the restitution of property \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
