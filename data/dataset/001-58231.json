At DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d \u2013 PERSON ) , a ORG body responsible , inter alia , for dam construction , expropriated CARDINAL plots of land belonging to the applicant in the village of PERSON ( Sinop ) .", "Following the construction of the GPE hydroelectric dam in LOC , the land , which had been used for growing crops , was flooded , as was that of CARDINAL families also affected by the scheme .", "CARDINAL . After title to the land had been transferred to the authorities on CARDINAL DATE , the ORG paid the applicant a total of MONEY ( TRL ) for the CARDINAL plots of land ( being GPE CARDINAL and TRL CARDINAL respectively ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought , in respect of the expropriation of each plot of land , an action in ORG for increased compensation . The actions were registered under nos . ORG and CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the court ordered CARDINAL on - site valuations by experts in order to assess whether the amounts fixed by the expropriating authorities were correct . The CARDINAL panels of experts relied on the same criteria in preparing their valuations , namely the criteria set out in PERSON no . ORG on expropriation rules . As , however , they did not use the same methods of calculation , their valuations differed , but both were higher than the amount that had been paid by the ORG on expropriation .", "An application by the parties for a third valuation was dismissed because the court considered that the CARDINAL valuations had been based on criteria complying with the statutory requirements and contained sufficient relevant material to enable it to decide the case .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the applicant stated in writing that he accepted the lower of the expert valuations . ORG Instance noted his agreement and made an order in those amounts .", "CARDINAL . NORP In action no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , on DATE the court ordered the ORG to pay GPE CARDINAL in additional compensation for expropriation . In action no .

It came to ORG , of which ORG was interest for delay due up to DATE .", "In action no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL the applicant received the sum of GPE CARDINAL on DATE , ORG CARDINAL of which was interest for delay calculated up to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of LAW , relating to expropriations , provides :", "\u201c ... Compensation for expropriation shall be paid immediately and in cash ... If deferred payment is permitted by statute ... interest for delay at the maximum rate laid down for ORG debts shall be payable on the part that is not paid immediately ... \u201d", "At the material time the rate of interest for delay payable on debts owed to the ORG was PERCENT per month ( PERCENT per annum ) ( section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL on the collection of debts due to the ORG and Cabinet Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . By PERSON no . CARDINAL the rate of interest on overdue State debts is PERCENT per annum .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c CO \u201d ) provides :", "\u201c Where the loss sustained by the creditor exceeds the interest due for delay and the debtor is unable to show that the creditor has been at fault , it is for the debtor to make good the loss .", "If the additional loss can be assessed immediately the court may determine the amount when giving its decision on the merits . \u201d", "In practice , the loss for which compensation may be claimed under this provision is the loss caused by the lapse of time between the date the debt is due and the date it is paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) , which has jurisdiction in cases concerning compensation for expropriation , ruled as follows :", "\u201c The way in which creditors are compensated for the late payment of debt is through statutory interest . Since creditors are able , when resorting to enforcement measures , to claim the amount due to them plus interest , they are not entitled to claim any other form of compensation ; accordingly , the decision to grant the creditor \u2019s claim , on the basis that the rate of inflation was high , was ill - founded ... \u201d", "The Government referred to another judgment delivered by the same division ( judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , in which ORG had allowed an application for compensation under LAW . The decision concerned alleged additional loss resulting from the authorities\u2019 delay in repaying a sum to which they had not been entitled . However , the claims in that case were based on the fact that in order to pay the amount supposedly due the plaintiff had had to close a deposit account before term , thereby losing interest .", "Nonetheless , the practice of ORG and in particular of its Thirteenth ORG ( see judgments LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) in cases not concerning expropriation appears to be to allow compensation for losses of that type under LAW in disputes between private individuals . On this point , it should be observed that the presidential committees of ORG , responsible for ensuring that the case - law is consistent , tend to dismiss grounds of appeal based on differences in the practice of the various divisions , as they consider that decisions are made on a case by case basis in the light of the particular facts concerned and consequently do not need to be harmonised .", "CARDINAL . In a leading judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting as a full court , ruled for the first time on the adverse effects of inflation , holding :", "\u201c Law no . CARDINAL was approved and came into force when inflation in the country was high with rates well over PERCENT . Notwithstanding that fact , the legislature fixed the rate of interest for delay at PERCENT . In the present case it would therefore be unlawful to award compound interest at a rate PERCENT on the erroneous basis that the rate of interest payable on bank deposits was applicable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a full court , delivered another leading judgment in which it decided the issue of the applicability of Article CARDINAL CO ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to claims for loss sustained as a result of inflation . It held as follows :", "\u201c ... the rate of interest provided for by PERSON no . CARDINAL ... constitutes lump - sum compensation for damage without the need for proof of loss ... Since the rate of default interest ( interest for delay in payment ) is fixed by statute in the light of the economic problems ( inflation , monetary erosion ... ) the country is experiencing , it is impossible to adduce the same factors ( inflation , monetary erosion ... ) as clear evidence of the additional loss referred to in LAW , or to affirm that the resulting disadvantages constitute the actual damage suffered . Otherwise , the legislature \u2019s decision that the compensation for those disadvantages would be PERCENT would no longer make any sense . If the legislature , having had regard to all the economic problems , has , by virtue of the legislative power conferred on it by LAW , fixed the rate of compensation for loss resulting from those problems , it can not be accepted that the damage for which compensation is due amounts to PERCENT or PERCENT rather than PERCENT , on the implied ground that the [ legislature \u2019s ] assessment was unfounded ... It is obvious that inflation , which has a considerable impact in the current economic climate of the country , exceeds [ the rate of ] PERCENT laid down by ... PERSON no . CARDINAL and that [ in consequence ] the creditor \u2019s loss through late payment is not covered . However , in so far as it exceeds the PERCENT rate fixed by the legislature , that loss does not come within LAW ... As the legislature , pursuant to its legislative power , considered that the loss amounted to PERCENT , a judicial decision applying a higher rate of loss on the ground that inflation exceeds PERCENT would constitute an encroachment on the legislature \u2019s jurisdiction ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In practice , leading judgments must be followed by the courts below when those courts decide issues similar to those previously considered by ORG , sitting as a full court .", "CARDINAL .
