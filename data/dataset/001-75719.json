The realities of the international situation following the end of the Second World War prevented GPE from asserting any claims arising out of persecution of its citizens , including as forced labourers , by NORP GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the period immediately following the Second World War , GPE did not conclude a specific agreement with GPE regarding the issue of reparations . It relied on LAW of DATE , concluded by the governments of GPE , GPE and GPE and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG on LOC ( LAW ) was concluded by GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . Under LAW , consideration of claims arising out of the Second World War by countries that had been at war with , or were occupied by , GPE , and by nationals of such countries , against the PERSON or agencies of the PERSON was deferred until the final settlement of the issue of reparations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE after a similar declaration by the government of GPE , the government of GPE declared that it renounced any claims against GPE in respect of war reparations as of DATE . In a declaration of CARDINAL DATE made at ORG , the government of GPE clarified that the renouncement of DATE did not affect individual claims arising out of unlawful acts .", "CARDINAL . It was only after the conclusion of LAW on the Final Settlement with respect to GPE of CARDINAL DATE ( the socalled TwoPlusFour LAW ) and the conclusion of CARDINAL treaties between GPE and GPE in DATE and DATE that the issue of persons persecuted by the NORP regime was addressed in the bilateral agreement of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subjected to forced labour during the Second World War on the territory of occupied GPE . In DATE he worked on a NORP farm near GPE . Subsequently , from DATE to DATE , the applicant worked as a forest labourer in GPE . Finally , he was relocated to an area situated QUANTITY from his habitual place of residence , where he was required to reinforce NORP defences from DATE to DATE .

On DATE the applicant applied to the NORP - German Reconciliation Foundation ( PERSON ORG Pojednanie \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) for compensation on account of his forced labour from the funds contributed by the government of GPE under LAW of DATE ( see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) , having regard to a document issued by the social security authorities , established that the applicant had been subjected to forced labour from DATE to DATE and awarded him MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation . This payment was granted within the framework of the \u201c primary payments scheme \u201d ( wyp\u0142aty podstawowe ) . The issue of deportation was apparently not addressed in the decision . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal against this decision was dismissed by ORG ( GPE ) on an unspecified date . ORG found that the amount of payment granted to the applicant had been calculated correctly .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the ORG \u2019s management board ( ORG ) adopted ORG no .

On DATE , following the adoption of Resolution no . CARDINAL , ORG granted the applicant a supplementary payment of ORG . The decision on supplementary payment related to the applicant \u2019s forced labour as a child under the age of CARDINAL ( from DATE ) . Thus , the period of forced labour from DATE was not taken into account because the deportation condition as defined in ORG no . CARDINAL had not been met . The period of forced labour from DATE was not acknowledged in the absence of appropriate evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to ORG , challenging the amount of compensation granted . It appears that the applicant complained that the period of his forced labour DATE and DATE , carried out in particularly harsh conditions connected with his relocation , was not taken into account by ORG . Having received no reply to his appeal , the applicant made further enquiries with the ORG on DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant had lodged a complaint with the Ombudsman regarding the ORG \u2019s inactivity . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that , regrettably , he was not in a position to question the lawfulness of resolutions adopted by ORG or any other foundation . ORG was established in accordance with LAW of DATE . In this particular case , the ORG operated under the supervision of the Minister of ORG . However , the ORG could not interfere with the ORG \u2019s actions as long as they complied with its statute and other legal regulations . The ORG also referred to ORG decision of DATE , which refused to recognise the NORP - German Reconciliation Foundation as a public administration body ( see paragraphs DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL .

The applicant was further informed that , since he had resided and performed forced labour on the territory of GPE which , known as GPE at the time , was annexed by ORG in DATE , the obligation to perform forced labour in the area of the applicant \u2019s residence ( his first workplace was located QUANTITY from his place of residence and DATE was in his habitual place of residence ) could not be considered as deportation with a view to performing forced labour . Similarly , the obligation to reinforce NORP defences on NORP territories annexed by ORG was not considered \u201c deportation \u201d under ORG no . CARDINAL .

The ORG was to be established by the government of GPE with a view to providing financial assistance to victims of NORP persecution who had suffered serious damage . The ORG was to determine the necessary criteria for the granting of compensation , having regard to serious damage to the GPE health and to their current financial difficulties .

Lack of legal protection for the entitlements of particular persons to receive benefit from the ORG implies that a claim raised in this respect is not a civil one , and accordingly the jurisdiction of the [ civil ] courts is excluded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG referred to ORG a question of law ( pytanie prawne ) , as to whether decisions given by the bodies of the ORG could be appealed against to ORG and , if not , whether they could be subjected to judicial review in civil proceedings . The ORG relied , inter alia , on LAW . In particular , the ORG asked ORG to consider the following issues :", "( a ) whether there was any legal provision excluding judicial review if a dispute arose between an individual and the ORG ;", "( b ) whether the ORG could be regarded as a body performing functions in the area of public administration , given that it served public aims with the use of public resources ;", "( c ) whether LAW and LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW constituted sufficient grounds to conclude that it could not perform any functions in the area of public administration ;", "( d ) whether the assessment of facts and law established by the ORG also had a bearing on the claimant \u2019s relationship with the Director of the Veterans and ORG ;", "( e ) NORP whether the decision to award or refuse to award compensation was not a purely technical act , since it was always preceded by a legal assessment of an individual case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy ) adopted Decision no . III ZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL , holding that , since administrative functions could only be delegated by a statute , which was not the case with regard to the Polish - German Reconciliation Foundation , its decisions did not meet the requirements of an administrative decision and thus could not be challenged before ORG . However , ORG refused to give a definite answer to the question whether the ORG \u2019s decisions were subject to judicial review in civil proceedings . It nevertheless observed that entitlement to receive a benefit from the ORG did not fall within the scope of civil law , and thus could not be raised before a civil court . In exceptional cases , such as where the claimant \u2019s eligibility was established but the benefit had not been paid , a claim could arise under civil law .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that the fact that the ORG \u2019s aims were the same as the aims which were to be achieved by the public authorities would not justify the conclusion that ORG performed functions in the area of public administration . Similarly , the manner in which the ORG had been established and the nature of its tasks , common DATE in ORG view \u2013 to all foundations , could not support the above conclusion .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( no . V SAB MONEY ) , ORG ruled :", "\u201c The Polish - German Reconciliation Foundation does not perform any functions in the area of public administration , in that there is no legal provision giving it the competence to do so . It follows that , in view of the lack of statutory authority , decisions granting or refusing to grant compensation to a victim of the NORP regime are not administrative decisions and can not be challenged before ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( no . III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG ruled that a plaintiff \u2019s claim seeking recognition of the fact that he had been subjected to forced labour during the Second World War could not be examined by a ( civil ) court . ORG considered that the awarding of compensation by the ORG under the second compensation scheme did not create an individual right of a contractual nature . The ORG decided whether the eligibility conditions for the granting of payment were established . Thus , according to ORG , the ORG was not a debtor vis - \u00e0 - vis the claimants , but acted as a decision - making body . The ORG \u2019s decisions merely created a legal basis for the awarding of compensation . The above situation did not , therefore , resemble civil - law relations .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( no . OPS MONEY ) , ORG confirmed the earlier case - law to the effect that it did not have jurisdiction to review the decisions of the ORG and observed :", "\u201c The Polish - German Reconciliation Foundation , which awards benefits to the victims of NORP persecution using the financial resources allocated to it by foreign entities , does not perform functions in the area of public administration . Thus , the source of the entitlement to receive an award from the ORG does not stem from acts of the public administration . \u201d", "It further observed :", "\u201c There is no doubt that the Agreement of DATE concluded between the NORP and NORP governments , which was not ratified , as well as subsequent acts [ starting with ORG and LAW ] concerning grants of financial assistance by the ORG on account of NORP persecution do not fulfil the criteria which would make it possible to classify them as sources of binding NORP law . No administrative - law relation arises between a claimant and the ORG on the basis of the aforementioned acts , and consequently the ORG is not an organ of public administration established by law to determine cases in the sphere of public administration . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
