HUNGARY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Length of pre-trial detention)", "JUDGES": "Carlo Ranzoni", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , quoting the relevant sections of LAW , ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention on charges of terrorist acts and other related offences involving abuse of firearms and explosives on the grounds that he might abscond for fear of a severe punishment , might frustrate the on - going investigation by colluding with accomplices still at large , or might execute the planned offences or re - offend .", "CARDINAL . The detention measure was extended on DATE and again on DATE . The court reiterated its earlier reasons , adding that the risk of collusion was serious , since certain other suspects had not yet been apprehended .", "CARDINAL . A further extension was ordered on DATE . The court stated that the applicant was being prosecuted for terrorist acts committed as an associate of an organised criminal group whose plans entailed a real risk of loss of life . It was of note that the group had existed for quite some time and had been committed to carrying out terrorist acts . Moreover , the volume of evidence supporting a reasonable suspicion , as weighed individually against the applicant , was increasing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was again extended , the court noting that , in view of the grounds for his detention , not even his clean criminal record , family ties and settled background could provide adequate justification for a less strict measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the measure was renewed , with special reference to the fact that the case was concerned with a series of crimes committed over a long period of time by a criminal organisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be held under house arrest , holding that the danger of his re - offending was not of a degree that justified his continued detention , noting also that the investigation was about to be wrapped up and that , in any case , some accomplices in the case had already been released pending trial .", "The applicant was released from detention DATE . During the ensuing period he complied with the rules of house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again ordered the applicant \u2019s detention . It held that the charges of several very serious offences committed over a long time in an organised group were of such gravity that they could not be addressed merely by house arrest .", "CARDINAL . The measure was extended on DATE . In addition to the previously cited reasons , the court considered that there was no reason to assume that the applicant \u2019s political motivation behind the incriminated acts had subsided , which meant that the risk of re - offending was real .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s house arrest , observing that the applicant had abided by the previous house arrest ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and holding that the risk of re - offending was slight .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s house arrest was replaced by a restraining order , which was eventually lifted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was again detained on remand for the purposes of prosecution for a new offence allegedly committed during the on - going proceedings . He was accused of having threatened and harassed a relative of CARDINAL of the witnesses in the main case . For want of evidence , this new investigation was discontinued on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was released from detention and put under house arrest , which lasted until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and his accomplices were convicted . He was sentenced to DATE in a strict - regime prison .", "CARDINAL . Both the defendants and the prosecution appealed . The outcome of the ensuing proceedings is unknown ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
