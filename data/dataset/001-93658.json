The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and her then husband ORG , who had decided to get divorced , entered into an agreement on the partition of their joint property . The agreement stipulated , inter alia , that ORG would transfer to her , within DATE , the ownership of LOC on FAC , unless they agreed on a different location . The agreement further stipulated that if the stated obligations were not fulfilled , the applicant could terminate the agreement and claim a share of the joint property in accordance with the relevant domestic law . On DATE the applicant and ORG divorced .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG did not transfer the ownership of LOC on FAC to the applicant . However , on DATE the applicant accepted the keys of certain LOC on FAC . After ORG had bought the latter premises , on DATE , he offered the applicant the possibility of signing a supplement to the agreement . According to the supplement , the applicant would receive MONEY of the LOC on FAC as a form of alternative performance of the relevant part of the agreement . The applicant refused to sign the supplement to the agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she instituted proceedings in ORG ( PERSON sodi\u0161\u010de v PERSON ) seeking termination of the agreement and partition of the joint property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE F.B. died and his heirs , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , took over his capacity in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court issued a partial judgment terminating the relevant agreement and rejecting the counter - claim lodged by PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( \u201c the heirs \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) quashed the first - instance court \u2019s judgment and remitted the case for re - examination . The applicant then challenged that decision in an appeal on points of law , but that was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the re - examination proceedings , on DATE , the ( renamed ) ORG ( NORP sodi\u0161\u010de v PERSON ) issued a new judgment rejecting the applicant \u2019s claim . The court considered that the relevant agreement was not a \u201c fixed contract \u201d ( fiksna pogodba ) which could be terminated without allowing additional time for its performance . Moreover , from ORG \u2019s conduct it had not been apparent that he was not going to honour his obligation . The applicant should therefore have offered an additional time - limit to ORG In addition , the court found that ORG had in large part fulfilled his obligations and that the applicant , by accepting the keys to the LOC on FAC , had agreed to an alternative performance of the agreement .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance court \u2019s judgment . It , however , amended certain parts concerning the payment of costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with ORG sodi\u0161\u010de ) . She supplemented the appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal to the extent that it concerned the application of law by the lower courts , but dismissed the remainder . ORG considered that the interpretation of the relevant agreement concerned the application of the law . It then concluded that ORG had not fulfilled his obligations by offering the applicant only a share of the LOC on FAC . In addition , the applicant had not consented to the alternative performance nor had ORG showed an intention to fulfil his obligations . ORG consequently varied the lower courts\u2019 judgments and terminated the relevant agreement . As far as the partition of the joint property was concerned , ORG remitted the case to the first - instance court .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the heirs ( J.B.J. and B.E.B. ) lodged a constitutional appeal complaining , inter alia , of the arbitrariness of ORG judgment and of a breach of the provision guaranteeing equal protection of rights ( LAW ) . On DATE ORG ( PERSON sodi\u0161\u010de ) accepted the appeal for consideration , which is equivalent to declaring it admissible . On DATE it upheld the appeal by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , quashed ORG judgment and remitted the case to ORG for re - examination ( decision no . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . It would appear that the applicant was informed of that decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but there is no document in the case file certifying as to when .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that ORG decision was based on the interpretation of the parties\u2019 motivation and of the content of the agreement . In its view , such interpretation constituted an interference with the facts established by the lower courts . However , according to the domestic legislation , ORG , when deciding on an appeal on points of law , had jurisdiction only for the determination of legal issues . ORG found that ORG decision was obviously erroneous and therefore arbitrary . This , and the fact that ORG had exceeded its jurisdiction , represented an interference with the appellants\u2019 right to equal protection of rights .", "CARDINAL . In the re - examination proceedings , ORG , on DATE , again varied the lower courts\u2019 judgments by terminating the relevant agreement and remitting the case to the first - instance court to determine the partition of the joint property .", "CARDINAL . After accepting for consideration the relevant part of the heirs\u2019 further constitutional appeal on DATE , ORG , on DATE , quashed ORG judgment , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law and upheld ORG judgment of DATE . The decision was adopted by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL ( decision no . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court found that ORG had again dealt with questions of fact DATE a matter over which it had no jurisdiction ; that it had failed to provide reasons for its decision , which was different from previous decisions adopted in other cases concerning the same issue ; and that it had disregarded the instructions given by ORG . The latter therefore again found a violation of the right to equal protection of rights . Using the special power afforded in section CARDINAL of LAW and because of the already lengthy duration of the proceedings , ORG , in order to secure effective judicial protection , decided on the merits of the case itself and upheld ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court \u2019s decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE noted , under paragraph CARDINAL , as follows :", "\u201c in accordance with the provisions of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , ORG served the constitutional appeal on ORG , on the opposite party ( plaintiff ) to the proceedings [ the applicant ] and on the third defendant in the proceedings . None of them replied to the constitutional appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , she had not received a copy of the first constitutional appeal . On DATE , a note was prepared by an official in this connection on ORG premises . The note , which appeared to be part of the file no . Up CARDINAL/CARDINAL , mentioned that the constitutional appeal and admissibility decision of DATE had been handed over to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the applicant submitted to the ORG copies of receipts relating to the attempt to serve the process by ORG , concerning the file no . Up CARDINAL/CARDINAL . It would appear that this process included a copy of the second constitutional appeal , the admissibility decision and a letter informing the applicant that the constitutional appeal had been accepted for consideration and that that the applicant should submit her comments within DATE . It transpires from the receipts that the process was sent by ORG on DATE but had not been served on the applicant . The address referred to in the receipts and the letter is different from the applicant \u2019s address as mentioned in her claim and in the decisions issued in the domestic proceedings , including in the last ORG judgment . According to the applicant , the address used to serve the process was actually the address of CARDINAL of the other parties to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Zakon o Ustavnem sodi\u0161\u010du , ORG no . CARDINAL ) provides , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c For procedural questions which are not governed by LAW , the ORG shall apply the relevant provisions of legislation concerning [ ordinary ] court proceedings , taking into consideration the nature of the matter . \u201d", "\u201c After being accepted , a constitutional appeal shall be referred to the body which issued the decision against which the constitutional appeal is lodged , in order for that body to reply to the constitutional appeal within a given time - limit . \u201d", "\u201c CARDINAL . If ORG quashes a decision , it may also decide on a relevant right or freedom if such procedure is necessary in order to bring to an end consequences that have already occurred on the basis of the quashed decision , or if so required by the nature of the constitutional right or freedom , and provided that a decision can be given on the basis of information in the file .", ".... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG adopted amendments to LAW ( Official Gazette no . DATE ) . Section CARDINAL was amended to read :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If ORG accepts a constitutional appeal for consideration , it shall inform the body which issued the decision against which the constitutional appeal is lodged accordingly . A ORG judge .... can request the body ... to submit information or an explanation necessary for the decision on the constitutional appeal .", "CARDINAL . In the above circumstances , the constitutional appeal should be sent to the persons who participated in the proceedings leading to the decision challenged in the appeal if that decision concerned CARDINAL of their rights , obligations or legal interests , so that they can reply to it within a certain time - limit . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of LAW ( Zakon o pravdnem postopku , ORG no . CARDINAL , in force since DATE ) provides that an appeal on points of law is not allowed in respect of an alleged erroneous or insufficient establishment of the facts .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of LAW , proceedings which have been finally concluded by a court decision ( pravnomo\u010dno kon\u010dan ) can be reopened at the request of a party to the proceedings , if , inter alia , that party did not have an opportunity to give testimony in court , due to some illegality , in particular lack of service . The final conclusion of the proceedings in principle refers to the final decision against which no ordinary appeal lies ; that would normally be a decision of a first - instance court , or if an appeal has been lodged , that of a second - instance court .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the same act provides that certain documents ( such as statements of claim , notices of extraordinary remedies or judgments which can be appealed against ) should be served on parties in person . If the party is not found at his or her address , the server should leave a note informing him or her of a new date on which he or she is to be served with the process . If the party is not found at his or her address on that date , the server will serve the process on , inter alia , an adult family member , who will be required to accept the process . If that is not possible , the server will return the process to the court or leave it at a local post office . The server will leave a note at the party \u2019s address informing him or her of the process and the DATE deadline for its collection . The note shall also state the reasons why the process was left at the post office or the court and the date of that event . Under the above conditions and , as the case may be , after the expiry of the deadline , the process will be considered to have been effectively served on the addressee ( sections CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted CARDINAL decisions by which ORG had decided on requests for reopening of the proceedings before it . CARDINAL of them ( decision no . U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE and decision no . U - I-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) concern proceedings by which the constitutionality and legality of a statutory act were being challenged ( postopek za oceno ustavnosti in zakonitosti ) . In both of them , ORG found that neither LAW nor any other legislation provided for the possibility of reopening such proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the oldest of the remaining CARDINAL decisions concerning proceedings in which a constitutional appeal had been dismissed ( decision no . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , the panel of CARDINAL members of ORG ( that is a formation in which a decision on admissibility is normally taken ) dismissed the request for reopening . It explained that the appellant had not invoked any of the grounds which would justify reopening under the relevant provision of LAW and section CARDINAL of LAW . Likewise , in all the remaining decisions ( decision no . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , decision no . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE and decision no . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) ORG found that the appellants had not demonstrated any grounds which could justify reopening under LAW and the relevant provisions of the legislation concerning court proceedings . It therefore rejected the requests , but added that this decision was taken \u201c without considering the issue whether the reopening of the proceedings before ORG was actually possible \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
