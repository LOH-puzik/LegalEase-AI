The first applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . The second applicant ( \u201c the applicant company \u201d ) is a limited liability company based in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company publishes a newspaper called ORG which has a circulation of CARDINAL . On DATE it published an article on a criminal trial concerning the drunken and disorderly behaviour , including an assault on a police officer , of PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG . The article bore the title \u201c His wife [ is ] the chairperson of the parliamentary ORG from ORG hits policeman in restaurant \u201d ( \u201c Vaimo eduskunnan sivistysvaliokunnan puheenjohtaja PERSON asianajaja iski poliisia ravintolassa \u201d ) .", "Follow - up articles were published on DATE and DATE concerning the verdict whereby the defendant was convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 suspended imprisonment .

Husband of member of parliament receives harsh sentence for violence in restaurant \u201d ( \u201c ... GPE miehelle kova tuomio ravintolassa riehumisesta \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The trial of PERSON had been widely publicised and discussed locally , and the role of PERSON who was in no way involved in the criminal proceedings \u2013 had become the subject of , inter alia , political satire in a programme ( \u201c GPE ) broadcast on the main national television channel .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , who did not dispute the facts as presented by ORG , instituted proceedings against the applicants and CARDINAL of the journalists involved on the grounds that the reporting by ORG had been libellous and had invaded her privacy . She requested that the respondents be punished for invasion of privacy and defamation , and claimed compensation for non - pecuniary damage caused by the articles . Moreover , she relied on LAW of LAW then in force ( valtiop\u00e4iv\u00e4j\u00e4rjestys , riksdagsordningen ) which stipulated that members of parliament as well as parliamentary officials were to enjoy special protection in the performance of their duties and for the duration of parliamentary sessions . Criminal offences , in the form of words or physical acts , that violated the rights of members of parliament or officials while ORG was in session , or subsequent physical violence , were to be regarded as being committed in particularly aggravating circumstances . According to PERSON , this provision was applicable both in relation to the criminal charges and in determining the amount of damages in her case . She argued that the articles had caused her particular suffering as she had been publicly associated with a criminal act that was in no way connected to her person or function as member of parliament .", "CARDINAL . As editor - in - chief of ORG the first applicant , PERSON , admitted to being superficially aware of the type of material published but denied any detailed prior knowledge of the specific material in question . According to section DATE of the Freedom of LAW then in force ( painovapauslaki , tryckfrihetslag ; DATE , replaced by Act no . CARDINAL in DATE ) , an editor - in - chief was ultimately responsible for any original material published in his newspaper or periodical , regardless of whether he had in fact been aware of its contents . The defendants also argued that they had only mentioned in their articles that PERSON was married to PERSON , a fact which was not denied by PERSON She had not been otherwise mentioned in the articles . Moreover , the case had already been reported locally and their article contained no new information as such . They also argued that a member of parliament , as a public political figure , must tolerate more from the media than an \u201c average citizen \u201d and that it was particularly disturbing that a member of parliament was trying to limit the GPE freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the first applicant and the CARDINAL other journalists on CARDINAL count of invasion of privacy under particularly aggravating circumstances within the meaning of section CARDINAL of LAW .

The defamation charges were dropped .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that , as a whole , the banner headlines , the front pages and the articles themselves were published with the purpose of drawing the ORG attention principally to PERSON marital relationship with PERSON and not with the purpose of depicting the events as such . It further found that the highlighted publication of PERSON name , picture and professional status was in no way necessary in order to report on the criminal trial of PERSON It acknowledged that the protection of the private life of PERSON , as a member of parliament , was narrower than that of other persons , but only in so far as the matters in question were connected to her public functions and there was a public interest justifying their publication . The fact that the conviction of the spouse of a politician could affect people \u2019s voting intentions did not in itself render the matter of public interest such as to justify the publication .", "ORG held that the fact that the actions of the plaintiff \u2019s husband and the criminal proceedings against him had been well known in their home district and the fact that the local newspapers had been reporting the matter had no bearing on the GPE liability . According to the judgment , it was the nationwide publicity accorded by ORG and the resultant infringement of the plaintiff \u2019s protected private domain that had essentially constituted the criminal offence in question .", "It further held that , although the reasons underlying section CARDINAL of LAW could be regarded as outdated , it was a mandatory provision , leading to conviction for an offence categorised as aggravated .", "As to the determination of the amount of compensation for suffering , ORG noted that the plaintiff herself , especially as she was also a doctor and thus an expert , was best placed to assess her own situation and the damage she had sustained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) dismissed the joint appeal of the defendants and upheld ORG judgment without any observations on the merits of the case , save for a minor correction of the lower court \u2019s statement as to the alleged unlawful benefit accruing to the publishers . ORG added that regardless of this correction the damages awarded to the plaintiff were not to be considered excessive .", "CARDINAL .

Furthermore , the person \u2019s consent to the disclosure of the information is relevant to the assessment of the lawfulness of the interference .

On DATE ORG delivered CARDINAL judgments relating to articles which had given information on cases of arson . The first judgment ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) concerned a newspaper article ( summary from ORG Yearbook ) :", "\u201c A newspaper published an article concerning cases of arson , in which it was said that the suspect was the wife of the head of a local fire department . As it was not even alleged that the head of the fire department had any role in the events , there was no justifiable reason for publishing the information on the marriage between him and the suspect . The publisher , the editor - in - chief and the journalist who wrote the article were ordered to pay compensation for the suffering caused by the violation of the right to respect for private life . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The other judgment ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) concerned an article published in a periodical , which was based on the aforementioned newspaper article ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and on the records of the pre - trial investigation and the court proceedings , but did not indicate that the newspaper article had been used as a source ( summary from the ORG ) :", "\u201c Compensation was ordered to be paid for the reason that the article violated the right to respect for private life . Another issue at stake in the precedent was the relevance to liability for damages and the amount of compensation of the fact that the information had been reported in another publication at an earlier stage . \u201d", "The article published in the periodical had also mentioned the name and profession of the head of the fire department , although the offence was not related to the performance of his duties . Thus , it had not been necessary to refer to his position as head of the fire department or to his marriage to the suspect in order to give an account of the offence .", "ORG considered that the fact that the information had previously been published in print did not relieve the defendants of their responsibility to ensure , before publishing the information again , that the article did not contain information insulting the persons mentioned in it . The mere fact that the interview with the head of the fire department had been published in the newspaper did not justify the conclusion that he had also consented to its publication in the periodical .", "ORG further found that repeating a violation did not necessarily cause the same amount of damage and suffering as the initial violation . The readers of the newspaper and the periodical were partly different , and the circulation of the newspaper apparently did not entirely coincide with that of the periodical . Therefore , and considering the differences in the content and tone of the articles , ORG found it established that the article published in the periodical was conducive to causing the head of the fire department additional mental suffering .", "The publisher and its partners were ordered jointly to pay ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) plus interest for the mental suffering caused to the head of the fire department .", "According to ORG , the events reported in the article did not concern the plaintiff \u2019s conduct in the performance of his duties as head of the fire department and it had not been necessary to mention the complainant \u2019s name and profession for the purpose of discussing a matter involving significant public interest . It had not been necessary to refer to the complainant \u2019s profession in order to report on the offences . By associating the complainant \u2019s name and profession with the offences in question , the article had unlawfully spread information and insinuations concerning his private life likely to cause him damage and suffering . The disclosure of the complainant \u2019s name and the emphasis on his occupation had amounted to an insult . By again reporting on DATE after the events had occurred , the periodical was found to have caused the complainant additional suffering for which separate compensation was to be paid .", "CARDINAL . In another judgment ( ORG CARDINAL ) , ORG held as follows ( summary from the ORG ) :", "\u201c The accused had picked up a photograph of the plaintiff from the archives of a newspaper and published it in the context of an electoral campaign without the plaintiff \u2019s consent . He was convicted of a violation of private life and ordered , jointly with the political organisations which had acted as publishers , to pay damages for mental suffering . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
