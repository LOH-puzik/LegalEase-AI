IRELAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson;Luzius Wildhaber;Nicolas Bratza;Paul Mahoney", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a police officer ( garda ) . At TIME on DATE , when off - duty , the applicant and CARDINAL passengers , in a private car ( described in subsequent police reports as a \u201c jeep \u201d ) towing a van on a trailer , crossed from GPE into GPE at a GPE permanent vehicle checkpoint in GPE . Precisely what occurred that night is disputed between the parties . It is not , however disputed that the applicant accidentally drove his car into the checkpoint barrier . The check - point was manned by armed NORP soldiers , CARDINAL of whom , a corporal in FAC , approached the applicant after the accident . The Government contend that he asked the applicant to stop and was ignored . The applicant alleges that he did stop and that the soldier then waved him on . In any event , it would appear that the soldier moved towards the car and was hit by the vehicle being towed . He was thrown forward on to the tow - bar and dragged for a short distance until he managed to pull himself up into a standing position on the tow - bar . The applicant maintains that he was unaware of the soldier \u2019s position and continued driving into GPE . According to the report completed by ORG in DATE following their investigation into the incident ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the soldier fired QUANTITY shots , CARDINAL of which entered the car \u2019s exhaust pipe , another of which went through the back windscreen and exited through the roof . The Government claim that some , at least , of these shots were fired in GPE . According to the applicant he heard the shots and , fearing a terrorist attack , continued driving until he reached a police station , where he considered he would be safe . He stopped the car QUANTITY from the border , in the village of LOC , in GPE , GPE . According to the police report , at this stage the soldier , described by witnesses as in a state of \u201c blind panic \u201d , ordered the applicant and the CARDINAL passengers to get out of the car and stand against the wall with their hands in the air . The applicant alleges that he turned to face the soldier , intending to explain that he was a police officer and that there was no cause for alarm . Again , according to the applicant , the soldier then aimed his gun at him and pulled the trigger twice , although the shots did not fire because the gun jammed .", "CARDINAL . The NORP police had been notified of the incident at the border and soon arrived at PERSON . The applicant was arrested on suspicion of driving having consumed excess alcohol . He refused to comply with police requests to provide blood and urine samples .", "CARDINAL . As mentioned above , the NORP Police carried out an inquiry into the incident in the course of which CARDINAL witnesses were interviewed . In his report the investigating officer concluded that the applicant had shown \u201c a regrettable degree of recklessness \u201d in leaving the scene of the accident at the check - point . The report continued :", "\u201c This was a most serious incident and one which could have resulted in the serious injury or death of CARDINAL or more persons . First of all the soldier was at great risk , had he fallen off the draw - bar . The CARDINAL occupants of the jeep may well have been shot by [ the soldier ] or his colleagues at the check - point . The safety of the bystanders at PERSON was also put in jeopardy resulting from the presence of the armed and terrified soldier . This matter has been vigorously and thoroughly investigated and the only conceivable reason that I can find that would prompt PERSON to deliberately leave the scene of the accident would be because he was intoxicated ... \u201d .", "The applicant was subsequently prosecuted and convicted in GPE for his refusal to provide blood and urine samples . No disciplinary proceedings were taken against him , but he was transferred to another area .", "CARDINAL . The applicant alleges that he feared for his life and suffered severe post - traumatic shock as a result of the above incident . On DATE he lodged an action in ORG against the individual soldier and the NORP Secretary of ORG for GPE . He claimed damages , including exemplary and punitive damages , in respect of his allegation that the soldier had wrongfully assaulted him by pointing a loaded gun at him and pulling the trigger .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG solicitors wrote to the applicant \u2019s solicitors as follows :", "\u201c ... The Secretary of ORG for GPE bears no responsibility for the actions of the first defendant who is a soldier in ORG under the authority of the Secretary of ORG in GPE and accordingly the Secretary of ORG for GPE is not a proper defendant to these proceedings . Even if the Secretary of ORG was the proper defendant , both it and [ the soldier ] contend that they are exempt from the jurisdiction of the NORP courts on the basis of the doctrine of sovereign immunity . If your client considers that he does have a valid claim there is nothing to prevent him from pursuing it in GPE against the proper body . ... \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s solicitors replied in a letter dated DATE :", "\u201c ... We have also sought advice on the issue of foreign sovereign immunity raised by you and have been advised that , in these circumstances , no such immunity would apply . That being so , our client prefers to seek his redress in the courts of this jurisdiction where the incident in question occurred . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for permission to substitute for the second defendant the GPE Secretary of ORG . On DATE the Secretary of ORG for GPE , claiming sovereign immunity , applied for the summons to be set aside .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG judge granted the Secretary of ORG \u2019s request , on the ground that the applicant was not entitled to bring an action in the NORP courts against a member of a foreign sovereign government .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , arguing , first , that the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not apply to claims for damages for personal injury caused by torts taking place within the forum ORG \u2019s jurisdiction . Secondly , he submitted that the principle of reciprocity should apply to prevent the NORP court granting immunity to GPE in circumstances in which NORP courts , applying LAW DATE , would not grant immunity to GPE . Thirdly , he put forward the argument that , even if the doctrine of state immunity applied , it should yield in his case since he alleged an infringement of the constitutionally protected right to bodily integrity .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE , rejecting the applicant \u2019s appeal . The applicant had relied on ORG judgment in ORG v. ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL IR CARDINAL , but the court held that that judgment was authority only for the proposition that the doctrine of immunity did not apply in respect of commercial or trading activities carried out by a foreign government . The facts alleged by the applicant did not relate to any commercial activity , and it was not established that , as a principle of public international law , immunity no longer applied in respect of personal injuries caused by the tortious act of a foreign ORG \u2019s servant or agent acting within the sphere of sovereign activity ( \u201c de jure imperii \u201d ) . In his judgment , Chief Justice PERSON , with whom Justices O\u2019Flaherty and ORG agreed , observed :", "\u201c There can be no doubt but that the first defendant [ the soldier ] in carrying out his duties at the said checkpoint was acting within the sphere of governmental or sovereign activity and the acts complained of must be regarded as \u2018 jure imperii\u2019 even though alleged to have been committed within this jurisdiction .", "It is submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that , as the acts complained of were tortious and caused personal injuries to him , the principle of foreign sovereign immunity should not apply to such acts and that it was a near - universally recognised principle of international law that claims for personal injuries allegedly inflicted in the forum state by or on behalf of a foreign government constitute an exception to the sovereign immunity principle . In support of such submission , counsel for the plaintiff referred in particular to ORG DATE ; the NORP State Immunity Act DATE ; ORG DATE and LAW DATE . ... The plaintiff relies on these statutes as indicative of a recognised principle of public international law . ... Distinction must be drawn between the provisions of legislation in a number of states and the provisions of public international law , and the principles set forth in individual state legislation can not be regarded as establishing principles of public international law . The provisions of statutes can not be used as evidence of what international law is : statutes are evidence of the domestic law in the individual states and not evidence of international law generally . LAW provides that:- \u2018 A Contracting Party can not claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of another contracting party in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to tangible property , if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory of ORG , and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those facts ORG I do not have to decide , in the circumstances of this case , whether the terms of the Convention are part of the domestic law of this State because even if it were , the plaintiff \u2019s claim herein would fail by virtue of the terms of LAW , which provides that:- \u2018 Nothing in this Convention shall affect any immunities or privileges PERSON enjoyed by ORG in respect of anything done or omitted to ORG be done by , or in relation to its armed forces when on the territory of ORG The terms of LAW recognise that , as a matter of international law , immunities and privileges in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by or in relation to armed forces , when on the territory of ORG , exist . ... Despite the ORG efforts of the plaintiff \u2019s legal advisers in making available to the court copies of all relevant decisions , articles and draft LAW , and the cogent arguments of counsel , I am not satisfied that it is a principle of public international law that the immunity granted to sovereign states should be restricted by making them liable in respect of tortious acts , committed on their behalf by their servant or agent , causing personal injuries to the person affected by such act or omission , when such act or omission is committed jure imperii and I would dismiss the appeal on this point ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not pursue his action against the individual soldier who had allegedly assaulted him .", "CARDINAL . In his judgment in the Government of GPE case ( cited in paragraph CARDINAL above ) , Justice PERSON described the position of sovereign immunity in NORP law as follows :", "\u201c The doctrine of sovereign immunity is one of the generally recognised principles of international law , which , by LAW , s.CARDINAL of the LAW , GPE has accepted as its rule of conduct in its relations with other states .... [ T]he ORG [ ORG ] has never sought to qualify or modify this position ... \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The DATE European Convention on State Immunity ( \u201c the Basle Convention \u201d ) , entered into force on DATE after its ratification by CARDINAL States . It has now been ratified by MONEY ( GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE and GPE ) and signed by CARDINAL other ORG ( GPE ) , but has not been signed or ratified by GPE . It provides in LAW :", "\u201c A ORG can not claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of ORG in proceedings which relate to redress for injury to the person or damage to tangible property , if the facts which occasioned the injury or damage occurred in the territory of the ORG of the forum , and if the author of the injury or damage was present in that territory at the time when those facts occurred . \u201d", "LAW provides :", "\u201c Nothing in this Convention shall affect any immunities or privileges enjoyed by ORG in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by or in relation to its armed forces on the territory of another Contracting State . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG on ORG and Their Property , submitted to ORG of ORG ( ( DATE ) , PERSON ) PERSON CARDINAL ) , provides at Article CARDINAL that :", "\u201c ... a ORG can not invoke immunity from jurisdiction before a court of another ORG which is otherwise competent in a proceeding which relates to pecuniary compensation for death or injury to the person , or damage to or loss of tangible property , caused by an act or omission which is alleged to be attributable to the ORG , if the act or omission occurred in whole or in part in the territory of that other ORG and if the author of the act or omission was present in that territory at the time of the act or omission . \u201d", "In its commentary on that passage , the PERSON noted that the \u201c physical injury ... appears to be confined to insurable risks . The areas of damage envisaged in DATE are mainly concerned with accidental death or physical injuries to persons ... involved in traffic accidents ... Essentially , the rule of non - immunity will preclude the possibility of the insurance company hiding behind the cloak of ORG immunity and evading its liability to the injured individuals . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
