Referring to LAW , ORG argued that the applicant , on account of his age , would manage his integration in GPE . Moreover , the public interest in his expulsion , given the seriousness of his criminal conduct , outweighed his own and his child \u2019s and friend \u2019s family interests . ORG ordered that the applicant be expelled after having served his prison sentence .", "The applicant appealed against this expulsion order and the decision dismissing his administrative appeal to the competent administrative courts . At the same time he applied for an interim measure to stop his expulsion .", "On DATE ORG ( Verwaltungsgericht ) refused his request for an interim measure .
