AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life)", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Steiner;Erik M\u00f8se;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the biological mother of PERSON , then DATE and born out of wedlock , set her apartment on fire after having consumed drugs . The mother and her child were rescued and , on DATE , ORG ( ORG f\u00fcr ORG und Familie ) handed PERSON over to the applicants as foster parents .", "CARDINAL . The applicants subsequently tried to obtain custody of PERSON and wanted to adopt him . PERSON \u2019s mother recovered and was at first allowed access to visit her son . She then tried to obtain custody of PERSON , which led to arguments between her and the applicants . Since these disputes were to the detriment of PERSON , he was given to a \u201c crisis foster family \u201d ( Krisenpflegefamilie ) on DATE for DATE . After that period PERSON was handed over to his biological mother , who obtained provisional custody of him following a decision of ORG ( GPE ) on DATE . This decision entered into force on DATE , when ORG rejected an appeal by the applicants ( Revisionsrekurs ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime on DATE the applicants requested the right to visit F. Thereupon ORG asked ORG for their observations on the applicants\u2019 request .", "CARDINAL . ORG submitted observations on DATE , stating that because of the long - lasting relationship between PERSON and the applicants it would be inappropriate not to allow access to the foster parents .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard the biological mother , who opposed the granting of visiting rights to the applicants because PERSON was in the process of getting used to her again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested the acceleration of the proceedings ( PERSON ) under LAW of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Wiener Jugendgerichtshilfe ) submitted their observations to ORG . In DATE both parties repeatedly filed written observations on that report . The applicants also requested that an expert for child psychology be appointed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained about the length of the proceedings and requested the opinion of an expert on child psychology . The biological mother objected to this request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the applicants whether they were maintaining their request for the appointment of an expert , given that meanwhile a report by the doctor with whom PERSON had had therapy had been obtained . On DATE the applicants informed the court that they insisted on the appointment of an expert and proposed further questions to be put to the expert appointed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG designated Dr. PERSON . as the expert . The biological mother filed objections against PERSON .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the court file was transferred to ORG , which was dealing with an appeal lodged by the applicants in the custody proceedings concerning PERSON lodged on DATE . On an unspecified date ORG transferred the file to ORG as it considered that that court was competent to decide on the appeal . ORG did so on DATE ; the file was then forwarded to ORG , which had meanwhile become competent to deal with custody and visiting - rights proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON asked ORG for leave to be discharged from the duty to prepare an expert report . He submitted that a report was not feasible because he had not been given the opportunity to examine F. thoroughly by PERSON \u2019s mother .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing with the parties on DATE in order to discuss how to proceed further with the case . The judge informed the applicants and the biological mother that he would ask ORG of ORG ( ORG ) for a final report on the issue of visiting rights .", "CARDINAL . P. , who was the officer in charge at ORG of ORG , submitted the report on DATE . She recommended refusing visiting rights to the applicants , because the reestablishment of contact with PERSON after it had been interrupted for DATE might harm the psychological stability of the child . On DATE and DATE the parties submitted their comments on that report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr. PERSON of ORG ( Kinder- und jugendpsychologischer ORG ) also suggested that the applicants should not be granted access to PERSON , explaining that PERSON was aware of the difficulties between his mother and the applicants and therefore , as a protective measure , had said that he did not want to see the applicants . Dr. PERSON further stated that not seeing the applicants was not to the detriment of the child . The applicants submitted observations regarding these recommendations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the ORG request to visit PERSON and found that failure to provide for personal contact ( ORG PERSON ) between the applicants and PERSON did not endanger his well - being .", "CARDINAL . It found that under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW a court , upon the request of a parent , the child , a youth welfare body or of its own motion had to take the necessary measures if failure to provide for personal contact between the child and the third person would endanger his or her well - being . Third persons , in contrast to parents or grandparents , had no legal right to be granted contact rights and consequently no legal standing in related court proceedings . They could merely suggest to the court ( anregen ) that it examine the matter of its own motion , and a court could only grant contact rights if failure to do so would endanger the child \u2019s well - being .", "CARDINAL . Taking the ORG request as such a suggestion , visiting rights could not be granted . From all the material in the possession of ORG it was evident that PERSON was vehemently opposed to meeting the applicants , while at the same time he had developed a close and positive relationship with his mother . ORG acknowledged that the applicants had a genuine concern for PERSON \u2019s well - being ; however , in the present situation the interests of the applicants did not coincide with the child \u2019s best interests . Given that F. had not been in contact with his foster parents for DATE , ORG would follow the conclusions in the reports of P. , from ORG of ORG , and Dr. PERSON , from ORG . It was quite possible that immediately after PERSON had been placed with the \u201c crisis foster family \u201d in DATE the granting of visiting rights to the applicants might have been useful . However , this was no longer the case and it now served the best interests of the child , who was living with his biological mother , not to put him back in a situation of divided loyalties ( PERSON ) between her and his \u201c former family \u201d , the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed against ORG decision . They argued that the refusal of visiting rights breached their rights under LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on DATE . It found that foster parents could file requests in proceedings concerning the foster child and also had the right to appeal against decisions . The status of a foster parent was , however , a matter which depended rather on whether the person actually cared for the child and whether a lasting emotional link similar to the CARDINAL between parents and children had developed . Even though the applicants had lived with PERSON for DATE in the same household with the intent to develop such emotional ties , it was actually DATE since they had had care of him and they could now no longer be considered his foster parents . Nevertheless , their appeal had to be considered on its merits , and , for the reasons given by ORG , granting visiting rights to them was not in the best interests of F. The appeal was therefore unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an extraordinary appeal by the applicant ( au\u00dferordentlicher Revisionsrekurs ) . That decision was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch ) reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If CARDINAL parent does not live in a common household with a minor child , then the child and this parent have the right to be in personal contact with each other . The exercise of this right shall be regulated by mutual consent between the child and the parents . Whenever such an agreement can not be reached , the court shall regulate the exercise of this right in a manner appropriate for the welfare of the child , upon an application by the child or a parent , giving due consideration to the needs and wishes of the child .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If necessary , the court shall restrict or not permit the exercise of the right to personal contact , especially if the authorised parent does not comply with his / her obligation under LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) Paragraphs ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) shall apply by analogy to the relationship between grandchildren and their grandparents . However , the exercise of the right of grandparents shall also be restricted or not permitted to such an extent that this would otherwise disturb the family life of the parents ( a parent ) or their relationship to the child .", "( CARDINAL ) Where the absence of personal contact between the minor child and a third party that is ready to engage in such contact may jeopardise the child \u2019s welfare , the court shall issue the disposition necessary to regulate the personal contact upon an application by the child , a parent , the youth welfare agency , or of its own motion . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
