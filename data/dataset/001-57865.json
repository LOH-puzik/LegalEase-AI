Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , who are NORP nationals , have both lived in GPE since DATE . They were married in GPE in DATE and PERSON has NORP citizenship also . In accordance with NORP law ( LAW ) , they chose the wife \u2019s surname , \" PERSON \" , as their family name ; the husband availed himself of his right to put his own surname in front of that and thus call himself \" PERSON \" .", "CARDINAL . The NORP registry office ( GPE ) having recorded \" Schnyder \" as their joint surname , the couple applied to substitute \" PERSON \" as the family surname and \" PERSON \" as the husband \u2019s surname . On DATE the cantonal government ( NORP ) of GPE turned down the application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants made a further application to the cantonal ORG ) of ORG , following an amendment to LAW as regards the effects of marriage , which had been made on DATE and had come into force on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE their application was again refused , on the ground that they had not pointed to any serious inconvenience arising from the use of the surname \" PERSON \" . Furthermore , in the absence of any transitional provisions the new LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW could not apply to couples married before DATE . Lastly , under the new LAW para .

The applicants then lodged an appeal ( GPE ) with ORG ( PERSON ) in which they complained of , among other things , a breach of the new LAW and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW and LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) .", "On DATE ORG allowed the appeal in part . While refusing to apply paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , which concerned only engaged couples and had no retrospective effect , it held that in the particular case there were important factors which justified applying paragraph CARDINAL in order to allow the applicants to call themselves \" Burghartz \" ; apart from DATE and profession , account had to be taken of the differences between the relevant NORP and NORP systems , which were made more acute by the fact that PERSON was a frontier city .", "As to Mr PERSON \u2019s application to be allowed to bear the name \" PERSON \" , no support for it could be found in LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ; the drafting history showed that ORG , out of a concern to preserve family unity and avoid a break with tradition , had never agreed to introduce absolute equality between spouses in the choice of name and had thus deliberately restricted to wives the right to add their own surnames to their husbands\u2019 . This rule therefore could not avail by analogy a husband in a family known by the wife \u2019s surname . There was , however , nothing to prevent Mr PERSON from using a double - barrelled name ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or even , informally , putting his surname before his wife \u2019s .", "CARDINAL .
