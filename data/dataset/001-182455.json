In DATE the NORP law - enforcement authorities of the GPE of GPE conducted a monitoring exercise of users of the so - called \u201c NORP \u201d network . The NORP police established that some of the users owned and exchanged child pornography in the form of pictures or videos . Files containing illegal content were exchanged through the so - called \u201c NORP \u201d ( peer - to - peer ) file - sharing network in which each of the connected computers acted as both a client and a server . Hence , each user could access all files made available for sharing by other users of the network and download them for his or her use . Among the dynamic Internet Protocol ( \u201c IP \u201d ) addresses recorded by the NORP police was also a certain dynamic IP address , which was later linked to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Based on the data obtained by the NORP police , on DATE the NORP police , without obtaining a court order , requested company S. , a NORP Internet service provider ( hereinafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , to disclose data regarding the user to whom the above - mentioned IP address had been assigned at TIME on DATE . The police based their request on section DATE ) of LAW ( hereinafter \u201c the CPA \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which required the operators of electronic communication networks to disclose to the police information on the owners or users of certain means of electronic communication whose details were not available in the relevant directory . In response , on DATE the ORG gave the police the name and address of the applicant \u2019s father , who was a subscriber to the Internet service relating to the respective IP address .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police proposed that ORG request the investigating judge of ORG to issue an order demanding that the ORG disclose both the personal data of the subscriber and traffic data linked to the IP address in question . On DATE such a court order was obtained on the basis of section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of the CPA and the ORG gave the police the required data .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG issued an order to carry out a house search of the applicant \u2019s family home . The order indicated the applicant \u2019s father as the suspect . During the house search the police and the investigating judge of the ORG seized CARDINAL computers and later made copies of their hard disks .", "CARDINAL . Based on a conversation with the applicant \u2019s family members , of which no record is available , the police changed the suspect to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Reviewing the hard disks , the police found that CARDINAL of them contained files with pornographic material involving minors . The police established that the applicant had installed eMule , a file - sharing program , on CARDINAL of the computers by means of which he had been able to download different files from other users of the program and had also automatically offered and distributed his own files to them . Among the files downloaded by the applicant , a small percentage had contained child pornography .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the LOC prosecutor requested that a judicial investigation be opened against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In his defence before the investigating judge , the applicant argued , inter alia , that he had not been aware of the content of the files in question . He also argued that the ORG had unlawfully , without a judicial warrant , passed his data , including his address , to the police .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG , opened a judicial investigation against the applicant on the basis of a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the criminal offence of displaying , manufacturing , possessing and distributing pornographic material under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW . The judge noted , among other things , that the applicant \u2019s father had been the holder of the identified IP address and that the applicant had allegedly been logging into the respective program under the name of \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel lodged an appeal against the decision to open a judicial investigation . He argued , inter alia , that the evidence concerning the identity of the user of the respective IP address had been obtained unlawfully . That information concerned the traffic data and should therefore not have been obtained without a judicial warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an interlocutory panel of the court rejected the appeal finding that , although counsel had argued that the identity of the user of the IP address had been obtained unlawfully , he had not requested that certain documents be excluded from the file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG lodged an indictment against the applicant for the above - mentioned criminal offence .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the applicant lodged a written request for exclusion of evidence obtained unlawfully , including the information concerning the user of the respective IP address obtained without a court order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court rejected the applicant \u2019s request , finding that the data concerning the user of the respective IP address had been obtained in compliance with section CARDINAL ) of the CPA .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of the criminal offence with which he had been charged . Based on the opinion of an expert in computer science , ORG held that the applicant must have been aware of the CARDINAL pornographic pictures and CARDINAL videos involving minors which he had downloaded through ORG networks and made available for sharing with other users . The applicant was sentenced to a suspended prison term of DATE with a probation period of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the district state prosecutor appealed against the first - instance judgment . The applicant challenged the facts as established by ORG . He also alleged that the subscriber information the NORP police had acquired without a court order , and thus unlawfully , should have been excluded as evidence . Consequently , all the evidence based on such unlawfully acquired data should also have been excluded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the appeal of the district state prosecutor in part , converting the applicant \u2019s suspended sentence into a prison term of DATE . The applicant \u2019s appeal was dismissed as unfounded . ORG confirmed that the first - instance court had correctly established the facts of the case ; moreover , it held that the data concerning the user of the IP address had been obtained lawfully , as no court order was required for such a purpose .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law before ORG , reiterating that a dynamic IP address could not be compared to a telephone number which was not entered in a telephone directory , as a new IP address was assigned to a computer each time the user logged on . Accordingly , such data should be considered as traffic data constituting circumstances and facts connected to the electronic communication and attracting the protection of privacy of communication . The applicant argued that the NORP police should not have obtained the respective dynamic IP address without a court order , and nor should the NORP police have obtained the data on the identity of the subscriber associated with the IP address without such an order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , reasoning that given the general accessibility of websites and the fact that the NORP police could check the exchanges in the NORP network simply by monitoring the users sharing certain contents , that is without any particular intervention in internet traffic , such communication could not be considered private and thus protected by LAW . Moreover , in ORG view , the NORP police had not acquired traffic data about the applicant \u2019s electronic communication , but only data regarding the user of a particular computer through which the Internet had been accessed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before ORG , reiterating the complaints adduced before the lower courts .", "CARDINAL . ORG asked the Information Commissioner to express her position on the issue . The Information Commissioner was of the view that the reason for obtaining the identity of an individual user of electronic communication was precisely that he or she communicated by means of more or less publicly accessible websites . In the Information Commissioner \u2019s view , it was impossible to separate traffic data from subscriber data , as traffic data alone did not make any sense if one did not ascertain who the person behind those data was DATE this latter information was thus considered to be an extremely important element of communication privacy . The Information Commissioner also highlighted that the provisions of LAW in force at the material time required a court order regarding all data related to electronic communications , irrespective of whether they related to traffic or identification data . In the Information Commissioner \u2019s view , section CARDINALb ( CARDINAL ) of the CPA , which required only a written request from the police to obtain data on who was communicating , was constitutionally problematic .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint , holding that his constitutional rights had not been violated . ORG decision was adopted by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . Judge PERSON and Judge PERSON wrote dissenting opinions . The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court pointed out , at the outset , that in addition to the content of communications , LAW also protected traffic data , that is any data processed for the transmission of communications in an electronic communications network . It considered that IP addresses were included in such traffic data . ORG , however , concluded that the applicant , who had not hidden in any way the IP address through which he had accessed the Internet , had consciously exposed himself to the public and could not legitimately have expected privacy . As a result , the data concerning the identity of the user of the IP address were not protected as communication privacy under LAW , but only as information privacy under LAW , and no court order was required in order to disclose them in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . The most relevant parts of ORG decision are as follows ( as translated into LANGUAGE on ORG website ) :", "\u201c Review of the objections regarding access to the complainant \u2019s IP address by the NORP police", "CARDINAL . The second paragraph of LAW provides a higher level of protection than LAW ORG as it requires a court order for any interference with the right to communication privacy ... The right to communication privacy determined by the first paragraph of LAW primarily protects the content of the communicated message . ... In addition to the message content , the circumstances and facts related to the communication are also protected . In accordance with this view , in Decision No . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , dated DATE ( ORG , No . CARDINAL , and QUANTITY , CARDINAL ) ORG extended the protection provided by LAW also to such data regarding telephone calls that by their nature constitute an integral part of communication so that such data can not be obtained without a court order . The mentioned Decision refers otherwise to telephone communication , but the same conclusion can be applied mutatis mutandis to other types of communication at a distance . The crucial constitutional review test for the review of ORG whether a particular communication is protected under LAW is the test of the legitimate expectation of privacy .", "CARDINAL . Communication via the internet takes place , in principle , in an anonymous form , which is essential for the free development of personality , freedom of speech , and the expression of ideas , and , consequently , for the development of a free and democratic society . The privacy of communication protected by the strict conditions determined by the second paragraph of LAW is therefore a very important human right that is becoming increasingly important due to technological advances and the related growing possibilities of monitoring . It entails ORG legitimate expectation that the state will leave them alone also in their communication through modern communication channels and that they do not necessary have to defend themselves for what they do , say , write or think . If there is a suspicion of a criminal offense the Police must have the ability to identify the individuals who have participated in a certain communication related to an alleged criminal offense , because the perpetrators are harder to trace due to this principle of anonymity on the internet . The conditions under which the Police can carry out investigative actions and whether they need a court order , however , depend on whether such entail an interference with the right to communication privacy .", "CARDINAL . As was pointed out above , in addition to the content of communications , LAW also protects traffic data . Traffic data signifies any data processed for the transmission of communications in an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof . Such entails that the IP address is a traffic datum . ORG must therefore answer the question whether the complainant legitimately expected privacy regarding this datum .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL factors must be weighed in relation to this review : the expectation of privacy regarding the IP address and the legitimacy of this expectation , where the latter must be of such nature that the society is willing to accept it as legitimate . The complainant in the case at issue communicated with other users of the FAC network by using the eMule application to exchange various files , including those that contained child pornography . With regard to the general anonymity of internet users and also the content of the files , ORG has no doubt that the complainant expected that his communications would remain private , and he also certainly expected that his identity would not be disclosed . The question therefore is whether such expectation of privacy was legitimate . The complainant has not established that the IP address through which he accessed the internet was hidden in any way , and thus invisible to other users , or that access to the FAC network ( and thus to the content of the files ) was in any way restricted , for example by passwords or other means . ... In contrast , in the complainant \u2019s case anyone interested in exchanging such data could have accessed the contested files , and the complainant has not demonstrated that his IP address was in any way concealed or inaccessible by other users of this network . This leads to the conclusion that this entailed an open line of communication with a previously undetermined circle of strangers using the internet worldwide who have shown interest in sharing certain files , while at the same time access to the IP addresses of other users was not limited to users of this network . Therefore , in the view of ORG , the complainant \u2019s expectation of privacy was not legitimate ; that which a person knowingly exposes to the public , even if from a home computer and the shelter of his or her own home , can not be a subject of the protection afforded by LAW . In view of the foregoing , the contested standpoint of ORG does not raise concerns regarding constitutional law . Obtaining the data regarding the complainant\u2019", "...", "Review of the objections regarding access to data on the user of a certain IP address", "CARDINAL . The complainant also challenges the standpoint of ORG that by its request to the service provider under the third paragraph of Article CARDINAL of the CPA the Police did not acquire traffic data , but only data regarding a particular user of a determined means of communication ...", "CARDINAL . In the case at issue , on DATE , on the basis of the third paragraph of Article CARDINAL of the CPA , the Police sent a request to the service provider for data regarding the user to whom IP address CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL was assigned on DATE at CARDINAL . In the response , they received data regarding the user \u2019s name , surname , and address , while the time of the communication set to the nearest second was already known . Then on DATE the ORG also obtained an order issued by the investigating judge on the basis of the first paragraph CARDINAL of the CPA and the service provider also provided the traffic data on the basis of this order . The main issue for ORG at this point is therefore whether obtaining the data regarding the identity of the user of a determined IP address falls within the framework of communication privacy .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the position of ORG . Up-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , LAW also protects traffic data , i.e. data regarding , for example , who , when , with whom , and how often someone communicated . The identity of the communicating individual is one of the important aspects of communication privacy , therefore it is necessary to obtain a court order for its disclosure in accordance with the second paragraph of LAW . Despite this standpoint , ORG decided that the complainant \u2019s allegation of a violation of LAW is unfounded in the case at issue . By his conduct , the complainant has himself waived protection of his privacy by publicly revealing both his own IP address as well as the content of his communications , and therefore can no longer rely on it as regards the disclosure of his identity . Since by such he also waived the legitimate expectation of privacy , the data regarding the identity of the IP address user no longer enjoyed protection in terms of communication privacy , but only in terms of information privacy determined by LAW . Therefore , by obtaining the data on the name , surname , and address of the user of the dynamic IP address through which the complainant communicated the Police did not interfere with his communication privacy and therefore did not require a court order to disclose his identity . In view of the foregoing , the contested position of ORG is not inconsistent with LAW , and the complainant \u2019s complaints in this part are unfounded . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON welcomed ORG departure from ORG view that the information concerned had not amounted to traffic data . However , in her view , the police wishing to obtain identification of the subscriber should have requested a court order . She pointed out that ORG conclusion implied that the protection of privacy of traffic data was always dependent on the protection of the content of communication . Accordingly , traffic data concerning certain communication were protected as long as the content of that communication was protected . Consequently , an individual could not enjoy separate and independent protection of traffic data . Judge PERSON disagreed with this view , pointing out that the applicant had not appeared in public under his own name , but only through the digits of his dynamic IP address .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON agreed with the Information Commissioner that the police had been interested not in the ownership of the device but in \u201c the identity of the person communicating and precisely because he had been communicating \u201d . She endorsed the Commissioner \u2019s view that \u201c the content of communication alone did not have any particular weight in the absence of identification of those communicating \u201d . She also pointed out that under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the new LAW ( \u201c ECA-CARDINAL \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the Internet provider was not allowed to transfer the stored information without a court order . Compared with section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of the CPA , the ECA was definitely more recent and therefore the decision of the majority ran contrary to the level of rights protection already achieved .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON argued that the constitutional guarantees set out in LAW were aimed at strengthening the expectation of privacy in this area of life and preventing disproportionate interferences and an abuse of power by the executive .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s expectation of online anonymity , Judge PERSON argued that none of the data publicly disclosed by the complainant revealed his identity . In her view , anonymity was what prevented the police from linking a particular communication with a particular person \u2013 that is , linking a dynamic IP address and an individual with his or her name and address . She further argued that the question whether the applicant \u2019s manner of communication could lead to the conclusion that his expectation of privacy had not been objectively justified had to be approached by taking all the circumstances into account , including the law that had been in force at the relevant time . She explained that the LAW ( sections CARDINAL ) ) , CARDINAL ) and DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) required Internet providers to delete traffic data as soon as they were no longer needed for the transfer of messages . Moreover , section CARDINAL of the ORG provided that the secrecy of communication could be interfered with only on the basis of a decision by a competent authority . A letter from the police to an Internet provider could not be considered to amount to such a decision . Thus , even if section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) of the CPA could be interpreted as allowing the police to ask for information on an Internet subscriber , it should not apply in the situations covered by the LAW , which explicitly concerned the \u201c protection of secrecy and confidentiality of electronic communications \u201d . Otherwise , the legislation would be contradictory . The judge concluded that the applicable legal framework could not therefore have led to the conclusion that the applicant , as a reasonably and sufficiently informed individual , could not have expected privacy ; that is , he could not have expected that his anonymity would be protected .", "CARDINAL . Judge PERSON went on to elaborate on the neutrality of traffic data , such as data on the user of a certain dynamic IP address :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The traffic datum \u2013 the dynamic IP address that was assigned randomly at a given moment \u2013 as I understand it , reveals how the internet was used on some computer , because it is inextricably attached to a specific connection . ... This is because only the CARDINAL data jointly communicate how the internet was used in a non - anonymised way , i.e. regarding internet use in connection with an identified person . This essential circumstance in my opinion negates the notion of the neutrality of the datum regarding a specific user of services for a certain ( known ) dynamic IP address that the police sought through the service provider - namely , the neutrality of the datum in terms of denying its ability to communicate anything more than the name and address of a certain person ( who has a subscription contract with the service provider ) . Precisely because this datum is inseparably linked to a specific communication , the traffic datum falls within the scope of protected communication privacy .", "CARDINAL . Even if the service provider communicated to the police \u2018 only\u2019 the data identifying a person who had a subscription contract with it , by doing so , as I understand it , the service provider in fact communicated ( to put it simply ) traffic data in an electronic communications network regarding this person . The police also , as I have already explained , wanted to determine more than just the name and surname of a certain person who had concluded a contract . Since , as I understand it , they asked for traffic data associated with a particular person they would have to proceed according to the first paragraph of Article CARDINAL of the CPA and obtain an order from the investigating judge . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
