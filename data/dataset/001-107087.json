The applicants were born respectively in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , and live in LOC , PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . All CARDINAL of them are members and followers of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a political party founded in DATE and based in southwestern GPE ( in an area known as the GPE region or the geographic region of LOC ) . The party was declared unconstitutional by ORG on DATE and as a result dissolved . In a judgment of DATE this ORG found that the party \u2019s dissolution had been in breach of its and its PERSON right to freedom of association ( see ORG PIRIN and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . The party apparently has links with ORG ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) , an association also based in southwestern GPE and advocating similar ideas ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , and PERSON and Others v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants notified the Mayor of Sandanski that ORG intended to organise a rally on DATE , first at the grave of PERSON near FAC and then in front of his monument in the town of ORG . The programme of the event , which was to take place TIME , included the laying of wreaths on the grave QUANTITY and the singing of folk songs in front of the monument TIME", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the applicants of DATE the Mayor of PERSON allowed the rally , specifying that the laying of wreaths had to take place between CARDINAL and CARDINAL a.m. and the musical programme between TIME and TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Regional Governor of ORG , acting of his own motion and relying on section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW and LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , annulled the Mayor \u2019s letter . He reasoned that it amounted to an administrative decision , creating legal rights for ORG PIRIN , and that it was unlawful . Firstly , the organisation was not registered ; on the contrary , in DATE ORG had upheld ORG judgment turning down its request to be registered as a political party ( see ORG PIRIN and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . Since it was accordingly unlawful under NORP law , it had no standing to give notice of its intention to hold a rally . Secondly , the proposed rally would put public order at risk . Both ORG and ORG were places visited by many tourists , especially on DATE . It was therefore inappropriate to allow the staging of rallies there . Moreover , rallies and meetings were being organised at those locations at the same time by the local authorities and non - governmental organisations . As clashes between supporters of ORG PIRIN and others had taken place in the past , it was necessary to ban its rally . Finally , the activities of the organisation were contrary to NORP law , as they consisted in propaganda against the country \u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and aroused national and ethnic hatred . The Governor specified that his decision was to be served on the Mayor of PERSON for execution . It was not served on GPE PIRIN or on any of the applicants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the members of the managing board of ORG PIRIN , as well as the first and second applicants , PERSON and PERSON , were summoned by the police . They were issued orders under LAW Ministry of Internal Affairs Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) not to organise or take part in the rally in front of PERSON \u2019s grave near LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the third applicant , PERSON , was told by telephone by an employee of the local branch of ORG that no electrical power would be provided for the rally in ORG , as it had been banned by order of the regional governor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a number of drivers of buses hired to transport the participants to the rally in ORG informed the fourth applicant , Mr PERSON , that they could not provide the requested service . PERSON then approached a number of travel agencies in ORG , all of which advised him that the police had apprised them of the regional governor \u2019s decision and that they would not provide transportation for fear of suffering negative consequences . Mr PERSON eventually managed to hire CARDINAL buses in a nearby village .", "CARDINAL . Similar transportation problems were experienced by persons from the towns of GPE and PERSON who wished to attend the rally .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parties\u2019 accounts of the events of CARDINAL DATE differed somewhat .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on TIME the transport police carried out routine checks of some of the motor vehicles transporting people to the rally . As the police found certain irregularities , they sanctioned individual drivers and then allowed the buses to proceed to ORG . After that both PERSON and ORG were able to go ahead with the events planned by them , respectively in ORG and near FAC . As required by law , the police dispatched forces to ensure public order during the events . At TIME a group of CARDINAL supporters of ORG laid a wreath and flowers at PERSON grave . PERSON chairman made a short speech , and then the rally continued with a musical programme . No breaches of public order were noted . ORG PIRIN was not allowed to hold a rally in front of FAC . A compromise solution was reached with the organisation to hold the rally in ORG . At TIME CARDINAL members and supporters of ORG PIRIN gathered in front of PERSON monument in ORG . They laid a wreath and flowers . Then the organisation \u2019s leaders made short speeches about his life and work ; in the ORG \u2019s view , most of those speeches contained insults against the NORP people and ORG . There were also a number of negative remarks against the police , threats of violence against the Regional Governor and insults against the chairperson of ORG , the Prime Minister and other highranking politicians . The musical programme continued after the allotted time slot . The police did not allow drunk individuals to breach public order . Journalists from \u201c the former GPE \u201d interviewed the leaders of ORG and ORG and a number of supporters .", "CARDINAL . The applicants started by pointing out that CARDINAL events took place on CARDINAL DATE . The first was the one which their organisation , ORG \u2013 PIRIN , held in ORG , in front of PERSON monument . The other was the one held by ORG \u2013 a similar but separate organisation \u2013 at PERSON \u2019s grave near FAC . ORG PIRIN \u2019s members and supporters , including the applicants , were not able to approach the Monastery as originally planned because they were stopped en route by the police . They were allowed to drive only to ORG . They could not tell whether members and supporters of ORG had been allowed to hold a rally near the Monastery .", "CARDINAL . The applicants further stressed the difference between the way in which ORG intended to conduct the rally and the way in which it actually unfolded . The original plan was to proceed in the manner described in paragraph CARDINAL above . As a result of ORG decision and the ensuing actions of the police , ORG PIRIN \u2019s members and supporters were able to go only to ORG . On their way there , CARDINAL buses carrying participants in the rally from ORG were stopped several times by the police , who carried out lengthy checks of the drivers\u2019 and the PERSON papers and imposed penalties for purported violations of the traffic rules . Buses with participants travelling from PERSON to ORG were also stopped by the police CARDINAL times , for TIME each time . The third applicant , PERSON , who was travelling by car , was also stopped by the police , told that the rally was unlawful , and forced to throw away a wreath which he was carrying .", "CARDINAL . Upon their arrival in ORG the applicants saw that PERSON monument was surrounded by CARDINAL police officers , who prevented the participants in the rally from laying a wreath , only allowing them to lay flowers individually . The officers also forced the participants to take away ribbons with the inscription \u201c For Yane \u2013 from grateful NORP \u201d and did not let them make speeches in front of the monument . At TIME the officers advised the bus drivers that if they did not leave ORG in TIME they would be fined .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were adamant that no agreement on how to proceed with the rally was ever made between them and the authorities , and that , contrary to what was asserted by the Government , they did not agree to any changes to their original plan . They also pointed out that the ORG \u2019s allegations that participants in the rally had made offensive speeches and had acted in a disorderly manner were not supported by any evidence .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the DATE LAW and the DATE Meetings and Marches Act are set out in paragraphs CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON and ORG v. GPE ( nos .
