They lived completely isolated until DATE , following which they received visits by whalers and expeditions .", "In DATE the NORP polar researcher PERSON established a commercial trading station and privately initiated a colonisation of the area , which he called LOC . By a decree of CARDINAL DATE LOC was incorporated into the NORP colonial area in GPE . In order to preserve the people \u2019s way of living , in DATE PERSON established ORG ( PERSON ) , which adopted the \u201c Laws of the FAC \u201d . In DATE GPE took over the trading station .", "During World War II , after the NORP occupation of GPE in DATE , GPE ( \u201c the GPE \u201d ) invoked ORG in respect of GPE and reached an agreement in DATE with the NORP minister at GPE that permitted the establishment of GPE military bases and meteorological stations . Thus , in DATE , among other places in GPE , a so - called weather station was built in LOC . It appears that ORG received a sum of QUANTITY ( ORG ) in compensation for this .", "After the war , GPE and the GPE signed a treaty on the defence of GPE , which was approved on CARDINAL DATE by ORG ( called Rigsdagen at the relevant time ) and entered into force on DATE .", "Consequently , an NORP air base was established at LOC in the LOC amidst the applicants\u2019 hunting areas and in the vicinity of the applicants\u2019 native village site , ORG ( then called PERSON ) .", "As part of the base a QUANTITY airstrip was built , together with housing and facilities intended to accommodate CARDINAL people . There appears to be dispute as to the exact size of the defence area at the relevant time and how much of it the PERSON were excluded from . The applicants alleged that the defence area amounted to QUANTITY .", "It is common ground , however , that PERSON access to hunting and fishing was increasingly restricted and that the activities at the base eventually had a detrimental effect on the wildlife in the area .", "In DATE the GPE wished to establish an anti - aircraft artillery unit as well and requested permission to expand the base to cover the whole LOC . The request was granted , with the consequence that ORG was evicted and had to settle outside the defence area . The tribe was informed of this on DATE and within DATE , while they could still travel over the frozen sea ice with dog sleds , twentysix NORP families , consisting of CARDINAL people , left ORG , leaving behind their houses , a hospital , a school , a radio station , warehouses , a church and a graveyard ( the family houses were later burned down and the church was moved to another village on the west coast ) .", "Most of the families chose to move to GPE , QUANTITY north of GPE , where they lived in tents until DATE , when substitute housing was built for them ( altogether CARDINAL wooden houses ) , together with facilities for a new village ( including a school , a church , a hospital , administration buildings , a power station and road facilities ) . Also , groceries and equipment were handed out to the families .", "The total cost of the relocation amounted to MONEY ( equivalent to MONEY ( ORG ) ) , of which the GPE paid MONEY ( ORG ) , equivalent to ORG CARDINAL . It is estimated that the GPE DATE income on average at the relevant time amounted to DKK CARDINAL .", "On DATE a new NORP LAW was passed ( to replace the previous one of DATE ) . It extended to all parts of GPE , including GPE , which thus became an integral part of GPE .", "Subsequently , by Resolution CARDINAL ( ORG ) of CARDINAL DATE ORG approved the constitutional integration of GPE into LOC and deleted GPE from the list of non - self - governing territories .", "At ORG meeting in DATE the question of compensation for the ORG relocation arose for the first time , but not until after their meetings in DATE and DATE did they submit formal requests to ORG . The latter requested a statement by the Chief of GPE ( ORG ) , who submitted his reply on DATE . It is in dispute what happened thereafter , but the authorities claimed that the case file had disappeared . It reappeared in DATE . It is undisputed , however , that neither ORG nor ORG received a decision on their requests .", "In DATE home rule was introduced in GPE , a scheme which left most of the important decision - making , excluding the areas of foreign policy and defence , to ORG ( Landsstyret ) .", "In DATE , following the publication of a book on FAC and FAC ( Thule \u2013 fangerfolk og milit\u00e6ranl\u00e6g ) , ORG lodged a fresh claim for compensation via the municipality of GPE .", "Consequently , several meetings were held between the Minister for GPE , the municipality of GPE , and a working group appointed to safeguard the interests of the applicants . This led , inter alia , to the building of new houses instead of the original houses from DATE , and to an agreement between ORG and ORG to coordinate a plan to improve the conditions for the PERSON municipality vis - \u00e0 - vis its military neighbour in order to remedy the inconveniences resulting from the existence of the military base . The plan was implemented in DATE . Thus , on DATE the GPE and GPE entered into an agreement reducing the area of the base to CARDINAL its original size . Moreover , ORG and ORG agreed to seek a solution concerning an improvement in the use of the military base for additional civilian traffic and to create a civilian transit area funded by ORG .", "Finally , on DATE the Minister of ORG set up a review committee to submit a report establishing the facts of the ORG relocation in DATE . The committee consisted of a ORG judge , a senior archivist and a vice - bishop . As part of the review , numerous people gave statements to the committee , which submitted its report in DATE .", "ORG made some very critical observations on the conclusions of the report , but found that the material that had been obtained as its basis had been satisfactory , apart from the above - mentioned case file that had apparently disappeared within ORG for GPE and some security - related documents to which the committee had been unable to obtain access .", "On DATE , in order to resolve the PERSON case dispute , ORG ( Statsministeriet ) and the Premier of ORG ( GPE for det GPE PERSON ) entered into an agreement whereby the former agreed to donate DKK CARDINAL towards the cost of a new airport in GPE .", "In the meantime , on DATE the applicants had brought a case against ORG before ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON ) , seeking a declaration :", "( CARDINAL ) that they had the right to live in and use their native settlement in ORG in LOC ;", "( CARDINAL ) that they had the right to move , stay and hunt in the entire LOC ;", "( CARDINAL ) that FAC was entitled to compensation in the amount of DKK CARDINAL ( equivalent to approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) ; and", "( CARDINAL ) that each individual was entitled to compensation in the amount of DKK MONEY ( equivalent to approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "The applicants had been granted free legal aid to bring their case , although this was restricted so that their claim for compensation could amount to a maximum of DKK CARDINAL instead of DKK MONEY ( equivalent to approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , which was the amount that they had originally intended to claim .", "Before the High Court numerous ethnographical , geographical , historical , political and autobiographical reports , books and TIME , inter alia , were submitted on the issue , including the report of DATE by the review committee . Witnesses gave evidence and the High Court visited the relevant areas in GPE . In addition , experts were appointed to produce a report on the development of hunting in LOC . It was submitted on DATE .", "On DATE ORG of Eastern GPE delivered its judgment , which ran to CARDINAL pages . It found , in particular : that FAC had been legally established under LAW , the adoption and content of which had been in accordance with NORP law ; that the population at the relevant time could be regarded as a tribal people as this concept was now defined in LAW ( a ) of ORG \u2019s Convention no . CARDINAL of DATE concerning ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) ; that the substantial restriction of access to hunting and fishing caused by the establishment of FAC in DATE and the eviction of the tribe from LOC in DATE had amounted to such serious interferences that they had to be regarded as expropriations ; that the tribe had had too little time to prepare their departure ; that expropriations could be carried out in GPE at the relevant time without statutory authority ; but that at the relevant time , pursuant to LAW ( FN Pagten ) , ORG had had international obligations towards GPE , as was confirmed by LAW ( NORP af DATE om GPE styrelse ) ; and that the ORG claims had not become time - barred .", "Since the exercise of the rights claimed by the applicants according to the wording of claims nos . ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) would be incompatible with the presence of the GPE air base , and having regard to its finding concerning the legal basis for the establishment of the base , ORG found that claims CARDINAL . ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) could not be allowed , but that claims FAC . ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) should be allowed in part .", "In order to assess the compensation to be granted , ORG took into account various accounts , TIME , witness statements and historical and political descriptions but stated that the material did not give an unambiguous and objective picture . In addition , the change in hunting possibilities had to be taken into account . ORG found it established , for example , that fox hunting , which in DATE had represented a very significant part of ORG hunting , had become more difficult since the distance to the fox - hunting fields had increased after the tribe \u2019s removal . On the other hand , the hunting of seals and narwhals had later become of crucial importance . Having regard to those factors , and to the fact that the NORP authorities in the past had failed to examine and specify the loss suffered , ORG decided to ease the burden of proof normally required for granting compensation for alleged loss . In addition , it found that the loss should be assessed only up to DATE , when a new site called PERSON had been established between GPE and ORG in order to adapt to various changes in hunting . Finally , ORG took into account the fact that substitute housing had been built for the families concerned .", "In conclusion , ORG found that ORG should be granted ORG MONEY ( equivalent to approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in compensation for its eviction and loss of hunting rights in LOC .", "As regards the applicants\u2019 individual claims , ORG did not find it established that they had suffered pecuniary damage which had not been covered by the substitute housing and the groceries and materials handed out to them in DATE , and the above amount granted to the tribe by way of compensation .", "With regard to the claim for non - pecuniary damage , ORG noted that at the relevant time there had been no legal rules authorising such compensation in relation to GPE . Nevertheless , having regard to the nature and extent of the interference imposed by the colonial power on an isolated indigenous tribe , ORG found that the individuals affected in DATE should be granted an award for non - pecuniary damage . In the assessment of the amount to be awarded , ORG found it appropriate to deviate from the general principles according to which the calculation of compensation should take as a point of reference the time at which the harm was sustained , in this case DATE , notably because the relevant applicants had been prevented for a long time from having their claim examined . The age of the individuals at the time of the eviction was also taken into account .", "Accordingly , those applicants who at the relevant time had been DATE were granted DKK CARDINAL ( equivalent to approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage and those who had been DATE were granted DKK CARDINAL ( equivalent to approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "In accordance with the ORG claim , interest was payable on the amounts awarded as from the date on which the case had been brought before ORG .", "In the proceedings before ORG , the applicants\u2019 CARDINAL counsel was awarded fees in the amount of respectively DKK CARDINAL and DKK CARDINAL plus VAT .", "On DATE , in addition to signing a new agreement aimed at renewing the relationship between ORG and ORG , the NORP Prime Minister formally apologised to the applicants for the forced relocation of the PERSON in DATE , by stating as follows :", "\u201c ORG has on DATE ruled in the case regarding the forced movement of the PERSON people in DATE . The ORG states that the NORP authorities acted unlawful at the time . The forced movement was decided and carried out in such a way , and under such circumstances , that it has to be regarded as a serious encroachment towards the people . We can not alter the historical events , but we have to answer for them and respect them . With the recent verdict , a limit has been set on the Government \u2019s encroachment towards the people .", "DATE , no one can be made responsible for actions committed by past generations DATE . But with the spirit of the ORG , and with respect for GPE and the inhabitants of PERSON , the Government would , on behalf of ORG , like to offer an apology DATE utoqqatserpugut ( mamiasuktugut ) DATE to the PERSON , the inhabitants of PERSON , and to the rest of GPE , for the way in which the decision regarding the forced movement was made and carried out in DATE . We wish to continue and strengthen our collaboration and solidarity between GPE and GPE . NORP cooperation within the ORG shall also in the future be based on mutual respect .", "With the amendment of the LAW in DATE , the citizens of GPE were made to enjoy the same rights as the NORP people . With the introduction of ORG in DATE , GPE obtained its own parliament , a fact which implied that decisions were and are made closer to the people in the PERSON democracy . Any possible repetition of what took place in DATE is therefore out of the question .", "We recognise the achievements we have made through our cooperation and solidarity over DATE . Our ORG has experienced a very positive human , social and economic development for the benefit of the people of GPE and GPE .", "ORG wishes to strengthen ORG participation in matters to do with foreign policy and in security issues relating to PERSON interests . Dialogue regarding this matter has begun already on the basis of the report of the \u2018 ORG ( committee comprising officials from both the PERSON and ORG ) , among other things . Representatives of ORG will be included in the negotiation process , when new agreements are made between ORG and foreign States on matters which relate specifically to GPE . \u201d", "On appeal to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , the applicants argued that pursuant to LAW b ) of LAW , they had to be considered a distinct indigenous people separate from the rest of the NORP population , for which reason Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of ORG should be applied in particular . They also increased their claim for compensation to ORG CARDINAL .", "Before ORG all the evidence that had been presented before ORG was submitted , together with the case file from ORG that had reappeared in DATE . Witnesses also gave evidence .", "In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG unanimously upheld ORG judgment and held as follows :", "\u201c LAW", "In order to address ORG request for their claims to be dismissed , and in support of their own claims , [ the applicants ] have as their main argument referred to the provisions of ORG Convention no . CARDINAL of DATE concerning ORG ( LAW ) , particularly LAW , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE . Thus , [ the applicants ] have argued that pursuant to LAW b ) , the tribe is considered a distinct indigenous people separate from the rest of the PERSON population .", "The Convention became operative for GPE on DATE . At the time of ratification , the ORG people as a whole were considered an indigenous people within the meaning of the Convention .", "In support of its allegation that it is an indigenous people , ORG has pointed out that its members descend from the people that lived in LOC at the time of the colonisation in DATE , and that its members retain some of their own social , economic , cultural and political institutions . According to its own definition , the ORG encompasses all descendants of this indigenous population and the GPE spouses , irrespective of where they were born and where they live . The members of the tribe see themselves as belonging to CARDINAL distinct indigenous people .", "[ ORG finds that ] the assessment of whether or not ORG is a distinct indigenous people within the meaning of the ILO Convention should be based on current circumstances . In GPE , there are still regional variations in terms of language , business conditions and judicial systems , caused by the size of the country , communication and traffic conditions , and local natural conditions , among other things . After an overall assessment of the evidence before it , ORG finds that in all essential respects the population of LOC [ live under ] the same conditions as the rest of the PERSON people , and that they do not differ from the latter in any other relevant way . The particulars produced on the difference between the languages spoken in GPE and in GPE and ORG perception of itself as a distinct indigenous people can not lead to any other conclusion . ORG therefore finds that ORG does not \u2018 retain some or all of its own social , economic , cultural and political institutions\u2019 , and that accordingly ORG is not a distinct indigenous people for the purposes of LAW b ) of LAW .", "Article CARDINAL ( a ) of ORG also includes \u2018 tribal peoples in independent countries whose social , cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or ORG . As reasoned above , ORG finds that ORG does not fall within this provision of the LAW either .", "This interpretation is consistent with the declaration made by ORG , endorsed by ORG , in connection with the ratification of LAW . According to this declaration , GPE has \u2018 only one indigenous people\u2019 within the meaning of the Convention , namely the original inhabitants of GPE , the NORP .", "In its decision of DATE the ORG \u2019s ORG reached the same conclusion . It thus endorsed the report of DATE by the ORG committee that had considered a complaint submitted by the GPE trade union PERSON ( ORG ) concerning GPE \u2019s alleged breach of the LAW . The report states that \u2018 there is no basis for regarding the inhabitants of the ORG community as a \u2018 people\u2019 separate from and different from other PERSON and that \u2018 the territory traditionally inhabited by the NORP has been identified and consists of the entire territory of GPE .", "It must be considered established that within the meaning of LAW the Thule Tribe does not constitute a tribal people or a distinct indigenous people within or coexisting with the PERSON people as a whole . Consequently , ORG does not have separate rights under the said LAW .", "ORG request for the claims to be dismissed", "The fact that the Thule Tribe can not be considered a tribal people or a distinct indigenous people within the meaning of LAW does not preclude ORG from being entitled to take legal action in accordance with the general rules on the matter .", "ORG has not disputed that the organisation PERSON may represent ORG . As was stated by ORG , ORG must be considered a sufficiently clearly defined group of people . These matters are not altered by the fact that CARDINAL of the original CARDINAL individual plaintiffs have lodged individual appeals with ORG . The objection raised by ORG that ORG is not entitled to the claims , and that consequently [ the tribe ] is not the rightful plaintiff can not result in their dismissal . In view of their substance , LAW are not so ambiguous that they can not form the basis of an examination of the case .", "For this reason , ORG [ agrees with ORG ] that the [ Prime Minister \u2019s Office \u2019s ] request to dismiss ORG Claims CARDINAL and CARDINAL should be rejected . For the same reason , ORG rejects the request to dismiss Claim CARDINAL .", "ORG further agrees that the request to dismiss ORG and CARDINAL in respect of the individual appellants should also be rejected .", "Access to habitation , travelling , hunting and fishing ( Claims CARDINAL and CARDINAL )", "In support of LAW and CARDINAL , [ the applicants ] have DATE in addition to the reference to LAW argued in particular that FAC was established illegally because the DATE GPE - Denmark Defence Agreement is invalid under constitutional and international law . [ The applicants ] have also argued that no legal decision to move the settlement was taken .", "As was stated by ORG in section CARDINAL.CARDINAL of its judgment , FAC was established under the DATE GPE - Denmark Defence Agreement . The agreement was adopted by the Rigsdagen [ name of the NORP parliament until DATE ] pursuant to LAW , as applicable at the relevant time , and accordingly ORG accepts that a constitutionally valid approval of the establishment of the base existed , although the technical appendix to the agreement was not submitted to the Rigsdagen . For this very reason , the agreement is also valid under international law .", "The substantial restriction of access to hunting and fishing caused by the establishment of FAC in DATE can not , for the reasons stated by ORG in section CARDINAL , be considered a non - indemnifiable regulation , but an act of expropriation . This expropriation could , as stated by ORG in section CARDINAL.CARDINAL , be carried out without statutory authority . ORG therefore finds , for the reasons stated by ORG , that the substantive law provisions of LAW applicable at that time , including LAW , did not extend to GPE , that LAW did not include any claim to statutory authority , and that the question of establishing the base did not fall within the competence of ORG .", "As was stated by ORG in section CARDINAL , the intervention in the ORG settlement and the PERSON colony that took place in connection with the decision in DATE to move the population is also to be considered an act of expropriation . This intervention may also be considered to have been carried out under the DATE USDenmark Defence Agreement and the expropriation it entailed could take place without statutory authority .", "[ ORG ] notes that any inadequate information provided to ORG in DATE and DATE can not constitute grounds for invalidity .", "ORG therefore finds that both the intervention in DATE regarding access to hunting and fishing and the intervention in DATE on relocation of the settlement were legal and valid . In this context , it is not necessary to decide whether or not the population of LOC at that time constituted a tribal people or a distinct indigenous people in the sense in which these terms are now defined in LAW .", "The purport of ORG LAW and CARDINAL is that tribe members are entitled to live in and utilise the abandoned settlement and to travel , stay , hunt and fish in the entire LOC . For the very reason that , owing to the acts of expropriation , the exercise of this right of enjoyment has been prevented or curtailed in the areas affected by such acts , the appellants\u2019 Claims CARDINAL and CARDINAL can not be complied with .", "This finding applies to LAW , although in DATE the GPE and GPE , including ORG , in continuation of the DATE USDenmark Defence Agreement , signed a memorandum of understanding about isolating GPE \u2013 the area in which the settlement and colony were placed DATE from the defence area at FAC In this connection , it should be noted that FAC , which as stated is not considered a tribal people or a distinct indigenous people within the meaning of LAW , can not claim privileges regarding ORG with reference to LAW . Nor does GPE customary law give cause for such privileges .", "ORG therefore finds for ORG as concerns the appellants\u2019 LAW .", "ORG claim for damages ( Claim CARDINAL )", "The primary claim for damages in the amount of around ORG CARDINAL relates in the first place to FAC loss owing to the lost and reduced hunting and fishing opportunities as a result of the establishment of the base and the relocation of the population from the ORG settlement .", "For the reasons stated by ORG in section CARDINAL , ORG finds that compensation for this loss should be granted according to the principles of LAW as applicable at that time , although this provision was not directly applicable to GPE .", "After making an overall assessment and weighing up the pros and cons , ORG set the compensation at MONEY , and ORG has requested that this decision be upheld .", "For the reasons stated by ORG , ORG finds that there has to be a certain adjustment of the standard of proof as to the loss incurred .", "The calculations on which ORG claims are based can not be accorded any weight . These calculations use factors that , to a large extent , may be deemed arbitrary , while discounting various matters that ought to have been included in the assessment . The calculations are not based on developments in the species being hunted . The primary claim in the amount of around ORG CARDINAL is based on the size of the confiscated land without clarifying the correlation between surface area and hunting potential . The calculation comprises a period of DATE without taking into account the substantial reduction in the area of the base in DATE and the general limitation of the indemnification period . These calculation factors relate to an DATE compensation figure of DKK CARDINAL , the sum which was granted when the weather station in PERSON was established in DATE and whose basis remains unknown . The alternative claim in the amount of MONEY is mainly based on a presumed increase in costs owing to the longer distances required for hunting , without taking into account the fact that , according to the PERSON report , it was not a general rule that the distances to the most significant hunting grounds increased . The adaptation of the species in question to the changed conditions has not been taken into consideration . The number of hunters included in the calculation DATE of the original plaintiffs \u2013 is not consistent with the number of hunters affected by the interventions .", "ORG agrees , on the whole , with ORG assessment of the facts to be considered when determining the amount of compensation , such as the character of the confiscated hunting grounds , the distances to the most significant hunting grounds , general developments in the patterns of the species concerned \u2013 especially the decrease in the fox population and the increase in the narwhal population DATE and the limitation of the period to be included in the assessment .", "From an overall assessment the ORG finds no grounds for increasing the compensation of DKK CARDINAL set by ORG .", "For the reasons stated by ORG , no separate compensation for the church should be granted .", "ORG therefore accepts the request by ORG to uphold ORG CARDINAL .", "Individual claims ( Claim CARDINAL )", "The appellants concerned by this claim are members of ORG who were affected by the relocation in DATE or their heirs .
