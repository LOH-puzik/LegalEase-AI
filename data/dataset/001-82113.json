From there , in DATE , having renounced their application for asylum , they returned to GPE .", "On DATE , the applicants entered GPE , together with the second applicant \u2019s son and applied for asylum . At the relevant time the second applicant had a black eye , which the first applicant explained was due to her being assaulted by a man at the train station in GPE on account of her ethnicity .", "ORG ( Migrationsverket ) held an initial short interview with the applicants on DATE and a more extensive CARDINAL on DATE .", "In support of their request for asylum , the first applicant submitted inter alia that over DATE of time , primarily due to the second applicant \u2019s NORP ethnicity , but also because she was a member of ORG , whose ideas he sympathised with , they had been subjected to physical and psychological harassment , mostly by PERSON who had fled GPE . Among other things he was told to kill his wife , called a traitor because of the conflict in GPE - Karabakh , forced to close his shop , and beaten up . He had also been beaten up in connection with a political demonstration in DATE . His wife had been forced to live in hiding since DATE and consequently for DATE of time they had only had sporadic contact . Despite being in hiding , his wife had been subjected to assaults , most recently outside a shop in GPE in DATE . The harassment was supported by the ORG and the police ignored his reports of the incidents . His son and stepson also encountered problems due to his wife \u2019s ethnicity . Their son was not able to finish his studies at the university because the professors and fellow students refused to accept people with NORP ethnicity . His stepson had been beaten up and his flat occupied by NORP refugees from GPE who claimed to be entitled to live there .", "The second applicant submitted before the ORG inter alia that due to her NORP ethnicity she had been subjected to physical and psychological harassment for DATE . Since DATE she had been forced to live in hiding . She had become a member of GPE \u2019s Witnesses DATE . The meetings of GPE \u2019s Witnesses were always held secretly because otherwise the police would turn up and ill - treat the participants . In connection with a meeting in DATE in CARDINAL member \u2019s home , the second applicant had been arrested and taken to a police station and raped by a policeman . Moreover , in DATE , outside a shop in GPE , she had been severely beaten up by QUANTITY persons who had referred to her ethnicity . As a result of the assault she had cracked a dental plate and had a swelling or tumour on her back . She had never reported the assaults to the police because people of NORP ethnicity were considered secondrate citizens in GPE and it would thus have been to no avail . The second applicant originally declared that she had not travelled abroad before or applied for asylum in any other country .", "On DATE ORG refused to grant the applicants asylum . In its decision , ORG first referred to the general situation in GPE and the information contained in a report by ORG , ORG , DATE . As to the latter , ORG noted in particular that while discrimination against ethnic NORP was not proclaimed official policy in GPE , clearly there was a certain amount of discrimination in everyday life against them , which was tolerated by the authorities . However , the said discrimination was not such as to amount to persecution per se , although in individual cases it was possible that the cumulative effects amounted to it . Moreover , as to FAC , only high profile people within the religious community had a well - founded fear of persecution .", "ORG furthermore noted that the assaults to which the first applicant had been subjected had been committed by private individuals in violation of NORP legislation . Moreover , adding that the fact that the police had not arrested any perpetrators did not necessarily mean that the police were unwilling to help him , the ORG found unsubstantiated the first applicant \u2019s allegation that the harassment was supported by the ORG . In conclusion , as to the first applicant , the ORG found that the described incidents failed to amount to persecution constituting a ground for asylum within the meaning of LAW .", "With regard to the second applicant , ORG observed anew that the assaults had been committed by private individuals and a policeman in violation of NORP legislation and without support from ORG . Moreover , the second applicant did not have a high position within GPE \u2019s Witnesses . Finally , having obtained information from foreign immigration authorities , ORG found that the fact that the second applicant , in DATE , had renounced her application for asylum in GPE and chosen to return to GPE , reflected that she had not felt a particular need for protection . In conclusion , the ORG found that the second applicant did not fulfil the legislation requirements for enjoying refugee status .", "The applicants appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) and submitted , among other things , that it was impossible for NORP to report ethnic persecution to the police and that both the second applicant and her children had been maltreated by the police several times . They repeated that the second applicant had been living in hiding since DATE , mostly in DATE houses in the countryside . She had been forced to move because she was hunted for and her life was in danger . Her life was at risk , should she be forced to return to GPE . At the very least they would be arrested at the airport and imprisoned . Moreover , the applicants submitted a letter of QUANTITY DATE from ORG in GPE , signed by its head , PERSON , to the NORP Ambassador to GPE , stating that hatred against the NORP population of GPE had not been decreasing over time , that the anti - NORP propaganda was organised and proliferated on a ORG level , that since DATE not CARDINAL single NORP had been able to return to GPE , and finally that upon return to GPE there was a serious risk that the applicants would become victims of persecution on ethnic grounds .", "On DATE ORG upheld the decision to refuse to grant the applicants asylum , subscribing to the reasons given by ORG .", "On DATE , ORG , examining the applicants\u2019 cases on its own initiative , in accordance with a temporary provision of LAW , found that the applicants could not be granted residence permits under the temporary wording of LAW , section CARDINAL b of LAW .", "The applicants lodged their application on DATE and following an indication given by the ORG on DATE under Rule CARDINAL of ORG , the applicants\u2019 deportation was stayed until further notice .", "Subsequently , before the ORG the applicants submitted that their problems started in DATE when the persecution of ethnic NORP commenced . The second applicant tried to hide her ethnicity by keeping her NORP surname , but through state archives it became known , nevertheless , that she was NORP . It came to the applicants\u2019 knowledge that the police had lists of people of NORP ethnicity and that they went to these people \u2019s homes to ill - treat them . Therefore , fearing for her life , the second applicant and her son left GPE and went to live in DATE houses in the countryside . Sooner or later their ethnicity was discovered , so they always had to keep moving in order to escape persecution . During short periods she hid in the first applicant \u2019s flat in GPE , but the neighbours always found out and persecuted her in the street or in the house . During DATE that the second applicant had to hide , the police came to the first applicant \u2019s flat DATE , looking for her because they wanted to detain her and use her in an exchange of prisoners with GPE . The police often ordered the first applicant to divorce the second applicant or get rid of her . Otherwise the police said they would deal with her themselves . The harassment got worse in DATE , with assaults by the police and neighbours , which the first applicant reported in vain to the police . In DATE the applicants decided that the second applicant and her son had to flee . They were returned from GPE to GPE under LAW . In GPE the second applicant was told that there was no possibility whatsoever for them to stay there . The only possibility was to return to GPE . When they arrived at the airport in GPE they were immediately arrested by the border police . Their passports were taken and never returned and they were interrogated . The police told them that they would be sent to prison as spies . However , after the first applicant negotiated with the police and paid a large sum of money , the second applicant and the son were released . They stayed in the first applicant \u2019s flat for DATE and then resumed moving around from CARDINAL place to another . The whole time the first applicant was in contact with the authorities or the police to ask for help , but this was constantly refused . Some police reports were written , which the police would let him sign , but then tore to pieces . However , as to the rape to which his wife was subjected in DATE , the first applicant was not informed thereof until the asylum proceedings in GPE . The first applicant ran a factory with CARDINAL employees in GPE , but had to close it down in DATE due to the increased persecution . There were always meaningless inspections , with completely unfounded complaints about his book - keeping and the hygiene in the factory . Thereafter , he had no means of providing for his family . The last time he was assaulted was in DATE when the police asked about his wife \u2019s whereabouts . Since he refused to answer , he was beaten up , resulting in fractured ribs .", "In DATE the second applicant was dragged out of a shop in GPE and beaten up in public . The perpetrators told the bystanders that they did not care about the consequences because the woman was NORP . She was hit and kicked in the kidneys and the head . Her jaw was broken . The first applicant managed to intervene and stop the assault with the help of CARDINAL NORP bystanders . The police left without taking any action against the CARDINAL men , despite the first applicant \u2019s efforts to make them draw up a report . The second applicant consulted a private doctor and then went to a hideout . The first applicant filed a report with the police but to no avail . In the light of the constant lack of success that the first applicant had had , being NORP , whenever he reported incidents to the police , the second applicant abstained completely from making use of this remedy .", "The Government submitted that some of the ORG statements before ORG were new to them and did not correspond to the information provided during the domestic proceedings .", "For example , as to the second applicant \u2019s claim that she and her son kept moving around in the countryside because they continuously were beaten up and threatened , according to the second interview with ORG , the second applicant stated that the reason she moved around was that she did not wish to be a nuisance to her friends , but that she never experienced any problems while staying in the countryside .", "Moreover , as to the first applicant \u2019s claim that his ribs were fractured in DATE when the police beat him up because he refused to reveal his wife \u2019s whereabouts , according to the second interview with ORG , the first applicant stated that his ribs were fractured \u201c after DATE \u201d when he took part in a demonstration organised by the opposition .", "Also , the Government pointed out , according to TIME the second interview with ORG , in reply to a question from his counsel , the first applicant replied that he did receive receipts of the police reports . When asked whether he brought such receipts to GPE , he replied in the negative .", "A new Aliens Act ( SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , replacing the DATE LAW , entered into force on DATE . The Act established a new system for examining and determining applications for asylum and residence permits . While ORG continued to carry out the initial examination , an appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision was determined by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL new migration courts . ORG was the court of final instance . It examined appeals against the decisions of the migration courts , provided leave to appeal was granted . Upon the entry into force of LAW , ORG ceased to exist . ORG acted as the alien \u2019s opposing party in proceedings before the courts .", "The provisions mainly applied in the present case were to be found in the DATE LAW , now repealed . In accordance with the LAW , an alien staying in GPE for DATE had to , as a rule , have a residence permit ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . A residence permit could be issued , inter alia , to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , was to be allowed to settle in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . Serious physical or mental illness could , in exceptional cases , constitute humanitarian reasons for the granting of a residence permit .", "An alien who was considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection was , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d referred to an alien who was outside the country of his nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who was unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country . This applied irrespective of whether such persecution was at the hands of the authorities of the country or whether those authorities could not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . An \u201c alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d denoted , inter alia , a person who had left the country of his nationality because he had a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . By making that a separate ground for granting a residence permit , the legislature had highlighted the importance of such considerations . The correspondence between national legislation and LAW had been emphasised as a result .", "In enforcing a decision on refusal of entry or expulsion , the risk of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment was taken into account . In accordance with a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien could not be sent to a country where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . In addition , he could not , in principle , be sent to a country where he risked persecution ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "Until DATE an alien who was to be refused entry or expelled in accordance with a decision that had gained legal force could be granted a residence permit if he filed a so - called \u201c new application \u201d with ORG based on circumstances which had not previously been examined in the case concerning refusal of entry or expulsion . A residence permit could then be granted if the alien was entitled to a residence permit under LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW or if it would be contrary to the requirements of humanity to enforce the refusal - of - entry or expulsion decision ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , in its wording before DATE ) .", "Amendments to LAW , section CARDINAL b , of the DATE LAW entered into force on DATE , whereby a new legal remedy of a temporary nature was introduced . The new procedure for obtaining a residence permit replaced the rules relating to new applications for a residence permit laid down in chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , in its previous wording . Furthermore , the amendments to the DATE Act introduced additional legal grounds for granting a residence permit to aliens against whom a final expulsion order had been made . The object of these temporary amendments was to grant residence permits to aliens who , inter alia , had been in GPE for a very long time or where there existed \u201c urgent humanitarian interests \u201d ( humanit\u00e4rt angel\u00e4get ) . Special consideration was given to the situation of children . The temporary provisions remained in force until the new LAW entered into force on DATE .

Interethnic tensions extended also to other parts of the country . Because of interethnic violence and with the escalation of the conflict in Nagorno - Karabakh in DATE , the overwhelming majority of the ethnic NORP population of GPE left the country .", "CARDINAL . To the knowledge of ORG , none of these ethnic NORP displaced in DATE has actually returned to GPE and therefore a detailed assessment of the risk remaining in the case of such return , if permitted at all by the NORP authorities , is difficult to make . While a number of these refugees of the DATE caseload have been naturalized and others enjoy secure refugee status in GPE , a number of ethnic NORP refugees who went to other parts of the former GPE have not received or no longer enjoy a secure status . A durable solution for them is yet to be resolved . In the case of secondary movement of such refugees , an assessment of the remaining protection needs , as well as on safely found elsewhere , would require a careful analysis of the individual case .", "CARDINAL . According to a survey conducted in DATE by a UNHCR Implementing Partner , up to CARDINAL NORP may still reside in NORP , mostly women with ethnic NORP or NORP husbands . The treatment of ethnic NORP varies from community to community . However , discrimination instances against ethnic NORP are regularly reported . ORG includes access to governmental jobs , payment of pensions and other social benefits , and more generally problems with the authorities when claiming one \u2019s right . A pattern of discrimination in the workplace is common . Access to public post might indeed be obstructed to persons with NORP family names or with NORP family members . As far as private employers are concerned , it is entirely their choice to hire or dismiss employees .", "CARDINAL . Ethnic NORP residing in GPE prefer to conceal their names and keep a low profile .", "...", "CARDINAL . To sum up , while discrimination against ethnic NORP is not proclaimed official policy in GPE , clearly there is a certain amount of discrimination in everyday life against them , which is tolerated by the authorities .

In DATE , President PERSON announced that the Government henceforth would abide by FAC standards concerning freedom of religion .

As a side note , some Government officials share a common popular prejudice against ethnic PERSON , who have converted to NORP and other religions .", "CARDINAL . New religious groups with no history in GPE are not always socially acknowledged . However , following the statement by President PERSON , instances of harassment of and discrimination against members of such non traditional religious denominations have been reduced considerably . While each case will have to be considered in its own merit , the mere fact that an NORP asylum seeker is merely a member of CARDINAL of the above - mentioned non traditional religious denominations would not in itself suffice to substantiate his / her claim for refugee status . However , claims by leaders or high profile activists of non traditional religious groups would warrant careful consideration .", "...", "GPE acceded to LAW in DATE .", "In DATE , ORG ( CERD ) noted with satisfaction that GPE had made the optional declaration recognising the ORG \u2019s competence to receive communications under LAW CO/CARDINAL ) . Moreover , in its reports from DATE on the sixty - sixth and DATE sessions , it stated inter alia as to GPE :", "CARDINAL . ORG notes the position of ORG that , despite the negative effects of the conflict in the ORG region , persons of NORP origin do not experience discrimination in GPE . However , the ORG is concerned that , according to reports , incidents of racial discrimination against NORP occur , and that a majority of the NORP residing in GPE prefer to conceal their ethnic identity in order to avoid being discriminated against ( Convention , article CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG encourages the ORG party to continue to monitor all tendencies that give rise to racist and xenophobic behaviour and to combat the negative consequences of such tendencies . In particular , the ORG recommends to ORG that it conduct studies with a view to effectively assessing and evaluating occurrences of racial discrimination , in particular against ethnic NORP .", "In its second report on GPE , of CARDINAL DATE , ORG against Racism and Intolerance ( ECRI ) stated inter alia :", "Persistence of the negative climate against NORP", "CARDINAL . In its first report , ORG recommended that the NORP authorities ensure an adequate response to all instances of discrimination and hate - speech against NORP , including through the use of the relevant legal provisions . It also encouraged the NORP authorities to contribute more actively to generating a climate where NORP do not feel threatened when exposing their identity publicly .", "CARDINAL . ECRI deeply regrets that since the adoption of its first report in DATE , the situation as concerns ethnic NORP living in GPE ( hereafter : NORP ) has not improved at all . While ORG continues to receive alarming information concerning racism and racial discrimination against this group of persons , the NORP authorities have not demonstrated their will to tackle this problem . On the contrary , the general attitude among national and local authorities is rather to purely and simply deny that NORP are confronted with problems in GPE . ECRI is surprised by this position which comes in stark contrast to information from numerous national and international non - governmental sources . NORP are often referred to as the most vulnerable group in GPE in the field of racism and racial discrimination . The issue is sufficiently serious for NORP to sometimes be described as \u201c second - class citizens \u201d in GPE . This situation is generally said to be a consequence of the overall negative climate in GPE generated by the conflict over GPE - Karabakh .", "CARDINAL . According to official sources the number of NORP living on NORP territory outside Nagorno - Karabakh and the occupied zones amounts to CARDINAL CARDINAL , Non - official sources estimate that the real number is probably lower , QUANTITY . These persons are almost exclusively persons married to PERSON or of mixed NORP descent .", "CARDINAL . A first problem is apparently the discrimination with which NORP are confronted in their daily lives , particularly in access to public services . Allegedly , some officials merely refuse to proceed with request from NORP when they discover their ethnic origin . The discrimination amounts sometimes to harassment which prevents the persons concerned from exercising their basic rights such as the right to pension allowance or the right to work . Judicial proceedings opened by NORP trying to secure their rights are said to systematically fail due to the general negative climate against NORP . As mentioned in another part of this report , some refugees and IDPs have been occupying properties belonging to NORP who are still unable to regain their property .", "CARDINAL . Another problem is the oral and written inflammatory speech on the conflict over Nagorno - Karabakh . These statements do not only target GPE and NORP citizens . It also often portrays NORP living in GPE as enemies and traitors . ECRI is concerned to learn that some media , and particularly certain TV channels , some members of the general public , some politicians and even some authorities at local and national levels apparently fuel negative feelings among society towards NORP in general , and ethnic NORP living on NORP territory in particular . At present , PERSON notes that no steps have been taken to use the relevant criminal law provisions to prohibit material inciting to racial hatred against NORP . As already described in ORG \u2019s first report , the mere attribution of NORP ethnic origin to an ethnic NORP may be perceived as an insult . Thus , there have continued to be trials for slander and insult opened by public figures against persons who had publicly and falsely alleged their NORP ancestry .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL of the consequences of discrimination and inflammatory speech against NORP is that many NORP keep a low profile in GPE , trying as much as possible to avoid drawing attention to themselves . They often seek to hide their ethnic identity , for instance through changing their names .", "CARDINAL . This negative climate mainly resulting from the conflict over Nagorno - Karabakh does not only have an impact on NORP living in GPE . It also allegedly affects NORP individuals or NGOs assisting NORP when they try to exercise their basic rights . They are reportedly victims of anonymous threats , defamation campaigns in some media and harassment by some authorities . They are often publicly and falsely accused of \u201c having NORP roots \u201d and of treason to GPE . Another consequence of this negative climate is that NORP individuals travelling to GPE or to the occupied territories of GPE are victims of threats , harassment and attacks on their goods or persons on the grounds that they \u201c betray their country \u201d . ECRI notes that so far , the NORP authorities have not taken adequate steps to protect the relevant persons from these acts . In its first report , ORG already expressed its concern at the lack of opportunities available for members of civil society to resume dialogue in order to favour the full reconciliation of all people living in the region and the restoration of mutual confidence among members of the different communities . Apparently , the situation has not evolved much in this field .", "CARDINAL .
