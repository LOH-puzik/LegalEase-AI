He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", ".", "The applicant is a civil servant and the father of CARDINAL children . His pension was calculated on DATE by an order of DATE . However , the calculation did not take account of the service credits for children established in LAW then in force , which provided :", "\u201c Under conditions determined by a regulation of the Prime Minister , the following service credits shall be added to the periods of service actually completed : ... ( b ) A service credit granted to female civil servants for each legitimate child , each natural child of established paternity and each adopted child , and , subject to the condition that they have been brought up for DATE before reaching their CARDINAL birthday , for each of the other children listed in paragraph II of Article L.CARDINAL . \u201d", "By a judgment of DATE ORG of ORG held that LAW was contrary to the principle of equal pay as laid down in LAW establishing ORG . Following that judgment , the PERSON d\u2019Etat held , in a judgment of DATE concerning PERSON , a litigant other than the applicant , that PERSON was entitled to the service credit provided for in LAW .", "On DATE the applicant requested a review of his pension with a view to obtaining the service credits to which he considered he was entitled in respect of his CARDINAL children . He submitted that he should be awarded DATE of service credits in respect of his CARDINAL children , by strict reference to the PERSON d\u2019Etat \u2019s analysis in its judgment in favour of PERSON on DATE , and also the principle of equal pay for men and women , which precluded civil servants being refused entitlement to the benefit of the provisions on the ground of their sex .", "On DATE a new Act amended the provisions of Article L.CARDINAL of the Pensions Code . Section CARDINAL I stated :", "\u201c Under the conditions determined by a decree of the PERSON d\u2019Etat , the following service credits shall be added to the periods of service actually completed : ...

CARDINAL(b ) of ORG resulting from the wording of [ sub - subsection ] CARDINAL of [ Part ] I shall apply to pensions calculated from CARDINAL DATE . \u201d", "The above - mentioned decree of the PERSON d\u2019Etat was adopted on DATE .", "On DATE the Minister for ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request in the following terms :", "\u201c ...", "Given the date of calculation of your pension , a service credit is payable only if you can provide evidence of having interrupted your employment on the birth of your children .", "If that condition is satisfied , it will then be necessary to consider whether the duration of that interruption does in fact correspond to the duration due to be fixed by the forthcoming decree . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant lodged an application with ORG , seeking judicial review of the order of DATE awarding the pension and of the decision of the Minister for ORG refusing to review the applicant \u2019s pension entitlement . He alleged that since the order of DATE containing the calculation of his pension had failed to take account of his situation as a father of CARDINAL children , it had disregarded his rights under Article L.CARDINALb of the Pensions Code , which was intended to apply to both female and male civil servants , and was thus discriminatory . He also maintained that , given the refusal to review his pension , the new Act had been applied retrospectively . When ORG had decided that there could be no retrospective effect for female civil servants , the resulting situation had established discrimination , since , for the same retirement date , women continued to be covered by the old provisions whereas men were subject to the new , retrospective provisions . The applicant concluded that there had been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL and of the principle of non - discrimination .", "In a number of judgments , in particular that of DATE , the ORG d\u2019Etat adjudicated in cases identical , both in law and in fact , to the applicant \u2019s case . On the complaint based on LAW No . CARDINAL , the PERSON d\u2019Etat held that , while section QUANTITY of the Act of CARDINAL DATE \u201c retrospectively [ deprived ] civil servants whose pension [ had been ] calculated after CARDINAL DATE of entitlement to the credit , the principle and the amount of which were certain ... , that retrospective effect , applicable to a period of DATE , PERSON ] an interference with the asset in question which was justified , in line with the legislature \u2019s intention , by public - interest considerations related to the desire to ensure that the announcement of the tabling of the PERSON did not lead to an increase in litigation . \u201d It concluded that \u201c this interference , which [ did ] not affect the substance of the right to a pension but only one of the elements of its calculation , [ was proportionate ] to the aim thus pursued . \u201d", "As for the complaint based on LAW , the ORG d\u2019Etat considered that the enactment of LAW , on DATE the application submitted by the litigants , at a time when no dispute existed between them and the ORG concerning the calculation of their pensions , had had neither the aim nor effect of influencing the outcome of pending judicial proceedings and that it had thus not deprived those concerned of their right of access to a court in order to assert their rights .", "On the basis of those considerations , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application on DATE .", "In view of the aforementioned judgments of the PERSON d\u2019Etat , the applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law .", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG of ORG held that the principle of equal pay precluded limiting to women credits granted for the purpose of calculating a retirement pension to persons who had raised their children , whilst men who had raised their children were excluded from entitlement to the credit . It held that Article L. CARDINAL(b ) of ORG , which introduced , for the calculation of pensions , a service credit of DATE for each child , limited to female civil servants , was incompatible with the principle of equal pay as laid down in the LAW establishing ORG and the LAW annexed to LAW No . CARDINAL on ORG annexed to LAW .", "On DATE the ORG d\u2019Etat , which had stayed proceedings pending the ruling of ORG , held that in so far as provisions were maintained which were more favourable to female civil servants who had raised their children , PERSON , who had raised [ his ] children himself , was entitled to the credit provided for in LAW ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
