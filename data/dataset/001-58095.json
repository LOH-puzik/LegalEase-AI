THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Civil rights and obligations;Reasonable time);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed (Article 41 - Pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction);Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage)", "JUDGES": "John Freeland", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicants , PERSON and PERSON , born respectively in DATE and DATE , are resident in PERSON , PERSON and in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The background to the case is a dispute between neighbours over sewerage . Initially the applicants\u2019 neighbours , Mr and PERSON , instituted proceedings seeking damages for problems experienced with their sewerage , allegedly caused by work carried out by the applicants . Mr and PERSON won their case . On DATE the applicants then instituted proceedings against Mr and Mrs T. in ORG in GPE , alleging that the latter \u2019s sewage was seeping onto their land . On DATE , Judge PERSON gave judgment against the applicants . Their appeal was subsequently dismissed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In GPE and GPE it is usual that the unsuccessful party to litigation pays the costs of the successful party ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On CARDINAL DATE , Mr and PERSON , who were not in receipt of legal aid , requested a hearing to determine costs issues . The applicants had been and were legally aided throughout the litigation to appeal stage . Although this did not affect the amount of costs Mr and PERSON T. would be entitled to receive , after having made an order for costs it would be necessary for the judge to assess the applicants\u2019 means for the purposes of section CARDINAL of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . After hearings on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , the matter was adjourned until DATE , to be heard at ORG , also in PERSON . As the question of costs could not be resolved because of factual disputes and conflict between the parties , on CARDINAL DATE Judge PERSON made a direction that the inquiry should be adjourned and not restored until a number of points concerning the applicants\u2019 entitlement to legal aid had been clarified . In particular , information was sought as to ORG whether the applicants had advised ORG ( \u201c LAB \u201d ) of any change in their circumstances and whether revocation of their legal - aid certificate , if necessary , would have any retrospective effect .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the court received a report from the LAB outlining events from the time the applicants first applied for legal aid . This report was sent to the parties on DATE , when they were informed that the matter could be re - listed for hearing . However , on DATE , the ORG informed the court that a fresh ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) assessment of the applicants\u2019 means was required in view of the fact that they had separated . The ORG later explained , in a letter filed with the court on DATE , that a delay of DATE had been caused because of a misapprehension in this respect ; in fact , the applicants had not separated .", "CARDINAL . The restored hearing was held on DATE before Judge PERSON , as Judge PERSON had fallen ill . Examining the criteria set out in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the judge ordered that QUANTITY ( GBP ) , which had previously been retained by the ORG following an award of damages to the applicants resulting from a successful negligence action against a firm of solicitors , should be paid to PERSON and PERSON T. forthwith and that the applicants should in addition pay them GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL in instalments of GBP DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought legal aid to appeal against this decision . On DATE they applied for an extension of time , since the time - limit for appealing the costs order had expired on DATE . Subsequently queries were raised by a lawyer in ORG as to whether leave to appeal was required , and the matter was referred to the registrar .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , DATE and DATE DATE the applicants contacted ORG asking why there was a delay in dealing with their application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the registrar directed that leave was not required to appeal against the costs order . With a view to avoiding the time and expense of holding CARDINAL hearings , CARDINAL before him for the extension of time and another before the full ORG , he referred the application to the full court to determine the question of the time extension and , if granted , immediately to hear the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were requested to lodge the relevant documents by CARDINAL DATE . Extensions of this time - limit were granted on DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and again on DATE at the request of the applicants , because they were experiencing difficulty in obtaining transcripts and judge \u2019s notes of hearings from the first - instance courts . It later transpired that Judge PERSON \u2019s notes had been either lost or did not exist . On DATE , the registrar granted the ORG request that transcripts of the judgment of Judge PERSON be produced at public expense .", "CARDINAL . Another extension of the time - limit for the submission of documents was granted , upon the ORG request , on DATE . On DATE the documents were finally lodged with ORG and on DATE the application was listed for hearing . After the hearing on DATE , ORG confirmed Judge PERSON judgment of CARDINAL DATE and dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . Legal aid is available to litigants in the NORP courts subject to various requirements as to means and the merits of the case in question . Financial assessments of a litigant \u2019s disposable income and capital are carried out by specialist staff of ORG . The resources of the litigant \u2019s spouse are treated as belonging to the litigant unless they are living \u201c separate and apart \u201d ( see ORG DATE ( ORG DATE no . CARDINAL ) , Regulations CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the NORP courts , the award of costs generally ( in all cases , including those where one or more parties are legally aided ) is a matter for the discretion of the court ( see ORG , section CARDINAL ) . However , rules of court lay down certain principles which are normally applied in the exercise of this discretion , including the principle that the LAW unsuccessful party to litigation pays the costs of the successful party ( see the Rules of ORG , Order CARDINAL , Rule CARDINAL , and ORG , Order DATE , Rule CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . This principle is not affected by the fact that an unsuccessful litigant is legally aided . However , after an order for costs has been made against such a person , the court which tried or heard the proceedings must determine how much of these costs it would be reasonable for the legally aided litigant to pay , in accordance with section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , which provides :", "\u201c The liability of a legally assisted party under an order for costs made against him with respect to any proceedings shall not exceed the amount ( if any ) which is a reasonable one for him to pay having regard to all the circumstances , including the financial resources of all the parties and their conduct in connection with the dispute . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
