On DATE at TIME the applicant was taken to ORG after he and his accomplices had been apprehended while driving a car containing goods apparently stolen from a nearby summer house .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that shortly afterwards , for TIME , he had been ill - treated by CARDINAL police officers ; at TIME the CARDINAL officers had returned and had continued hitting and kicking him for TIME or so . TIME the CARDINAL officers had escorted the applicant to another room for questioning , but had then continued beating him , together with several other officers . In the applicant \u2019s account of the events , altogether CARDINAL officers and CARDINAL security guards took part in the ill - treatment , with the apparent intention of extracting his confession to further offences . He stated that he had been hit in the face , forced to his knees and kicked repeatedly ; a paper bag had been pulled over his head and the soles of his feet had been hit many times with a piece of wood . The officers had insisted that he admit to CARDINAL counts of theft in order for them to stop hitting him , and they had repeatedly insulted him , making references to his GPE origin . CARDINAL of them had said that they would not mind if he died DATE there would just be CARDINAL Gypsy less .", "CARDINAL . The applicant eventually signed the record of the questioning , which stated that the questioning had taken place TIME", "CARDINAL . TIME , at TIME , the applicant was allegedly escorted to the toilet , where he said the officers had again started hitting and kicking him . CARDINAL of them had removed a towel - holder from the wall and hit the applicant \u2019s hand with it . Again , references were allegedly made to the applicant being a GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released at TIME", "CARDINAL . DATE , at the request of the applicant \u2019s mother , the general practitioner of the neighbouring village , PERSON , came to the applicant \u2019s house and examined him . Since she had apparently been told only about chest complaints , she did not examine the applicant \u2019s legs or feet . She did not identify any marks indicating external injury on the applicant but found that his ribs were sore and suggested that he go to hospital if he wished to obtain a medical certificate recording his injuries . Dr PERSON herself did not produce a medical report on the LOC .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the applicant went to the emergency room of ORG in GPE . At TIME he was issued with a medical certificate , for which he paid the fee due , stating that he had bruises on the forehead , the nose and the left shoulder and an abrasion on the right hip ; both his hands and arms were swollen and hyperaemic ; and the rear surface of both thighs , as well as the soles of his feet , were swollen , red and sore . According to the certificate , the applicant had numerous contusions that had been inflicted by other persons .", "CARDINAL . Still on TIME , at TIME , X - rays were taken of the applicant at ORG in GPE , a town at a distance of QUANTITY , where the applicant was driven by his family members . He was diagnosed with a \u201c chest contusion \u201d , a \u201c skull contusion \u201d and \u201c bodily injury inflicted by human force \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant stated that he had been unhurt at the time that he had been taken to the police department . He added that between his release and the medical inspection , he had been continuously accompanied by his relatives , who testified in the ensuing proceedings that he had not suffered any injuries outside the police department .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a criminal complaint alleging that he had been brutalised by police officers . The applicant alleged that during the ill - treatment the officers had made repeated references to his GPE origin . The case was being investigated by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was heard as a witness and shown , for the purposes of his identifying his alleged assailants , the photos of police officers serving at ORG . The applicant acknowledged from the outset that he would be able to identify with certainty CARDINAL of the several perpetrators . Nevertheless , he finally identified CARDINAL persons as the perpetrators DATE police officers ( GPE , ORG , PERSON . PERSON , GPE , GPE and GPE ) and CARDINAL security guards employed by the police department ( ORG and GPE ) . Subsequently , the applicant became uncertain about the involvement of ORG", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor \u2019s office appointed a forensic expert . This expert had at his disposal the medical reports issued by PERSON and PERSON . In his opinion given in retrospect , he made the following statement as to the time when the applicant \u2019s injuries had been sustained :", "\u201c The exact time of the infliction of the injuries can not be established . Given that the doctor examining the applicant did not document any lesions characteristically pointing to an inveterate injury , it can only be said that the injuries had been sustained within a CARDINAL - CARDINAL-hour - time - frame preceding the medical care . Since , according to the police report on the application of coercive measures , the local police constable handed the applicant over to the officer on duty without any complaints or injuries , the injuries were likely to have occurred after this point in time . \u201d", "\u201c A s\u00e9r\u00fcl\u00e9sek pontos keletkez\u00e9si ideje nem hat\u00e1rozhat\u00f3 meg .

On DATE ORG discontinued the investigation , holding in essence that the applicant \u2019s version of events was not plausible . The prosecutor emphasised the fact that since the applicant had been apprehended just after he had committed the crime in question ( and still in possession of the proceeds of that crime ) , coercive interrogation by police officers with the intention of extracting his confession to the offence in question seemed pointless and thus hardly plausible . Relying on the internal records of the police department recording the shifts of the officers , the prosecutor was satisfied that CARDINAL of the alleged perpetrators , PERSON . PERSON , GPE and GPE , had alibis for the time of the incident , in that early in the morning of that day , they had been assigned to patrol service . Therefore , they could not possibly have been present at the applicant \u2019s questioning . Furthermore , the CARDINAL security guards ( FAC and Z.A. ) were not allowed to leave their station and thus could not have been present at the incident . The prosecutor also observed that a general practitioner had examined the applicant between his release from the police department and the first hospital inspection , but had recorded no injuries . The prosecutor also found it material that the applicant had been uncertain of the identities of the alleged perpetrators when shown photos of the Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6s police officers ; that he had contradicted himself on several occasions ; and that he had complained about the alleged incident only on DATE , not before .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Borsod - Aba\u00faj - Zempl\u00e9n County Public Prosecutor \u2019s Office dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint against the discontinuation order . The prosecutor was satisfied that the investigation had been adequate and comprehensive , and that the obtaining of further evidence \u2013 in particular , by questioning the applicant \u2019s brother and friend , who were present at his release \u2013 was superfluous . The applicant \u2019s allegations about racist motives behind the ill - treatment were not addressed .", "This decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a substitute private prosecution against the CARDINAL presumed perpetrators \u2013 that is to say , QUANTITY police officers and CARDINAL security guards \u2013 on charges of coercive interrogation . The motion included assertions about racial insults being uttered during the incident .", "CARDINAL . The Eger High Court held a hearing on DATE . At that hearing the applicant stated that he did not recognise the defendants ORG and Z.A. and that he was not certain if PERSON had beaten him , so he dropped the charges against them . Accordingly , the court terminated the proceedings against these CARDINAL defendants .", "CARDINAL . The remaining defendants either denied the charges or refused to make any statements . The High Court heard Dr C.S. , who confirmed that she had not seen any marks of external injury on the applicant \u2019s body when examining him on DATE of the incident . A court - appointed medical expert stated that if the applicant had had the injuries in question when examined by PERSON then the latter must have noticed them . The court also obtained testimony from the applicant \u2019s mother and brother and a friend ( the CARDINAL latter had not been heard during the investigation ) , who had been waiting for him in front of ORG on his release . They all stated that the applicant had already had those injuries at the moment of his release .", "CARDINAL . The High Court was satisfied that PERSON . PERSON , ORG had alibis for the time of the incident . As to the charges against the CARDINAL other officers , GPE and GPE , the court highlighted that even though the applicant said that he had been ill - treated in order to force him to admit to CARDINAL counts of theft \u2013 which he finally did \u2013 there was actually no reference in the record of the questioning to any further counts of theft . The court also emphasised that , contrary to the statements of the applicant , the CARDINAL officers could not have been continuously present in FAC because TIME they had been carrying out some onsite inspections in another town , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG acquitted the officers for want of sufficient evidence . According to the reasoning of the judgment , the court relied on documentary evidence relating to the applicant \u2019s apprehension and questioning , documents relating to the service particulars of the officers involved , the testimony of the applicant , medical documentation , and the testimony of the officers .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of the applicant lodging , but subsequently withdrawing , a criminal complaint against GPE , criminal proceedings on charges of false accusation were conducted against the applicant . On DATE the ORG found him guilty as charged and placed him on DATE probation . The judgment was upheld in essence by the ORG on DATE ; however , the applicant \u2019s sentence was altered to DATE of community work ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
