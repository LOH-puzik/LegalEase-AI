The birth lasted from TIME in the presence of doctors and medical students , who had apparently received some information about her state of health and medical treatment . During the labour the doctors performed an episiotomy ( incision ) . The child was diagnosed with light asphyxia . At TIME the child was moved to a special care baby unit and remained there until CARDINAL DATE , the date the applicant took her home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with the hospital , seeking compensation for non - pecuniary damage allegedly caused as a result of the measures aimed at delaying the birth .", "CARDINAL .

This could not have had any negative impact on the outcome of the birth . Management of the delivery was performed by [ the head of ORG ] . On admission [ the applicant ] was notified of the possible presence of the public during her labour . Obstetricians did not intentionally delay the birth .

In their report dated DATE the experts concluded that :", "\u201c [ The hospital ] provided [ the applicant ] with medical care without any shortcomings capable of deteriorating the health of mother or child . The medical treatment was adequate and carried out timeously . After [ the applicant \u2019s admission ] she had been carefully examined by doctors , who had made the correct diagnosis and prepared an adequate plan for the birth . Owing to the prematurity of [ the applicant \u2019s ] contractions and her general fatigue , the prescription of a drug - induced sleep should be considered an appropriate measure . The subsequent treatment [ for ] the premature contractions was necessary ...", "Childbirth is stressful for every woman . The presence of [ the hospital \u2019s ] medical students , even at the second stage of delivery , when the pregnant woman was bearing down , could not have affected management of the labour . The delivery could only have been adversely affected at the first stage . During the bearing down phase , a pregnant woman is usually focused on her physical activity .

On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claim . Relying on the above - mentioned expert report , it held that the quality of the applicant \u2019s treatment at the hospital had been adequate .

It also established the fact that the applicant had been informed of her involvement in the study process beforehand , as she had received the hospital \u2019s booklet containing an explicit warning about the possible presence of medical students during her treatment . ORG dismissed her argument that she had objected to the presence of the public during the birth as unsubstantiated by accepting the oral submission of her doctor that no such objection had been made . The court did not verify the doctor \u2019s statements in this respect by questioning other witnesses and did not refer to any other evidence in connection with the issue . It concluded that the hospital doctors had acted lawfully and had not caused her any nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows :", "\u201c ... The applicant lodged a claim seeking compensation for non - pecuniary damage ... [ She ] alleged that the birth of her child had been intentionally delayed to arrange for a public procedure in the presence of medical students . [ She ] stated that the demonstration of her labour , which had been carried out without her consent , had caused her physical and psychological suffering and violated her rights . She stated that the defendant should pay her RUB CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "The representatives of [ the hospital ] objected to the claim .
