T. Tobacco Ltd , is a company incorporated under NORP law . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr P. Clerides , Attorney - General of GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant lives in GPE . He is the director of the second applicant which is a limited liability company with its registered office in GPE .", "On DATE the customs department applied to ORG of GPE for a search warrant on the basis of Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Protocol on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters between GPE and ORG ( hereinafter \u201c the LAW \u201d ) and sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON . CARDINAL , as amended ) . The application was made following a request made by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) concerning an investigation they were carrying out into the smuggling of cigarettes into ORG in violation of LAW . The customs department maintained that they had reasonable grounds to suspect that there were documents , in electronic or other form , on the applicants\u2019 premises which , on the basis of reasonable suspicion , concerned such smuggling .", "ORG of GPE issued CARDINAL search warrants on DATE ; CARDINAL for the private residence of the first applicant and CARDINAL for the applicant company \u2019s office . The wording of the latter warrant was as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Towards the director of the customs department and the other customs officials of the customs department", "Because it appears from the sworn statement of PERSON [ customs official ]", "...", "That there is reasonable cause to suspect", "That on the premises of the company ORG ( former ORG ) , ... , there are documents in electronic or other form , computers and other objects which on the basis of reasonable suspicion are used in smuggling cigarettes to countries of ORG in violation of LAW . With a written request by ORG ... towards ORG authorities which is based on LAW , DATE , and CARDINAL of the Protocol on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters between GPE and ORG ( CARDINAL ( III)/CARDINAL ) .", "This warrant authorises you and calls you immediately with the appropriate help , to enter the mentioned premises of the mentioned person ... and with diligence to search for the mentioned objects and if these or part of these , are found during the search , to bring the objects which will be so found ... before myself or another Judge of ORG for them to be treated in accordance with the PERSON ... . \u201d", "The search of the company \u2019s premises was carried out from DATE , TIME , until DATE , TIME The search warrant was executed by the head of the investigation unit of the customs department in the presence of CARDINAL customs officials , CARDINAL officials from the tax department , CARDINAL foreign officials authorised by ORG , the first applicant and the second director of the applicant company , CARDINAL shareholders and CARDINAL employees of the applicant company , the financial directors of another company and , finally , the applicants\u2019 lawyers . It is not clear from the documents submitted before the ORG how many of the above persons actually participated in the search .", "The customs officials seized CARDINAL documents and other material , including CARDINAL computers , a computer screen , keyboards and several floppy discs . During the search the first applicant requested the officers not to separate certain documents and also contested the seizure of certain material . The customs officials gave him copies of all the documents seized .", "All the material seized was taken to the customs department \u2019s offices where the documents were copied . Some of these copies were communicated to ORG .", "The customs officials also carried out a search of the first applicant \u2019s private residence but did not seize any material .", "On DATE an ex parte application ( no . CARDINAL ) was filed by the customs department before ORG of GPE requesting the retention of the material seized until completion of the investigation and , in the case of filing of an action before the court , until the conclusion of the hearing of the action .", "The court directed that the application be served on the applicants . The hearing of the application took place DATE and DATE .", "The applicants objected to the retention of the material seized in so far as their relevance with the investigations had not been established . They further argued that the manner in which the search had been carried infringed their rights to private life , communication and correspondence under LAW , DATE and DATE of the LAW . In their application before the ORG the applicants claimed that they had also complained before ORG of a violation of their rights under LAW No . CARDINAL .", "During the hearing the customs authorities claimed that at the time of the search they had seized all the documents and material they had considered relevant to the investigation but that it had been impossible during the search , in view of the amount of documents , to assess their exact relevance . The customs officials had only carried out an evaluation at first sight and , as a consequence , certain of the seized documents subsequently proved to be irrelevant whilst others needed to be examined in conjunction with other documents that were abroad .", "In the meantime , by a letter dated DATE addressed to the director of the customs department , the applicants requested that the material seized during the search be returned to them . The Acting Attorney - General , who had received a copy of the above letter , replied by letter on DATE informing the applicants that all the material was kept at the offices of the customs department and would be presented before the court on the basis of section CARDINAL of LAW and that copies of certain of the documents had been given to the representatives of ORG .", "Furthermore , in DATE , CARDINAL documents that were assessed as irrelevant were returned to the applicants .", "On DATE ORG delivered its decision .", "The judge firstly observed that both parties had accepted that search warrants were subject to the exclusive control of ORG and that they could be reviewed by way of appeal , where such a right was granted , or by way of the prerogative writ of certiorari . Consequently , in the present case , neither the issuing of the search warrant nor the basis for its issue nor its validity nor its legality was disputed . It was therefore binding .", "The judge then found that he did not have jurisdiction to intervene at this stage and was therefore not competent to examine the lawfulness of the execution of the search warrant ; this could only be examined in the context of criminal proceedings or of any procedure before the court in which an attempt would be made to use the exhibits seized as evidence . In particular , the judge noted as follows :", "\u201c I am of the opinion that the court at this pre - trial stage , of the completion essentially of the investigatory work which entailed the evaluation of the seized exhibits , can not intervene as not being competent to examine the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the execution of the search warrant and of the consequences of this . It is obvious for this reason that an application of this kind is made by ex parte application by the authorities ( police , customs etc ) and the decision is within the discretionary power of the court which , as I mentioned above , is exercised judicially and with the interests of all the parties involved as the criterion . The main concern of the court is to ascertain if the detention of the seized exhibits is necessary or , moreover , if there is a danger of their destruction , with the interests of all the parties involved as the criterion . This serves both the urgency and the secrecy which should surround the conditions of the issuing of such an order for the detention of exhibits . The Legislator gave the right to the person from whom the exhibits have been seized or even to the person who claims ownership of them , to apply for their return after the filing of a criminal case or even for them to be disposed of for the payment of costs or damages ( see Sect . CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , PERSON . CARDINAL and also the case ORG ... ) .", "The unlawful execution of a search warrant ... will be the subject of criminal proceedings or of any procedure before the court in which an attempt will be made to use exhibits seized and detained as evidential material . The competency , in my opinion , belongs to the court which will try the case to decide if the search was conducted lawfully or unlawfully ( within the framework of a trial within a trial ) and at the same time there is an obligation on the present court to safeguard evidence which might be lost , destroyed , altered or falsified .", "In cases such as the present one , where there is seizure and the detention is sought of a large number of documents as exhibits and there is a great difference in the evidence before the court as to the way in which the search was carried out , the matter must be left to the court which will hear the case to decide within the framework of an investigation within the trial if the evidence collected and detained is admissible .", "...", "There are clearly many particularities in the present case . The first peculiarity is the issuing and execution of a search warrant by virtue of the LAW and indeed by the customs department . The most important peculiarity , however , is the seizure of such a significant number of documents . And the time the search took is indicative . Some of the seized documents have already been returned ( CARDINAL ) , having been assessed as irrelevant .", "...", "The relevance of documents which concern financial transactions and commercial activities in connection with the offences under investigation alleged to have been committed by the respondents , PERSON and ORG is not an easy matter and no one can decide at first glance if a document is relevant or not . The work of evaluation is subtle , difficult and laborious , which requires time , knowledge and mainly comparison and evaluation with other documents abroad where customs officials are planning to send them in the near future , as was stated to the court . \u201d", "Despite the above findings , the judge noted that he would go into an examination of the unlawful or lawful execution of the search warrant , without pre - empting any future decision of the court within the framework of the trial , where the unlawfulness or the lawfulness of the execution of the search warrant and the consequences of this for the acceptance or rejection of evidential material detained for this purpose had to be examined in the light of the facts at the time . He therefore proceeded to consider the points raised by the applicants\u2019 lawyer in this respect . The judge held that the customs authorities had complied with the LAW when notifying ORG of the results of the search and , further , that both the officers of ORG and the tax department had been duly authorised by the director of the customs department to be present during the search . With regard to the applicants\u2019 claim concerning their constitutional rights , the judge observed that questions concerning violations of rights such as the right to respect to one \u2019s private and family life , home and correspondence , were taken into account at the stage of issuing and not of the execution of the search warrant . In this connection he held that \u201c the issuing of a search warrant automatically resulted in the violation of the constitutional rights of the person against whom it was issued \u201d . Deviation from these rights was only justified when required by the public interest for the investigation of serious offences .", "Moreover , the judge held that the damage to the service of awarding justice would be much greater at the present stage if the documents were returned to those entitled to them than if they were detained by the customs department for evaluation and safe - keeping until a new order of the court . In this respect he further noted that their return before their essential evaluation was not advisable as the court was not competent and also lacked the knowledge to evaluate all the documents in order to decide if they were relevant or not . He therefore ordered that the majority of the documents and other exhibits be detained by the customs department until a new court order and/or until the conclusion of any criminal proceedings . In connection with this , the judge also observed that the applicants had not argued before the court that the retention of the material seized affected their trade activities in any way .", "Although he disagreed with the applicants\u2019 arguments that the search ought not to have included financial activity and commercial transactions of other legal and natural persons who had links with the applicants ( associated persons ) , he found that it should have excluded the taking of documents which related to the applicants\u2019 private life and any other activities , except financial activities and commercial transactions . He ordered that material that had been seized and concerned numbers of telephone communications of the applicants should be returned at once to the applicants and that the relevant copies taken by the customs officials should be destroyed , as the disclosure of such information was unlawful and violated the confidentiality of telephone communications . The judge referred to the PERSON on the Protection of the Confidentiality of Private Communication ( Surveillance of Communications ) in this respect ( Law CARDINAL/(I)/CARDINAL ) .", "Finally , the judge did not exclude the possibility of the filing by the applicants of an application for the return of material seized at a future stage , in which the documents or exhibits would be specified and the reasons for which their return was claimed , either within the framework of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , that is , before the filing of any criminal proceedings or within the framework of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of that PERSON , that is , the commencement of the criminal proceedings .", "Following the above decision , the authorities destroyed the copies made of the documents concerning the applicants\u2019 telephone communications .", "The applicants appealed against the decision of the court of first instance asking for it to be set aside and annulled ( appeals nos . DATE and DATE ) . They alleged that the decision was the outcome of a wrong exercise of the discretion granted to the court by section CARDINAL of LAW to order the retention of objects seized during the execution of a search warrant . They further complained that the search of the company \u2019s premises had been in violation of their constitutional rights .", "During the course of the appeal proceedings all the remaining material seized was returned to the applicants .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeals on the ground that the decision of ORG was not appealable as the applicable law did not provide the right to appeal against decisions of this nature . The court , however , did go on to say the following :", "\u201c .. in the case of section DATE ( CARDINAL ) of the PERSON , the grant by law of the right to appeal against decisions giving rise to the detention of confiscated objects is advisable , in as much as it concerns the independent decision of a court of first instance which affects fundamental rights of the individual , that of property and of the use of movable property ( Art . CARDINAL of the LAW ) , and possibly other rights too , such as the right to private life ( Art . CARDINAL of the LAW ) and of the secrecy of communication ( Art . CARDINAL of the LAW ) . \u201d", "No criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicants .", "The right to private life , communication and correspondence is safeguarded by Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the LAW .
