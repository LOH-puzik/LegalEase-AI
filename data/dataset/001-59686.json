FAC airport is the busiest airport in LOC , and the busiest international airport in the world . It is used by CARDINAL airlines , serving over CARDINAL destinations world - wide . It is GPE leading port in terms of visible trade .", "CARDINAL . Restrictions on night flights at FAC airport were introduced in DATE and have been reviewed periodically , most recently in DATE , DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , a number of reports into aircraft noise and sleep disturbance were published by or on behalf of ORG .", "CARDINAL . A Consultation Paper was published by ORG in DATE in the context of a review of the night restrictions policy at FAC . The Consultation Paper stated that research into the relationship between aircraft noise and sleep suggested that the number of movements at night could be increased by perhaps PERCENT without worsening disturbance , provided PERSON were not increased ( dBA Leq metric is a measurement of noise exposure ) .", "CARDINAL . It indicated that there were CARDINAL reasons for not considering a ban on night flights : first , that a ban on night flights would deny airlines the ability to plan some scheduled flights in TIME , and to cope with disruptions and delays ; secondly , that a ban on TIME flights would damage the status of FAC airport as a CARDINAL-hour international airport ( with implications for safety and maintenance and the needs of passengers ) and its competitive position in relation to a number of other NORP airports .", "CARDINAL . DATE , night flying was regulated solely by means of a limitation upon the number of take - offs and landings permitted at night . TIME of restriction were as follows :", "Summer TIME to TIME DATE", "TIME to TIME DATE landings", "TIME to TIME DATE take - offs", "Winter CARDINAL.CARDINAL p.m. to TIME DATE", "TIME to TIME DATE take - offs and landings", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , ORG commenced an internal review of the restrictions on TIME flights . A new classification of aircraft and the development of a quota count system were the major focus of the review . As part of the review , ORG asked ORG to undertake further objective study of aircraft noise and sleep disturbance .", "CARDINAL . The fieldwork for the study was carried out during DATE . Measurements of disturbance were obtained from CARDINAL subjects living in the vicinity of FAC , GPE , GPE and GPE airports . The findings were published in DATE as the \u201c Report of ORG and Sleep Disturbance \u201d ( \u201c the DATE sleep study \u201d ) . It found that , once asleep , very few people living near airports were at risk of any substantial sleep disturbance due to aircraft noise and that , compared with the overall average of CARDINAL DATE awakenings without any aircraft noise , even large numbers of noisy TIME - time aircraft noise movements would cause very little increase in the average person \u2019s DATE awakenings . It concluded that the results of the field study provided no evidence to suggest that aircraft noise was likely to cause harmful after effects . It also emphasised , however , that its conclusions were based on average effects , and that some of the subjects of the study ( PERCENT ) were PERCENT more sensitive than average .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the Government published a ORG regarding a proposed new scheme for regulating TIME flights at the CARDINAL main airports serving GPE : FAC , GPE and GPE . In considering the demand for night flights , the ORG made reference to the fact that if restrictions on TIME flights were imposed in GPE , certain flights would not be as convenient or their costs would be higher than competitors abroad could offer , and that passengers would choose alternatives that better suited their requirements .", "CARDINAL . It also stated that various foreign operators were based at airports with no night restrictions , which meant that they could keep prices down by achieving a high utilisation of aircraft , and that this was a crucial factor in attracting business in what was a highly competitive and price sensitive market .", "CARDINAL . Further , the Consultation Paper stated that both scheduled and charter airlines believed that their operations could be substantially improved by being allowed more movements during TIME , especially landings .", "It also indicated that charter companies required the ability to operate in TIME , as they operated in a highly competitive , price sensitive market and needed to contain costs as much as possible . The commercial viability of their business depended upon high utilisation of their aircraft , which typically required CARDINAL rotations a day to nearer destinations , and which could only be fitted in using movements at TIME .", "CARDINAL . Finally , in reference to the demand for night flights , the Consultation Paper referred to the continuing demand for some all - cargo flights at TIME carrying mail and other time - sensitive freight such as newspapers and perishable goods , and referred to the fact that all - cargo movements are banned , whether arriving or departing , for much of DATE at FAC airport .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper referred to the DATE sleep study stating that the DATE sleep study found that the number of disturbances caused by aircraft noise was so small that it had a negligible effect on overall normal disturbance rates , and that disturbance rates from all causes were not at a level likely to affect people \u2019s health or well - being .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper further stated that , in keeping with the undertaking given in DATE not to allow a worsening of noise at TIME , and ideally to improve it , it was proposed that the quota for DATE based on the new system should be set at a level so as to keep overall noise levels below those in DATE .", "CARDINAL . A considerable number of responses to the Consultation Paper were received from trade and industry associations with an interest in air travel ( including ORG [ \u201c ORG \u201d ] , ORG and the GPE and ORG ) and from airlines , all of which emphasised the economic importance of TIME flights . Detailed information and figures were provided by the associations and the airlines to support their responses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG announced his intention to introduce , with effect from DATE , a quota system of night flying restrictions , the stated aim of which was to reduce noise at the CARDINAL main GPE airports , which included FAC ( \u201c the DATE Scheme \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Scheme introduced a noise quota scheme for the night quota period . Under the noise quota scheme each aircraft type was assigned a \u201c quota count \u201d between QUANTITY ( for the quietest ) and QUANTITY ( for the noisiest ) . FAC airport was then allotted a certain number of quota points , and aircraft movements had to be kept within the permitted points total . The effect of this was that , under the DATE Scheme , rather than a maximum number of individual aircraft movements being specified , aircraft operators could choose within the noise quota whether to operate a greater number of quieter aeroplanes or a lesser number of noisier aeroplanes . The system was designed , according to the DATE ORG , to encourage the use of quieter aircraft by making noisier types use more of the quota for each movement .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Scheme defined \u201c TIME \u201d as the period TIME , and further defined a \u201c night quota period \u201d from TIME to TIME , DATE a week , throughout DATE , when the controls were strict . During TIME , operators were not permitted to schedule the noisier types of aircraft to take off ( CARDINAL FAC \u2013 quota count DATE or QUANTITY ) or to land ( QUANTITY ) . During the night quota period , aircraft movements were restricted by a movements limit and a noise quota , which were set for DATE ( DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Consultation Paper had proposed a rating of QUANTITY FAC for the quietest aircraft . This would have allowed an unlimited number of these aircraft to fly at TIME , and the Government took account of objections to this proposal in deciding to rate the quietest aircraft at QUANTITY . Otherwise , the DATE Scheme was broadly in accordance with the proposals set out in the DATE Consultation Paper .", "CARDINAL . The local authorities for the areas around the CARDINAL main GPE airports sought judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision to introduce the DATE Scheme , making CARDINAL consecutive applications for judicial review and appealing twice to ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) In consequence of the various judgments delivered by ORG and ORG , the ORG consulted on revised proposals in DATE and DATE ; commissioned a study by ORG ( ORG of ORG and the Regions [ formerly ORG ; \u201c the DETR \u201d ] ) in DATE into ground noise at TIME at FAC , GPE and GPE airports ; added to the quota count system an overall maximum number of aircraft movements ; issued a further ORG in DATE , and issued a supplement to ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE supplement stated that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s policies and the proposals based on them allowed more noise than was experienced from actual aircraft movements in DATE , and acknowledged that this was contrary to Government policy , as expressed in the DATE Consultation Paper . As part of the DATE review of the DATE Scheme , the Government reviewed ORG reports on aircraft noise and sleep disturbance , including the DATE sleep study . The DETR prepared a series of papers on TIME arrival and departure statistics at FAC , GPE and GPE airports , scheduling and curfews in relation to night movements , runway capacity TIME , FAC night arrivals for DATE in DATE , and TIME departures for DATE in DATE . The ORG also considered a paper prepared by FAC on the implications of a prohibition on night flights TIME", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG announced that the noise quotas and all other aspects of the night restrictions regime would remain as previously announced . In DATE , ORG decided that the Secretary of ORG had given adequate reasons and sufficient justification for his conclusion that it was reasonable , on balance , to run the risk of diminishing to some degree local people \u2019s ability to sleep at TIME because of the other countervailing considerations to which he was , in DATE , willing to give greater weight , and that by DATE errors in the consultation papers had been corrected and the new policy could not be said to be irrational . On DATE , ORG dismissed a petition by the local authorities for leave to appeal against the decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The movement limits for FAC under the DATE Scheme , introduced as a consequence of the legal challenges in the domestic courts , were set at CARDINAL per DATE from DATE , and CARDINAL per DATE from DATE to DATE ( DATE being deemed to change when the clocks change from ORG to ORG ) . The noise quotas for FAC up to DATE were set at CARDINAL for DATE and CARDINAL for DATE . Flights involving emergencies were excluded from the restrictions . The number of movements permitted during TIME period ( i.e. from TIME to TIME ) remained at about the same level as DATE . At the same time , the number of movements permitted during TIME ( i.e. from TIME ) increased under the DATE Scheme due to the reduction in the length of the night quota period .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a trial was initiated at FAC airport of modified procedures for TIME landings ( those TIME ) . The aim of the trial , which was conducted by ORG on behalf of the DETR , was to help alleviate noise over parts of central GPE in TIME . An interim report , entitled \u201c Assessment of Revised Heathrow Early Mornings Approach Procedures Trial \u201d , was published in DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a study , commissioned by the DETR and carried out by ORG gave rise to a report , \u201c Night noise contours : a feasibility study \u201d , which was published in DATE . The report contained a detailed examination of the causes and consequences of night noise , and identified possible areas of further research . It concluded that there was not enough research evidence to produce \u201c scientifically robust night contours that depict levels of TIME - time annoyance \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the Government conducted a CARDINAL - stage consultation exercise on night restrictions at FAC , GPE and GPE airports . In DATE , a preliminary ORG on night restrictions at FAC , GPE and GPE was published . The Preliminary Consultation Paper stated that most night movements catered primarily for different needs from those that took place during the daytime , and set out reasons for allowing night flights . These were essentially the same as those given in the DATE Consultation Paper .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the Preliminary Consultation Paper referred to the fact that air transport was CARDINAL of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy and contained some of GPE most successful firms . Air transport facilitated economic growth , world trade , international investment and tourism , and was of particular importance to GPE because of its open economy and geographical position . The Consultation Paper went on to say that permitting night flights , albeit subject to restrictions , at major airports in GPE had contributed to this success .", "CARDINAL . The Government set movement limits and noise quotas for DATE at the same level as for DATE , in order to allow adequate time for consultation .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) commissioned a report from ORG into the economic costs of maintaining the restrictions on night flights . The report was published in DATE and was entitled \u201c The economic costs of TIME flying restrictions at the GPE airports \u201d . The report concluded that the economic cost of the then current restrictions being maintained during DATE was MONEY . ORG submitted the report to the Government when it responded to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government announced that the movement limits and noise quotas for DATE would be the same as for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the Government published the second stage ORG on night restrictions at FAC , GPE and GPE . The Consultation Paper stated that it had been the view of successive Governments that the policy on night noise should be firmly based on research into the relationship between aircraft noise and interference with sleep and that , in order to preserve the balance between the different interests , this should continue to be the basis for decisions . The Consultation Paper indicated that \u2018 interference with ORG was intended to cover both sleep disturbance ( an awakening from sleep , however short ) and sleep prevention ( a delay in first getting to sleep at TIME , and awakening and then not being able to get back to sleep in TIME ) . The Consultation Paper stated that further research into the effect of aircraft noise on sleep had been commissioned , which would include a review of existing research in GPE and abroad , and a trial to assess methodology and analytical techniques to determine whether to proceed to a full scale study of either sleep prevention or total sleep loss .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper repeated the finding of the DATE sleep study that for noise events in the range of CARDINAL dBA ORG ( CARDINAL - CARDINAL dBA Lmax ) , the likelihood of the average person being awakened by an aircraft noise event was CARDINAL in DATE . It acknowledged that the CARDINAL in CARDINAL related to sleep disturbance , and not to sleep prevention , and that while there was a substantial body of research on sleep disturbance , less was known about sleep prevention or total sleep loss .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper stated that the objectives of the current review were , in relation to FAC , to strike a balance between the need to protect local communities from excessive aircraft noise levels at TIME and to provide for air services to operate at TIME where they are of benefit to the local , regional and national economy ; to ensure that the competitive factors affecting GPE airports and airlines and the wider employment and economic implications were taken into account ; to take account of the research into the relationship between aircraft noise and interference with sleep and any health effects ; to encourage the use of quieter aircraft at night ; to put in place at FAC , for the night quota period ( TIME ) , arrangements which would bring about further improvements in the TIME noise climate around the airport over time and to update the arrangements as appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper stated that since the introduction of the DATE Scheme , there had been an improvement in the noise climate around FAC during the night quota period , based on the total of the quota count ratings of aircraft counted against the noise quota , but that there had probably been a deterioration over TIME period between TIME as a result of the growth in traffic TIME", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper found a strong customer preference for TIME long - haul services from LOC .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper indicated that the Government had not attempted to quantify the aviation and economic benefits of night flights in monetary terms . This was because of the difficulties in obtaining reliable and impartial data on passenger and economic benefits ( some of which was commercially sensitive ) and modelling these complex interactions . ORG had submitted a copy of the ORG DATE report with its response to the Preliminary Consultation Paper , and the Consultation Paper noted that the report estimated the value of an additional daily long haul scheduled night flight at FAC to be MONEY per year , CARDINAL of which was made up of airline profits . The Consultation Paper stated that the financial effects on airlines were understood to derive from estimates made by a leading GPE airline . Other parts of the calculation reflected assumptions about the effects on passengers and knock - on effects on other services , expressed in terms of an assumed percentage of the assumed revenue earned by these services . The ORG stated that the cost of restricting existing TIME flights more severely might be different , and that ORG \u2019s figures took no account of the wider economic effects which were not captured in the estimated airline and passenger impacts .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper stated that , in formulating their proposals , the ORG had taken into account both ORG \u2019s figures and the fact that it was not possible for the Government to test the estimates or the assumptions made by ORG . Any value attached to a \u201c marginal \u201d night flight had to be weighed against the environmental disadvantages . These could not be estimated in monetary terms , but it was possible , drawing on the DATE sleep study , to estimate the numbers of people likely to be awakened . The Consultation Paper concluded that in forming its proposals , the Government must take into account , on the one hand , the important aviation interests involved and the wider economic considerations . It seemed clear that GPE airlines and airports would stand to lose business , including in the DATE , if prevented by unduly severe restrictions from offering limited services at TIME ; that users could also suffer , and that the services offered by GPE airports and airlines would diminish , and with them the appeal of GPE and GPE more generally . On the other hand , these considerations had to be weighed against the noise disturbance caused by TIME flights . The proposals made in the Consultation Paper aimed to strike a balance between the different interests and , in the Government \u2019s view , would protect local people from excessive aircraft noise at TIME .", "CARDINAL . The main proposals in relation to FAC were : not to introduce a ban on night flights , or a curfew period ; to retain the seasonal noise quotas and movement limits ; to review the FAC classifications of individual aircraft and , if this produced significant reclassifications , to reconsider the quota limits ; to retain the FAC system ; to review the FAC system before DATE ( when fleet compositions would have changed following completion of the compulsory phase - out in LOC of LAW civil aircraft , with the exception of Concorde , which began in DATE ) , in accordance with the policy of encouraging the use of quieter aircraft ; to reduce the DATE and DATE noise quotas ; to maintain TIME period as TIME and the night quota period as TIME to TIME ; to extend the restrictions on aircraft classified as QCCARDINAL on arrival or departure to match those for GPE and to ban QCCARDINAL aircraft from being scheduled to land or take off during the night quota period from DATE ( i.e. after completion of the compulsory LAW phase out ) .", "CARDINAL . The Consultation Paper stated that since the introduction of the DATE scheme , headroom had developed in the quotas , reducing the incentive for operators to use quieter aircraft . The reduction in DATE and DATE noise quotas to nearer the level of current usage was intended as a first step to restoring the incentive . The DATE noise quota level under the DATE scheme was CARDINAL ORG points , and the average usage in DATE had been CARDINAL ORG points . A reduction to CARDINAL was proposed . The summer noise quota level had been CARDINAL points , and the average usage in DATE was provisionally calculated at CARDINAL . A reduction to CARDINAL was proposed . The new levels would remain in place until DATE , subject to the outcome of the ORG review .", "CARDINAL . Part CARDINAL of the Consultation Paper invited comments as to whether runway alternation should be introduced at FAC at TIME , and on the preferential use of FAC \u2019s runways at TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government announced that the proposals in the DATE Consultation Paper would be implemented with effect from DATE , with limited modifications . With respect to FAC , the only modification was that there was to be a smaller reduction in the noise quotas than proposed . The quotas were set at CARDINAL ORG points for the DATE , and CARDINAL ORG points for DATE . The effect of this was to set the DATE quota at a level below actual usage in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Scheme came into effect on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a report was published on \u201c The Contribution of the Aviation Industry to the GPE Economy \u201d . The report was prepared by ORG and was sponsored by a number of airlines , airport operators and ORG , as well as the Government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Government announced that runway alternation at FAC would be extended into TIME at the earliest practicable opportunity \u201d , and issued a further consultation paper concerning proposals for changes to the preferential use of FAC \u2019s runways at TIME .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the DETR and ORG published the final report of ORG on \u201c Noise from Arriving Aircraft \u201d . The purpose of the report was to describe objectively the sources of operational noise for arriving aircraft , to consider possible means of noise amelioration , and to make recommendations to the DETR .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG published a report , prepared on behalf of the DETR , entitled \u201c Adverse effects of TIME - time aircraft noise \u201d . The report identified a number of issues for possible further research , and was intended to form the background to any future GPE studies of night - time aircraft noise . The report stated that gaps in knowledge had been identified , and indicated that the DETR was considering whether there was a case for a further full - scale study on the adverse effects of night - time aircraft noise , and had decided to commission CARDINAL further short research studies to investigate the options . These studies were commissioned in DATE , before the publication of the ORG report . CARDINAL is a trial study to assess research methodology . The other is a social survey the aims of which included an exploration of the difference between objectively measured and publicly received disturbance due to aircraft noise at TIME . Both studies are being conducted by university researchers .", "CARDINAL . A series of noise mitigation and abatement measures is in place at FAC airport , in addition to restrictions on night flights . These include the following : aircraft noise certification to reduce noise at source ; the compulsory phasing out of older , noisier jet aircraft ; noise preferential routes and minimum climb gradients for aircraft taking off ; noise abatement approach procedures ( continuous descent and low power / low drag procedures ) ; limitation of air transport movements ; noise related airport charges ; noise insulation grant schemes and compensation for noise nuisance under LAW DATE .", "CARDINAL .
