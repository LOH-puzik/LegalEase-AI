In the explanatory report ( d\u00f4vodov\u00e1 spr\u00e1va ) on the bill the deputy considered that the repeal of the exemption under LAW ( CARDINAL ) ( e ) had been contra ORG mores in that employed pensioners had been made to contribute to the pension scheme but had received nothing in return .", "ORG submitted the bill to the ORG with an introductory report ( predkladacia spr\u00e1va ) in which they disagreed with the drafter . According to this report the exemption in question had given an unjustified advantage to employed pensioners over other employed persons in that as no contributions had been associated with the employment of pensioners , the latter group had been a more attractive work force than other employees . This had distorted the labour market and had to be corrected by the amendment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . Another reason for that amendment had been the recent passive balance of the retirement pension fund .", "The situation of persons who are employed after becoming entitled to a retirement pension but do not draw such a pension is addressed in LAW .
