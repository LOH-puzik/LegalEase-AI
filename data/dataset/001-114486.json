She always felt that she was a female in a male body but decided to cope with the situation . In DATE she married a woman and in DATE they had a child .", "CARDINAL . The applicant started feeling worse in DATE , and decided in DATE to seek medical help . In DATE she was diagnosed as transgender . Since that time , she has lived as a woman . On DATE she underwent gender re - assignment surgery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant changed her first names and renewed her passport and driver \u2019s licence but she could not have her identity number changed . The identity number still indicates that she is male , as does her passport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the local ORG ( maistraatti , magistraten ) to confirm her as being female and to change her male identity number to a female one as it no longer corresponded to reality .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the local ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request . It found that , according to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Act on Confirmation of ORG ( laki transseksuaalin sukupuolen vahvistamisesta , lagen om fastst\u00e4llande av transsexuella personers k\u00f6nstillh\u00f6righet ) , the confirmation required that the person was not married or that the spouse gave his or her consent . As the applicant \u2019s wife did not give her consent to the transformation of their marriage into a civil partnership ( rekister\u00f6ity parisuhde , registrerat partnerskap ) , the applicant \u2019s new gender could not be introduced in the population register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) complaining , inter alia , that her wife \u2019s decision not to give consent , to which she was perfectly entitled as they both preferred to remain married , meant that the applicant could not be registered as a female . A divorce would be against their religious convictions . A civil partnership did not provide the same security as a marriage and this would mean , among other things , that their child would be put into a different situation vis - \u00e0 - vis children born within wedlock .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal on the same grounds as the local ORG . Moreover it found , inter alia , that the impugned decision of DATE was not contrary to LAW as same - sex partners had a possibility , by registering their relationship , to benefit from family law protection in a manner partially comparable to a marriage . Similarly , Sections CARDINAL and QUANTITY of the Act on Confirmation of ORG did not violate the constitutional rights of the applicant \u2019s child .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltnings - domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds presented before the local ORG and ORG . She also asked the court to make a request for a preliminary ruling to ORG of ORG , in particular on the interpretation of LAW . Referring to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , the applicant claimed that the ORG should not tell her that a civil partnership was appropriate for her , especially when it required that her wife become a lesbian . Their sexual identity was a private matter which could not be a condition for the confirmation of gender . Transgenderism was a medical condition falling within the scope of private life . The ORG was violating her right to privacy every time the male identity number revealed her to be transgender . Moreover , she claimed that if her marriage were turned into a civil partnership , it would mean that she could no longer be a legal father to her child nor his mother , as a child could not have CARDINAL mothers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for a preliminary ruling and rejected her appeal . It found that by adopting the LAW on Confirmation of the Gender of a Transsexual the legislator did not mean to change the fact that only a man and a woman could marry and that same - sex partners could have their relationship judicially confirmed by registering it . ORG had found under LAW that there were no acceptable grounds to deny transgender persons their right to marry but that the margin of appreciation in this respect was large . It was not possible under NORP law for persons of the same sex to marry but , in such a case , it was a question of a civil partnership . As to its juridical and economic consequences , a civil partnership was essentially comparable to a marriage . The question of transforming the marriage institution into a gender - neutral one was connected to significant ethical and religious values and it was to be solved by an act enacted by ORG . The current state of law was within the margin of appreciation given to the ORG by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal with ORG , requesting it to annul its previous decision of DATE . She stated that she had undergone gender reassignment surgery on DATE and that she could no longer prove that she had been male , as indicated by her identity number and passport . Even though , for marriage purposes , she would still be considered as male , the fact remained that she should not be discriminated against due to her gender .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the extraordinary appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for reimbursement of the costs of some hormonal medicine which was part of her treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Kansanel\u00e4kelaitos , Folkpensionsanstalten ) refused her application as she was deemed to be entitled to the reimbursement only once she had been given a new identity number .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( PERSON muutoksenhakulautakunta , GPE f\u00f6r social trygghet ) claiming , inter alia , that she had been discriminated against .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s appeal and changed the decision of CARDINAL DATE by ORG , finding that the applicant was entitled to reimbursement .", "CARDINAL . As no appeal was made against this decision , it became final .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant also filed a complaint with ORG ( NORP - arvovaltuutettu , PERSON ) , complaining about the wrong identity number as well as the reimbursement of medical costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Ombudsman for ORG stated that she could not take a stand on the identity number issue as the matter had already been dealt with by ORG and the ORG was not competent to supervise the courts . Moreover , the matter was pending before ORG . As to the reimbursement of medical costs , the ORG found that the fact that the reimbursement was conditional on the identity number and not on medical grounds placed transgender persons in a different position to other persons receiving the same treatment . She recommended that ORG change its practice in this respect in order to prevent discrimination against transgender persons .", "CARDINAL . DATE ( Suomen perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides the following :", "\u201c Everyone is equal before the law .", "No one shall , without an acceptable reason , be treated differently from other persons on the ground of sex , age , origin , language , religion , conviction , opinion , health , disability or other reason that concerns his or her person . Children shall be treated equally and as individuals and they shall be allowed to influence matters pertaining to themselves to a degree corresponding to their level of development .", "Equality of the sexes is promoted in societal activity and working life , especially in the determination of pay and the other terms of employment , as provided in more detail by an LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Section CARDINAL of the same LAW provides for exceptions from the marital status requirement . A marriage or a civil partnership does not prevent the confirmation of gender if the spouse or the partner personally gives his or her consent to it before a local ORG . When belonging to the opposite gender is confirmed , a marriage is turned ex lege into a civil partnership and a civil partnership into a marriage .
