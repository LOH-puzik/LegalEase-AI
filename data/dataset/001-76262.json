Shortly before his release in DATE \u2013 after a GPE court had ruled that the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE was not permissible \u2013 the prison authorities received indications that the applicant and CARDINAL co - detainees harboured escape plans . On DATE , the applicant filed a criminal complaint with the police , alleging that the NORP authorities planned to kill him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested and placed in pre - trial detention ( voorlopige hechtenis ) on suspicion of having committed serious crimes within a violent criminal organisation in which he played a leading role . Criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant , who was sentenced in first - instance proceedings to DATE imprisonment . On DATE , following proceedings on appeal , ORG ( gerechtshof ) of \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch quashed the first - instance judgment , convicted the applicant of several offences and sentenced him to life imprisonment . His subsequent appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was initially detained in an ordinary remand centre ( huis van bewaring ) . Shortly after he was apprehended , and on the basis of information indicating a risk that he would seek ways to escape and also reports that he was in danger of being \u201c liquidated \u201d , he was transferred to ORG ) in a GPE detention facility .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the advice of the special selection board of the maximum security institution ( NORP PERSON \u2013 \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the Minister of ORG decided to place the applicant in the pre - trial detention unit of the ORG , which is part of the PERSON Penitentiary Complex in FAC . His detention in the ORG prison was reviewed and extended by the Minister DATE . The applicant unsuccessfully challenged each decision to extend before ORG ( beroepscommissie ) of ORG ( Centrale PERSON ) . On DATE ORG was replaced by ORG ( PERSON GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE the applicant was informed that the Minister of ORG had decided to extend his detention in the ORG once again . According to information contained in the proposal of DATE to extend the applicant \u2019s stay in the ORG , he had not had any contact with social workers during DATE and apparently did not feel the need to have such contact . The proposal , which describes in detail the applicant \u2019s attitude , behaviour and activities in the ORG , does not mention any psychological problems encountered by the applicant caused by his detention in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The letter of DATE , in its relevant part , reads as follows :", "\u201c From the information available about you , it appears that you must be regarded as likely to try to escape ( vluchtgevaarlijk ) . On this subject , I would inform you as follows .", "Official reports ( ambtsberichten ) that have been received point out that \u2013 quite apart from your membership of a criminal organisation \u2013 you are suspected of having committed serious crimes . You are suspected of leadership of an international criminal organisation that must be regarded as very violent . You are suspected of having personally instigated very serious and very violent crimes that have seriously undermined law and order . You have since been sentenced at first instance to DATE imprisonment , after a sentence of life imprisonment was sought [ by the prosecution ] . You have lodged an appeal .", "When you were being transferred to ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) and ORG in GPE on DATE and DATE respectively , \u201c suspect \u201d cars were observed [ whose registered owners ] may have been connected to persons with a criminal background . You have indicated that you(r family ) are wealthy . It is therefore also reasonable to conclude that you are capable of providing financial backing for escape plans , in this instance for the organisation of an escape ( attempt ) via the hiring of third parties .", "Also during a previous detention , in the ... detention facility , there were indications , on DATE , that you had plans to mount an escape together with others , in an operation involving a firearm . On DATE , in the same detention facility , information ( was found ) that could be connected to the indications referred to above . Your previous detention was a consequence of the fact that GPE ( unsuccessfully , as it later transpired ) had requested your extradition in connection with serious crimes .", "As during your previous detention , you have indicated that you are being threatened with \u201c liquidation \u201d , even whilst in detention . You also lodged a criminal complaint to that effect with the GPE police on DATE . Accordingly , as during your previous detention , you were transferred \u2013 in view of the seriousness of the information , which became apparent after the investigation \u2013 [ to ORG on DATE ] in order to secure not only your safety but also the order , peace and security of the prison where you were detained . The fears which you expressed were confirmed once more in DATE by official reports .", "On DATE you and your sister , who was visiting you , acted in breach of the rules governing the regime in the ORG . Your sister allowed you to read uncensored reports which she then destroyed . Disciplinary action was taken against you as a result .", "With reference to the contents of the third paragraph , I would inform you that in DATE the presence of another \u201c suspicious \u201d car was noted near the ORG around the time of your transfer to ORG . CARDINAL persons who had been travelling in the car were present in the courtroom on DATE . They turned out to have criminal records .", "On DATE you and a co - detainee had a conversation about one of the latter \u2019s escape attempts elsewhere in the GPE . In this context the co - detainee concerned told you that he had paid MONEY for this . It was noted that your co - detainee added that \u2018 that would never succeed here because the staff and the Governor work closely together\u2019 .", "In the meantime , after life imprisonment was sought [ by the prosecution ] , you have been sentenced at first instance to DATE imprisonment . You have lodged an appeal .", "An escape on your part would be unacceptable to society and would seriously undermine law and order , having regard to the serious crimes of which you are suspected and , in this case , of which you have been convicted at first instance . If plans to \u201c liquidate \u201d you were to materialise , this would give rise to offences creating social unrest and seriously undermining law and order .", "In view of the above , the [ ORG ] selection board , having heard evidence from the selection officer ( with whom you refused to speak ) , has advised me to continue your detention in the ORG . I have taken a decision to that effect .", "To give you as full a picture as possible , I would further inform you that the rules governing the ORG regime offer added guarantees for preventing the implementation of ( possible ) plans to \u201c liquidate \u201d you . In this connection it must be mentioned , with reference to what has been stated above , that ( at DATE ) \u201c liquidation plans \u201d concerning you came to light within the ORG , in this case death threats by third persons . You indicated that you took these threats very seriously ; you appeared frightened and it was clear that they had made an impression on you . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , as in the case of the previous decisions to extend , again challenged the extension of his stay in the ORG by lodging an appeal with ORG . In his appeal against the decision of DATE the applicant challenged the necessity of his continued detention in the ORG . He also stated that he was suffering both physically and mentally as a result of the ORG detention regime without , however , substantiating that claim . Relying on the findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c CPT \u201d ) in respect of its visit to the ORG in DATE and on the ORG \u2019s decision on admissibility of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON the GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , he argued that his ( continued ) detention in the ORG infringed his rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW on account of the ORG detention regime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It held , on the basis of the different elements set out in the impugned decision , that the applicant was extremely likely to try to escape and , in view of the offences of which he was suspected , that he posed an unacceptable risk in terms of the danger of his committing further serious violent crimes . Noting that the applicant was suspected of offences in respect of which a DATE prison sentence had been imposed at first instance and which were a source of grave concern to society and public opinion , ORG was of the opinion that the applicant , in the event of an escape , would pose an unacceptable risk to society . It also took into account the fact that specific threats to kill the applicant or to have him killed had repeatedly come to light . It therefore concluded that the applicant \u2019s stay in the ORG corresponded to both situations provided for in LAW on the selection , placement and transfer of detainees ( NORP selectie , plaatsing en overplaatsing van gedetineerden ) of DATE . As regards the applicant \u2019s reliance on the Convention , it held that the proceedings on the extension of the applicant \u2019s stay in the ORG fell outside the scope of LAW and that the interference with the rights guaranteed by LAW was permissible to the extent that such interference was in accordance with the law and necessary in a NORP society in the interests of , inter alia , the prevention of disorder or crime . Lastly , it held that the decision to extend the applicant \u2019s stay in the ORG was lawful and that , weighing up all the interests involved , it could not be considered as unreasonable or unjust . It did not deal with the applicant \u2019s argument that the extension of his stay in the ORG was contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the applicant \u2019s detention in the ORG had been extended again . His appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE on the same grounds as those given in ORG decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention in the ORG was extended once more . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG against this decision on DATE . No further information has been submitted about these appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred from the ORG to another prison with a different regime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr R.J.P. Rijnders \u2013 a psychiatrist attached to ORG ( ORG \u2018 CARDINAL ) , a national centre for the medical - psychological treatment of members of the Resistance in the Second World War , victims of war and organised violence , and asylum seekers suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder related to experiences in their country of origin \u2013 drew up a report on the applicant \u2019s state of mental health . According to the report the applicant had developed various mental problems ( chronic post - traumatic stress disorder , depression and a strong tendency towards somatisation ) during his detention in the ORG . The post - traumatic stress phenomena were mainly linked to his experiences in the ORG and only some of his complaints and symptoms were connected with his experiences in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil action in tort ( onrechtmatige daad ) against ORG before ORG . CARDINAL of the grounds on which he claimed payment of compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage for unlawful acts for which he considered GPE to be liable was that , from his arrest in DATE until DATE , he had been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment on account of the conditions of his detention , including \u201c ( continuous ) sensory deprivation and insufficient social contact ( extensive social isolation ) , humiliating and unnecessary strip - searches , frisking , [ and ] being prohibited ( inter alia ) from communicating in NORP with , for instance , his mother and children \u201d . The applicant based this part of his claim on the ORG \u2019s findings in its judgments of CARDINAL DATE in the cases of PERSON the GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL ) and PERSON and Others v. the GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , the findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) as set out in CARDINAL reports ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , a report drawn up on DATE by academic researchers on the psychological impact of the ORG regime on the mental well - being of ( former ) inmates ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and the report drawn up on DATE by the psychiatrist PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . These civil proceedings are currently pending before ORG .", "CARDINAL . An overview of the relevant domestic law and practice is given in the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON the GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINAL-II ) and in GPE v. the GPE ( ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in view of the ORG \u2019s findings in its judgments of CARDINAL DATE in the cases of PERSON ( cited above ) and PERSON and Others ( cited above ) , the ORG house rules ( huisregels ) were amended , with the result that the practice of DATE routine strip - searches accompanying the DATE cell inspections was abandoned . Under the amended Article CARDINAL ) of the ORG house rules , strip - searches could be carried out at random during or directly after a DATE cell inspection .", "CARDINAL . As from DATE , pursuant to a ruling given on DATE by the judge responsible for provisional measures ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG in summary injunction proceedings brought against GPE in DATE by CARDINAL ORG detainees , the random strip - searches were no longer linked to cell inspections and the ORG authorities from then on determined in the case of each individual detainee to what extent random stripsearches were called for . The situation of each individual detainee is now discussed at the DATE ORG staff meeting on detainees .", "CARDINAL . On DATE researchers from ORG presented a report on a study , commissioned in DATE by the Minister of ORG , about the psychological impact of the ORG regime on the mental well - being of ( former ) inmates ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . It concluded that the ORG regime affected the cognitive functioning of detainees in a negative manner , with particular reference to the speed of processing information and response inhibition . This was probably a result of the lack of stimuli in the detention situation . The report further concluded that the ORG regime caused more depression than a restricted community regime and that strip - searches were perceived as humiliating , constituting an extra burden for persons detained in the ORG . On the other hand , the ORG regime provided a better balance between rest and activity than a restricted community regime , as a result of which ORG detainees maintained a healthier life rhythm . In addition it had not been demonstrated that ORG detainees displayed more physical symptoms of persistent mental stress .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under GPE law the civil courts have traditionally had jurisdiction to grant relief against the authorities , if and in so far as no other relief is available . Where a person bases a claim against the authorities on an allegation that the latter have committed a tort within the meaning of Article CARDINAL of the Dutch Civil Code ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) against him or her , the civil courts have jurisdiction in principle . Where the civil courts have jurisdiction , they can also act in summary injunction proceedings ( kort geding ) in which a plaintiff can , inter alia , request the civil court to issue an order against the authorities . An act by the authorities is unlawful and constitutes a tort when it violates a right of the plaintiff or is contrary to a rule of international or domestic law which seeks to protect the plaintiff \u2019s interests , or to general principles of proper administration ( algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur ) . An action in tort is subject to a limitation period of DATE under LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , as to the jurisdiction of the civil courts in cases where an administrative appeal lies , it is an established principle under GPE law that DATE given the closed system of legal remedies ( gesloten system van rechtsmiddelen ) in the GPE legal system \u2013 the civil court should refrain from examining the lawfulness of an administrative decision , provided that the administrative appeal offers sufficient guarantees as to a fair procedure . On this topic , extensive case - law has been developed by ORG ( PERSON ) over DATE , supported by several authorities , to the effect that where an administrative appeal does not offer sufficient guarantees of a fair procedure , the civil courts have full jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of the administrative decision . On the other hand , a civil action should be declared inadmissible when another specific remedy exists which offers sufficient guarantees of fair proceedings ( see ORG , DATE , PERSON ( GPE Law Reports \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d ) DATE , no . CARDINAL ; see also NORP v. the GPE , judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a case in which it gave judgment on DATE , ORG examined the question whether a party which considers that it has been injured by a judicial ruling against it can bring a subsequent civil action in tort against the ORG arguing that the judge failed to act with due care in giving that ruling . ORG found that this was not possible , holding that it was solely for the legislature to decide in what cases a remedy was to be provided . It would be incompatible with this principle if an unsuccessful party were to have the possibility , via a civil action , of making the correctness of a [ final ] judicial ruling the subject matter of new proceedings , and thus to obtain a renewed examination in another manner than that provided for by statute . It added that only if the proceedings leading to a judicial decision had breached such fundamental legal principles ( fundamentele rechtsbeginselen ) that the case could no longer be said to have been determined in a fair and impartial manner , and if there was no possibility of appeal nor had there ever been such a possibility , could the ORG be held liable for the effects of such a ruling in a civil action in tort ( GPE DATE , no .

In a judgment given on DATE concerning civil proceedings taken against ORG by an association of detainees who wished to challenge a special restricteddetention regime in a specific wing of the prison in GPE , ORG held that , as individual detainees had available to them a specific remedy to challenge a transfer to the wing concerned ( that is to say , the individual complaint procedure provided for in Article CARDINAL et seq . of the Prison Act DATE ( Beginselenwet Gevangeniswezen ) as in force at that time ) and it was not in dispute that that remedy offered sufficient procedural safeguards , the plaintiff \u2019s case had been correctly declared inadmissible , as the association had acted solely \u201c in the context of promoting the interests of its members \u201d , which were already safeguarded by the individual complaint procedure under LAW seq . of LAW ( GPE DATE , no .

CARDINAL ) in a civil action against GPE brought by a coaccused of a successful applicant in GPE ( PERSON v. the GPE , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , ORG held :", "\u201c It is embedded in the [ GPE ] legal system that a criminal court conviction against which an ordinary appeal can no longer be lodged not only should , but must , be executed . It is further incompatible with the closed system of legal remedies in criminal cases that a convicted person should have the opportunity , via a claim [ for damage arising from tort ] against the ORG , to bring a fresh set of legal proceedings challenging the decision of the criminal court or the acceptability of the [ criminal ] proceedings leading to the decision and to have [ the subject matter of those proceedings ] reviewed by the civil courts .", "Considering the obligations flowing from ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL [ of the Convention ] to secure the rights set out in LAW ] and to provide an effective remedy in the event of a violation of those rights , an exception must be made to the above - mentioned rules should a ruling of ORG [ of Human Rights ] , which the criminal court judge could not take into account in his decision , prompt the conclusion that the decision had come about in such a manner that it could no longer be said that there had been a fair hearing of the case within the meaning of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL [ of the Convention ] .", "When such an exceptional case occurs , immediate execution of the decision can no longer be regarded as permitted under the legal system , and the person convicted can institute interim injunction proceedings [ before the civil court judge ] seeking DATE depending on the circumstances DATE to have execution prohibited , suspended or limited . The nature of interim injunction proceedings and the reticence to be observed by the judge in interim injunction proceedings when examining the manner in which an irrevocable decision of the criminal court judge has come about , mean that there is scope for granting such a claim only when it is beyond reasonable doubt that the ruling of ORG [ of Human Rights ] indeed requires that the above - mentioned conclusion be reached . \u201d", "In this case , ORG accepted ORG finding against the plaintiff in view of the fact that , when the impugned ruling was given on DATE , the ORG had not yet delivered its judgment in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE an amendment to LAW \u201c the ORG \u201d ) entered into force , governing possible means of obtaining revision ( herziening ) of final judgments .

In its judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON and Others v. the GPE ( Reports CARDINAL ) , the ORG found a violation of the LAW in that the criminal proceedings against the CARDINAL applicants had not been conducted in compliance with the requirements of LAW CARDINAL and CARDINAL ( d ) of the LAW . In its judgment it awarded each of the applicants an amount for costs and expenses and adjourned its examination of the ORG claim for non - pecuniary damage , considering that that part of the applicants\u2019 claim for just satisfaction was not ready for decision .", "CARDINAL .

In its judgment of DATE , following appeal proceedings taken by GPE , ORG quashed the impugned judgment given on DATE by ORG , and for the time spent in detention ( pre - trial and following conviction ) awarded compensation for non - pecuniary damage to the first plaintiff in the amount of ORG , less ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL already awarded by ORG .

The plaintiff has an urgent interest in his claim . The civil court judge DATE in this case the judge responsible for provisional measures in summary injunction proceedings \u2013 is empowered to take cognisance [ of the case ] , as the plaintiff claims that the ORG has acted unlawfully toward him by , inter alia , continuing his detention .", "CARDINAL . For the determination of the claim , it is a fact that the ORG has violated the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW ....", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of [ the LAW ] the applicant is entitled to reparation ( rechtsherstel ) in respect of this irreparable violation of the LAW . If need be , he can assert that right before the courts . The ORG is deemed to be acting unlawfully towards him if no suitable form of redress is provided .", "CARDINAL . The parties provide different answers to the question as to whether the measures requested by the plaintiff ... constitute a form of redress compatible with our legal system and , if so , whether those measures are suitable and appropriate in this case .", "CARDINAL . [ The judge responsible for provisional measures rejects ] the argument of the ORG that the closed system of legal remedies in criminal proceedings and the corresponding obligation of the ORG to execute rulings of the criminal courts , militate against this form of redress . In this system , no provision has been made to date for ( a suitable response to ) a violation of the kind at issue in the instant case . There have been no prior similar cases , and the possible occurrence of such cases has apparently not been taken into consideration in legislation or in existing case - law . In principle , early release or non - execution of a fine imposed may constitute a suitable form of redress for a violation of LAW kind in issue . This exception to the closed system of legal remedies in criminal cases is , to that extent , consistent with ORG approach in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has referred to the financial compensation awarded by the [ ORG ] and to the just satisfaction which , in the case of the applicant , lies in the fact that his complaint was declared well - founded [ by ORG ] . However , these CARDINAL elements do not form a suitable , and certainly not a sufficient , form of redress for the plaintiff . Consequently , they do not stand in the way of the claims being allowed . The plaintiff can request the domestic judge to order that additional measures be taken .", "CARDINAL . In reply to a question , the ORG stated that it was possible , in this respect , to consider measures such as the plaintiff \u2019s serving the remainder of his prison sentence under a less strict regime or the granting of a pardon in accordance with existing procedure . ... Again , these options do not form an obstacle to allowing the claims . The first option does not constitute sufficient redress in this case , while the option of a pardon corresponds to ( a request for ) a concession rather than the granting of a right , which is what is at issue here .", "CARDINAL . In these circumstances , the ORG should release the plaintiff DATE [ when the plaintiff becomes eligible for early release ] and waive the execution of the sentence in its entirety . Having regard to the nature of the violation of the ORG which is an established fact , a form of redress ( genoegdoening ) which relates to the applicant \u2019s liberty is more suitable , and in any event warrants greater priority than waiving payment of the part of the fine still outstanding .", "CARDINAL . No fixed standard exists for \u2018 offsetting\u2019 the remaining part of the plaintiff \u2019s prison sentence . There are no pertinent reference points on the subject in the existing legislation . This means that the amount of the compensation must be determined on an equitable basis ( naar billijkheid ) . The seriousness of the violation [ of the ORG ] justifies reduction of the sentence by a period equal to PERCENT of DATE for which the applicant was subjected to the regime in the ORG ... This amounts to a reduction of DATE ( round figure ) ...", "CARDINAL . On the basis of this solution , the plaintiff \u2019s claim should be rejected . Indeed , the plaintiff has no urgent interest in a provisional measure which will only take effect after DATE [ when the applicant has served his mitigated sentence ] ... It is assumed that the ORG ( the Minister of ORG ) will execute this ruling and release the plaintiff at a time that can be determined precisely on the basis of the standard set out here . If need be , the plaintiff can apply again in due course to the judge responsible for provisional measures .", "CARDINAL . Each of the parties can in fact be deemed to have been ruled against . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Both parties agreed to lodge a direct \u201c leapfrog \u201d appeal on points of law ( sprongcassatie ) with ORG , which dismissed both appeals on DATE . Although it agreed with ORG that the judge responsible for provisional measures had incorrectly assumed that LAW gave Mr Lors\u00e9 an ( independent ) right to redress which , if need be , could be asserted before the domestic judge , it held that this could not lead to the setting - aside of the judgment as , pursuant to the LAW , the ORG was obliged to provide redress . However , relying on the ORG \u2019s reasoning in the cases of PERSON and Others v. GPE ( ( LAW ) , judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and PERSON and ORG v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG and CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVIII ) , ORG considered that , although the ORG was in principle free to determine the manner in which redress was to be provided , that freedom did not mean that the domestic judge was unable to take a decision on that point , but simply that a suitable form of redress was to be sought within the domestic legal order . As ORG had acted unlawfully towards PERSON in so far as his rights under LAW had been violated , as found by the ORG , PERSON was entitled to claim compensation from the ORG , which would be acting unlawfully if it failed to provide a suitable form of redress . ORG accepted that such compensation could be granted in a manner other than the payment of a sum of money . In cases such as the present one , where the violation found concerned the manner of execution of a custodial sentence , it could take the form of cessation of the execution of the sentence . ORG found that the order of the judge responsible for provisional measures to cease execution of the prison sentence should be regarded as a suitable form of compensation in kind in the case of PERSON . As regards the argument raised by the ORG that the closed system of legal remedies and the corresponding obligation for the ORG to execute rulings of the criminal courts precluded the form of redress claimed by PERSON , ORG \u2013 while acknowledging that there was a difference between a situation in which the violation found concerned a domestic criminal conviction itself or the proceedings having led to that conviction [ as in the case of PERSON and Others ] and a situation in which the violation found was unrelated to such a conviction or proceedings [ as in the case of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE in the case of PERSON the GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , in which the applicant complained that his telephone conversations with PERSON had been recorded by the latter with equipment provided by the police with a view to their use as prosecution evidence against him , the ORG found a violation of LAW on the ground that the conversations in question had not been recorded \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d . As the applicant had declined to submit any claims for compensation in respect of pecuniary or nonpecuniary damage , stating that he intended instead to pursue such claims before the domestic courts , the ORG made no award for just satisfaction under those headings . In so far as the applicant claimed compensation for legal costs and expenses incurred by him in the domestic proceedings , the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that the criminal proceedings against him had resulted entirely from the violation it had found in his case , taking the view that those proceedings had in fact been occasioned by a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing on the applicant \u2019s part , and recalling that it had already at the admissibility stage rejected the applicant \u2019s complaints touching on the use made of the evidence obtained as a result of the violation found .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date and on the basis of the ORG \u2019s findings in its judgment of DATE , the applicant PERSON filed a request with ORG for revision of the final domestic judgment of DATE , in which ORG \u2013 without the recorded telephone conversations having been relied on in evidence \u2013 had convicted him of having sexually assaulted PERSON and another woman and had sentenced him to a suspended term of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and payment of a fine of NLG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) , to be replaced by CARDINAL days\u2019 detention in the event of non - payment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG accepted the request for revision and , in accordance with LAW ORG , determined the matter itself . It held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... the ORG has the obligation to provide redress if ORG has found a violation of a LAW provision . Such redress can be provided entirely or in part within the framework of the revision procedure , amended for this purpose .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the violation of LAW found by ORG , ORG is of the opinion that revision is necessary for the purposes of redress . To that extent , the request is well - founded . ... The request is aimed primarily at having ORG declare the prosecution inadmissible , while quashing the judgment in respect of which revision is sought .", "CARDINAL . ORG can not accede to this request since it is only in exceptional cases that a prosecution may be declared inadmissible , and the instant case can not be considered as such . In this respect the petitioner relies mistakenly on [ ORG judgment of DATE ; NL DATE , no . CARDINAL ] . In that case ORG held that , in certain circumstances , a serious breach of the principles of proper proceedings may lead to the prosecution being declared inadmissible if , as a result of that breach , deliberately or owing to gross negligence of the defendant \u2019s interests , the defendant \u2019s right to a fair hearing has been violated . As ORG , in its decision on admissibility [ M.M .. v. the GPE ( dec . ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ] of CARDINAL DATE , preceding its judgment of DATE , declared inadmissible the [ applicant \u2019s ] complaint under LAW as being manifestly ill - founded , it can not be said that there has been a serious breach of the principles of proper proceedings as a result of which , deliberately or owing to gross negligence of the [ applicant \u2019s ] interests , his right to a fair hearing has been violated .", "CARDINAL . Taking into account that , in the proceedings leading to the judgment of which revision is sought , there was no breach of LAW and that the contents of the recorded telephone conversations were not used in evidence , there is no ground for referring the case to ORG under LAW , as requested by the petitioner in the alternative .", "CARDINAL . In the light of the importance of the provision violation and the nature and seriousness of the irreparable defects in the preliminary criminal investigation , as found by ORG , ORG will , after accepting the [ revision ] request , determine the matter itself , in accordance with LAW ORG , and reduce the fine imposed by ORG in the following manner . \u201d", "ORG quashed the original judgment of ORG in part , that is , in respect only of the amount of the fine imposed and the duration of the alternative detention period , reducing the fine by PERCENT to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the duration of the alternative detention to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The findings of ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) as regards the ORG , as set out in its Report on the visit to the GPE from DATE , together with ORG response to these findings , are set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of PERSON ( cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG visited the GPE again from CARDINAL to DATE and , in the course of this visit , carried out a follow - up visit to the ORG . Its findings were the following ( ORG to ORG on the visits carried out to GPE and to GPE by ORG for ORG Treatment or Punishment ( ORG ) in DATE , ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL , excerpts ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . At the time of the DATE visit , ORG ( ORG ) at the FAC was being renovated , and the inmates allocated to it were being held in FAC ( ( GPE ) building nearby ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) .", "In addition to paying a brief visit to the facilities undergoing renovation , the ORG \u2019s delegation examined the regime currently being applied , and devoted attention to the procedures governing placement and extension of placement in ORG . In the course of the visit , interviews were held with all CARDINAL inmates , the establishment \u2019s management and staff , as well as representatives of ORG .", "...", "c. regime", "CARDINAL . Following its first visit to the ORG , the ORG expressed considerable concern about the regime applied within the institution . It recommended that the regime be revised , in particular as regards certain of its features : the group system ( if not discarded , to at least be relaxed and inmates to be allowed more out - of - cell time and a broader range of activities ) ; searching policies ( to be reviewed in order to ensure that they are strictly necessary from a security standpoint ) ; and visiting arrangements ( to be reviewed , the objective being to have visits take place under more open conditions ) ( cf . paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL of ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) .", "However , in their response ( dated DATE ) to the ORG \u2019s visit report , the NORP authorities defended point by point the different aspects of the regime being applied in the ORG ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the DATE visit , the Director of the FAC and the Acting Director of the ORG informed the ORG \u2019s delegation that a limited number of modifications to the regime and its implementation had taken place . For instance , steps were being taken to increase staff / inmate communication through a training programme known as \u201c Safety at the door \u201d , as well as by the previously - mentioned adaptations of the exercise yards . Further , a slight expansion of the types of activities offered had made it possible for inmates to practice playing musical instruments in their cells . Another positive development was that the special \u201c handcuffs regime \u201d ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) had not been applied in respect of any inmate since DATE .", "However , despite these welcome developments , the regime in the unit was essentially the same as in DATE , and the prison \u2019s management acknowledged that there had been \u201c no change in most of the rules \u201d . Although the official allowance for activities was generous ( TIME ) , in practice , most inmates\u2019 out - of - cell time did not appear to have increased ( averaging TIME per day ) . The stringing of plastic curtain hooks on short rods , which was performed individually in the cells , continued to be the only work offered . It remained the case that body searches - including anal inspections - were performed on each prisoner at least once DATE , a process which was invariably perceived as humiliating . Conditions under which visits and sessions with non - custodial staff took place also continued to be very restrictive . Inmates\u2019 remarks to the delegation ( e.g. \u201c losing positivity \u201d , lacking \u201c future feelings \u201d , \u201c beginning to hate people from the heart \u201d , and/or having to cope by being \u201c mentally separate \u201d ) frequently echoed those made in DATE .", "To sum up , inmates held in the ORG remained subject to a very impoverished regime .", "CARDINAL . In an environment which is potentially hazardous to the mental health of prisoners , it is of critical importance to provide a varied programme of appropriate stimulating activities ( including education , sport , work of vocational value , etc . ) . The ORG calls upon the NORP authorities to make further efforts with a view to increasing out - of - cell time , allowing for more human contact , expanding the range of activities ( work and education ) , and alleviating searching measures for prisoners held in the ORG . Less constrained contact should be encouraged with all staff .", "Following a recommendation made by the ORG in its previous periodic visit report ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) , the NORP authorities commissioned ORG to carry out an independent study of the psychological state of current and former inmates of the ORG . A preliminary study completed on DATE concluded that \u201c an empirical examination of the possible effects of a maximum security regime on the mental conditions of prisoners is feasible . \u201d The NORP authorities have indicated that such an empirical examination has in fact commenced and would be completed by DATE . The ORG trusts that it will receive the results of the study in due course .", "CARDINAL point raised by the preliminary study may be noted , i.e that the lack of influence of detainees on the severity of the regime being applied to them constitutes a \u201c contradiction in the policy \u201d of the ORG .

Less constrained contact should be encouraged with all staff ( paragraph CARDINAL )", "Response : Prisoners in the ORG spend a total of TIME a week on out - of - cell activities , and these activities are no less varied than in other prisons . They include exercise , visits , sport , work , education and recreation . Not all prisoners take part in all activities . What they do depends partly on interest and ability . The work in the ORG is simple . However , it is difficult to provide work that is more varied and yet meets security requirements . In principle , work in the ORG is done jointly . The Government refutes the claim that , on average , prisoners participate in activities for no more than between TIME a day . In fact they spend an average of TIME a day in out - of - cell activities .", "The Government agrees that prisoners and staff should have more contact . Fenced - off walkways for staff have now been erected in the exercise yards . They provide more opportunities for informal contact and interaction between prisoners and staff .", "The number of searches has been sharply reduced since the opening of the ORG . Besides a DATE search during cell checks , searches are carried out after visits to areas containing potentially dangerous objects , such as the hairdresser \u2019s or the doctor \u2019s or dentist \u2019s surgery , and after contact with the outside world , such as visits . Searches are still necessary from the point of view of security . The Government would point out that searches are also conducted in ordinary prisons .", "On DATE , in CARDINAL separate cases against the GPE , ORG ruled that : \u201c the combination of routine strip - searching with the other stringent security measures in the ORG amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of LAW .
