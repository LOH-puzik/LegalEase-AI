Sale negotiations began in DATE and apparently led , in DATE , to an initial contract . DATE , Mrs. PERSON paid to the vendors the greater part of the agreed price . However , the definitive contract was not drawn up until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

The contract in question was therefore contrary to social and economic interests within the meaning of the above - mentioned LAW .", "The applicant received a copy of the appeal but did not file any observations in reply .", "CARDINAL . The Government Office of the ORG was organised in a number of \" groups \" and each group comprised several \" divisions \" . In the present case , the Transactions Officer was the director of group III ; his secretariat was provided by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL divisions in that group , namely division III b. CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , ORG at ORG of the Tyrol held a hearing . ORG sat in camera but the parties , namely ORG and Mrs. PERSON , were present . The latter appeared in person , without the assistance of a lawyer .", "In accordance with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ORG was composed as follows : the elected mayor of a municipality in the GPE , who was a farmer experienced in real estate matters , as chairman ; a judge of ORG ; a civil servant from division III b. DATE of the CARDINAL divisions in group III - of ORG , as rapporteur ; the head of group III d ; the director of ORG , being the head of group III f ; a farmer ; and a lawyer .", "The secretariat was provided by division III b. CARDINAL , to which the rapporteur belonged .", "CARDINAL . ORG According to TIME of the hearing , the rapporteur presented the facts and read out the expert opinions and observations received during the course of the investigation ; the latter concerned , inter alia , the percentage of the parcels of land in GPE which was in foreign hands . The Transactions Officer then requested the ORG to uphold his appeal on the ground that as there was already a risk of foreign domination in GPE , the acquisition of the land in question would be contrary to social and political interests .", "The applicant stated that she had signed the initial contract ( Erstvertrag ) , which could not then be found , on DATE . As early as DATE , she had reached an agreement to purchase ORG and had received assurances that all would go well . Since that time , she had come to GPE several times each year to settle the matter . Her husband was living with the family in GPE , where he worked , but would be retiring shortly . She declared that she herself was prepared to apply for NORP nationality . Their permit to reside in GPE was temporary and she did not wish to return to GPE . She added that she had already made a first payment of MONEY . In conclusion , she requested that the contract be approved .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , that is DATE , ORG upheld the appeal : referring to the above - mentioned section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW , it refused to approve the transfer of title . Its decision ( PERSON ) was dated DATE .", "The ORG noted firstly that according to a statement from the municipality of GPE , which had not been challenged at the hearing , there were CARDINAL foreign landowners in GPE , owning QUANTITY of land . There were CARDINAL inhabitants and CARDINAL families in the locality , though not all of them were landowners . The proportion of non - NORP owners already exceeded CARDINAL per cent and the extent of their holdings revealed a tendency towards foreign domination .", "The ORG then recalled that for DATE past it had been refusing to approve the transfer of land in GPE to foreigners since it had concluded that there was a risk of foreign domination in the area . It had to take account , inter alia , of the effects of its decision on third parties . According to the ORG , experience showed that the approval of a contract between a landowner and a foreigner led to an influx of other foreigners who also wished to buy land in the locality . This caused prices to rise substantially , making it very difficult , if not impossible , for the indigenous population to find housing for themselves . For these reasons and in view of the scarcity of building plots in the GPE , very strict legal ( gesetzlich ) control had to be exercised : sales and purchases could normally be approved only if they contributed to the establishment or maintenance of an effective ( leistungsf\u00e4hig ) agricultural population or if they served to satisfy domestic land needs ( inl\u00e4ndischer PERSON ) for any kind of public or social purposes .", "However , Mrs. PERSON was intending to use the land in question - at least for some time - for the construction of a holiday residence . Such an objective could easily be satisfied by the local hotel trade which , furthermore , was losing potential customers as a result of the construction of villas by foreigners . The acquisition contemplated was therefore prejudicial to economic and social interests and thus fell foul of , in particular , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW .", "Lastly , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that she had already concluded a contract in DATE , that is at a time when NORP citizens were treated on an equal footing with NORP by virtue of a bilateral treaty dating from DATE . The ORG emphasised firstly that it had to base itself on the factual and legal situation obtaining at the time when the decision had to be taken . In its view , the DATE treaty had not established any equality between citizens of GPE in the area concerned . In the case in question , the transfer of ownership contemplated fell under LAW para . CARDINAL , as interpreted by ORG in a DATE memorandum which stated that the general regulations with regard to foreigners were applicable . Even if this interpretation had not been known at the time when the initial contract had allegedly been concluded ( CARDINAL DATE , see paragraph CARDINAL above ) - though this was not the case , since the above - mentioned memorandum dated from DATE - , Mrs. PERSON could not claim that she had acted in good faith : she was obliged under LAW to seek approval of the contract within DATE and she alone bore the responsibility for not having done so .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE , the applicant appealed to ORG ) against the decision of ORG . She claimed that her right to inviolability of property and her right to a decision by the legally competent court ( gesetzlicher Richter ) had been infringed and relied on LAW , Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ( Bundes - Verfassungsgesetz ) and LAW .", "As concerns the first complaint , Mrs. PERSON alleged that ORG had applied section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW in a misconceived ( denkunm\u00f6glich ) manner by adopting an illogical approach ; amongst other things , it had concluded that there was a danger of foreign domination in GPE without being in possession of detailed documentation , without defining the risk in question and without enquiring into the actual position in GPE regarding real property ownership .", "She further contended that ORG was not an \" independent tribunal \" within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention .", "On these grounds , she requested ORG to annul the decision under appeal or , in the alternative , to refer the case to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) .", "Mrs. PERSON supplemented her grounds of appeal on DATE . She asserted that her lawyer had not been able to consult TIME deliberations . She had , in fact , learnt that the ORG had not given its ruling on DATE , immediately after the closure of the hearing . She inferred from this that the decision complained of had not been taken by the legally competent court .", "She requested ORG to provide her lawyer with an opportunity of reading the above - mentioned TIME .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE ( ORG und ORG , DATE , vol . CARDINAL , no . CARDINAL ) .", "It took the view that ORG was indeed a \" tribunal \" within the meaning of Article CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL ) of the Convention . It gave decisions which the executive could neither annul nor vary . As regards its members - who included a judge - , they had a degree of independence equal to that of judges . They were not bound by any instructions in the exercise of their functions and they could not be removed during their DATE term of office , except for reasons which would have precluded their appointment or if they were permanently prevented from carrying out their duties . ORG accordingly held that LAW ) had not been violated .", "The applicant \u2019s other ground of appeal was also rejected . Recalling that it had already held in another case , in DATE , that it was not misconceived to conclude that there was a danger of foreign domination in GPE , ORG stated that it saw no reason to change its opinion in the instant case . As regards the facts noted by ORG , they had not been the subject of any dispute during the administrative proceedings .", "ORG sat in camera and gave judgment without holding a hearing .", "CARDINAL . ORG Even before the above - mentioned judgment had been delivered , the plot in question was sold to an NORP who , according to the Government , turned it back into grazing - land . ORG had taken the view that it could examine the new contract , provided that its decision was held in abeyance pending the outcome of ORG proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG The Government stated that during DATE or so ORG had not approved any acquisition of real property in GPE by a foreigner . They supplied a list of CARDINAL refusals in the period DATE and DATE ; according to the applicant , the list was insufficiently detailed to be conclusive .", "CARDINAL . ORG Under LAW , as interpreted by ORG , the regulation of real property transactions is a matter coming within the jurisdiction of the L\u00e4nder . Most of the ORG have enacted legislation whereby all contracts relating to agricultural or forestry land and also , in some cases , real property transactions with foreigners have to be approved by special authorities .", "CARDINAL . ORG In the LOC ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , section CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL/CARDINAL LAW obliges the purchaser to seek such approval within DATE of the conclusion of the contract . No entry can be made in the land register until the transaction has been approved by the competent authority ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .
