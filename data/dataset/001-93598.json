On DATE ORG upheld the appeal and set aside the ORG \u2019s decision . It ordered a retrial of the case . ORG found that the LAW had erred in its assessment of the evidence that had been put before it . In this connection , it noted that the LOC had failed to take into account the average rental rate of the shops in the area and relevant factors such as the age , condition and facilities of those shops when assessing the rental value of the shop in question . Secondly , it found substantial errors in the valuation made by the ORG \u2019s expert which included the failure to make the necessary adjustments when comparing different properties and to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the properties compared . The court considered that the valuation given by the ORG \u2019s expert had been ill - founded and unreliable and that therefore the ORG should not have relied on it . Similarly , the court found that the valuation of the respondents\u2019 expert ( the appellants at the appeal stage ) had been unsound . In this connection , it noted that this valuation had defined the area in question very narrowly and as a result had not taken into account other nearby shops which should have been considered for comparison purposes . ORG therefore concluded that overall no evidence had been put forward which would enable the determination of a fair rent in respect of the ORG shop .", "CARDINAL .

During the retrial proceedings , by letter dated DATE , the applicants\u2019 lawyer requested the Attorney - General to consider whether it would be possible for the State to pay the costs of the proceedings in view of the fact that the errors for which the case was sent back for retrial had not been committed by the applicants .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the Attorney - General replied that this was not possible since the proceedings in question concerned a trial between private parties and , further , that it was for the courts to take into account all relevant circumstances when determining the matter of costs .", "CARDINAL .
