Each count related to a photograph in an album which had been part of a consignment from GPE addressed to the applicant in GPE . The applicant had signed a form declaring that he was not bringing in prohibited material in that way . Each photograph was of a young naked child , engaging in normal outdoor activity such as playing on a beach . The questions put to the jury in respect of each count were :", "\u201c Considering each count separately , has the prosecution made you sure that :", "CARDINAL . On DATE the defendant knowingly brought into this country the photograph of the child that is the subject of the count ?", "CARDINAL . The child is DATE ?", "CARDINAL . The photograph is indecent ?", "[ A photograph is indecent if in your judgment in offends against recognised standards of propriety ]", "CARDINAL . The defendant deliberately failed to disclose his possession of the photograph because he believed that it was or might be indecent ?", "If the answers to all CARDINAL questions are YES , the defendant is GUILTY . If the answer to any of the above questions is NO , the defendant is NOT GUILTY . \u201d", "The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment on DATE . On DATE a single judge granted leave to appeal against sentence as it was arguable that the sentence was too long . Leave to appeal against conviction was refused , the judge considering that the trial judge 's direction to the jury had been entirely satisfactory , and that the offence was sufficiently precisely defined so as to comply with LAW . In this latter respect he referred to PERSON and Others v. GPE ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) and the domestic decision of NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] EWCA Crim CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant 's appeal against sentence was allowed by ORG on DATE . No alternative sentence was passed , although the applicant was still required to register as a sex offender under LAW DATE .", "A renewed application for leave to appeal against conviction was dismissed by ORG on DATE . ORG noted that :", "\u201c whereas counsel 's advice and grounds of appeal are set out in CARDINAL paragraphs over CARDINAL pages , those arguments put forward by the applicant himself extend to CARDINAL paragraphs over CARDINAL pages . He is a dedicated enthusiastic and well - researched apologist for what he sees as innocent and non - exploitative pleasure in viewing photographs of juvenile nakedness . He raises many philosophical , social and artistic arguments about that which we regard as irrelevant to the CARDINAL legal questions for us :", "( CARDINAL ) Was the conduct of the trial and the summing up correct ?", "( CARDINAL ) Are the convictions safe ? \u201d", "ORG dealt with the various grounds of appeal as follows :", "- ORG did not accept that the concept of \u201c indecent \u201d material was too vague to allow a citizen to conduct himself in knowledge of what the law was . It recalled that the test of whether an article was indecent was an objective one , and that the quality of indecency was to be determined by looking at the article alleged to be indecent , and nothing else . To require absolute certainty in advance as to whether an article was or was not indecent would set an impossible task which could only be met in the rare case in which a second set of proceedings was brought in respect of specific material already found to have been indecent .", "- As to the ground of appeal that the judge was alleged to have dealt wrongly with the \u201c context \u201d of the photographs in that he had suggested that that was relevant to whether the photographs were indecent , and that he misdirected the jury that visibility of genitalia was a relevant consideration in determining whether the material was indecent , ORG referred to the questions which the judge had put to the jury , in which he had stated that a photograph was indecent if it offended \u201c against recognized standards of propriety \u201d . As to context , the trial judge had said :", "\u201c ... here what you should do is to ignore context . Forget about context . Just look at the photographs of these young children , ignoring any context , and ask yourselves the question : Are they decent or indecent ? The real question is ... : Are we sure they are indecent ? \u201d", "ORG added that the extent of the display of genitalia was a factor which one could expect to be considered by the jury , and the judge 's reference to it was not surprising .", "- As to the ground of appeal that in using the CARDINAL questions put to the jury , the judge had reduced the statutory requirement of \u201c knowingly \u201d being concerned in importation to a belief that the photograph was or may have been indecent , ORG considered that the statutory requirement of \u201c knowledge \u201d was met by the fourth question .", "- As to the ground of appeal that the applicant had been denied the right to silence because the judge had instructed the jury that they could draw adverse inferences from the fact that applicant had not given evidence , ORG noted that the judge 's direction under LAW of ORG LAW DATE had been absolutely orthodox . The defence had asked the judge to rule in advance that if the applicant gave evidence he could not be cross - examined about a number of matters , in particular matters which would reveal his general attitude to the \u201c philosophical , social and artistic arguments \u201d referred to above , and which could colour the jury 's determination of the fourth question . To this , ORG replied that the judge was wise to refuse to make any such ruling , as if he had done so , he would have given carte blanche to the defence \u201c to give the sort of proselytising combative assertions which we find in the grounds of appeal through the defendant 's evidence \u201d", "According to Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the ORG and Excise Management Act :", "\" Without prejudice to any other provision of the Customs and Excise Acts DATE , if any person is , in relation to any goods , in any way knowingly concerned in any fraudulent evasion or attempt at evasion \u2013", "...", "( b ) of any prohibition or restriction for the time being in force with respect to the goods under or by virtue of any enactment ;", "...", "he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and may be arrested . \"", "As ORG found in the case of PERSON ( [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c This provision extends to all cases involving the evasion or attempted evasion of a prohibition or restriction . It requires proof by the prosecutor of CARDINAL things . First he must prove that the goods in question were the subject of a prohibition or restriction under or by virtue of any enactment which was in force at the time of the evasion or attempt at evasion . This is an essential element in any prosecution , but its proof in many cases is likely to be a formality . In the present case the fact that the video cassettes contained indecent photographs of children , which is prohibited indecent material , was agreed between the defendant and the prosecutor . The second thing which the prosecutor must prove is that the defendant was knowingly concerned in a fraudulent evasion or attempt at evasion of the prohibition or restriction . \u201d", "A number of provisions create prohibitions on indecent photographs , including LAW DATE ( obscene publications ) , LAW DATE ( indecent photographs of a child under the age of CARDINAL ) and LAW of LAW CARDINAL ( indecent photographs ) .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG LAW DATE provides , so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where this subsection applies , the court shall , at the conclusion of the evidence for the prosecution , satisfy itself ( in the case of proceedings on indictment , in the presence of the jury ) that the accused is aware that the stage has been reached at which evidence can be given for the defence and that he can , if he wishes , give evidence and that , if he chooses not to give evidence , or having been sworn , without good cause refuses to answer any question , it will be permissible for the court or jury to draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to give evidence or his refusal , without good cause , to answer any question .", "( CARDINAL ) Where this subsection applies , the court or jury , in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged , may draw such inferences as appear proper from the failure of the accused to give evidence or his refusal , without good cause , to answer any question . \u201d", "The applicant complained under LAW that domestic law is not sufficiently precise to enable an individual to know in advance whether his conduct is criminal .", "He also complained under LAW that the trial was unfair for the same grounds as made in his appeal against conviction , that his appeal was refused in an ill - considered way , in particular that his grounds of appeal entitled \u201c misdirection on standard of proof \u201d and \u201c infringement of right to silence \u201d were not properly dealt with ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
