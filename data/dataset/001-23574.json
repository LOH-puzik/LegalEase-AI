SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Matti Pellonp\u00e4\u00e4", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON and PERSON are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE respectively . They live in GPE , GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mrs Siv PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "By ORG ( L\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten i PERSON ) judgment of DATE , R was taken into public care pursuant to the Act with Special Provisions on ORG ( lagen med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga , CARDINAL - hereafter LAW ) . A , ORG ( socialn\u00e4mnden ) and CARDINAL witnesses were heard , among the latter a consultant specialised in child and youth psychiatry . The court found it established that A was very suspicious and in conflict with many persons ; that A involved R in her conflicts ; that A did not set any boundaries to R ; that consequently R \u2019s behaviour had become socially unacceptable ; that there was a palpable risk of impairment of the health and development of R due to lack of proper care ; that A had failed to provide proper care ; and that A refused to receive assistance from the social authorities .", "On appeal , the judgment was confirmed by ORG ( ORG ) on DATE . ORG ( Regeringsr\u00e4tten ) refused leave to appeal on DATE .", "On DATE both applicants were placed at a care centre called GPE , specialising in treating and taking care of mothers and their children . On DATE A was discharged from the centre , on demand of the staff , who found her behaviour obstructive . On CARDINAL DATE ORG decided to place R with a foster family . Moreover , the ORG exceptionally ordered a temporary prohibition on contact between A and R and the concealment of the foster family \u2019s identity . On appeal to ORG , A requested that the orders to take R into public care and to place her with a foster family be revoked . She consented to care continuing on a voluntarily basis entailing placement of both of them at a centre . Also , she requested that the prohibition on contact between her and R be revoked .", "A stated among other things that she would be more motivated to undergo treatment if the care continued on a voluntarily basis . She admitted having had conflicts at ORG but found that this could be imputed mainly to her disagreements with the superintendent on therapy issues . The disputes that she had had with other persons there were in her opinion irrelevant . Also , recently she had commenced seeing a psychologist .", "ORG , a social worker and the superintendent of GPE , all stated among other things that A lacked insight in R \u2019s need for care ; that A exhibited an increasingly aggressive , harassing and even hateful behaviour towards others , which had resulted in GPE discharging her ; that A constantly involved R in her conflicts to the detriment of R \u2019s mental health ; and that in their opinion the foster family would not be able to stand the strain that contact with A unavoidably would entail .", "A teacher , who had seen R and A DATE from DATE until DATE stated inter alia that in her opinion A and R \u2019s relationship was very close , and that they were very dependent on each other .", "A clergyman , who regularly had met A and R during their stay at ORG , stated inter alia that in the beginning they were very deviant , vociferous and restless . However , they had developed in a positive direction .", "By judgment of DATE ORG found against A , stating as follows :", "It is undisputed in the present case that [ R ] is in need of care . Firstly [ A ] has requested that the care order be revoked in order that care continues on a voluntarily basis by placing her and [ R ] at a treatment centre . The care centre GPE has stated that it does no longer wish to receive [ A ] . Accordingly , continuing care at GPE is excluded . No elements have been brought to light in the present case , which could indicate that treatment at another care centre would have any prospect of success .", "ORG has assessed that now only the placement of [ R ] with a foster family can provide the needed care . [ A ] can not accept such a placement . Against this background , there are no possibilities left to continue care on a voluntary basis ; consequently [ the court ] refuses to revoke the care order . ORG", "Secondly , A has claimed that the court revokes the decision to place [ R ] with a foster family . Such a claim entails that public care continues at ORG or at another appropriate treatment centre , placing mother and daughter together . As stated before , however , continuing care at ORG is no longer an option , and care at another treatment centre does not appear to be a realistic alternative . In these circumstances in ORG opinion the needed care can only be provided by a foster family . The court shares this view . Accordingly , it lacks reasons to revoke ORG decision as to the replacement [ of R ] .", "Finally , as to revocation of the prohibition on contact and the concealment of [ R \u2019s ] whereabouts it must be emphasised that the provisions authorising the imposition of such measures must be interpreted restrictively . Having regard to the statements submitted on [ A \u2019s ] intriguingly and aggressively behaviour , to the detriment of the intended and needed treatment of [ R ] , the court finds that ORG had justified cause for its decision temporarily to prohibit contact . Moreover , taking into account the information submitted as to the risk that [ A ] may go underground with her daughter , and to the foster family \u2019s prospects of handling contact with [ A ] , the court finds that ORG had justified cause for its decision to conceal [ R \u2019s ] whereabouts . It is definitely appreciated that [ A ] now is in touch with a psychologist , but it has not been established that she has made such progress , that could result in considerations of revoking the said restrictions . [ A \u2019s ] appeal is to be refused in its entirety .", "The judgment was upheld on appeal on DATE by ORG . Leave to appeal was refused on DATE by ORG .", "According to LAW the social authorities are under an obligation to review regularly whether public care is still necessary . By decision e.g. of DATE they upheld public care and the temporary prohibition on contact , which on appeal was confirmed by ORG on DATE .", "A appealed to ORG , before which A invoked CARDINAL statements of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , respectively , from a psychiatrist , ORG , who found it established that A did not suffer from any serious mental disorder , and that further examination was necessary in order that he assess whether she suffered from a slight mental illness or disorder . Also she invoked an opinion by a professor , BE , who gave his view on the social authorities\u2019 handling of the case .", "A was heard before the court and explained inter alia that allegedly the foster family was maltreating R. Her daughter had lost weight , and e.g. when in DATE A had found the foster family \u2019s residence , she had paid R a visit , during which she found out that R had bruises all over because she had been beaten up by the foster parent \u2019s CARDINAL boys .", "ORG invoked inter alia a psychiatric statement of DATE on R , in which a consultant , ORG , and a psychiatrist , ORG , stated that R \u2019s mental state had improved ; that she had expressed a wish to remain with the foster family ; and that she objected to live with her mother . They found that R had been gravely deviant during several different periods in her upbringing , and they recommended that the placement with the foster family be prolonged in order that R \u2019s commencing positive development continued . Moreover , they recommended that access be established between mother and daughter , however , in a foreseeable , safe , and clear setting .", "As regards A , ORG invoked a statement procured by a psychologist , TIME , and a consultant ORG , who found that A did not exhibit any clear signs of a serious mental illness , rather her difficulties concerned a personality disorder , most likely of a paranoid sort .", "Other statements on A were submitted , among others by CARDINAL psychiatrists , IP and GPE .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to revoke the care order on the following grounds :", "\u201c ... Having regard to the statement by ORG , and several psychiatrists , ORG , and ORG , the court finds that [ A ] does have weaknesses ; some form of personality disorder , which influences her behaviour towards other people and her ability to provide [ R ] with a favourable development . [ A ] lacks insight in her own need for help , and as long as she does not appear at summoned and necessary examinations , and commence treatment , she can not appropriately take responsibility for the care of [ R ] . The statements submitted by ORG and BE do not alter this assessment . [ R ] has a need for special care , which [ A ] can not [ presently ] provide her \u201d", "However , ORG revoked the prohibition on contact and ordered that access be initiated and progressively increased , commencing as from DATE with TIME every third DATE . It further noted that according to LAW of LAW it is at the social authorities\u2019 discretion to decide where access is going to take place , the exact time , and who are to be present . A \u2019s request for leave to appeal against the judgment was refused by ORG on DATE .", "The social authorities decided that access should take place in the foster family \u2019s home and be subject to surveillance . On DATE the social authorities increased A \u2019s access to TIME every third DATE . The change of DATE was explained by lack of staff resources and the fact that the social authority office was closed during DATE . A brought this decision before ORG , and claimed that the court intervened by an interim measure . The court refused this on DATE . A appealed to ORG , which by decision of CARDINAL DATE found for A and maintained that access take place on DATE as set out in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE .", "Moreover , A initiated proceedings before ORG claiming inter alia access DATE from DATE at a place a her discretion and without any surveillance . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted access TIME every second DATE . The exact time , place and whom to be present remained at the social authorities\u2019 discretion . The judgment was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE . Leave to appeal was refused by ORG on DATE .", "In the period DATE , A initiated CARDINAL sets of various court proceedings claiming e.g. the care order revoked , change of foster family , access increased , and change as to the time and place of access .", "It emerges from a judgment of DATE by ORG that access had functioned well since DATE ; that A had access TIME every second DATE under surveillance ; and that it took place by turns at the foster family \u2019s home in LOC and at A \u2019s home in FAC . Also , in accordance with a recommendation from a psychiatrist , the social authorities had made several attempts to unite the foster family and A , but this had failed due to A \u2019s resistance . As to CARDINAL of A \u2019s claim , that access took place DATE from DATE until DATE TIME , and during DATE , she submitted among other things that PERSON was not accessible by public transportation . The court found against her on all points , and stated inter alia that it was not for the court to decide on her transport . On appeal , A abstained from submitting that PERSON was not accessible by public transportation . By judgment of DATE ORG increased access to TIME every second DATE . On DATE the applicant A requested that ORG grant her leave to appeal against the judgment . It appears that leave to appeal was refused .", "The decisions disputed in the present case were taken under LAW containing Special Provisions on ORG DATE ( lagen CARDINAL:CARDINAL med s\u00e4rskilda best\u00e4mmelser om v\u00e5rd av unga \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) .", "Compulsory public care may be ordered under LAW ( Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) and is to be provided , inter alia , if there is a clear risk of impairment of the health or development of a person DATE due to illtreatment , improper exploitation , lack of care or any other condition in the home ( LAW ) .", "ORG may decide to take a child into care immediately on a provisional basis if later court proceedings concerning compulsory care can not be awaited on account of the risk to the child \u2019s health or development or of the risk that the continuing examination will be obstructed ( Section CARDINAL ) .
