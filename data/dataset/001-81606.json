The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who had several convictions and had served a number of prison terms , was charged with the theft of construction material from a warehouse . It was alleged that he had been one of the members of a group that had committed thefts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appear when summoned for questioning and on CARDINAL DATE he was arrested and remanded in custody , by order of an investigator or a prosecutor . He remained in detention throughout the investigation proceedings and the trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant . He was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Upon the prosecutor 's appeal , the acquittal was upheld by ORG on DATE . ORG found , inter alia , that at the outset there had been clearly insufficient proof of the applicant 's involvement in the thefts . In particular , a police officer had testified that the only reason for suspecting the applicant had been the presence of his name on an internal police list of nicknames as the person behind the nickname \u201c PERSON \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant brought an action against ORG , seeking damages in respect of his pre - trial detention . He relied on LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant sought non - pecuniary damages for the suffering caused by his pre - trial detention , which had lasted DATE , DATE and DATE . In his initial claim he sought CARDINAL \u201c old \u201d NORP levs ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . In the course of the proceedings he increased the claim to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( the equivalent of approximately LAW ) , including interest , which in his view was to be calculated as from DATE , the date of his arrest .", "CARDINAL . The Sofia City Court delivered its judgment on DATE . It held that the ORG was liable to pay all damage suffered by the applicant as a result of his \u201c unlawful pre - trial detention \u201d and the \u201c unlawful bringing of charges \u201d against him .", "CARDINAL . The court stated , inter alia :", "\u201c [ ORG ] has not exercised the necessary supervision over the GPE prosecutors and the investigation authorities which , during a period of [ DATE ] , mounted an unjustified criminal prosecution against [ the applicant ] on charges of theft ... They remanded him in custody , imposing the harshest measure of judicial control , which resulted in [ the applicant ] spending DATE and DATE [ sic ] DATE in detention ... [The applicant ] has undoubtedly suffered non - pecuniary damage ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the amount , the court considered that the length of the detention should be taken into consideration and rejected as unproven the applicant 's contention that his health had deteriorated as a consequence of his detention . Deciding on an equitable basis , the court awarded to the applicant BGL CARDINAL in non - pecuniary damages ( the equivalent of approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) plus interest from the date on which the applicant had been acquitted with final effect , DATE . The court dismissed the remainder of the applicant 's claim for damages .", "CARDINAL . The court further applied section QUANTITY of ORG ( see paragraphs DATE below ) and ordered the applicant to pay BGL CARDINAL ( the equivalent of approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in court fees . That amount represented PERCENT of the dismissed part of the applicant 's claims .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . He averred , inter alia , that the sum awarded in damages was too low and that it was unlawful to order him to pay court fees in an amount almost equal to the compensation award .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed the appeal . As regards the court fees , it stated that section QUANTITY of ORG was unambiguous and required the payment of court fees proportionately to the dismissed part of the claim . In the applicant 's case , he had indicated an excessive amount in his claim and had thus himself brought about the situation complained of .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a cassation appeal to ORG which was dismissed by judgment of DATE . As regards the costs , ORG reiterated the position taken by ORG . It stated that although no initial payment of court fees was required when bringing proceedings under LAW , in accordance with its section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL the plaintiff was liable for fees in an amount proportionate to the dismissed part of the claim . By setting his claims at an excessive level , the applicant himself had caused his liability for a substantial amount in court fees .", "CARDINAL . In civil proceedings in GPE , the general rule is that court fees are payable by the plaintiff in advance , upon the submission of the claim ( LAW and sections DATE of LAW ) . A court fee at the flat rate of PERCENT is payable in respect of pecuniary claims ( Fees Schedule CARDINAL to LAW ) . Where the plaintiff succeeds fully or partly , the defendant is ordered to pay him his costs , including court fees , proportionately to the successful part of the claim .", "CARDINAL . By section QUANTITY of ORG , in proceedings under LAW , no court fees or costs are payable by the plaintiff upon the submission of the claim . However , in circumstances where the claim is eventually wholly or partly dismissed , the court is to order the plaintiff to pay \u201c the court fees and costs due \u201d . The courts have interpreted the above provision as meaning that the plaintiff should pay court fees calculated as a pro rata percentage of the dismissed part of his claims . LAW provides for waiver of the fees in cases of indigence but concerns fees due upon the submission of the claim ( argument from ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As a result of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , where a court holds that a claim against the ORG is well - founded but excessive in quantum , it orders the ORG body concerned to pay damages to the plaintiff and at the same time orders the plaintiff to pay court fees to the ORG budget . Where the plaintiff indicated too high an amount in the claim form , the court fees may exceed the sum awarded in damages , the overall financial award being in favour of the ORG despite the finding that the plaintiff suffered damage which called for compensation under LAW ( see , for example , the following judgments of ORG : judgment no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL in case no . CARDINAL and judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL in case no . CARDINAL ) . There is no provision for judicial discretion and considerations of equity play no role in fixing the court fees ' amount . The court fees are fixed with reference to the amount indicated in the claim form , even if in the course of the proceedings the plaintiff makes a binding declaration waiving part of the claim ( ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG of DATE provides , as relevant :", "\u201c The ORG shall be liable for damage caused ... by the organs of ... the investigation , the prosecution , the courts ... for :", "unlawful pre - trial detention ... , if [ the detention order ] has been set aside for lack of lawful grounds ...", "unlawful bringing of criminal charges , if the person concerned has been acquitted or the proceedings discontinued on the following grounds : ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The general rule with regard to compensation claims lodged with an administrative court ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) is that a state fee of PERCENT of the amount claimed - but not CARDINAL kroons ( EUR CARDINAL ) and no more than in civil court proceedings concerning an equivalent amount \u2013 is charged when the claim is brought . In case non - pecuniary damages are claimed but the amount of the compensation is left to the discretion of the court , a simple fee of CARDINAL kroons ( EUR CARDINAL ) is due ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( Riigi poolt isikule alusetult vabaduse v\u00f5tmisega tekitatud kahju h\u00fcvitamise seadus ) , which concerns , inter alia , criminal proceedings that ended in acquittal or were discontinued , provides that the individual concerned can lodge a compensation request with ORG . No fees are involved . The amount of compensation is fixed by the LAW : it is DATE of the national DATE minimum salary ( enacted by the Government ) per day of detention . There is a presumption that this compensation covers non - pecuniary damage and loss of profit .", "CARDINAL . Compensation for pecuniary damage is regulated by LAW . In accordance with section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( which came into force on DATE ) , no fee is payable on a claim lodged with an administrative court for pecuniary damage caused by deprivation of liberty .", "CARDINAL . A claim for damages against the ORG can be brought under LAW . The court fee is approximately LAW , depending on the procedural actions undertaken by the court , regardless of the amount claimed .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL avenues of redress are open in such cases : an administrative claim to ORG in accordance with LAW out of ORG Funds to Detainees or Convicts Found to Have Been Innocent ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL as amended ) or a civil action for damages under the aforementioned LAW . In either case no court fees are due in cases of detainees or acquitted persons .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the ORG has been responsible for paying court costs in respect of criminal proceedings . LAW provides for a right to be compensated for all pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage sustained as a result of pre - trial detention in cases of acquittal or discontinuation of the proceedings . The claim is filed with the President of ORG in whose area the criminal case was decided . All fees and costs in these proceedings are borne by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Actions for damages for unlawful detention are adjudicated by the civil courts . Proceedings for damages against the ORG may also be instituted before the administrative tribunals , where the wrongful conduct was imputable to the public administration .", "CARDINAL . Court fees are in fixed amounts , irrespective of the sum claimed . The fees are different for first instance and appellate courts and modest in quantum : none of them exceeds LAW , according to the Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Actions for damages for unlawful detention are exempt from court fees ( Article CARDINAL ) of LAW ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In proceedings involving compensation claims against the ORG , the maximum fee is the equivalent of approximately ORG CARDINAL ( Article CARDINAL(m ) of the Act ) . As to costs and expenses , at the conclusion of the proceedings , the losing party has to reimburse the other party 's costs and expenses .", "CARDINAL . Claims for damages for unlawful detention are examined by ordinary courts in civil proceedings . Plaintiffs are exempt from court fees ( Article CARDINAL.CARDINAL , Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW ) and the court can not order the plaintiff to pay such fees at the end of the proceedings , even if the claim was partially or fully dismissed .", "CARDINAL . The successful party is entitled to the reimbursement of its costs . If an action succeeds only partly , the costs are divided proportionately between the parties ( Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . The defendant is required to pay into the federal budget a fee , from which the plaintiff is exempt , in proportion to the allowed part of the claim ( Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL possibilities for seeking damages for unlawful detention in GPE . The first is an administrative quasi - judicial procedure before the Chancellor of ORG , who can award compensation in fixed amounts . There is no fee for the claimant . The second possibility is a civil action for damages before the civil courts , for which a modest fixed court fee is payable regardless of the amount of the claim . Also , the claimant who loses the case must pay the other party 's costs", "CARDINAL . An action for damages against the state for unlawful detention is called a \u201c claim for false imprisonment \u201d which is treated as an action in trespass to the person ( i.e. a personal injury claim ) and is brought in the civil courts . Taking into account the money value of the claim and the complexity of the case , the court will allocate the case to CARDINAL of CARDINAL tracks : the \u201c small claims \u201d track , the \u201c fast - track \u201d or the \u201c multi - track . \u201d An action for false imprisonment is likely to be allocated to the multi - track .", "CARDINAL . There are several types of court fees that the claimant has to pay in proceedings for false imprisonment . The first one is the \u201c issue fee \u201d , charged for filing the claim . It depends on the amount of money claimed in accordance with a decreasing table . For example , the issue fee for claims of MONEY ( ORG ) is GBP CARDINAL , for claims MONEY it is GBP CARDINAL and for claims MONEY it is GBP CARDINAL . The higher issue fee , charged for claims of GBP CARDINAL and higher , is GBP CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . When a defence is filed , the court allocates the case to a track and orders the claimant pay an \u201c allocation fee \u201d in the amount of \u00a3 MONEY ( except for claims not exceeding GBP CARDINAL for which no allocation fee is due ) . Finally , for matters that go to trial , a \u201c trial fee \u201d is payable as follows : in multi - track cases \u2013 GBP CARDINAL and in fast - track cases \u2013 GBP CARDINAL , no fee being due for small claims track cases .", "CARDINAL . In respect of all fees , the court may decide that the claimant does not have to pay a court fee ( exemption ) , or that he / she may pay a smaller fee ( remission ) . That is usually done in cases involving indigent claimants .", "CARDINAL . When deciding on the award to be granted to the claimant , the courts enjoy a wide power to limit the amount that a party may recover with regard to the trial costs . According to ORG , the court is \u201c to have regard to all the circumstances \u201d in determining what costs are payable ( r.CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) . Those circumstances specifically include those set out in r.CARDINAL.CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , namely : ( a ) the procedural conduct of all the parties , including in particular , the efforts made , if any , before and during the proceedings in order to try to resolve the dispute ; ( b ) the amount involved ; ( c ) the importance of the matter to all the parties ; ( d ) the particular complexity of the matter or the difficulty or novelty of the questions raised ; ( e ) the skill , effort , specialised knowledge and responsibility involved and ( f ) the time spent on the case;.", "CARDINAL .
