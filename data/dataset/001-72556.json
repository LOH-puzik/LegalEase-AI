The applicants were born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in Alba Iulia .", "CARDINAL . In connection with the restructuring of the armed forces , which had begun in DATE , a number of legislative measures were passed with a view to encouraging professional soldiers to apply for reassignment to the reserve force and thereby to take early retirement .", "CARDINAL . In addition to their retirement pension , section CARDINAL of Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ( \u201c Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u201d ) granted those concerned a tax - free \u201c income replacement allowance \u201d calculated in relation to their gross DATE pay . Under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \u201c Law no . CARDINAL \u201d ) , they were additionally entitled to a tax - free \u201c maintenance allowance \u201d , also calculated in relation to their gross DATE pay . The method of calculating those allowances was amended by Government Emergency Ordinance no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \u201c Ordinance no . CARDINAL \u201d ) , which provided that the net DATE pay would be used as the basis of calculation .", "CARDINAL . At their request , the applicants were assigned to the reserve force and thereby took early retirement , on DATE for the first and third , and on DATE for the second , with entitlements to the above - mentioned pension and allowances . However , when those sums were paid out , ORG deducted income tax , calculated in accordance with Ordinance no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE concerning income tax ( \u201c Ordinance no . CARDINAL \u201d ) , thereby depriving the first applicant of CARDINAL NORP lei ( ROL ) , the second of ROL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL and the third of ROL CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In an action against ORG , the applicants claimed the reimbursement of those sums , which they alleged had been wrongfully deducted , on the ground that their allowances were exempt from tax under Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and PERSON no . ORG . ORG disputed their claim , contending that the taxation in question was consistent with Ordinance no . ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the applicants\u2019 action and ordered the Ministry to reimburse the amounts deducted for tax . The court considered that on the date of their retirement , that is to say some time before the entry into force of Ordinance no . CARDINAL , the applicants had acquired an entitlement to tax - free allowances calculated in relation to their gross DATE pay . Moreover , the court observed that section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . CARDINAL provided that maintenance allowances were likewise tax exempt .", "CARDINAL . ORG appealed , arguing that the tax exemption provision in respect of the income replacement allowance , under section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , had been expressly repealed by section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which had also implicitly abolished the exemption in respect of maintenance allowances under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE ORG upheld the merits of the judgment at first instance on the following grounds :", "\u201c Even assuming , purely for the sake of argument , that the provisions of section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . DATE had been repealed , those of LAW ( CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . DATE which also provide for tax exemption and for the calculation [ of the allowance ] in relation to gross DATE pay DATE would remain as a legal basis . ORG contends that the provision in question was implicitly repealed , but that view has not been substantiated , because Ordinance no . ORG post - dates PERSON no . ORG and if the legislature had wished to repeal the section in question , nothing would have prevented it from making express provision to that effect , as was the case for other legislative instruments referred to in section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . CARDINAL . ... In any event , a Government Ordinance , being of secondary legislative importance in relation to statute law , can not repeal a statute .", "In addition , the ORG wrongly contends that Ordinance no . ORG constitutes a lex specialis in relation to Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and to Law no . CARDINAL . In actual fact , Ordinance no . ORG is the framework instrument concerning taxation , and , in relation to the other CARDINAL instruments mentioned above , which grant tax relief to a specific category of employees , it lays down the ordinary rules from which the special provisions of those instruments derogate .", "Moreover , section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . CARDINAL states that income replacement allowances and maintenance allowances , such as those concerned in the present case , are exempt from income tax , thus indicating the legislature \u2019s intention that they should not be taxable .", "The provisions of Ordinance no . CARDINAL to the effect that the allowance is calculated in relation to net pay do not apply in the case of the applicants , who retired before the entry into force of the LAW , which does not have retrospective effect ... The possibility of discrimination [ between servicemen who retired after the entry into force of Ordinance no . CARDINAL , whose allowances were calculated in relation to net pay , and those who retired before that date , who were entitled to allowances based on gross pay ] is not left to the discretion of the employer or of the courts , but is a matter for the legislature , which should have taken this into account and found an appropriate solution in the course of the legislative process , by means of precise and specific regulatory provisions . Accordingly , neither an employer nor a court can substitute itself for the legislature in harmonising the various provisions which have come into force at different times but which concern situations that are similar , although they arose , changed or ceased to exist under different statutes . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The court also considered that the CARDINAL allowances in issue could not be characterised as a \u201c salary \u201d or \u201c income treated as a salary \u201d for the purposes of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Ordinance no . CARDINAL , especially as they were not included among the forms of taxable income referred to in section CARDINAL of that GPE .", "Lastly , the court looked at the practice of other courts in similar disputes and found that it supported the claims of the former servicemen .", "CARDINAL . As the judgment of DATE had become res judicata and had been endorsed with a writ of execution , the applicants received , on an unspecified date , the amounts they had claimed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Procurator - General of GPE applied to ORG to have the DATE judgment of ORG and DATE decision of the ORG quashed .", "CARDINAL . He considered that in construing domestic law the CARDINAL courts had committed serious errors of law which had vitiated the settlement of the dispute . He argued that section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . CARDINAL had superseded the provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and LAW CARDINAL of PERSON no . ORG , and added that under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Ordinance no . ORG the allowances and other entitlements of military personnel were treated as salaries and were therefore liable to the taxation provided for in that Ordinance .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought the dismissal of the Procurator - General \u2019s application to have the judgments quashed , disputing his arguments that the above - mentioned provisions had been superseded and that the allowances were treated as salaries . They argued that , in any event , even assuming that the allowances could have been treated as salaries , they should not have been liable to tax , since section CARDINAL ( f ) of Ordinance no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL exempted from tax any allowances that were calculated in relation to net DATE pay . Moreover , under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of that GPE , net earnings were not defined as gross earnings minus tax but as gross earnings minus social - insurance contributions . Accordingly , they considered that ORG had wrongly deducted tax from their allowances .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG allowed the Procurator - General \u2019s application , quashed the impugned judgments and ordered the reimbursement of the sums that ORG had paid to the applicants on the basis of those judgments . The relevant passage of the decision provided :", "\u201c Whilst section CARDINAL of Law no . ORG provides that , upon their reassignment to the reserve force , servicemen benefit from a tax - free maintenance allowance , calculated in relation to their gross DATE pay , that provision must be read in the light of the provisions of section CARDINAL of Government Ordinance no . CARDINAL and of ORG [ no . DATE \u2013 \u201c Order no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL \u201d ] , which , whilst providing that income from maintenance allowances is exempt from tax , specify which forms of income are included in that category and exclude any salaries or income treated as such .", "Considering that Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL pertains precisely to salaries and entitlements relating to the status of ORG employee , it is clear that the grant of a maintenance allowance under LAW of the above - mentioned PERSON stems from employee status , and that such allowances are accordingly liable to tax , in accordance with Ordinance no . ORG .", "That conclusion is confirmed by Government Order no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL which , referring to LAW no . CARDINAL , specifies what forms of income are exempt from tax , among them maintenance allowances . It can be seen from the enumeration in that provision that the maintenance allowances contemplated in Ordinance no . CARDINAL are confined to those granted for special purposes , such as maintenance allowances for soldiers\u2019 spouses , welfare benefits , emergency relief granted by the ORG or local councils in cases of hardship , funeral grants , etc .", "The above - mentioned provision makes no reference to maintenance allowances paid to servicemen upon their reassignment to the reserve force and calculated in relation to their gross DATE pay .", "Consequently , since such allowances are comparable to a salary and are calculated on the basis of gross DATE pay , they are taxable like any gross income .", "In addition , section CARDINAL of Ordinance no . ORG expressly provides that any provision contrary to that Ordinance is superseded , thereby confirming once again that the legislature \u2019s intention was to render such income taxable .", "As regards the income replacement allowances granted to the applicants under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , being tax - exempt and likewise calculated in relation to gross DATE pay , it should be noted that section DATE of Ordinance no . CARDINAL expressly superseded that provision as regards the tax exemption of such income . Accordingly , the applicants are also liable for tax on such income .", "Furthermore , it is to be observed that section CARDINAL ( f ) of Ordinance no . ORG exempts from income tax only those income replacement allowances and maintenance allowances that are calculated in relation to net DATE pay , whereas the allowances granted to the applicants were calculated in relation to their gross DATE pay . It follows that this income was also taxable . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
