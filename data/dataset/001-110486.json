It questioned CARDINAL witnesses , who stated that they did not know or did not remember anything about the case . However , CARDINAL of the witnesses , Mr A.D. and Mr PERSON , admitted that they had received international money transfers , and Mr DATE specified that he had thus done the fourth applicant who had had no identity card a favour .

In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court held that the prohibition had been imposed in compliance with the law , on the grounds of the second applicant \u2019s conviction for an offence subject to public prosecution , and that the ratio legis behind the prohibition was to prevent criminally active individuals from travelling abroad until they had proved that they had been reformed .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date the fourth applicant was released from prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP Regional Police Directorate prohibited him from leaving the country pending his rehabilitation . He appealed against the order , arguing that he had served his sentence , that there were no pending criminal proceedings against him , that his work as a football manager required frequent travel abroad and that he had to accompany his son for medical treatment abroad . In a final judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , holding that the assessment of the administrative body was not subject to judicial control . The court further held that the police authorities were not obliged to state any reasons for their decision to impose the ban .", "CARDINAL . Seeing that the travel bans were contingent on the judicial rehabilitation of the second and the fourth applicants , these measures apparently would have lasted at least until DATE for the second applicant and until an unknown date in DATE for the fourth applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , in DATE the Bulgarian Identity Papers Act was amended to the effect that convicted individuals who had served their sentences could no longer be prohibited from leaving the country .

Pursuant to Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the DATE Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the DATE ORG \u201d ) , in force until DATE , measures for the protection of a witness had to be taken where there were sufficient grounds to believe that his testimony had caused or could have caused a real risk to his life , health or property or that of his close relatives or other individuals with whom he had very close ties . The decision that a witness should be protected had to specify the reasons for the protection and its type . The pretrial authorities and the court had a direct access to the protected witness and were obliged to verify his identity before the interview . A copy of the record of the interview with a protected witness had to be presented immediately to the accused and his lawyer who were entitled to put questions to the witness . The measures for protection could be discontinued at the request of the protected witness or where they were no longer necessary .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article ORG of the DATE ORG , the charges and the conviction could not be based exclusively on the testimony of anonymous witnesses .", "CARDINAL .

In point CARDINAL of the decision it held that the victim of a human trafficking offence could participate in the criminal proceedings as an anonymous witness . It held that the accused \u2019s defence rights could be subjected to reasonable restrictions , including by granting anonymity status to the testifying victim , in order to protect the latter \u2019s rights . However , a strict judicial control had to be exercised over the reasons for granting anonymity to testifying victims and over the procedures aimed at counterbalancing the restriction of the defence rights . According to ORG , in cases of anonymous witnesses the legislation provided CARDINAL procedural safeguards against the risk of manipulating the evidence in favour of the prosecution : ( CARDINAL ) the direct contact between the judge and the anonymous witness , which guaranteed , at the very least , that such a witness indeed existed ; ( CARDINAL ) the right of the accused and his lawyer to put questions to the anonymous witness immediately after his questioning ; and ( CARDINAL ) the limited probative importance the legislation attached to anonymous testimony ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The court made reference to the case - law of this Court and concluded that the rules of fair trial would not be breached if the above procedures were strictly complied with , and notably , if the accused has been given the opportunity to put questions to the anonymous witness immediately after the questioning of the latter .", "CARDINAL . The possibility to interview a witness before a judge , in cases where it is likely that the witness would not be able to attend the trial due to illness , absence or other reasons , or where his testimony would be of \u201c exceptional importance for the establishment of objective truth \u201d , was provided for in Article CARDINALa of the CARDINAL ORG . The provision was inserted with effect from DATE with the aim of creating a possibility to use evidence collected at the pre - trial stage of the proceedings , while at the same time conforming to the principle of immediacy of judicial proceedings . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL specifically provided that the investigator or prosecutor in charge of the interview had to ensure the witness \u2019s presence and \u201c a possibility \u201d for the accused and his counsel to take part in the interview .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the DATE ORG allowed the statement of a witness given at the pre - trial stage to be read out in court if , inter alia , there was a considerable discrepancy between that statement and the ORG testimony given at the trial ; if the witness had not been found and summoned or was unable to appear in court ; or if he had appeared but had refused to testify at trial or had stated that he did not remember anything . If the accused was not represented , the court had to inform him that the testimony thus read out would be used for the determination of the criminal charges against him . Where the statement had been made before a judge , pursuant to LAW , there was no requirement for the court examining the case to obtain the consent of the parties ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice concerning travel bans on convicted individuals pending their rehabilitation are set out in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE .", "CARDINAL .
