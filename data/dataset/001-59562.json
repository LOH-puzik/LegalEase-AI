PERSON went inside and killed PERSON with CARDINAL shots .", "CARDINAL . The motivation for the incident came from PERSON , the other village guards acting on the basis of his wishes .

When the characteristics of the individuals killed in the operations in question are examined , the difference between those NORP supporters who were killed in the region in which a state of emergency had been declared and those who were not lay , in the financial strength the latter presented in economic terms . These factors also operated in the murder of PERSON , a smuggler and pro - ORG activist . They equally applied to PERSON , ORG and ORG .

They asked him his connection with the applicant and PERSON , saying that they had killed PERSON and it would be his turn next .

As regarded the seventh person , her clients had mentioned the involvement of CARDINAL persons in their statements shortly after the incident to the gendarmes . Their statements to the police had apparently been lost . The accused referred to the seventh person for the first time on DATE , describing him as a military person or police officer but without giving his name . She had suspected that their earlier statements to the gendarmes , which were all suspiciously the same , had been given under duress and the seventh person deliberately omitted .

The seventh person \u2019s name had been revealed as PERSON by the GPE report . His address had recently been given to the court in DATE . As officials\u2019 addresses were easily found , the reason for his non - appearance in the proceedings was due to powerful elements deliberately causing the delay or he had his own particular reason not to appear . She thought that ORG had been very negligent in not obtaining his address earlier . The court had failed to accept her request for photographs of personnel to be shown to her clients for the purposes of identification . Though the court made various requests on her application , they did not try very hard in her view . It was a mistake for the court now to summon him as a witness as he has been described as a suspect in the documents for a long time . However , he could only be heard as a suspect if the prosecution drew up an indictment , based on the necessary steps . She considered that there was negligence in that respect .", "CARDINAL . Her clients had been forced to leave ORG because of threats . She herself was followed when in ORG and threatened openly .

That protection stopped when the bench changed . There were increased threats when the seventh person was mentioned in the proceedings . More recently with the exposure of the situation in the south - east , matters had improved .", "CARDINAL . She did not believe that the incident was based on ORG personal ideas .

There was no car to be delivered \u2013 the car was not an issue but only mentioned later for something to say . When asked how he could be expected to help if he was still injured , he said that he had to do what he was told and that perhaps it was to show the others where the headquarters were .", "CARDINAL . NORP When they arrived in GPE , he showed the guards the gendarme headquarters and they saw PERSON . He sent them to the police headquarters .

They came back with CARDINAL people , who had been outside and who had said that there was no need to call the police . The witness thought that they were the police . They showed their identity cards and took the man . At that point , as it was crowded , he was outside the shop leaning on a tree outside the door . He did not hear what was said inside the shop . The QUANTITY men and CARDINAL of the village guards drew their guns . They left in CARDINAL cars .", "CARDINAL .

He and PERSON stayed by the car . He could hear the men talking with PERSON . GPE helped the witness out of the car . Then , they heard gunshots and the CARDINAL men came back .

They did so in the village , in the surrounding district and as far as ORG , with the knowledge of the ORG . There were no police in GPE at the time and the soldiers did not know the people so the village guards virtually did the police work . Things had changed as the police were there now and there was no work left for the village guards . The guards had walkie - talkies for use at TIME in the villages .

He asked them how they could take that position , as the men were village guards and would hand PERSON over to the ORG . There was an argument going on as to whether PERSON should go . The people in the shop said that the police should come . Eventually PERSON said that he would go with them to the gendarmerie . CARDINAL used force and there were no security officers present .

From his experience of DATE , he stated that village guards were appointed by the provincial governor on approval of the district governor and the security forces . The ORG paid them and supplied them with pistols and long - barrelled weapons . Their duty was to provide security to the place where they were registered , namely within the territory of their village . They were given walkie - talkies when the need arose .

He denied that the muhtar would take orders from the gendarmerie , or that the gendarmerie would give orders to village guards . Village guards were not used for any purpose other than protecting their own village . It was not possible to use them for taking persons into custody .

He could have met the CARDINAL village guards before the investigation , but could not remember . He might have sent them on to the police when told about their instructions . PERSON had custody facilities , used for persons detained within their jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the CARDINAL village guards\u2019 involvement in apprehending persons in ORG , he had given no such orders . Orders might have been issued by the ORG command to which they were attached . However , village guards were not authorised to take people into custody on their own . They only helped law enforcement officers , by informing them about wanted persons and assisting in their detention . Though their primary function was to protect their villages , they were regularly given anti - terrorist missions in other areas e.g. in operations or in assisting in apprehension . The village guards in this case were working with the police as far as he could remember . He agreed that he would have to be informed if village guards had been sent to his jurisdiction to take persons into custody . However the men concerned in this case were not in his jurisdiction . If the village guards had come to the guest house , they would certainly have reported to the gendarmes . He had not been in touch with the NORP gendarme commander about the persons to be detained in his gendarmerie , though information would have been sent when they had been taken into custody . The custody record , if the persons were in the custody room and not merely waiting TIME for the convoy , would record that event .", "CARDINAL . He knew PERSON , who had left the ORG .

Most of the questioning however was done by him and his team . After DATE , the investigation was complete , and they sent the file to the public prosecutor .

There had been no duress during the reconstruction and the family and the village guards had not had any objections to what was done .", "CARDINAL . The gendarmes had carried out the investigation as the village guards were involved , guards being under the command of the gendarmerie , and because they had said that they were taking PERSON to the gendarmerie .

The checkpoint for the PERSON gendarmerie was by the Lion Fountain . The fountain itself was open to the public . The checkpoint did not affect persons going past the gendarmerie to the court building . It would have been impossible for the village guards and PERSON to have entered without being checked . The allegation that he was brought to the gendarmerie was false . He could have been brought to the courthouse without their knowing . In his view , the family were exploiting the abduction of their son on behalf of the ORG . It was a case of ordinary homicide and PERSON had changed his story to save his skin .

There had never been any question of PERSON being the seventh person .
