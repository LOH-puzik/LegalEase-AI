The ORG delegation again heard repeated complaints from persons charged with and convicted of administrative offences concerning the refusal of permission for them to receive visits or have contact with the outside world in EDPs .", "The ORG reiterates ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the report on the DATE visit ) that , where persons awaiting trial are concerned , if it is necessary in the interests of the investigation to place restrictions on visits for some of them , the restrictions should be strictly limited in time and applied for the shortest period possible . In no circumstances should visits to a detained person by family and friends be prohibited for a prolonged period . If there is thought to be an ongoing risk of collusion , it is better to allow visits under strict supervision . ...", "CARDINAL . The situation in the majority of penitentiaries visited , in view of the economic situation in the country , remained difficult and the delegation encountered a number of problems already identified during its visits in DATE and DATE in terms of physical conditions and detention regimes .", "Added to this is the problem of overcrowding , which remains serious . In fact , even though the penitentiaries visited were not operating at their full capacity \u2013 as is the case of Prison no . CARDINAL in which the number of detainees was appreciably smaller than during the last visit of the Committee \u2013 they continued to be extremely congested . In fact , the receiving capacity was still based on a very unsatisfactory QUANTITY per detainee ; in practice , this was often even less .", "CARDINAL . The follow - up visit to Prison no.CARDINAL in PERSON revealed an unsatisfactory situation . The progress noted was in fact minimal , limited to some running repairs . The ventilation system had been repaired primarily thanks to the financial support of civil society ( especially NGOs ) , and the creation of places for DATE recreation had been made possible only as a result of contributions by the detainees and their families .", "The repair , renovation and maintenance of cells are entirely the responsibility of detainees themselves and of their families , who also pay for the necessary materials . They must also obtain their own sheets and blankets , the institution being able to give them only used mattresses .", "In sum , the conditions in the great majority of cells in FAC and the transit cells continue to be very poor indeed . ...", "Finally , despite the drastic reduction in overcrowding , the rate of occupancy of cells is still very high , not to say intolerable .", "CARDINAL . Except in the Lipcani Re - education ORG , where the efforts made in this respect are to be highlighted , the quantity and quality of detainees ' food everywhere is a source of grave concern . The delegation was inundated with complaints regarding the absence of meat and dairy products . The findings of the delegation , regarding both the stocks of food and the menus , confirm the credibility of these complaints . Its findings also confirmed that in certain places ( in Prison no . CARDINAL , ... ) , the food served was repulsive and virtually inedible ( for instance , insects and vermin were present ) . This is not surprising given the general state of the kitchens and their modest equipment .", "The NORP authorities have always claimed financial difficulties in ensuring the adequate feeding of detainees . However , the ORG insists that this is a fundamental requirement of life which must be ensured by the ORG to persons in its charge and that nothing can exonerate it from such responsibility . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the ORG report concerning the visit to GPE DATE read as follows ( unofficial translation ) :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In DATE , the Director of ORG of ORG provided the delegation with detailed information on measures already taken or planned with a view to reforming the NORP prison system and implementing the ORG 's recommendations . CARDINAL particularly welcome outcome of these measures is the reduction of the country 's prisoner population . At the time of the DATE visit , the total number of prisoners stood at CARDINAL ( including CARDINAL on remand ) , compared to CARDINAL in DATE . This positive trend can be attributed to legislative changes in DATE , including the entry into force of a new LAW in DATE and the adoption of amendments to LAW and LAW . As a result , there has been an increase in the number of conditional early releases , as well as a wider use of alternatives to imprisonment and a more selective application of remand custody by the courts .", "Further , the implementation of the \u201c Concept for reforming the penitentiary system in the period DATE \u201d has been supported by an increase in the budgetary allocation ( from MONEY in DATE , to MONEY in DATE ) , as well as by a growing input of foreign aid . This has enabled , inter alia , the amelioration of the food provided to prisoners , an improvement of health care , and the carrying out of refurbishment works at several penitentiary establishments ( e.g. No . CARDINAL in GPE , No . CARDINAL in ORG and No . CARDINAL in ORG ) .", "Last but not least , there has been an important shift in mentality through improved staff recruitment and training procedures . The delegation was informed that the directors of many penitentiary establishments had been changed in DATE , following a competition and a probation period . Further , new training programmes for staff had been developed , placing particular emphasis on human rights issues ( see also paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG can only welcome the above - mentioned measures taken the NORP authorities . Nevertheless , the information gathered by the ORG 's delegation during the DATE visit shows that much remains to be done . In particular , overcrowding continues to be a problem ; despite the fact that all establishments visited were operating well under their official capacities , there was on average only CARDINAL m\u00b2 of living space per prisoner , rather than the standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 provided for in GPE legislation .", "The ORG is convinced that the only viable way to control overcrowding and achieve the standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 of living space per prisoner is to adopt policies designed to limit or modulate the number of persons sent to prison . In this connection , the ORG must stress the need for a strategy covering both admission to and release from prison to ensure that imprisonment really is the ultimate remedy . This implies , in the first place , an emphasis on non - custodial measures in the period before the imposition of a sentence and , in the second place , the adoption of measures which facilitate the reintegration into society of persons who have been deprived of their liberty .", "The ORG trusts that the NORP authorities will continue their efforts to combat prison overcrowding and in so doing , will be guided by Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL of ORG concerning prison overcrowding and prison population inflation , as well as ORG Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL on conditional release ( parole ) . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
