The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . They were both employed by ORG ( \u201c the company \u201d ) , an agricultural company based in PERSON . In DATE the workers\u2019 council of the company adopted a decision on the issuance of internal shares to the company \u2019s employees as part of its reorganisation from a socially owned company into a joint - stock company under the applicable regulations . It was decided that CARDINAL of the employees\u2019 salaries would be allocated towards instalment payments for the internal shares to be issued to them . On DATE the company \u2019s management board issued a series of resolutions authorising retention of earnings that resulted in an increase in the company \u2019s internal share capital . As a result of these board resolutions , the internal share capital amounted to PERCENT of the company \u2019s total share capital ( the remainder being held by the ORG ) . The reorganisation process continued until DATE , when the management of the company was taken over by the ORG following armed conflict in the north - western part of GPE ( where PERSON is located ) during the DATE - CARDINAL war . Following the ORG taking control of the company , the applicants were effectively unable to exercise any of their rights as shareholders , although the company continued to state the privately - held internal share capital allotted to its employees on its DATE balance sheets , as well as the ORG - owned capital , until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants\u2019 employment was suspended , as well as that of many other employees of the company , and they were placed on a waiting list for potential future employment by the new management of the company . However , they were never subsequently offered the opportunity to resume their employment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained to ORG ( a domestic human - rights body set up under Annex DATE LAW ) in CARDINAL separate appeals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG , an auditing and consulting company based in GPE , conducted an audit of the transfer of ownership of the company . It held that the measures taken from DATE until DATE to establish internal share capital had not been in accordance with the law and that , therefore , such internal share capital had never been formed . Consequently , it concluded that the company was PERCENT ORG - owned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a decree placing the company on the list of the companies under its control on the basis of the ORG - owned capital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG joined the applicants\u2019 cases ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and those of Mr PERSON and ORG of ORG and adopted a single decision . It was delivered on DATE . ORG held that the applicants had acquired possessions , in the form of their paid - up internal shares in the company , which were protected by law and found a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "The reasons were set out in the decision , the relevant paragraphs of which read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In summary , the ORG has concluded that the applicants acquired protected \u201c possessions \u201d in their paid internal shares in ORG for which payment was made on the basis of : ( a ) permanent deposits ; ( b ) allocation of parts of salaries , either on DATE basis during DATE , or on an DATE basis for DATE ; and ( c ) distribution of profits for DATE in proportion to the amount of paid internal shares . The decision on the results of the renewed ORG audit of DATE , which cancelled all internal shares in favour of state capital in ORG , deprived the applicants of these protected possessions . In addition , by exercising effective exclusive control over the management of ORG , the authorities of the Federation further interfered with the rights of the applicants to participate in the management and to share in the profits of ORG in relation to their paid internal shares . In these respects ORG did not act \u201c subject to the conditions provided by law \u201d . Consequently , the ORG concludes that the GPE has violated the rights of the applicants protected by LAW .", "...", "CARDINAL . The applicants are correct that they have had no real and effective means to participate in the establishment of the ownership structure of ORG , as that has been established through the performance of the audit , which was conducted exclusively by the auditor PERSON [ ... ] . There have been no actual or effective proceedings in which the applicants have been invited to participate . Under the law , the only way for the applicants to participate in the establishment of the ownership structure of the company in which they are shareholders has been to challenge the appointment of the auditor and to challenge the results of the audit [ ... ] . This has not proven effective in this case . Moreover , the ORG considers that this type of process has not been adequate properly to allow the applicants to have access to courts for the determination of their civil rights , as guaranteed by LAW .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG ordered ORG to take all necessary steps to recognise the applicants as holders of internal shares in relation to the amount of their paid - up internal shares and to enable them to exercise their right as shareholders to participate in the management of the company . In particular , the Federation was ordered to : ( i ) employ , at its own expense , internationally recognised auditors to undertake an audit to determine the complete ownership structure of the company , in compliance with ORG ; ( ii ) establish the value of the ORG shares and have them formally registered ; and ( iii ) provide them with individual share certificates . Lastly , ORG ordered interim measures whereby certain procedures and arrangements were put in place as regards the company \u2019s management until the adoption of the final audit report and the convocation of a general meeting of the company \u2019s shareholders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE branch of ORG produced an audit report , which found that PERCENT of the company \u2019s capital was ORG - owned , the remaining PERCENT being in private ownership . In addition , PERCENT of the total capital had been assigned to individual private shareholders , whilst the outstanding PERCENT remained unassigned . The value of the ORG shares had not been established . Consequently , they could not attend the general meeting of the company \u2019s shareholders which was to be held on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( the legal successor of ORG ) decided to lift the interim measures indicated in the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , after having received the final report on the completed audit from ORG and a signed copy of TIME first general meeting of the company \u2019s shareholders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG registered the changes in the ownership of the company resulting from its reorganisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a general meeting of the company \u2019s shareholders adopted a resolution authorising the distribution of the unassigned private share capital to individual shareholders ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants were issued with individual share certificates and their shares were formally registered with ORG . It was established that the first applicant was entitled to CARDINAL shares with a market value of CARDINAL convertible marks ( BAM ) and the second applicant to CARDINAL shares with a market value of BAM CARDINAL . Consequently , the applicants were also allowed to attend general meetings of the company \u2019s shareholders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( which became responsible for the supervision of the execution of ORG decisions after ORG ceased to exist ) concluded that ORG decision of DATE had been fully implemented .", "CARDINAL .
