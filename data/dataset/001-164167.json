NORP The applicant in the first case , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . The applicant in the second case , PERSON PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . Both applicants live in GPE and were represented before the Court by Ms K. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant is a well - known journalist , producer and television presenter . The television shows he was presenting at the relevant time included a political talk show and a news magazine .", "CARDINAL . The applicants married in DATE . The wedding reception was held in the GPE , an ancient palace surrounded by an NORP garden in GPE . The wedding ceremony took place in the PERSON , also in GPE . Both locations are well - known tourist attractions and are generally open to the public .", "CARDINAL . Among the CARDINAL wedding guests were well - known journalists , television presenters and sports personalities . The mayor of GPE also attended the wedding .", "CARDINAL . Due to the anticipated media interest in the wedding , the applicants\u2019 legal representative had informed the relevant newspapers beforehand that the applicants did not wish any reports to appear containing details of the wedding . In addition , both locations were closed to the public and only invited guests were allowed inside .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the magazine PERSON , a so - called \u201c people \u2019s magazine \u201d with a circulation of CARDINAL , published an article about the wedding . The article was announced on the cover of the magazine and illustrated with several photographs . Besides photographs of wedding guests and old photographs of the applicants , one photograph showed the first applicant on DATE , taken before the wedding ceremony inside the restricted area . It was ( erroneously ) captioned \u201c ORG WED PERSON after the wedding vows \u201d ( ORG PERSON nach dem Jawort ) . During the subsequent civil proceedings , the question of where the photograph of the first applicant had been taken from was a matter of contention . While the applicants asserted that it had been taken from outside the restricted area , through a hole in the wall \u2012 using a strong telephoto lens \u2012 the magazine maintained that they had no information regarding the photograph \u2019s provenance since it had been purchased from a stock photographic agency . They speculated , however , that it could just as easily have come from CARDINAL of the accredited photographers , or from an invited guest , or from a member of staff .", "CARDINAL . The article itself informed the reader about the precautions taken by the applicants to prevent press coverage but also gave details about the wedding , including the nature of the catering , the drinks , the ORG outfits , the music and the decoration of the church . The article also included quotes from the address given by the priest , and from the speeches of the second applicant and the first applicant \u2019s father , as well as an excerpt from an intercessory prayer recited by CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 children .", "CARDINAL . After publication of the article and at the request of the applicants , the magazine signed a cease and desist declaration regarding the further publication of a number of statements from the article outlining the details of the wedding . The magazine refused to sign such a declaration in respect of the above - mentioned photograph of the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued a cease and desist order in respect of further publication of the photograph of the first applicant on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant brought proceedings against the magazine , claiming ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL as a notional licence fee , LAW in damages and LOC of pre - trial expenses for the cease and desist declaration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reaffirmed the cease and desist order , awarded the applicant LAW in damages and ordered the magazine to reimburse the pre - trial expenses .", "CARDINAL . The court held that the article concerned an event of public interest because the second applicant was CARDINAL of the most famous and popular television presenters in GPE , who had a strong influence on shaping public opinion . His wedding was therefore anyway of public interest and even more especially so since the public were interested in knowing who had a sufficiently close relationship with him to be invited to attend his wedding . The latter point was of particular importance in terms of enabling the public to judge the second applicant \u2019s journalistic independence . The court also found that the chosen wedding locations increased the level of public interest in the wedding , since the CARDINAL places were amongst GPE \u2019s most popular tourist attractions . The court found that neither the article nor the photograph showed the applicants in a negative light , nor were they in any way derogatory . Nor did the photograph touch on the core of the applicants\u2019 privacy , as it did not show the wedding ceremony itself . Nonetheless , the court found that publication thereof had not been justified by a legitimate interest as the first applicant had chosen to retreat to a secluded place , away from the public eye . Furthermore , the applicants had made clear their intention to prevent press coverage of their wedding by asking the press to refrain from reporting it and taking precautions to create a degree of seclusion by restricting access to the wedding location(s ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court held that publication of the article alone \u2012 regardless of the accompanying photograph \u2012 constituted a serious enough violation of the first applicant \u2019s personality rights to justify damages . In particular the publication of core details of the wedding party and ceremony \u2012 such as quotes from the speeches , the range of drinks and food offered during the wedding and the choice of music \u2012 could not be justified by any public interest but rather constituted a voyeuristic intrusion into the applicants\u2019 privacy . Concerning the notional licence fee , the court held that it could not be considered normal commercial practice to pay royalties to the subjects of a news report . Consequently the magazine had not saved royalties which they would normally have had to pay to the first applicant for publishing the report and the photograph .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set ORG judgment aside and dismissed the first applicant \u2019s action in its entirety . It confirmed ORG reasoning regarding public interest on the basis of the popularity of the wedding locations . It furthermore , and in particular , emphasised that , owing to the influence of the second applicant on public opinion and his role in presenting political television shows , the public had a legitimate interest in knowing who was invited to his wedding \u2012 including the mayor of GPE \u2012 and to judge whether the public opinion presented by him was consistent with or contradictory to his real life . As the wedding was a shared event in the life of both the applicants , the first applicant was obliged to accept the public \u2019s interest in the life of the second applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the court disagreed with the findings of ORG concerning the level of interference with the first applicant \u2019s personality rights . It held that the details published about the wedding , such as information regarding drinks , food and music , were not core private issues but constituted information that was generally discussed and of interest in the context of a wedding . Furthermore , the court pointed out that it was normal practice and to be expected that , in the context of a wedding , photos would be taken by different people , whether invited guests or not . As the photo of the first applicant did not show her in a negative light and was not published on the front page of the magazine , its publication could be justified by public interest . Lastly , ORG gave special consideration to the publication of quotes from the priest \u2019s address , the speeches of the second applicant and the first applicant \u2019s father , and an excerpt from an intercessory prayer recited by CARDINAL of the applicants\u2019 children . It reasoned that this information was more intrusive than the rest of the published details . Nonetheless , even though the wedding was not open to the general public , CARDINAL guests had been invited , and they were not bound to confidentiality . As these guests were not all part of the core family , the speakers and the applicant had to accept that certain information would be communicated to persons who were not invited and to the general public . In conclusion it reasoned that the mere desire on the part of the applicants to have no press coverage could not outweigh the legitimate public interest in the wedding , the published details and the photograph .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law was rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , without providing reasons ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant also brought proceedings against the magazine , claiming damages of at least EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL and EUR CARDINAL in pre - trial expenses for the cease and desist declaration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second applicant \u2019s action . It endorsed the reasoning of ORG and quoted its judgment of DATE at length .", "CARDINAL .
