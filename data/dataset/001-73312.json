Previous expert reports", "Among the documents consulted , we have considered in particular the expert reports by the following psychiatrists :", "PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , of DATE ;", "PERSON , PERSON and PERSON , of DATE ;", "PERSON and PERSON , of DATE ;", "PERSON , of DATE ;", "PERSON , of CARDINAL DATE ...", "Observations", "We have studied the committal order by ORG and a number of expert reports . In their report dated DATE PERSON and PERSON observed in PERSON a mental distortion of reality bordering on the process of paranoia . They noted his pride , his taste for publicity and his need for a sense of self - worth . They referred to the substantial administrative file on PERSON , whose time in custodial establishments had been highly DATE . The CARDINAL experts emphasised that PERSON was very keen to publish his version of events . This , they concluded , was likely to cause a quite considerable scandal . His release risked causing a significant disturbance to public order , and they believed that it could give rise to fears of a publicity stunt .", "PERSON , who had been unable to examine PERSON as the latter had refused , expressed the view in his report of CARDINAL DATE based on the file that the prospect of release was risky .", "On CARDINAL DATE Dr PERSON noted in his report that PERSON intellectual faculties had remained intact . He observed that , despite a fairly warm appearance , there were still paranoid character traits centred on distrust , a suspicious and quibbling temperament , a general impression of persecution , difficulty in being self - critical , an underlying inflexibility and an inflated opinion of himself , accompanied by a latent sense of manipulation and provocation . Dr PERSON concluded from this that PERSON had scarcely changed since the assessment by PERSON and Dr Roumajon , finding him to be just as combative , prone to look for hidden meaning , and seemingly determined to assert in future , by any possible means , what he considered to be his justification and the expression of the truth .", "In PERSON opinion , the question of release was very difficult to assess , in view of the disturbance to public order and the media attention that were likely to ensue .", "During our examinations , PERSON developed good relations with us . The general impression that emerged seems more balanced than that observed by the previous experts .", "CARDINAL expression struck us in particular : \u2018 I have continued to develop a structure while in ORG That does indeed seem to be the case , but it is impossible to assess whether , as things stand , PERSON would be able to maintain this relative stabilisation on being released , if such a decision were taken .", "PERSON appeared to us to be well informed about the current situation . He demonstrated great skill in pleading his own case , without , moreover , displaying excessive passion or exerting pressure on his interlocutors , so much so that questions may be raised as to the intensity of his current desire to be released . In any event , after DATE of imprisonment , such ambivalence is not surprising . The idea of coming out of a system that is organised , restrictive and frustrating yet reassuring by its very monotony , with particular features such as a certain degree of respect on the part of most of the supervising staff , will undoubtedly cause him to wonder , quite naturally , about life as a free man , a life to which he is no longer accustomed : management of time and space , access to treatment , professional responsibility , social skills ...", "The version of events he submitted to the CARDINAL experts is consistent with what he has written and with the version he gave to the previous succession of experts . It is not for us to pass judgment on its credibility . Is it a mythomaniac fabrication ? What portion of truth is there in his current version of events ? Is it quite simply a defence mechanism ? Is it basically a defensive structure verging on the delusional ? All these aspects , indeed , may well be interlinked .", "In any event , a certain progression can be seen from these various documents . In simplified form , it may be broken down into CARDINAL phases :", "At first , PERSON appeared to have a highly disordered personality , being prone to mythomaniac fabrication and a somewhat naive boastfulness .", "ORG came the phase of multiple complaints and a defensive organisation bordering on paranoia .", "Currently there seems to be evidence of a relative softening of his character armour , although it is impossible to judge the impact of \u2018 protection afforded by prison\u2019 and his reaction on experiencing the \u2018 void of release\u2019 .", "Our overall impression is therefore more qualified .", "To sum up , [ the applicant ] was imprisoned at DATE . At the time he appeared to have a disordered personality ... DATE , most of his life has been spent in prison . ... Admittedly , a few paranoid personality traits may still be observed , but they are relatively well suppressed . Such traits essentially seem to be a form of character defence against accusations , a psychological survival response in order to ... \u2018 avoid losing a grip on ORG . He does not show any signs of systematic misjudgment , general over - simplification , deep suspicion , or a sense of current persecution ... at least , as soon as discussion moves away from the case in question . ...", "As further evidence against the presence of genuine paranoia , it is noticeable that he has maintained a certain sense of humour , a responsiveness to his surroundings and a degree of nuance . \u201d", "The report concluded :", "\u201c This assessment therefore focuses entirely on aspects of his personality from a strictly psychiatric and forensic standpoint . And from that standpoint , there do not currently seem to be any formal obstacles to his release . \u201d", "The report also stated that the previous experts had already found that there did not appear to be a risk of a further offence involving a child and that only the risk of a surge of paranoia and protest had held them back .", "\u201c That eventuality can not be totally ruled out , although a number of clinical factors suggest that there has been a relaxation of his reactive faculties . In the event of his release on licence , which is not precluded by the findings of the clinical examination , it is ultimately the continuity , consistency and solidity of the reference points with which he is provided that should prevent a reaction of psychological destabilisation after such a lengthy period of incarceration . It would be helpful for him , at least initially , to receive support through psychological counselling . \u201d", "The experts reported that the applicant was envisaging receiving such counselling \u201c to reassure everyone and myself , and in case I get depressed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge responsible for the execution of sentences gave the following opinion :", "\u201c PERSON is supported by the PERSON family , who have regularly come to see him in the visiting room for DATE . PERSON and PERSON have offered to provide [ the applicant ] with accommodation . They have already welcomed other people in difficulty into their family . In addition , Mr PERSON runs a company called \u2018 Le pain de nos GPE . He will employ the prisoner to carry out administrative duties . [ The applicant ] will not be able to submit any other plans in view of his age ( DATE ) and his isolated family situation ( as a widower with no children ) . The assessment recently conducted by a panel of psychiatric experts concludes that his personality has mellowed and that he has maintained his intellectual faculties and his grasp of reality . There does not appear to be any risk of his committing a further criminal offence involving a child . The findings of the clinical examination do not stand in the way of his release on licence . The solidity of the reference points with which he has been provided should prevent a reaction of psychological destabilisation after such a lengthy period of incarceration . It would be helpful for him initially to receive support through psychological counselling , according to the experts .", "I am forwarding the file on [ the applicant ] because I consider that after DATE in prison it is appropriate to review of his situation and thus assess the purpose of his sentence . Releasing him on licence would enable him to undergo compulsory medical and psychological treatment and to regain his liberty within a clearly defined framework , unlike an individual pardon . \u201d", "Following the reform of the post - sentencing system , including the procedure for granting release on licence to long - term prisoners , pursuant to the PERSON of DATE , the Minister of ORG refused the application for the applicant \u2019s release and referred his case to the newly established courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant availed himself of this new judicial procedure . In his application he again stated that friends of his would provide him with accommodation in an outbuilding at their home and with employment in their bakery on his release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the sentence enforcement board issued a unanimous opinion in favour of his release on licence . The applicant \u2019s resettlement and probation officer also expressed an opinion strongly in favour of the application .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing in LOC the advocate - general submitted that the applicant \u2019s application should be refused in view of his \u201c lack of reform \u201d in relation to the acts that had led to his conviction .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG , observing that the applicant denied having committed the offence of which he had been convicted , refused his application on the following grounds :", "\u201c The extremely serious offence which [ the applicant ] denies having committed was punished by a sentence of life imprisonment .", "The psychiatric experts who examined [ the applicant ] ( in DATE and DATE ) could not rule out his potential dangerousness and the risk of his reoffending , the only means of averting such risks being through psychotherapeutic counselling or support , which by its very nature requires acceptance by the subject .", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] position in relation to the offence committed and to the assessment which psychiatrists may make of a person \u2019s mental state rules out any counselling of that kind and precludes a finding that he is making \u2018 serious efforts to readjust to society\u2019 ... in spite of a coherent resettlement plan in terms of accommodation and employment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Contending that that decision had required a confession as a new condition for release , the applicant appealed to ORG . His lawyer observed that the applicant was assured of work and accommodation on his release and that the most recent psychiatric report submitted by a panel of experts on DATE had concluded that nothing stood in the way of his release on licence as there no longer appeared to be any risk of his reoffending . Relying on LAW , the applicant \u2019s lawyer argued that making his client \u2019s release conditional on a confession was tantamount to a slow death sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s friends attested that their offer of accommodation and employment , which they had repeatedly made over a period of DATE , was still valid although their bakery was currently being sold to a private company founded by their children ( a separate business registered at their home address ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG upheld the decision of DATE in the following terms :", "\u201c ... the offers of employment and accommodation referred to by the offender in support of his application as evidence of a social resettlement plan are closely interlinked and are currently in doubt as a result of the bankruptcy order against the person who made the offers . Furthermore , the paranoid tendencies still noted by the most recent expert would require psychological counselling , which the prisoner does not envisage undergoing . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following a proposal to commute the applicant \u2019s sentence , a fresh psychiatric report on him was completed in DATE . It concluded :", "\u201c ... In our view there has been no particularly perceptible change in the offender \u2019s mental state since the psychiatric assessments carried out in DATE . The character and personality traits observed do not make it possible to conclude with absolute certainty that he will not pose a significant danger in the community , in the psychiatric sense of the term .", "The forecast can not be anything but reserved ... as to his ability to readjust . Prospects of change are barely perceptible , seeing that he is increasingly occupied with disparaging the experts\u2019 methods rather than providing evidence to address the question of his plans for the future . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further application for release on licence with ORG sentencing ORG ( tribunal de l\u2019application des peines ) . The prison authorities recommended applying a probationary semi - custodial regime . The public prosecutor was opposed to the applicant \u2019s release on licence , contending that such a measure would entail a dual risk for society , that of reoffending and that of psychological decompensation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , which was upheld on DATE by the ORG - sentencing ORG of ORG , the applicant was released on licence with effect from DATE until DATE , on which date the monitoring and supervision arrangements would expire . In addition to the standard requirements which the applicant was to observe ( place of residence , contact with the judge responsible for execution of sentences and ORG social workers , permission for travel ) , particular obligations were imposed on him : to submit to medical examinations , treatment or care , including in a hospital environment , and to refrain from contacting the victim \u2019s mother , from distributing any publication or audiovisual work produced or co - produced by himself relating , in whole or in part , to the offence committed , and from making any public comment on the offence . The courts held that the applicant now satisfied the conditions laid down in LAW ORG and based their decision on CARDINAL considerations . Firstly , he had a coherent plan in terms of both accommodation ( long - standing friends who had already assisted a number of people in difficulty ) and voluntary work for ORG , such arrangements being stable and long - term . Furthermore , with regard to his attitude towards the victims , the courts pointed out that the applicant had not made the slightest gesture to them and took refuge behind his alleged innocence , but added : \u201c It nevertheless appears that PERSON conduct does not , after DATE of imprisonment , represent an obstacle to his release on licence as it might have done in the past . \u201d Lastly , with regard to the prevention of further offences , they noted that the risk of his reoffending was limited ( \u201c a CARDINAL risk of reoffending is so rare \u201d ) and that the recent expert reports were generally in favour of his release on licence . The first - instance court concluded as follows :", "\u201c There is no evidence to suggest that a more positive development may be expected in PERSON case , and there is cause to fear that even if his personality may have \u2018 mellowed\u2019 according to the experts\u2019 findings in DATE , it will not truly change . Accordingly , refusing his application for release on licence would amount to his virtually permanent exclusion from society , which does not seem justified in view of his resettlement plan and the limited nature of the risk of his reoffending . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under the legislation in force on the date of the applicant \u2019s conviction , murder carried the death penalty if it was preceded , accompanied or followed by another serious crime , and was punishable by life imprisonment in all other cases . The death penalty was abolished on CARDINAL October DATE . At the time of the applicant \u2019s conviction life sentences were irreducible ; the possibility of parole after a specified minimum term was introduced in a law of CARDINAL DATE . Article CARDINAL of LAW currently provides for a minimum term of DATE in the case of life imprisonment . The term may be increased to a maximum of DATE by a special decision of ORG . Under LAW of DATE , it is now possible to set a minimum term of DATE , or a whole - life term , where a life sentence is imposed for a certain category of offences , namely the murder , whether premeditated or not , of a minor DATE preceded or accompanied by rape , torture or acts of barbarity ( Articles CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Parole is the longest established means of relaxing the conditions of sentences . It was introduced by the PERSON of DATE . The PERSON initially entrusted decisions on parole to the Minister for the ORG and subsequently , in DATE , to the Minister of ORG , when the latter was assigned responsibility for ORG . The provisions of the DATE Law were incorporated into LAW . LAW DATE and DATE removed the requirement of good conduct in prison , making \u201c serious evidence of readjusting to society \u201d the criterion for release on licence , and empowered the judge responsible for the execution of sentences to decide whether to grant a licence to prisoners serving sentences not exceeding DATE ( this power was extended to sentences not exceeding DATE by the PERSON of DATE ) .", "In DATE the prison authorities were faced with a worrying decline in the number of licences granted , particularly in the case of longer sentences . The powers vested in the Minister of ORG were also strongly contested . In DATE the Minister of ORG decided to appoint a commission to make proposals for revitalising the parole system . In DATE ORG , chaired by PERSON , a judge of ORG , submitted its report .", "CARDINAL . Law no . DATE of DATE on reinforcing the presumption of innocence and GPE rights included many of the proposals made in the report . It made radical changes to the laws on parole by removing the Minister \u2019s powers and replacing them with an adversarial judicial procedure , and by broadening the conditions for release on licence .", "CARDINAL . The Law of DATE on adapting the justice system to trends in crime ( which came into force on DATE ) completed the process of transferring post - sentencing powers to the judicial system by establishing the post - sentencing courts as ordinary courts . It lays down provisions on post - sentencing measures based on the principle of adapting sentences to the individual ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG ) ) :", "\u201c ... The execution of sentences shall encourage the integration or reintegration of convicted persons into society and the prevention of recidivism , while respecting the interests of society and the rights of victims . To that end , sentences may be adjusted during the course of their execution to take into account changes in the convicted person \u2019s personality and circumstances . The adaptation of sentences to the individual must , wherever possible , allow the gradual return of offenders to liberty and ensure that they are not released without any form of judicial supervision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Prior to the Law of DATE the competent authority was either the judge responsible for the execution of sentences or the Minister of ORG . In both cases the proceedings did not observe the adversarial principle or due process . Since that date , applications for release on licence falling outside the sphere of competence of the judge responsible for the execution of sentences ( persons sentenced to more than ten years\u2019 imprisonment with DATE remaining to be served ) have been examined by judicial bodies : at first instance , the regional parole courts , instituted by the above - mentioned PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and subsequently replaced by the post - sentencing courts pursuant to the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and , on appeal , ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , now replaced by the Post - sentencing ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Since DATE , cases have been referred to these courts on an application by the convicted person or on the recommendation of the public prosecutor ( Article CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG ) . The post - sentencing court gives judgment after obtaining the opinion of a ORG representative , following adversarial proceedings in which it hears the public prosecutor \u2019s submissions and the observations of the convicted person and , where appropriate , his or her lawyer ( ibid . ) . An appeal against the post - sentencing court \u2019s judgment may be lodged within a DATE period ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) . The ORG - sentencing ORG comprises , in addition to the president and CARDINAL other judges , an official from an association for the resettlement of offenders and an official from a victim - support association ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) . An appeal on points of law may be lodged within DATE after the judgment of the appellate division has been served ( Article CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards temporal conditions , LAW of the ORG provides that life prisoners may not apply to be released on licence until DATE has elapsed ( DATE before the PERSON of DATE and DATE since ) . Whereas it was previously impossible to apply for release on licence before the minimum term in relation to the sentence had expired , there is now an exception to this rule : the PERSON of DATE entitles prisoners to ask for the conditions of their sentence to be relaxed even where a minimum term has been set ( ORG CARDINAL to DATE of the ORG ) if they have shown \u201c serious evidence of readjusting to society \u201d . Lastly , LAW ORG provides that the situation of convicted persons is reviewed at least once DATE if they satisfy the conditions laid down in LAW ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards substantive conditions , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG gives a precise indication of the criteria to be taken into account in examining an application for release on licence :", "\u201c Parole is designed to encourage the rehabilitation of convicted prisoners and prevent them from reoffending . Convicted persons serving one or more prison sentences may be granted parole if they have made serious efforts to readjust to society , particularly if they can show that they have engaged in occupational activities , or regularly attended an educational or vocational training course , or have taken part in a work experience scheme , or had a temporary contract of employment with a view to their social integration , or that their presence is essential to the life of their family , or that they have to undergo treatment , or that they have made efforts to compensate their victims . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Abolition of the death penalty must therefore be translated into a demanding attitude on the part of society towards the prison system . It would be deeply hypocritical to abolish the death penalty without changing conditions of detention , without envisaging reintegration into society and without also accepting the risks to society that such reintegration entails ... \u201d", "\u201c GPE \u2019s prisons house an increasing number of prisoners serving long sentences .

The current scarcity of such measures accounts for the difficulty in implementing a proper post - sentencing scheme . The commission of inquiry has seen in the GPE that offenders have genuine prospects of having their sentences relaxed after a certain period of detention ; this encourages them to become fully focused on reintegration .", "...

In her presentation on life sentences PERSON stated :", "\u201c A majority of ORG make legislative provision for life sentences . The extent to which such sentences can be , and are in fact imposed , varies . Life sentences do not necessarily imply imprisonment for the remainder of natural life . Most countries make provision for a review of life sentences with the possibility of granting release from prison . Some countries impose a very long period of mandatory detention for lifers , e.g. DATE in GPE , DATE in GPE , DATE in GPE , GPE and GPE , DATE in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , while in others release is possible after DATE , e.g. in GPE , or DATE in GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ...", "Probably the most wide - ranging provisions for the use of life imprisonment are to be found in GPE and GPE . There , a life sentence is mandatory for murder and a discretionary life imprisonment can be imposed for other serious offences against the person . With mandatory life sentences , a tariff giving the earliest date at which conditional release may be granted is set . \u2018 Whole life GPE mean that the imprisonment can not be exhausted during the natural life of the prisoner . This tariff can be reviewed after DATE . In addition , since DATE , an offender found guilty for the second time of serious sexual or violent crimes automatically receives a life sentence unless there are exceptional reasons for not imposing it ( automatic life sentence ) .", "By contrast , CARDINAL NORP countries , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , make no legislative provision for life imprisonment . In GPE , the most severe sanction is a sentence from DATE that may only be imposed exceptionally . Conditional release may be granted after CARDINAL , exceptionally CARDINAL , of the sentence has been served . CARDINAL persons were sentenced to exceptionally long - term imprisonment DATE . In GPE , the most severe sanction is a determinate sentence of imprisonment for DATE . Conditional release is possible after DATE has been served .

In western LOC this increase was linked to the growing number of convicted persons and the decreasing number of prisoners being released . These phenomena were combined with tougher policies on certain crimes in respect of which conditional release was granted under very restrictive conditions ( for example , sexual , violent or drug - related offences ) . In central and eastern LOC the considerable number of long - term and life - sentence prisoners was attributable not only to the imposition of long sentences but also to the abolition of the death penalty .", "CARDINAL .

The discretionary release system was found in most NORP countries applying the principle of parole , including GPE . The system was related to the concept of individualisation ( or personalisation ) , since by its very nature it excluded any possibility of automatic release . Mr GPE observed that the main drawback of the discretionary system was the lack of explicit criteria for granting conditional release , producing the following effects :", "\u201c \u2013 disparities between decisions where several bodies are involved in deciding on conditional release ( which is usually the case except in countries with a small number of inhabitants ) ;", "\u2013 unreliability of assessments of the likelihood of reoffending where performed without specialist scientific tools ;", "\u2013 uncertainty as to the date of release renders it difficult to make practical arrangements in advance ;", "\u2013 the above factors may undermine confidence in the system and reduce prisoners\u2019 motivation to cooperate in observance of the conditions and requirements of supervision . \u201d", "The mandatory release system had existed in GPE since DATE . Prisoners serving a fixed term of imprisonment had to be conditionally released after CARDINAL of the sentence . The focus in this system was on personalisation of supervision ( control and assistance measures ) and on the conditions to be satisfied by the prisoner after release . The mandatory release system was above all intended to be egalitarian . According to the report , it was far from commanding unanimous approval and might be reconsidered by ORG .", "The mixed system combined the discretionary system for long sentences with the mandatory system for shorter ones . It was fundamentally pragmatic . An example was the system applied in GPE and GPE .", "In any event , Recommendation Rec(CARDINAL)CARDINAL did not favour any CARDINAL system over another and simply reaffirmed \u201c ORG unambiguous support for the principle of conditional release \u2013 a planned , assisted and supervised reintegration in the community \u201d .", "DATE .
