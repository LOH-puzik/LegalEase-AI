The second applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE . Both applicants live in PERSON . They are represented before the Court by Dr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , Attorney General .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant arrived in GPE on DATE . He had obtained a visa on DATE in GPE , which was valid for CARDINAL entry for a duration of DATE , namely from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant \u2019s presence in GPE as from DATE was thus illegal under the provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . During his illegal stay , the second applicant was charged before ORG in connection with a violent incident which had occurred on DATE in the apartment in which he was residing . Following DATE of detention on remand the second applicant was granted bail and was released . The court ordered him not to leave GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the second applicant was cleared of attempted murder , but found guilty of possessing a knife without a licence . He was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . He served his sentence while his appeal was pending . By an appeal judgment of DATE the second applicant was acquitted of all the charges .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the second applicant met the first applicant , who at the time was DATE , and they entered into a relationship . The second applicant moved in with the first applicant \u2019s family and has lived in their house since .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , a request to issue marriage banns for the couple was rejected on DATE that is not clear on the grounds that the first applicant was too young and her GPE approval was required . The second applicant was also told that he required a visa , as it was not sufficient that he was in GPE on the basis of a court order . Nevertheless , no visa was issued to him , at first because his passport was being held by the police in connection with the court case , and later for unspecified reasons .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in DATE the applicants verbally enquired with ORG about the documents which were necessary to contract a marriage . According to the principal officer of the registry ( who gave evidence in later proceedings ) , the necessary documents were a birth certificate , a free status certificate , a permit allowing the second applicant to marry a non - NORP woman ( as required by the NORP authorities ) , a valid passport and a valid visa . The application could not be processed DATE as the applicants did not have the required documents .", "CARDINAL . It can be seen in the documents submitted to the ORG that on DATE the applicants lodged an application with ORG ( voluntary jurisdiction ) , requesting that the court order LAW to issue their banns . PERSON objected , noting that the refusal had been a result of the fact that the second applicant had failed to submit the necessary documents , namely ( i ) a true copy of his birth certificate together with a certified translation , ( ii ) a free status certificate together with a certified translation , ( iii ) a passport or a visa covering his stay until the marriage , and ( iv ) the written consent of the first applicant \u2019s parents . Furthermore , the second applicant had been waiting to undergo a trial by jury . By a decree of DATE , their application was rejected as the applicants had not produced all the documents required by law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants verbally requested that ORG publish the marriage banns and to this end they produced the second applicant \u2019s birth certificate , a certificate of free status and an expired passport . Since their request was not accompanied by a permit issued by the NORP authorities allowing the second applicant ( as a NORP national ) to marry , as well as a valid passport and visa , their request could not be processed .", "CARDINAL . The applicants put their case to the ORG who by a decision of DATE found that the fact that the would - be spouse had not presented a valid visa should not have been an obstacle to the marriage banns being issued . He thus advised ORG to issue the banns . However , the recommendation went unheeded .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the second applicant submitted a declaration of good conduct and behaviour , a certified free status certificate and a certified birth certificate . By a letter of DATE the Director of ORG declared that the only missing document was the visa .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , assisted by a lawyer , lodged another application with ORG ( voluntary jurisdiction ) , requesting that it order ORG to issue the marriage banns given that the required visa was not a lawful requirement . Alternatively , if the court considered it to be a required document , they requested that the court refer the matter to the constitutional jurisdictions to establish whether there had been a violation of Articles CARDINAL of the Convention . By means of a decree of CARDINAL DATE the court found that , without prejudice to any rights of the applicants of obtaining constitutional redress si et quatenus [ if and in so far as ] , given that it appeared that the applicants had not produced all the necessary documents ORG had been justified in refusing to issue their marriage banns .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicants had a son , who was , however , registered as having an \u201c unknown father \u201d up to the date of the submission of observations , namely when the child was aged CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that they wished to rectify the position of the child per subsequens matrimonium .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , assisted by a lawyer , instituted constitutional redress proceedings , invoking Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , in its constitutional jurisdiction , considered that the applicants had exhausted ordinary remedies , no further remedies were available , and it thus found a breach of LAW in respect of the applicants\u2019 rights . The court considered that the refusal to issue the banns had not been justified , and ordered the authorities to reverse that decision . In particular , it noted that LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) did not provide that a passport or visa were to be submitted in order to issue marriage banns . While it was true that a certain amount of discretion was allowed LAW ) , which also referred to \u201c in addition to all other relevant information \u201d , such discretion had to operate to ensure good order and national security , and it had to be reasonable and proportionate to the aim pursued . The court considered that it was justified for a state to require a visa or a passport , nevertheless in the second applicant \u2019s case it appeared that it was not possible to issue him with a visa , though no justification for this had been submitted . Now that the second applicant had submitted all the relevant documents ( apart from the visa ) and that he had been living in GPE for DATE , the court could not find any justification or legitimate aim behind the registrar \u2019\u2019 family life had not been affected in any way and no discrimination had been proved .", "CARDINAL . The respondents , namely the Director of ORG and ORG , appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG reversed the first - instance judgment . It considered that the applicants had not exhausted ordinary remedies as they had failed to institute ordinary proceedings before ORG ( FAC ) in its civil jurisdiction under LAW ( hereinafter the \u201c COCP \u201d - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . ORG highlighted that according to domestic case - law , particularly PERSON vs ORG , ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE , and the domestic case - law cited therein ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) that procedure was a normal and ordinary procedure , CARDINAL that was regularly used , and there was nothing preventing the applicants from instituting such proceedings . The decree of the court of voluntary jurisdiction could be challenged by an ordinary application before ORG ( FAC ) which had the power to confirm , revoke or alter the decree being challenged . In the event of the applicants\u2019 request being acceded to , the remedy would have been an effective one and there would have been no complaint concerning any breach of human rights .", "CARDINAL . The relevant articles of LAW , LAW of LAW , read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The celebration of marriage must be preceded by the publication of banns of matrimony .", "( CARDINAL ) PERSON of matrimony shall state the name , surname , place of birth and residence of each of the persons to be married , the place where they intend to contract marriage and , unless the PERSON in the case of natural filiation or other circumstances deems proper to act otherwise , the name of the father and the name and surname of the mother of each of the persons to be married .", "( CARDINAL ) A request for the publication of banns shall not be entertained unless it is delivered to the Registrar DATE before DATE of the intended marriage , or than such shorter period as the Registrar may in his discretion accept in special circumstances , and unless and until , in addition to all other relevant information , there are delivered to the Registrar-", "( a ) the certificate of birth of each of the persons to be married ;", "( b ) a declaration on oath made and signed by each of the persons to be married stating that to the best of his or her knowledge and belief there is no legal impediment to the marriage or other lawful cause why it should not take place .", "Provided that if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Registrar that it is impracticable to obtain a certificate of birth required to be delivered by this sub - article , the Registrar may accept instead such other document or evidence as he may deem adequate for the purpose of this article . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If the Registrar is of the opinion that he can not proceed to the publication of the banns or that he can not issue a certificate of such publication he shall notify the persons requesting the publication of his inability to do so , giving the reasons therefor .", "( CARDINAL ) In any such case , either of the persons to be married may apply to the competent court of voluntary jurisdiction for an order directing the PERSON to publish the banns or to issue a certificate of their publication , as the case may require , and the court may , after hearing the applicant and the Registrar , give such directions as it may deem appropriate in the circumstances , and the Registrar shall act in accordance with any such directions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the COCP ( Chapter CARDINAL of the Laws of Malta ) reads as follows :", "\u201c No appeal shall lie from any decree of the ORG of voluntary jurisdiction ; but it shall be lawful for any party , who deems himself aggrieved , to bring an action before ORG , ORG , for the necessary order . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Relevant domestic case - law on the subject matter includes the case of PERSON vs Director of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL , above ) , concerning the registrar \u2019s refusal to issue the necessary banns on suspicion that it would have been a marriage of convenience . ORG confirmed the first - instance judgment , noting that the applicable principles to decide whether the applicants have or had at their disposal an alternative and effective ordinary remedy had been underlined by it in various judgments and in particular in GPE vs Director of Citizenship and Expatriate Affairs of DATE . Amongst other principles , ORG referred to : the existence of another remedy as an actual and objective fact ; that the remedy be accessible , just , effective and adequate in addressing the violation complained of ; that for a remedy to be effective it need not guarantee a favourable outcome , but it sufficed that it could be pursued in a practical , effective and efficient manner ; that the discretion of ORG in this respect must be carried out justly and in the best interest of the administration of justice in order to , on the one hand , avoid that the constitutional jurisdictions be burdened by cases which could or should have been dealt with by other competent courts or through other effective remedies , and on the other hand to ensure that a person is not denied the remedies available under LAW or the Convention . It considered that the fact that a remedy is not pursued is not sufficient for the constitutional jurisdictions to refuse to take cognisance of a case , if it is shown that the remedy referred to was not effective to give full redress ; however , when it is clear that there exists an available ordinary remedy , that must be pursued before seeking constitutional redress .", "ORG held ( in PERSON ) that the plaintiffs had failed to challenge the decree of the court of voluntary jurisdiction by an ordinary application before ORG ( FAC ) , which had the power to annul and revoke the decree being challenged ( see also Director of Public Registry vs X , judgment of ORG ( FAC ) in its ordinary competence , of CARDINAL DATE ) . As had been held by the firstinstance court this was not an extraordinary remedy ; it had been used in the past and continued to be used ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
