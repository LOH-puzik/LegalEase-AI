De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and originates from GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for asylum in GPE on DATE . He stated in essence the following in support of his application . He is formally NORP , but does not practise and considers himself to be an atheist . He had a shop in GPE where he had rented out computer games and game consoles . In DATE he had employed a young woman who did not wear a veil . After DATE , on DATE , CARDINAL masked men claiming to be members of PERSON , an NORP branch of ORG , had entered the shop . They had told him that hiring a woman without a veil was against ORG and had required that she leave her job immediately . The applicant had refused their demand and had stated that \u201c if this is ORG , then I am not a NORP \u201d . The woman had quit her job DATE . Still , DATE the applicant had received a letter with a bullet , stating that he had to excuse himself before the emir within DATE or else he would be considered to have left ORG and could be killed . The applicant had refused to apologise . DATE he had received a death threat and had been shot at . Soon thereafter , his shop had been destroyed by a bomb . Through a friend , whose brother had worked for the police , the applicant had been informed that the police were looking for him because they believed that the applicant had destroyed the shop himself to cover up for hiding weapons for terrorists there . His GPE neighbour had later told him that both the police and NORP had come to the GPE apartment to look for him on several occasions . The applicant had then fled to PERSON in GPE , as ORG was less dominant there . Nothing had happened to him in PERSON . After a month there , he had left GPE on DATE . The applicant claimed that he risked being sentenced to death if he returned to GPE , since he had uttered an unacceptable religious opinion in front of local ORG representatives and since he was wanted by the police for alleged cooperation with terrorists . Both ORG and the police were allegedly searching for him all over GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected the application and ordered the applicant \u2019s deportation to GPE . The ORG questioned the applicant \u2019s allegations that ORG had been searching for him in his parent \u2019s home and that he was sought by the police for having hidden weapons for terrorists in his shop , because he had submitted this information only very late in the proceedings . In any event , noting that the police accusations were false , ORG did not consider that the risk of being prosecuted could be characterised as persecution that would justify the grant of asylum . However , it accepted the applicant \u2019s claim that his life had been threatened by ORG and that he would thus face a real risk of persecution upon return to GPE . ORG went on to examine the possibility of internal flight and found that the applicant had not made it plausible that he was at risk in all parts of GPE . He was not considered in need of protection in relation to areas of the country where ORG was not strong . ORG noted that , while ORG retained a strong presence in GPE , the security situation in LOC was stable and displaced persons could gain entrance there without a sponsor . Having regard to the general situation and the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances \u2013 including his gender , age , health , religion and ethnicity \u2013 , it further found that he could reasonably relocate to LOC , even if he would lack a social network there . That finding was supported by the fact that he had already stayed in PERSON for a month without encountering any problems .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , reiterating the claims he had made to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) upheld the decision of ORG , agreeing generally with its conclusions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his appeal to ORG ( Migrations - \u00f6verdomstolen ) , the applicant submitted a copy of an NORP document , purporting to be a warrant for his arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , in DATE , the applicant claimed that there were impediments to the enforcement of his deportation order . He added the following to his story . His family had previously collaborated with PERSON and the new PERSON government therefore considered them to be supporters of PERSON . Several of the applicant \u2019s relatives had been arrested in DATE and were being kept in a secret prison run by the government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the petition , finding that no new circumstances justifying a reconsideration had been presented .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG . It noted , inter alia , that the applicant \u2019s allegation that he was wanted by the police had been examined earlier in the proceedings and that the arrest warrant presented later thus did not constitute a new fact which gave reason to grant him a new examination of his case . The applicant did not appeal against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged a further petition for reconsideration , claiming that new important facts had emerged in his case . The petition was rejected on DATE by ORG , which noted that the applicant had not presented anything concrete in support of it . No appeal was made against this decision .", "CARDINAL . Another petition for reconsideration was submitted later . The applicant now stated that he had been wrongly convicted of terrorism and sentenced in absentia to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . He submitted CARDINAL documents in LANGUAGE , allegedly a copy of an arrest warrant and a copy of the judgment convicting him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the petition , again finding that no new circumstances had been presented which justified that the case be reconsidered . It noted that the documents submitted were copies and of a very simple nature and that handwritten text had been added to the judgment . It thus considered that their value as evidence was very low .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG and on DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant submitted a fourth petition for reconsideration in DATE . It was rejected by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE . The applicant did not appeal against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . A fifth petition was lodged by the applicant in DATE . It was rejected by ORG on an unknown date and by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
