GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Marc Fischbach", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE ( GPE ) . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , PERSON and PERSON V. ORG , lawyers practising in GPE .", "A.", "In DATE the applicant went to GPE to study law at ORG .", "In TIME of DATE , he was with some friends at a night club celebrating carnival . At TIME he left the club with a friend of his . He had had a number of drinks ( mix of wine and ouzo ) and was intoxicated when he left the club .", "At a flat , QUANTITY away from the club , a robbery and attempted murder of an old lady had taken place at about that time . The neighbours had called the police because they heard loud cries and the lady , after the arrival of the police was transferred to hospital where she died from her wounds caused by a broken glass TIME .", "The applicant was arrested by the police at TIME on DATE at the home of the victim , in a state of unconsciousness due to his intoxication . The applicant \u2019s leather jacket , golden chain and ring , watch , lighter and wallet were missing .", "As soon as he recovered , the applicant was informed that he was being arrested for attempted murder of the lady . He maintained that he did not know the lady and that he could not remember the events of TIME or how he was found at the scene of the crime . He also requested to undergo a blood test to verify the level of alcohol in his blood , but the police refused to do so until TIME following the arrest .", "At the police station , the applicant was not allowed to meet with his lawyer and the police put pressure on him to confess . As he refused to do so , he was beaten , taken to a special room and handcuffed , beaten on the soles of his feet and the wrists and on other parts of his body and the police threw urine over his body . During the interrogation , the police swore at him and his country . The applicant was kept at the police station for DATE where at TIME he was taken to a special cell . He was tied up TIME naked , without any blankets ( even though it was DATE ) or food and was not allowed to go to the toilet . At times the police opened the cell and they spat at him and cold water was thrown over him .", "On DATE , at TIME the applicant was transferred to ORG office . Allegedly , the police took no steps to ensure his safety and this gave the opportunity to a relative of the victim to strike the applicant on the head and other parts of his body . On DATE the applicant was sent to ORG , where he was detained in a room with no beds or blankets , full of rubbish and with no toilets or heating facilities .", "On DATE the applicant was transferred to the prison of PERSON . For DATE the applicant was locked in a corridor as there was no space in any of the cells in the prison . There was neither heating nor access to a toilet or a shower . Then the applicant was transferred to an overcrowded cell , where many inmates , apparently ill , were left without any medical care . The applicant alleges that CARDINAL of the inmates was left to die from his illness in that cell since the prison authorities refused to send him to the hospital , although they had been repeatedly invited to do so .", "In DATE , the applicant was transferred to the PERSON prison , as his trial before ORG of GPE was scheduled in DATE .", "The applicant appointed a lawyer specialising in criminal cases and paid him CARDINAL CARDINAL CARDINAL drachmas . However , DATE before the trial , the applicant maintains that the lawyer suggested to him to pay MONEY more , of which amount CARDINAL would be for the lawyer and CARDINAL for the judge ; the plan was for the applicant to plead guilty and the judge to impose a sentence of DATE . As the applicant completely disagreed with this method , he changed lawyer .", "On DATE , the proceedings started before ORG of GPE . In view of the recent change of his lawyer , the applicant requested an adjournment of the hearing in order to permit the lawyer to study the case file . However , ORG noted that the new lawyer had assisted the previous CARDINAL throughout the investigation proceedings and adjourned the hearing until DATE . On DATE , the applicant requested a further adjournment until DATE , because he had in the meantime appointed a second lawyer who was unable to attend the hearing on DATE due to another professional obligation . ORG granted the request and also ordered ORG to submit its report on the finger prints which was missing from the case file . Furthermore , ORG decided to summon the coroner who examined the body of the victim .", "During the hearing , the applicant complained that certain vital evidential elements had not been provided to the Public prosecutor \u2019s office or to him . Namely , the coroner \u2019s report which showed that the victim had died from a wound that was caused by a stable hand . Counsel for the defence also complained that the evidence file did not contain the report on the finger prints found on the glass by which the old lady was wounded and that this report had been hidden . ORG proposed to call as witnesses the man who heard the screams of the victim and ORG of the police station of the place in which the robbery was perpetrated . However , ORG refused to hear them on the ground that their testimony could not add any elements to the facts as they had already been established .", "Counsel for the defence pleaded the acquittal of the applicant for lack of evidence . He stressed that , although the wounds of the lady had been caused by a broken glass , there were no excoriation on the hands of the applicant and his shirt bore only a few blood stains of the victim . In addition , a sum of money belonging to the victim was missing and not found on the applicant .", "On DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , found the applicant guilty of intentional homicide and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment . The minority did not contest that it was the applicant who committed the homicide but concluded to the absence of criminal responsibility owing to his state of drunkenness . The applicant appealed before ORG against this judgment .", "The applicant maintains that following the conclusion of the trial , he ascertained that one of the judges of ORG was a close relative of CARDINAL of the prosecution witnesses . He also maintains that during his detention he had very little support in his effort to obtain his law books in order to finish his studies and that he was not allowed to attend the exams despite being legally entitled to do so . Furthermore , the Minister of ORG , in an interview he gave on the television in DATE , stated that the applicant being a criminal should not be allowed to be a student .", "On DATE , ORG quashed the judgment of ORG for lack of evidence . ORG stressed that the finger prints found on the broken glass by which the lethal blows were carried did not belong to the applicant and the damages to the apartment of the victim could not have been caused by a single person in such a short time . However , ORG refused to grant the applicant any compensation for his detention and imprisonment . It held that the applicant had been detained and convicted for a \u201c very immoral and dishonest offence \u201d on the basis of evidence that he had actually committed the offence ; consequently , his detention and conviction were not attributable to a breach of law on the part of the judges and the jury who had pronounced them ( articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) . ORG had invited the ORG not to grant such a compensation and the applicant \u2019s lawyers , as well as the applicant himself , had stated that they were leaving it to the ORG to decide on that issue .", "On DATE the applicant returned to GPE . In the meantime , his grandfather to whom he was very close had died on DATE and the applicant had not been allowed to attend the funeral . His mother \u2019s condition , who was ill , deteriorated because of the events that took place in relation to the applicant and she died on DATE .", "B.
