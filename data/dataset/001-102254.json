In the applicant 's view , while there is no comprehensive legislation on home birth in force in GPE , this provision effectively dissuades health professionals from assisting those wishing home birth .", "CARDINAL .

ORG \u201d", "\u201c ... Although risk assessment may be appropriately performed by trained birth attendants their advice about the place of birth , made on the basis of such assessment , is not always followed . Many factors keep women away from higher level health facilities . These include the cost of a hospital delivery , unfamiliar practices , inappropriate staff attitudes , restrictions with regard to the attendance of family members at the birth and the frequent need to obtain permission from other ( usually male ) family members before seeking institutional care ... Often , high and very high risk women do not feel ill or show signs of disease , so they give birth at home , attended by a family member , by a neighbour or by a TBA ...", "However , a properly attended home birth does require a few essential preparations ... [ T]ransport facilities to a referral centre must be available if needed . In practical terms this means that community participation and revolving funds are necessary to enable transport to be arranged for emergencies in areas where transportation is a problem .", "In some developed countries birth centres in and outside hospitals have been established where low - risk women can give birth in a home - like atmosphere , under primary care , usually attended by midwives . In most such centres electronic fetal monitoring and augmentation of labour are not used and there is a minimum use of analgesics . An extensive report about birth centre care in the GPE described care in alternative birth centres in and outside hospitals ... Experiments with midwife - managed care in hospitals in GPE , GPE and GPE showed that women 's satisfaction with such care was much higher than with standard care . The number of interventions was generally lower , especially obstetric analgesia , induction and augmentation of labour . The obstetric outcome did not significantly differ from consultant - led care , though in some trials perinatal mortality tended to be slightly higher in the midwife - led models of care ...", "In a number of developed countries dissatisfaction with hospital care led small groups of women and caregivers to the practice of home birth in an alternative setting , often more or less in confrontation with the official system of care . Statistical data about these home births are scarce . In an NORP study data were collected which suggested that the selection of low - risk pregnancies was only moderately successful . In planned home deliveries the number of transfers to hospital and the rate of obstetric interventions was low . Perinatal mortality and neonatal morbidity figures were also relatively low , but data about preventable factors were not provided ...", "The GPE is a developed country with an official home birth system . The incidence of home deliveries differs considerably between regions , and even between large cities . A study of perinatal mortality showed no correlation between regional hospitalisation at delivery and regional perinatal mortality ... A study conducted in the province of GPE , compared the \u201c obstetric result \u201d of home births and hospital births . The results suggested that for primiparous women with a low - risk pregnancy a home birth was as safe as a hospital birth . For low - risk multiparous women the result of a home birth was significantly better than the result of a hospital birth ... There was no evidence that this system of care for pregnant women can be improved by increasing medicalization of birth ...", "So where then should a woman give birth ? It is safe to say that a woman should give birth in a place she feels is safe , and at the most peripheral level at which appropriate care is feasible and safe ... For a low - risk pregnant woman this can be at home , at a small maternity clinic or birth centre in town or perhaps at the maternity unit of a larger hospital . However , it must be a place where all the attention and care are focused on her needs and safety , as close to home and her own culture as possible . If birth does take place at home or in a small peripheral birth centre , contingency plans for access to a properly - staffed referral centre should form part of the antenatal preparations . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
