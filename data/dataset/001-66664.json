When deciding the CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ORG took into account the detriment caused to the applicant by the expulsion and reduced the normal prison sentence , which would have been life imprisonment , accordingly .", "As concerned the expulsion , ORG had requested that ORG submit its observations on the matter . In its observations , ORG stated that the reasons invoked by the applicant at the time when he was granted asylum were not such that , according to the current practice , he would have been granted asylum . However , in line with ORG practice and the provisions in LAW , there was no reason to recall his refugee status . On the other hand , ORG found that there were no impediments to enforcing a possible order to expel the applicant . ORG also heard a witness called by the applicant who stated that he would be executed in GPE due to his political activities . The court considered that due to the very serious nature of the crime , there were particular reasons for expelling the applicant .", "The applicant did not appeal against the judgment .", "Following the conviction , the applicant lost custody of his sons and they were taken into care by the social authorities and placed in a foster home .

He maintained that he had been politically active within the ORG , distributing newspapers and leaflets , organising demonstrations and writing slogans on walls , and that he had been arrested in DATE and detained for DATE before he was sentenced by a revolutionary court to CARDINAL months\u2019 deportation to the city of PERSON . When he returned home , he married and resumed his political activities . During the autumn of DATE he was again arrested and this time he was tortured during the interrogations .

In DATE his first son was born . The applicant alleged that many refugees were killed in GPE for which reason he and his family , in DATE , had travelled to the GPE where he had applied for asylum . In DATE his second son was born and , in DATE , his request for asylum was refused by the NORP authorities . On DATE , to avoid being sent back to GPE , the applicant had travelled to GPE with his family , on forged documents , where he had applied for asylum under the name of DATE", "Before the Government the applicant submitted that he had continued his political activities in GPE where he had joined ORG ( BNM ) and had become a board member and a member of the editorial board of \u201c GPE \u201d , the organisation \u2019s newspaper . The applicant requested that the Government examine his reasons for asylum based on the information he had submitted . In particular , because of his family situation , an expulsion would mean that his sons would become parentless in GPE . Last , he claimed that the NORP authorities were aware of his political activities and that he would be executed because of this if forced to return to his home country . He submitted several documents to support his claims about his political activities , both in GPE and in GPE , inter alia , of which he submitted the following to the ORG :", "A fax from the BNM in GPE , dated DATE , in which it was stated that the applicant was a former member of the central committee of the BNM and a member of the editorial board of the movement \u2019s news paper , \u201c Zrombesh \u201d . It further stated that the applicant would face torture and execution if returned to GPE due to his political activities .", "CARDINAL further letter from the GPE , dated DATE , in which it renewed its concerns for the applicant \u2019s safety if expelled to GPE due to his active opposition to the NORP regime and that country \u2019s lack of respect for human rights .", "A fax from the Spanish Catholic Migration Commission , dated DATE , which drew attention to LAW and noted that to expel the applicant to GPE would imply serious danger to his life and freedom .", "A copy of his certificate issued in DATE by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees in GPE , stating that the applicant was recognised as a refugee by the ORG . His date of birth was noted to be DATE .", "On DATE , after a request by the Government , ORG ( Migrationsverket ) submitted its observation regarding the matter . It considered that there were no obstacles to expelling the applicant to GPE .", "During DATE the applicant published a book about his life , in NORP , which included information about his political activities , experiences from NORP prisons and criticism of the NORP regime . He claimed that the content of the book would automatically lead to a very harsh sentence for him if he were returned to GPE since he was convinced that ORG in GPE would have obtained a copy of the book . CARDINAL copies of the book had been printed .", "Based on this new information , the Government requested that ORG submit supplementary observations . On DATE , ORG maintained that the applicant \u2019s political activities in his home country as well as the political activities he had performed in GPE before his imprisonment were not such that they could constitute an impediment to the enforcement of his expulsion to GPE . However , it stated that some of the statements made by the applicant in his book were of such a character that it could not be excluded that the NORP authorities had noted them and that the applicant might be apprehended as a result if forced to return . ORG therefore considered that there could be an impediment against enforcing the expulsion for this reason .", "On DATE the applicant was conditionally released from prison but placed in detention awaiting expulsion following a decision , DATE , by the Minister of ORG . However , on DATE , the Minister of ORG had also decided that the applicant should not be expelled until the Government decided otherwise .", "On DATE the Minister of ORG decided that the applicant should be released from detention .", "Apparently , on DATE , the applicant participated in a NORP radio programme which discussed the topic of honour - related murders .", "In DATE the ORG requested ORG in GPE to investigate whether the applicant would be at risk if returned to GPE and to submit its assessment on the matter .", "On DATE the ORG submitted its answer to the Government . It stated that it was possible that the NORP authorities were aware of the GPE \u2019s activities outside GPE but that it did not appear that the organisation had any activities or contacts within the country . As concerned the applicant \u2019s book , the ORG made the assessment that it did not contain any information which could be considered as offensive by the NORP authorities . It noted that the prison conditions in GPE were discussed in the NORP media and that the applicant \u2019s experiences and descriptions of the prisons were outdated . Moreover , the political activities described by the applicant in his book were not current and were depicted in a vague and summary manner . Thus , the ORG concluded that the applicant would not risk being punished if returned to GPE , neither because of his political activities nor because of his book .", "The applicant claimed that the ORG had not seriously read and considered the content of his book . He had also participated in more radio programmes where he had made critical comments against the NORP regime and culture . Moreover , he stated that his wife \u2019s relatives would kill him if he returned as revenge for having murdered her . Last , he stated that his relationship with his sons was improving all the time and that he met with them and spoke with them on the phone frequently . In particular , his relation to his younger son was getting stronger and his son had asked to be allowed to live with the applicant .", "On DATE the Government rejected the applicant \u2019s request to have the expulsion order revoked . The Government found that there was neither any impediment against the enforcement of the expulsion nor any other special reason , as set forth in LAW , to revoke the expulsion order .", "In DATE the applicant lodged a new application with the ORG , requesting that the expulsion order be revoked . He stated that his younger son had had a severe crisis as a result of the ORG \u2019s rejection since he did not want to lose his father . The younger son spent DATE with his father and had expressed the wish to be allowed to live with him . The older son kept his distance from his father but did not want him to be expelled . He submitted a medical certificated written by a Chief Physician at the Children and ORG in DATE which stated that consideration should be taken of the children \u2019s difficult situation and need of their father .", "On DATE the Government rejected the request , finding no reason to change its previous decision .", "In DATE the applicant lodged yet another application with the Government to have the expulsion order revoked . He primarily invoked his younger son \u2019s deteriorating psychological status which was caused by the fear of losing his father and becoming parentless . The applicant and his younger son had developed a very close relationship and it would cause irreparable damage to the son if his father were to be expelled expelled .", "On DATE the Government rejected the application on the same grounds as previously .", "On DATE , after a request by the applicant , the President of the ORG to which the case had been allocated decided , under LAW , to indicate to ORG that it was desirable in the interest of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG not to expel the applicant to GPE until the ORG had had the opportunity to examine the application on DATE .", "Pursuant to LAW , LAW ( ORG ) , a crime may , apart from ordinary sanctions , result in special consequences defined by law . Expulsion on account of a criminal offence constitutes such a special consequence .", "Provisions on expulsion on this ground are laid down in LAW . According to LAW , section CARDINAL of the LAW , an alien may not be expelled from GPE on account of having committed a criminal offence unless certain conditions are satisfied . Firstly , he or she must be convicted of a crime that is punishable by imprisonment . Secondly , he or she may only be expelled if he or she is in fact sentenced to a more severe punishment than a fine and if ( CARDINAL ) it may be assumed , on account of the nature of the crime and other circumstances , that he or she will continue his or her criminal activities in GPE or ( CARDINAL ) the offence , in view of the damage , danger or violation involved for private or public interests , is so serious that he or she ought not to be allowed to remain in the country .", "Furthermore , under LAW , section CARDINAL of the Act , when considering whether or not an alien should be expelled , the court shall take into account his or her links to NORP society . As regards aliens who are considered to be refugees and in need of protection in GPE , they may be expelled only if they have committed a particularly serious crime and it would entail serious danger for public order and safety to allow them to remain in GPE . An alien with refugee status shall be considered as a refugee in need of protection in GPE unless it is evident that he or she no longer is a refugee with such a need .", "Moreover , the court must have regard to the general provisions on impediments to the enforcement of an expulsion decision . Thus , pursuant to LAW , LAW , there is an absolute impediment to expelling an alien to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . Further , a risk of persecution generally constitutes an impediment to enforcing an expulsion decision .", "According to LAW , section CARDINAL of the LAW , if the Government finds that a judgment or decision to expel a person on account of having committed a criminal offence can not be executed or if there are otherwise special reasons not to enforce the decision , the ORG may repeal , in part or completely , the judgment or decision by the court . The ORG may also , in accordance with LAW , LAW , of ORG ( Regeringsformen ) grant clemency or reduce a penal sanction or other legal effect of a criminal act ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
