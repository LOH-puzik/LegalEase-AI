In their reply to the claim , GPE and ORG submitted that the disputed statements in the second article had been based on the information published in the first article . They therefore argued that , in line with domestic law ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , the publishers of the second article could not be held liable for republishing erroneous information which had not been publicly retracted . They further submitted that , in any event , the disputed claims were true and testimony to that effect could be provided by law enforcement officers who had searched the applicant \u2019s apartment in DATE . Lastly , they argued that because of the applicant \u2019s long history of sexual crimes , there was a general interest in making such information public , and that \u201c as far as someone with such a reputation was concerned , it was impossible to cause any more dishonour \u201d ( tokios reputacijos asmeniui dar labiau sumenkinti jo garb\u0119 nebe\u012fmanoma ) .", "CARDINAL .

In their reply to the amended claim , ORG and the newspaper company submitted that the first article had not stated that the applicant had had sexual relations with his mother , but only that law enforcement officers had had such suspicions . They also submitted that , in line with domestic law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicant could not bring court proceedings against them , because he had not asked the newspaper to publish a retraction within DATE of the disputed publication . They asserted that in DATE the applicant had been interviewed by PERSON and some television journalists ; subsequently he had sued the television broadcasting company , but not PERSON sostin\u0117 . Accordingly , PERSON and the newspaper company submitted that the applicant had known about the first article and its contents , but had failed to ask for a retraction within the time - limits provided for in law .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing on DATE . During that hearing the applicant denied having given an interview to FAC in DATE , and claimed that he had not been aware of the first article until the current court proceedings had started . However , when asked by the judge how that article could have caused him any emotional distress if he had not known about it , the applicant replied that he had heard rumours about the publication but had not seen it himself . The court also heard the testimony of a witness requested by the applicant , who stated that in DATE he had been imprisoned together with the applicant and had seen other prisoners insult and humiliate him because of the statements published in the second article . The hearing was adjourned at the applicant \u2019s request , and the court ordered the defendants to provide the disputed photographs of the applicant and his mother .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was held on DATE .

On DATE ORG suspended the civil proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings instituted by the applicant ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

During the hearing the applicant submitted that the defendants were former supporters of the NORP regime , and the purpose of the publication had been revenge for his political and public activities . Meanwhile , PERSON stated that his purpose had been to warn the public about the applicant \u2019s dangerous sexual activities and that , when preparing the article , he had spoken to ORG and a prosecutor , ORG , who had confirmed the existence of the disputed photographs . That prosecutor was called as a witness and testified that he had personally seen such photographs . However , the photographs were not submitted to the court , because the prosecution archives of DATE had already been destroyed .", "The applicant made an application for the court to call additional witnesses who could testify about the damaging effects of the second article , and to obtain documents proving that ORG had participated in anti - independence repression during the NORP occupation . The court rejected his applications as unfounded and unnecessarily time - consuming with regard to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was held on DATE . The applicant made an application for the Vilnius City Third ORG to call witnesses who could testify about the circumstances of his mother \u2019s death , but the court rejected that application as unrelated to the case . In his final address to the court the applicant insisted that the statements about his sexual relations with his mother were false and unproven , and that GPE and GPE had published them to insult and humiliate him . Meanwhile , GPE and GPE argued that they had made a sufficient effort to verify the disputed statements \u2013 they had relied on the first article , which had not been publicly retracted , and had interviewed law enforcement officers who had had the relevant knowledge . They also submitted that the purpose of the article had not been to insult or humiliate the applicant , but to inform the public about a dangerous person known for his sexual crimes . They emphasised that the article had examined a certain aspect of life in the city of GPE , and statements about the applicant had constituted only a small part of it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Vilnius City Third ORG acquitted GPE and GPE of all charges . The court held that the criminal offence of defamation consisted of the intentional distribution of erroneous information about another person , but GPE and GPE had had reasonable grounds to believe that the disputed statements about the applicant and his mother were true , because they had been previously published in another newspaper and not retracted . The court also held that the criminal offence of insult consisted of the public humiliation of another person in an intentionally obscene or offensive manner , whereas a mere negative opinion about another person , presented in a civil manner , would not qualify as criminal insult . The court considered that the disputed statements of the second article , albeit amounting to negative characterisation of the applicant , had been presented in a neutral manner which was not offensive , and that GPE and GPE had not intended to insult the applicant . Lastly , the court dismissed the charge of contempt of the memory of a deceased person as time - barred . The applicant \u2019s civil claim for damages was left unexamined .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against that judgment , but on DATE ORG upheld the acquittal . It emphasised that , in criminal proceedings , the burden was on the prosecuting party to prove that statements published by defendants had been erroneous , or that defendants had intended to insult a victim . The court considered that the applicant had not discharged that burden . It also held that the first - instance court had been justified in not hearing the additional witnesses requested by the applicant , ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , because those witnesses could not have provided any information relating to GPE and ORG alleged intention to defame or insult the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , ORG resumed the examination of the applicant \u2019s claim for damages against the publishers of both articles ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . In a hearing held on DATE the court heard another witness called by the applicant , who stated that the publication of the second article had led to insults against the applicant among his fellow prisoners . The hearing was adjourned at the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . The next hearing was held on DATE . At the applicant \u2019s request , the court ordered a linguistic examination of the disputed statements in the first article , in order to determine whether they could be understood as unequivocally stating that the applicant had had sexual relations with his mother . The examination was carried out by ORG , which delivered its conclusion on DATE . It found that the article did not unequivocally state that the applicant and his mother had had such relations , but that it could raise suspicions that such relations may have existed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It held that domestic law provided for a mandatory out - of - court settlement procedure in cases concerning the publication of allegedly erroneous statements in the media , in accordance with which the applicant should have asked the publisher of the first article to retract it within DATE of its publication ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . The court noted that the applicant had missed that time - limit and had not asked for its renewal . As a result , he could not claim any damages from the publishers of the first article . The court further held that the disputed statements in the CARDINAL articles were essentially identical , and thus the publishers of the second article could not be held liable for republishing the contents of the first article , as long as they had not been publicly retracted .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted an appeal in which he insisted that he had not known about the first article until he began the civil proceedings against the publishers of the second article . On DATE ORG dismissed his appeal and upheld the first - instance judgment . The court underlined that the DATE time - limit to request a retraction was necessary in order to protect journalists from the unreasonable burden of having to prove the truthfulness of information which had been published a long time ago , especially in cases such as the CARDINAL in question , where the applicant had complained DATE after the publication of the first article . The court also referred to the submission of PERSON and the newspaper company that the applicant had been interviewed in DATE as part of the preparation of the first article ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and concluded that the applicant ought to have known that the impending publication would concern him . Accordingly , ORG found that the journalists could not be held responsible for the applicant \u2019s own failure to take timely action in respect of the first article .", "CARDINAL .
