The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The tax inspector conducted a tax inspection in CARDINAL different companies in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , concerning the first company , the tax authorities considered that the applicant had received , in DATE , MONEY ( ORG ) and in DATE , ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL as disguised dividends . They imposed on the applicant an additional tax and tax surcharges ( veronkorotus , skattef\u00f6rh\u00f6jning ) , amounting to LAW in respect of DATE and to ORG CARDINAL in respect of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax authorities found in respect of the second company that the applicant had received in DATE ORG CARDINAL as disguised dividends and imposed ORG CARDINAL as tax surcharges . Moreover , the applicant had received in DATE EUR CARDINAL as disguised dividends and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL were imposed as tax surcharges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax authorities considered that the applicant had received , in respect of the third company , ORG CARDINAL as disguised dividends in DATE for which a tax surcharge of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL was made .", "CARDINAL . The applicant apparently did not seek rectification of any of these decisions . Nor were there any appeal proceedings pending . The time - limits for seeking rectification and lodging an appeal ran until DATE and DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant on , inter alia , CARDINAL counts of aggravated tax fraud ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 veropetos , grovt skattebedr\u00e4geri ) and CARDINAL count of tax fraud ( veropetos , skattebedr\u00e4geri ) concerning DATE . According to the last count , the applicant was accused of aggravated tax fraud as he had under - declared his income . The undeclared income amounted to ORG CARDINAL for DATE and ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL for DATE . Consequently , the tax imposed in DATE had been EUR CARDINAL too low and in DATE EUR CARDINAL too low . The tax imposed on the applicant had thus been in total ORG too low .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicant as charged and imposed a prison sentence of DATE and DATE . He was ordered to pay the taxation authority ORG plus interest in respect of the last count .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that the charges be dismissed or at least , as far as aggravated tax fraud was concerned , that he be convicted of tax fraud . He also requested that the sentence be mitigated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) requesting , inter alia , that as concerned the last count of aggravated tax fraud , the charges be dismissed without examining the merits and that the compensation for damages be rejected . He claimed that in this respect the ne bis in idem principle had been violated as tax surcharges had already been imposed for the same acts . That count concerned at the earliest DATE , in respect of which the time - limit for an appeal in the taxation proceedings was still running until DATE , meaning that those proceedings had not yet been finalised . An effective use of the ne bis in idem principle would require a lis pendens effect preventing the pressing of charges if an administrative tax surcharge matter was still pending . Otherwise CARDINAL separate sets of proceedings concerning the same facts could be pending . Moreover , applicants would be treated unequally if the possibility of pressing charges depended on the finality of the taxation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted leave to appeal as far as the last count was concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . It found , after a detailed analysis of LAW No . CARDINAL to the LAW and the ORG \u2019s case - law , that it was clear since the PERSON judgment that the imposition of a tax surcharge rendered the case criminal and that the ne bis in idem principle applied to such a case even though , under the domestic law , it fell within the domain of administrative law . Both the taxation and the criminal proceedings concerned the same facts , namely the failure to declare the same income . For the ne bis in idem principle it was relevant whether the proceedings had become final . The principle did not prohibit a situation in which CARDINAL sets of proceedings concerning the same matter were pending at the same time . There was thus no lis pendens effect attached to this principle . Even if this lack of lis pendens effect was problematic in the sense that it might result in unequal treatment of applicants due to the fact that the point of time when taxation decisions became final varied , its acceptance might create even more profound problems . As the taxation decisions in the present case concerned DATE , the time - limits for seeking rectification ran until DATE and DATE respectively . The charges had been pressed on DATE . The taxation proceedings had thus not become final before the criminal proceedings started . Therefore , there were no impediments to examining the charge concerning aggravated tax fraud . This judgment became a published leading case PERSON ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P7-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
