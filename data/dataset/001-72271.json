FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s clients were suspected of , inter alia , alleged dishonesty as debtors in respect of a company that was in the process of being wound - up . However , on DATE the public prosecutor decided not to bring charges against them . Meanwhile in DATE , the company and the tax authorities brought a compensation claim against the applicant \u2019s clients before ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE .", "In DATE before the court , the applicant in his capacity as counsel presented a document according to which he had , acting for his clients , made a report to ORG ( keskusrikospoliisi , centralkriminalpolisen ) on the official receiver of the above company and CARDINAL tax officials , X and Y , accusing the CARDINAL last - mentioned of having committed aggravated abuse of office relating to the company \u2019s taxation .", "On DATE ORG rejected the compensation claim . The judgment was upheld by the higher courts .", "Subsequently , the official receiver and X and Y reported the applicant to the police alleging libel .", "On DATE the public prosecutor charged the applicant with CARDINAL counts of libel .", "On DATE ORG , having held an oral hearing , convicted him as charged and sentenced him to pay a fine and ordered him to pay damages and legal costs .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) .

The applicant was ordered to pay the legal costs of X and Y amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) .", "The court thus upheld the conviction insofar as ORG had found the applicant guilty of having libelled the tax officials by accusing X of having brought considerable pressure on the tax inspection unit with a view to obtaining an unlawful tax assessment and to furthering the commission by the official receiver of certain unlawful acts , for instance , as regards the obtaining of an unreasonably large fee from the company . The applicant was found to have libelled Y by accusing him of having furthered the commission by the official receiver and X of some unlawful acts . As to the alleged libel of the official receiver , the court found that the applicant had had well - founded reasons to make the allegations in question .", "The court noted that the public interest required that there be a wide freedom to express criticism in judicial proceedings . It had been the applicant \u2019s fundamental right to express criticism on behalf of his clients in the above proceedings . As to the tax officials in question , the court considered that in their capacity as civil servants they were expected to tolerate criticism directed at their exercise of powers . Nonetheless , the case should be assessed in a different manner when it was alleged that a civil servant had committed an aggravated offence , which was a particularly contemptible offence and one which could lead to a severe sentence and dismissal . The court also noted that the more serious an allegation , the more care must be exercised to ensure the accuracy of it . In the present case , the applicant had not put forward any grounds for his allegations against X and Y.", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal .", "A person who spreads false information or a false insinuation about another person conducive to causing damage or suffering to that person , or subjecting that person to contempt , or who makes a derogatory comment about another otherwise than in a manner referred to above shall be sentenced for defamation to a fine or to imprisonment for a maximum period of DATE . Criticism that is directed at a person \u2019s activities in politics , business , public office , public position , science , art or in a comparable public position and that does not obviously overstep the limits of propriety does not constitute defamation referred to above ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
