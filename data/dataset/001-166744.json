On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence . He remained in custody throughout the investigation and trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG of GPE sentenced him to DATE and QUANTITY months\u2019 imprisonment . The sentence was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following a complaint by the applicant of pain in his lower abdomen , he was diagnosed with an enlarged prostate gland and underwent surgery in relation to that condition .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was transferred to the prison tuberculosis hospital in GPE for testing of his urogenital system . CARDINAL operations were performed in the hospital , but various problematic symptoms relating to his urinary system persisted .", "CARDINAL . In DATE a biopsy of prostate tissue revealed the presence of cancer cells . The applicant was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer which had spread to his liver and inguinal lymph nodes . His condition was aggravated by a wasting syndrome and paraneoplastic syndrome .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he did not have access to the required medication in the hospital , and therefore his condition worsened .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a medical panel confirmed his diagnosis , adding a list of secondary illnesses to it . The doctors concluded that the applicant \u2019s medical condition made him eligible for early release .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Metallurgicheskiy District Court of Chelyabinsk \u201c the ORG \u201d examined the applicant \u2019s request for early release on health grounds . In the proceedings the applicant was represented by Mr A. ORG , a lawyer from ORG .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing the doctor who was treating the applicant testified that his condition had significantly deteriorated since DATE . He received painkillers in hospital , but effective medical treatment was unavailable , owing to a lack of the required medication .", "CARDINAL . The acting head of the hospital stated that the applicant could only receive adequate medical treatment in another hospital .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutor opposed the applicant \u2019s being released , citing his failure to reform while in detention . He also stated that the release was not necessary , as the applicant could receive the required medical treatment within the prison system .", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the applicant \u2019s request for release . It found that he had failed to improve himself , that is to say , the aim of reforming him as a prisoner had not been achieved . His medical condition did not preclude further detention , as the requisite medical treatment was available within the prison system . To receive it , the applicant only needed a transfer to a different hospital .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the above decision on appeal , having fully endorsed the reasoning of the lower court . It also noted that , in addition to pain relief and therapy to relieve symptoms , the applicant could have chemotherapy , should the prison hospital receive the required medication .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the applicant sought interim measures from this ORG under Rule CARDINAL to ensure adequate medical treatment or his release from detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to apply Rule DATE , indicating to the Government that it was desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant should be immediately examined by medical experts who were independent of the prison system , with a view to determining : ( CARDINAL ) whether the treatment he was receiving in the prison hospital was adequate with regard to his condition ; ( CARDINAL ) whether his state of health was compatible with detention in prison hospital conditions ; and ( CARDINAL ) whether his condition required his placement in a specialist , possibly civilian , hospital . Furthermore , the Government were also to ensure his transfer to a specialist hospital , should the medical experts conclude that he required it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Government responded to the ORG \u2019s letter of DATE , asserting that the scope and quality of the applicant \u2019s medical treatment in the prison hospital corresponded to his needs . They alleged that , owing to the gravity of the applicant \u2019s condition , only treatment of his symptoms was recommended , and such treatment was being provided in full . They submitted the following documents : a typed copy of the applicant \u2019s medical file ; certificates from detention facilities summarising the applicant \u2019s treatment and describing his state of health ; a report by a medical panel of CARDINAL DATE confirming his eligibility for early release ; a copy of ORG decision of DATE ; a statement by the acting head of the hospital in which he noted that ORG had misinterpreted his testimony given on DATE , as he had never discussed the possibility of the applicant being treated in another hospital ; and a statement by the head of the prison hospital in which he confirmed that the cancer treatment was only possible in a special oncological centre , and that he had never argued that it was accessible within the prison system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer submitted that the Government had not made arrangements for the independent medical examination indicated by the ORG to be carried out . However , CARDINAL independent doctors summoned by the applicant \u2019s lawyer had assessed the quality of his medical treatment in detention and the compatibility of further detention in the prison hospital with his state of health . In an expert report dated DATE the doctors had concluded that the treatment the applicant was receiving in the prison hospital was inadequate . The belated diagnosis of prostate cancer and the failure to provide active treatment , such as glandular therapy , radiation therapy or surgery were mentioned among other major shortcomings on the part of the medical authorities . The doctors had also noted that the applicant could not be provided with adequate medical treatment in the prison hospital , because it had no licence for inpatient treatment of cancer patients and urological diseases . Accordingly , the experts had concluded that his detention in that facility did not correspond to his medical needs , and threatened his life .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE the applicant \u2019s health continued to deteriorate , and the wasting syndrome progressed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the medical panel prepared a new report , again recommending the applicant \u2019s early release on health grounds . A court hearing on the matter was scheduled for DATE . DATE before that date the applicant died of cancer .", "CARDINAL . At the request of the applicant \u2019s lawyer , Mr A. ORG , ORG carried out a preliminary inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the applicant \u2019s death , which ended with a decision of DATE not to open a criminal case ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "34"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
