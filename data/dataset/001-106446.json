GPE testified that he could not see what happened when the applicant had run out of the van , but he saw him later in the court , when waiting for his hearing .

The action undertaken [ by the police officers ] led to the arrest of the applicant , who took fright at a warning shot fired by ORG and lay down on the ground . He was handcuffed and led to the van and brought to the detainees\u2019 room of ORG . ORG and ORG took part in the pursuit of [ the applicant ] . [ The third police officer ] stayed in the van to watch over the other detainee . For their own safety , the police officers searched the applicant and confiscated money and other small items from him . The applicant was alone in the detainees\u2019 room .", "After having been searched , the applicant was handcuffed . At that moment he started hitting his head against the floor and walls and shouting that the police officers had beaten him up and that it was their fault . Since ORG had left for FAC , in order to transmit the information about [ the applicant \u2019s ] attempt to flee , the remaining [ police officers ] , seeing [ the applicant \u2019s ] behaviour , laid him on the floor and held his hands and legs to prevent him from injuring himself further . During that time the applicant tried to free himself , rubbed his head against the floor and shouted at the police officers that he would inform the prosecuting authorities of the fact that they had beaten him up . He also threatened to kill them . After TIME an ambulance came to give him something to calm him down , but the doctor decided to take [ the applicant ] to the hospital .", "[ CARDINAL police officers ] went with [ the applicant ] to the hospital . In the hospital the applicant underwent the necessary examinations ; then , since he was allowed to participate in the trial , the police officers took him to ORG . The applicant was then transported to the prison because the hearing had been adjourned .", "The injuries sustained by [ the applicant ] on DATE qualified as injuries that could happen in the circumstances described by both the victim and the police officers . However , the court expert established categorically that they could not have happened as a consequence of repeated kicking or beating with substantial force , as described by the victim .", "On the basis of all the material collected in the case it can be unambiguously established that there is not enough evidence substantiating the allegations that the police officers escorting [ the applicant ] on DATE committed an offence . It should be said that the possibility that the applicant was beaten up by the police officers can not be totally ruled out . However , the evidence collected lends credence to the version of events given by the police , which differs completely from the CARDINAL given by [ the applicant ] because there were no other witnesses to the event who could confirm [ the applicant \u2019s ] version , and it is impossible to identify any such witnesses .", "GPE , who was transported with the applicant , does not have any information concerning the incident , as from the moment the applicant escaped , he lost all contact with him .", "As a side note it is to be pointed out that , judging from life experience , it is rather unlikely that the police officers , after having informed their superiors about the applicant \u2019s running off , beat him up and subsequently , having brought the applicant from the hospital back to the court building and knowing that ORG , their supervisor , was already present in the court building , ill - treated the applicant yet again .", "Since the version of the events given by the applicant was not confirmed by the evidence collected , his statements in this respect should be considered as untrue . It is therefore justified to discontinue the proceedings under LAW on the grounds that there is no evidence sufficiently justifying the suspicion that an offence was committed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor requested an expert to enlarge on [ his ] opinion by answering the question whether the injuries described below could have occurred in the circumstances as described by the police officers .

When preparing the opinion , the expert was unaware of the testimonies given by the witnesses PERSON and GPE , the police officers ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court entirely agreed with the prosecutor \u2019s findings after having allowed the new evidence requested by the applicant in his appeal , namely the testimony of GPE , a witness who was present at FAC on DATE and who allegedly saw the applicant being beaten by the police officers , and the additional testimony of GPE , who was transported with the applicant to a court hearing and was likewise present in the court building at the time the applicant was ill - treated .", "PERSON submitted that he saw the applicant when he had been waiting for a hearing in the holding room at the court building . The holding room led to CARDINAL cells . PERSON further submitted that there had been another woman in the room , who had also been transported to the court building for a hearing . According to PERSON , the applicant had been placed in one of the cells ; the door to the cell was left open . He could see the applicant , partly undressed ( without a shirt and trousers ) and handcuffed to a radiator . He saw the police officers entering the cell and insulting the applicant . He further submitted that , when leaning out , he had seen one of the police officers kicking the applicant . Subsequently , PERSON stated that he had seen CARDINAL police officers kicking the applicant .", "In his additional testimony , GPE submitted that at the court building , through a peep - hole in the door of his cell , he could see the applicant being pulled about by the police officers . He could not see whether the applicant had been beaten , but he heard him calling out in pain , which he associated with the applicant having been hit .", "CARDINAL . The court did not explain why PERSON \u2019s testimony and the additional testimony of GPE had been disregarded . The court did not refer either to the alleged stripping of the applicant . However , the court mentioned that the evidence obtained The court also took into account the supplementary expert opinion and concluded :", "\u201c [ From the supplementary expert opinion upholding the conclusions of the original opinion , and after having examined other evidence requested by the applicant ] it is clear that although the applicant sustained injuries , they do not indicate that he was repeatedly hit and kicked , and could have occurred when the applicant forcibly pushed the police van door open , fell , or lay down after fleeing , or when he struggled with the police officers while in a lying position and was held down by force ; the abrasion on the forehead could have happened when he was rubbing his head against the ground , and [ all these injuries ] were slight and minor in nature .", "In the light of the above and after all possible investigative actions have been carried out , it is impossible in the circumstances to establish the existence of evidence to prove that the offence was committed . Having analysed the material collected in the case , the court agreed with the prosecutor \u2019s findings in full and decided as in the operative part . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The regulations on the permissible use of direct coercive measures by the police are laid down in section CARDINAL of LAW , which provides that in situations in which a police order is not obeyed , such measures can be resorted to only in so far as they correspond to the requirements of the particular situation and in so far as they are necessary to obtain compliance with that order .", "CARDINAL .
