AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-2;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention Proceedings", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP police were informed via ORG that on DATE in PERSON ( GPE , GPE ) E.P. , a NORP citizen , and GPE , an NORP citizen , had been killed and that the applicant , who at that time lived in GPE , was suspected of having killed and robbed them . A warrant of arrest was issued against the applicant in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who in the meantime had returned to GPE , was arrested and on DATE was remanded in custody . The applicant remained on remand until DATE . This period was interrupted from CARDINAL May to DATE and from DATE to CARDINAL DATE whilst the applicant served prison sentences imposed in respect of previous convictions .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile the trial against the applicant took place before the PERSON of the Innsbruck ORG sitting with a jury . On DATE the jury acquitted the applicant , but the bench of ORG set aside the jury \u2019s verdict as erroneous . A new trial against the applicant and CARDINAL co - accused was held before ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again acquitted the applicant . The jury answered the question as to murder and the question as to aggravated robbery with CARDINAL votes of \u201c no \u201d and CARDINAL votes of \u201c yes \u201d . According to the record of the jury \u2019s deliberations , the majority of its members found the applicant not guilty as there had been discrepancies between the statements of the witnesses ( \u201c Widerspr\u00fcche in den LOC ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sitting with a single judge heard the applicant in private on his claim for compensation in respect of his detention on remand . The applicant , assisted by counsel , argued that the proceedings under LAW ( Strafrechtliches Entsch\u00e4digungsgesetz ) infringed the presumption of innocence guaranteed by LAW . He referred to the GPE v. GPE judgment of ORG DATE , Series A no.CARDINAL-A ) . The applicant also presented fresh evidence which , in his opinion , could entirely dissipate the suspicion still subsisting against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a chamber of ORG , composed of CARDINAL judges , dismissed the applicant \u2019s compensation claim . ORG found that a right to compensation in the applicant \u2019s case would require that the suspicion against him had been entirely dissipated . According to the records of the jury \u2019s deliberations , a majority of the members had found the applicant not guilty on the grounds that there had been discrepancies between the statements of witnesses . The applicant was not acquitted because his innocence had been proven , but because he had been given the benefit of the doubt . Thus , the suspicion against the applicant had not been dissipated . As regards the applicant \u2019s request for the taking of evidence , ORG found that it was prevented from examining further evidence . It referred in this respect to ORG case - law following the PERSON judgement , according to which a fresh examination of the question of guilt in compensation proceedings following a final acquittal would be in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision . He submitted , inter alia , that ORG had re - examined ORG acquittal . However , it was no longer acceptable to rely on suspicions once an acquittal had become final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in camera , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that a suspicion of having committed a criminal offence is only dissipated if either the claimant \u2019s innocence has been proven , or if all arguments supporting the suspicion against him have been refuted . The right to compensation demands that innocence be established . However , this requirement was not met in the applicant \u2019s case . Referring to ORG decision , ORG found that the records of the jury \u2019s deliberations clearly expressed the opinion of the members of the jury . In their mind various circumstances spoke against the applicant , but it had not been possible to convict him because of discrepancies between the statements of witnesses .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that , according to the PERSON judgment of ORG , a fresh examination of the question of guilt in the compensation proceedings following a final acquittal would have been in breach of LAW , but not the refusal of compensation itself . ORG had not re - examined the question of the applicant \u2019s guilt , rather it had referred to the reasons for which the majority of the jury had voted \u201c not guilty \u201d , and had concluded that the suspicion against the applicant had not been dissipated .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW ( Strafrechtliches Entsch\u00e4digungsgesetz ) read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A right to compensation arises : ...", "( b ) where the injured party has been placed in detention or remanded in custody by a domestic court on suspicion of having committed an offence making him liable to criminal prosecution in GPE ... and is subsequently acquitted of the alleged offence or otherwise freed from prosecution and the suspicion that he committed the offence has been dispelled or prosecution is excluded on other grounds , in so far as these grounds existed when he was arrested ; ... \u201d", "\u201c ... ( CARDINAL ) A court which acquits a person or otherwise frees him from prosecution ... ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) or ( c ) ) must decide either of its own motion or at the request of the individual in question or the public prosecutor \u2019s office whether the conditions of compensation under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) or ( c ) , ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) have been satisfied or whether there is a ground for refusal under section CARDINAL ... If the investigating judge decides to discontinue the proceedings , ORG concerned shall rule .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP Before ruling , the court shall hear the detained or convicted person and gather the evidence necessary for its decision where this has not already been adduced in the criminal proceedings ...", "( CARDINAL ) Once the judgment rendered in the criminal proceedings has become final , the decision , which need not be made public , must , as part of the proceedings provided for in paragraph CARDINAL , be served on the detained or convicted person personally and on the public prosecutor ...", "( CARDINAL ) The detained or convicted person and the public prosecutor may appeal against the decision to a higher court within DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) The court with jurisdiction to rule on the appeal shall order the criminal court of first instance to carry out further investigations if that is necessary for a decision . If the court which has to rule is the court of first instance , the investigations shall be carried out by the investigating judge .", "( CARDINAL ) Once the decision has become final , it is binding on the courts in subsequent proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As a general rule , there is no public hearing in ORG . ORG rules after sitting in private .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment of DATE ( VfSlg CARDINAL ) ORG dismissed the application filed by ORG to have LAW b ) of LAW annulled as being unconstitutional . It found that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) as such did not violate LAW which , under NORP law , has the force of constitutional law . In the light of the GPE v. GPE case ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A ) , it held that it was not the refusal of a claim for compensation which was contrary to the Convention , but the re - examination of the question of guilt after a final acquittal . In ORG view only the separate re - assessment of evidence on the basis of the contents of the whole court file was likely to infringe the presumption of innocence . Nevertheless , ORG observed that it would be desirable to amend LAW ( b ) of the DATE Act in order to clarify the law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-2"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
