{"ITEMID": "001-22167", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "GBR", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2002, "DOCNAME": "LAWRENCE v. THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , born in GPE in DATE and living in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as set out in documents submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant was involved in a boundary dispute with his neighbours . In DATE he had built a brick wall on an area which the neighbours claimed was their land , with the result that the neighbours commenced a civil action in trespass against the applicant in ORG in DATE . The neighbours instructed a partner in the litigation department at a local firm of solicitors , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , to act for them in connection with the dispute . The firm was the largest in GPE .", "The case was originally to be heard by a ORG Judge who , following the hearing of a number of preliminary issues on the case , became unavailable and was replaced by another such Judge ( \u201c the Deputy Judge \u201d ) on DATE . The applicant disputes the unavailability of the first Judge to preside over the proceedings after that date .", "The Deputy Judge and his wife had instructed the private client partner at ORG to prepare their wills in DATE . ORG had thereafter kept custody of the wills and , in DATE or DATE , the Deputy Judge and his wife instructed the same partner at ORG to amend their wills by way of new codicils . They made an appointment to call in at ORG \u2019s offices on TIME of CARDINAL DATE which , as the Deputy Judge was aware , would coincide with his presiding over the trespass proceedings .", "The trial commenced on DATE in order to allow CARDINAL of the ORG witnesses to give evidence , since he would not be available on the dates listed for trial DATE . On DATE , the District Judge heard the applicant \u2019s request that he withdraw from the case in favour of the original ORG Judge on the basis that the latter had been involved in the case throughout . The Deputy Judge refused the application . On DATE , the Deputy Judge heard an application by the applicant for summary judgment on the basis of alleged deliberate failure by the claimants , their expert and ORG to obey ORG . At the hearing , the Deputy Judge asked the applicant whether he was making a complaint about the conduct of ORG , to which the applicant responded that he was not . The applicant maintains that the Deputy Judge \u2019s question was aimed only at a specific part of the application for summary judgment , which part concerned failures only on the part of the ORG expert witness .", "The Deputy Judge informed the applicant upon resumption of the trial on DATE that ORG had made his will DATE previously , and that they still held it , and the applicant took no point on the issue . By DATE CARDINAL of the ORG , and CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s , witnesses of fact had been examined at length . On TIME , the Deputy Judge or CARDINAL of his assistant staff approached the ORG counsel outside the judges\u2019 robing room and informed him of the Deputy Judge \u2019s intention to impose a timetable for the trial , including a limit on the time to be allowed for examination - in - chief of outstanding witnesses of both parties . The ORG counsel passed on this message to the applicant as requested by the person who had spoken to him , and the Deputy Judge , upon resumption of the hearing , announced a TIME limit upon examination - in - chief of the remaining witnesses . As a result , the applicant decided not to call his second witness of fact , who was to travel to the hearing from GPE to testify , and that witness \u2019s written statement was not admitted into evidence .", "The hearing ended on TIME CARDINAL November CARDINAL and the Deputy Judge rose to consider his judgment TIME . He and his wife arrived at the offices of ORG and signed the codicils as previously arranged , meeting a solicitor and a paralegal who each witnessed the signatures . The paralegal had been waiting to meet a colleague in the reception area and was asked to witness the codicil on the spur of the moment . She had worked at ORG since around DATE in the firm \u2019s debt collection department and had assisted in typing some letters in connection with the ORG case against the applicant in DATE , CARDINAL and DATE . ORG subsequently wrote to the applicant and named the solicitor as a member of the firm \u2019s tax , trusts and probate department , but this identification is disputed by the applicant .", "The following TIME the Deputy Judge delivered judgement in the ORG proceedings in favour of the neighbours . The applicant was required to remove the wall which he had built on the land at issue , which was held to constitute part of the applicant \u2019s property . The applicant was also made subject to an injunction prohibiting him from entering onto the neighbour \u2019s land or interfering with it . The applicant was ordered to pay GBP CARDINAL in damages to the neighbours and a proportion of their costs .", "The applicant was granted leave to appeal to ORG by that court in DATE . He raised CARDINAL grounds of appeal : that the Deputy Judge had misunderstood or misdirected himself with regard to the necessary components of an \u201c adverse possession \u201d claim in that the neighbours had never had the necessary intention to possess ; that because the Deputy Judge before and during the trial had dealings with the solicitors acting for the neighbours , there was an appearance of bias ; and that the Deputy Judge conducted the hearing in an unfair manner , limiting the applicant \u2019s examination of his witnesses in a way in which the neighbours had not been so limited . Lord Justice PERSON , in granting leave , commented that he considered all CARDINAL grounds arguable , but that the third was of lesser weight .", "The applicant found out about the Deputy Judge \u2019s DATE meeting at ORG shortly afterwards .", "At the hearing of the appeal before ORG on DATE , the applicant confined his grounds of appeal to the first CARDINAL grounds considered at the leave stage , although the court did comment on all CARDINAL grounds in its judgment . On the first ground , following a fresh examination of the facts , the court concluded that adverse possession had been established in favour of the neighbours , and that such possession had continued for DATE thereby extinguishing the applicant \u2019s predecessor - in - title \u2019s ownership of the land . Lord Justice PERSON went on to comment on the second and third grounds of appeal as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It seems to me that the fair - minded and informed observer would recognise that every judge lives in the community and that in his private life , away from his judicial life , he may need to use the services of service providers , including solicitors . That observer would also appreciate that solicitors , by the very nature of their work , have many clients the affairs of each of whom must be kept separate from those of another client . The use by a judge of the services of a firm of solicitors for his personal purposes , such as for drafting his will , would not , I think , give rise to any expectation , or even any suspicion , in the fair - minded and informed observer that the judge in his judicial capacity would , by reason of that connection over his will , be untrue to his judicial oath and favour another client of those solicitors . The observer would take note of the fact that at the time when the Deputy Judge heard the evidence of Mr PERSON [ the applicant \u2019s predecessor - in - title ] he was not aware who were the solicitors of the claimants [ ie the applicant \u2019s neighbours ] and that , having heard that evidence , the Deputy Judge was the obvious person to complete the hearing of the trial . Indeed , if he had stood down , there would at least have been a risk that Mr PERSON \u2019s evidence would have to be taken in front of another judge , thereby adding disproportionately to the costs of what is essentially a very minor dispute . The observer would take note of the fact that the Deputy Judge volunteered the information that the PERSON solicitors had acted for him in preparing his will and that the Deputy Judge had obtained the express confirmation of the parties that there was no objection to him continuing to preside in the case . The observer would , in my view , have attached particular importance to the fact that the will , as the Deputy Judge told the defendants [ ie the applicant ] was being kept by the PERSON solicitors . That in itself would indicate that there was a continuing relationship with the solicitors and that it was possible that the will might need to be altered in some way ( and codicils are frequently made after a will has been executed ) , when probably there would be contact between the Deputy Judge and those solicitors . As the Deputy Judge obtained confirmation from the defendants that despite his connection with the solicitors over his will there was no objection to him continuing to sit , the observer would reasonably regard the completion of a codicil , which the solicitors had been asked by the Deputy Judge to prepare , as within the reasonable scope of what had been cleared with the parties .", "CARDINAL . The witnessing of the signature of the testator on a testamentary document , as the informed observer would know , is a mere ministerial task , and the fact that a secretary in the litigation department of the solicitors happened to be available to be such a witness is in itself neither sinister nor significant . The observer would note that the Deputy Judge as made clear that he did not discuss the PERSON case against the defendants when he went to complete his codicil .", "CARDINAL . The passing of a message to the claimants\u2019 counsel by the Deputy Judge , or the court usher , or the Deputy Judge \u2019s clerk would not , in my view , be regarded by the observer as of any significance whatsoever . There is no evidence that the Deputy Judge was consulting PERSON in passing that message to PERSON and PERSON PERSON . I have already stated that what PERSON has said occurred . In my judgment , it is impossible to regard that incident as indicating any appearance of bias .", "CARDINAL . ... the mere fact that a witness of the Deputy Judge \u2019s signature to his codicil was a secretary who had some connection with the case , in that her initials appear ( with the initials of another ) on letters to the defendants in relation to this case , would not appear to the fair - minded observer to be of any importance . Nor , in my judgment , can there possibly be some sort of duty on the Deputy Judge to have investigated precisely what functions were performed in the affairs of the claimants\u2019 solicitors by a mere witness to his signature .", "CARDINAL . Looking at the matter objectively , I am wholly unable to see that the fair - minded and informed observer would conclude from the various matters to which Mr PERSON has attached importance that this was a case in which there has been an appearance of bias . For this reasons , therefore , I do not accept his arguments on this ground .", "CARDINAL . For completeness I should also deal briefly with Mr PERSON \u2019s further objection that the Deputy Judge conducted the trial unfairly in imposing a timetable on the trial at DATE , only allowing TIME for the examination in chief of further witnesses . Mr PERSON submits that this is quite unfair , because CARDINAL witnesses for the claimants were examined in chief at greater length on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In my judgment there is nothing in this point either . The chief witness of fact for the defendants was PERSON . It is apparent from the transcript of the hearing in DATE that Mr PERSON was examined by Mr PERSON in chief at some length . The fact that the CARDINAL sons of the late Mr PERSON were examined on DATE for rather longer than TIME does not , to my mind , lead to the conclusion that on CARDINALth DATE the Deputy Judge , exercising his case management powers and imposing a rather more rigorous timetable from then on , was showing bias or acting unfairly . The Deputy Judge \u2019s direction also applied to the further witnesses of the claimants . In any event , as I have said , the main witness of the defendants had already given evidence without any time limit . Further the other witnesses had produced witness statements and there was no need for there to be a lengthy examination in chief . ( ... ) \u201d", "ORG therefore dismissed the appeal .", "The applicant has recently discovered that the Deputy Judge was never charged by ORG for the work done in connection with the codicils signed on DATE . In this connection , the Deputy Judge wrote to the head of ORG in DATE indicating that the purpose of the codicils was to delete a charitable gift that he and his wife had decided to give instead in celebration of his wife \u2019s seventieth birthday . He attached a letter dated DATE from ORG , which explains that the codicil involved the deletion of CARDINAL clause of the wills of the Deputy Judge and his wife and that , given the simplicity of the work , it would have been uneconomic to render an account for it .", "The applicant has informed the ORG that be a further hearing is listed before ORG for DATE on the question of whether or not that court has jurisdiction to re - open the matter in light of the recent developments ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
