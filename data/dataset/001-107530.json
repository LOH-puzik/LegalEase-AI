The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a journalist . On DATE ORG , a national LANGUAGE language newspaper ( \u201c The ORG \u201d ) published the applicant \u2019s letter to the editor entitled \u201c A Yacht Marina for Xemxija ? \u201d", "The letter , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c Dr PERSON , Minister of Transport , has been quoted as saying that a yacht marina is being projected for GPE , the inner part of GPE bay .", "The residents of the seaside village , permanent and occasional , and the fishermen , have not been consulted over what will be an impractical and highly unpopular attempt to bring about further havoc in the area .", "After the war , during the administration of PERSON , permission was given for buildings to be erected on the northern part of the bay because PERSON wanted to build there , and now this has erupted into a conglomeration of high and low - rise constructions of grotesque proportions .", "Then came the oil tanks and it was quite a relief later to see those go . There was some idea to develop ORG and one hopes this has evaporated . Now comes this new idea of a marina at GPE .", "When the breakwater at LOC was extended , the currents in the bay were diverted so that now silt has settled along the stretch by FAC . Similarly , any breakwater in the bay will further alter the currents . The residents will not welcome the intrusion of yachtsmen and are wondering whether the back up facilities will go .", "A proper study of the storms in the bay in DATE will certainly show though how impractical it is to build a large marina at GPE . Besides , one can imagine yachtsman with pegs to their noses from the stench from the drainage outflow which is such a feature of FAC where the authorities have continually botched the system .", "Why do n\u2019t they try GPE , which is a more sheltered and more practical marina \u2013 if in fact there is need for another marina ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , Mr GPE , the son and heir of the deceased Sir PERSON referred to in the letter ( who was Prime Minister of GPE and ORG in the post - war DATE and who died in DATE ) , sued the applicant for civil damages , claiming that the letter was defamatory . He argued that the words \u201c PERSON wanted to build there \u201d attributed false and despicable intentions to his father .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded that the action should be dismissed on the ground that a deceased person can not sue for libel . By a preliminary judgment of DATE ORG dismissed this preliminary plea . This preliminary decision was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended , on the merits , that his letter had not stated that Sir PERSON had wanted to build for himself in the specified area . His statement had referred to Sir PERSON \u2019s decision , acting in his role as Prime Minister of the country , to build in the area . Moreover , the letter was not injurious and there had been no mischievous intent , \u201c animus injuriandi \u201d , on the part of the applicant , who was also a family friend of the GPE .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG found the letter to be defamatory vis - \u00e0 - vis Sir PERSON and ordered the applicant to pay GPE euros ( ORG ) . It reiterated that a person may have a legal interest even if he or she was not the person to have been defamed , and it threw out the applicant \u2019s explanation of the impugned phrase for the following reasons : from the evidence submitted it transpired that the area close to ORG was indeed a development zone ; however , no date could be established as to when the land had been earmarked for such purpose . It further appeared that a company had submitted an application to acquire ( tehid ) land in GPE to erect a bulk storage installation for petroleum products . It followed logically , according to the reasoning of ORG , that the applicant had meant that the issuing of building permits during Sir PERSON \u2019s administration had been dependent on his will to build there ( on the northern side of the bay of GPE ) , personally . This was the meaning which would have been understood by any ordinary right - thinking person . However , the applicant had not been able to prove that any such permits had been issued , or that Sir PERSON had wanted to build there . Thus , since the allegations were untrue , and the applicant had not proved any basis for such an allegation , mischievous intent was presumed .", "CARDINAL . The judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . It reiterated that the statement \u201c during the administration of PERSON , permission was given for buildings to be erected on the northern part of the bay because PERSON wanted to build there \u201d was defamatory as it implied that PERSON had taken advantage of his position as head of the civil administration to build in an area for which planning permission had not previously been granted . This was what a reasonable person would have understood . However , PERSON had proved that his father never owned property in the said area . ORG further noted that the applicant had failed to publish any correction or apology after becoming aware that Mr Boffa had suffered from the defamation caused by the publication .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings claiming that there had been a violation of his rights under Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in its constitutional jurisdiction , dismissed his claims on the merits . It considered the evidence produced by the applicant , namely a letter from the editor of The ORG which explained the reasons why he disagreed with the court judgment of DATE , the witness testimony declaring that the relevant area was a building site , his research documents and his statement that he had never referred to PERSON wish to build for himself personally . It considered , firstly , that according to established domestic and continental jurisprudence , a descendant of a defamed person did have a right of action . It reiterated the lower ORG findings in relation to the animus injuriandi and confirmed that their decision based on the finding that the applicant \u2019s statement had been untrue could not be considered to be repressive . It held that an ordinary reader would have definitely understood the applicant \u2019s statement to refer to PERSON wish to build there personally and thus did cause harm to his reputation . Moreover , the concept of \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d did not entail the publishing of falsehoods . As to Article CARDINAL , it held that according to ORG case - law , the right to a fair trial did not extend to the failure to cross - examine persons who had not given testimony and whose interests were being represented by the heirs who could , themselves , be cross - examined . Thus , there could be no violation of ORG CARDINAL or CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG upheld the first - instance judgment and the ordinary court \u2019s reasoning under both ORG DATE and CARDINAL . In particular , it rejected the applicant \u2019s contention that he was referring to PERSON in his role as Prime Minister at the relevant time and not in his personal capacity , and that the applicant had never written that PERSON had wanted to build there for his own personal advantage . It further held that ORG had correctly applied the relevant principles , in particular the concept of \u201c ordinary reader \u201d and the importance of reputation .", "CARDINAL .
