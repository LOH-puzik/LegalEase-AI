The applicant was born in DATE and lives in NORP .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s father owned a vineyard in NORP . In DATE part of the land was expropriated .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicant \u2019s father requested restitution of the land in its \u201c actual boundaries \u201d . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the NORP land commission decided that the land should be restored through a land redistribution plan .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s father died in DATE and was inherited by the applicant and CARDINAL other heirs . It appears that only the applicant , but not the other heirs , participated in the subsequent proceedings concerning the vineyard .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the land commission decided that the restitution procedure envisaged in paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional and concluding provisions of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the restitution procedure under paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG \u201d ) was applicable to the area in which the applicant \u2019s vineyard was situated because that area comprised both land restored in \u201c actual boundaries \u201d and land allocated to usufructuaries . That procedure envisaged the preparation of a plan of newly formed plots ( \u201c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u201d ) based on the cadastral plan for the area .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the land commission decided to compensate the applicant and the other heirs of the applicant \u2019s father with another property . The applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE the ORG quashed the decision of DATE and held that the heirs of the applicant \u2019s father were entitled to the restitution of QUANTITY of the vineyard in their \u201c actual boundaries \u201d . The judgment was not appealed against and became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the land commission ordered the restitution of the land to the heirs in its \u201c actual boundaries \u201d . However , it expressly noted that a plan showing the precise boundaries of the real estate was to be drawn up after the approval of the cadastral plan so as to enable the heirs to conclude any transactions with the property .", "CARDINAL . Since the vineyard was possessed by third parties , in DATE the applicant brought a rei vindicatio claim against them . During the proceedings the municipality informed the court that it could not issue a plan of the vineyard because the cadastral plan for the area had not been finalised .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of DATE ORG rejected the claim as premature . It held that since the plan was not ready , the restitution procedure could not be deemed completed because the property was not sufficiently individualised .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date in DATE the applicant retained a licensed expert to prepare a plan of the vineyard and requested the land commission to validate it . The latter refused . Following an appeal , in a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the refusal . It held that the plan of newly formed plots for the area had not yet been approved and therefore no plans for particular properties could be issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the local ORG ( \u201c AFD \u201d ) to issue a plan for the vineyard . On DATE it refused . Following an appeal , in a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the refusal . It held that the plan of newly formed plots for the area was not yet in force , which prevented the ORG from issuing a plan for the property . It went on to note that if the applicant deemed that his claim should have been examined under a more simplified restitution procedure than the CARDINAL under paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , he should have appealed against the respective decision , which he had not done .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Governor of the Silistra Region approved the plan of newly formed plots for the area in which the applicant \u2019s land was situated .", "CARDINAL . On an unknown date in DATE the applicant brought a second rei vindicatio claim against the third parties , seeking to recover the entire vineyard . A plan of the property was issued on DATE and submitted to the court . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG granted the claim in respect of all heirs .", "CARDINAL . Following an appeal , on DATE ORG upheld the judgment of DATE only in respect of the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL share . Relying on section CARDINAL of LAW , it held that a rei vindicatio claim was more than a simple act of property management . Therefore , the applicant could not seek to vindicate the rights of the other heirs in such proceedings . Accordingly , ORG ordered the defendants to deliver the possession of a CARDINAL share of the vineyard to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG , arguing that the judgment of DATE went against the established case - law , which considered a rei vindicatio claim an act of property management that could be carried out by any co - owner on behalf of the others .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal on points of law , finding that the applicant had failed to show that an important substantive or procedural issue had been decided by the lower courts out of line with ORG case - law .", "CARDINAL .
