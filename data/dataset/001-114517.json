It follows also , that as long as the Chief Constable was entitled to form the opinion that the information disclosed might be relevant , then absent any untoward circumstance which is not present here , it is difficult to see that there can be any reason why the information that \u2018 might be ORG , ought not to be included in the certificate . I accept that it is possible that there could be cases where the information should not be included in the certificate because it is disproportionate to do so ; the information might be as to some trifling matter ; it may be that the evidence made it so unlikely that the information was correct , that it again would be disproportionate to disclose it . These were not , in my judgment , the situations on the facts before the Chief Constable . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The case of R ( R ) concerned the issue of a \u201c reprimand or warning \u201d to a young person for alleged offences of indecent assault . Unlike the issue of a caution , the issue of a reprimand or warning did not require the person \u2019s consent . However , like a caution , the issue of a reprimand / warning required the individual to admit to the offence . The issue of the reprimand / warning in the case had given rise to an obligation that the young offender in question be subject to registration pursuant to LAW . The claimant alleged that the reprimand had violated LAW because it had been issued without his consent and the consequences of its issue , including the need to register on LAW , had not been properly identified to him .", "CARDINAL . ORG unanimously rejected the claim . Lord PERSON of NORP doubted whether LAW had been engaged at all , but even assuming that it was , he concluded that it had ceased to apply once the decision had been made not to prosecute the claimant . He noted that there was little case - law from this ORG as to the meaning of \u201c determination \u201d of criminal charges and expressed the view that the determination of a criminal charge , to be properly so regarded , must expose the subject of the charge to the possibility of punishment , whether in the event punishment was imposed or not . He considered therefore that a process which could only culminate in measures of a preventative , curative , rehabilitative or welfare - promoting kind would not ordinarily involve the determination of a criminal charge . He accordingly concluded that neither the warning of the claimant nor the decision to warn him involved the determination of a criminal charge against him . Had they done so , Lord PERSON noted , it was acknowledged by the police force that there had been no valid waiver by him of his fair trial right .", "CARDINAL . The claimant challenged the inclusion under section CARDINAL ) of LAW of other information provided by the chief constable on an ECRC regarding alleged offences of which he had been found not guilty .", "CARDINAL . The High Court upheld the challenge and quashed the decision on the basis that the decision - maker had not taken reasonable steps to ascertain whether the allegations that had been made had been true and why the claimant had been acquitted . On the facts of the case it was clear that ORG had acquitted the claimant because it took the view that he was innocent in the full sense of the word . ORG observed :", "\u201c I stress , however , that this decision is very specific to the facts of this case . I do not suggest for TIME that allegations should not be disclosed in an ORG simply because the alleged offender has been acquitted . The circumstances surrounding the acquittal are all important . There will be instances where an alleged offender is acquitted but only because the Magistrates ( or Jury ) entertain a reasonable doubt about the alleged offender \u2019s guilt . The tribunal of fact may harbour substantial doubts . In such circumstances , however , it might well be perfectly reasonable and rational for a Chief Constable to conclude that the alleged offender might have committed the alleged offence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG considered a claim by an individual aggrieved by the disclosure in an ECRC of CARDINAL allegations of sexual abuse of autistic persons in his care , where he had been interviewed by the police about one of the allegations but no charges were pursued .", "CARDINAL . The judge conducted a detailed analysis of the allegations and concluded :", "CARDINAL . It follows that in my judgment the decision to disclose the CARDINAL allegations was lawful ... I recognise how painful such disclosure must be for the claimant , and how damaging its consequences may be . It seems to me , however , that all this follows inevitably from the terms of the legislation and is fully in line with the legislative policy as explained by Lord PERSON in R ( X ) v Chief Constable of GPE . In relation to employment with children or vulnerable adults , it is information of which an employer should be aware . It is then for the employer to decide whether the employment of the person concerned involves an unacceptable risk .", "CARDINAL . I am troubled by the fact that the claimant \u2019s new employer in this case apparently operated a blanket policy of insisting on a \u2018 ORG certificate , so that the disclosure of the CARDINAL allegations led inevitably to the claimant \u2019s dismissal on the transfer of his employment to that employer on a reorganisation at work . The legislation imposes a relatively low threshold for disclosure in the certificate in order to enable an employer to make a properly informed decision . But it is important that employers understand how low that threshold is and the responsibility that it places in practice upon them . A properly informed decision requires consideration not only of the information disclosed in the certificate but also of any additional information or explanation that the employee may provide . The operation of a blanket policy of insisting on a \u2018 ORG certificate leaves no room for taking into account what the employee may have to say . That is a matter of particular concern if it leads to the dismissal of an existing employee or of someone whose employment is transferred to the employer on a reorganisation . On the basis of the limited material available to the court , I confess to some surprise that the claimant was advised in this case that he had no reasonable prospect of success in a claim for unfair dismissal resulting from the application of such a policy ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The question for examination by ORG in its judgment handed down on DATE was whether certain principles of LAW , namely principle CARDINAL ( personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully ) , principle CARDINAL ( personal data shall be adequate relevant and not excessive ) and principle CARDINAL ( personal data shall not be kept for longer than necessary ) , required the police to delete certain old convictions from the ORG . Lord Justice PERSON noted at the outset :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The complaint in each case follows the disclosure of the convictions pursuant to a request by the ... CRB ... or , in CARDINAL case , a request by CARDINAL of the individuals herself , and it is important to emphasise at the outset that the complaint about retention flows in reality not from the retention itself but from the fact that , if retained , disclosure may follow . In respect of each of those convictions ORG ( the IT ) has upheld the view of the Information Commissioner ( the IC ) that they should be deleted . However the ramifications are far wider than these CARDINAL cases since , if these convictions must be deleted and if the police are to treat people consistently , the application of any viable system of weeding would probably lead to the deletion of CARDINAL convictions . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He clarified the effect of the \u201c stepping down \u201d policy on disclosure in the context of criminal records checks , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ I]t seems that both the Police and the IT understood that the result of stepping down would be that in certain circumstances the ORG would not have access to \u2018 stepped ORG convictions when preparing \u2018 standard disclosure certificates\u2019 ( as opposed to \u2018 enhanced disclosure certificates\u2019 ) under Part V of LAW . It is now accepted that that is not accurate . Under Part V of LAW \u2018 stepped ORG convictions are required to be revealed even on \u2018 standard disclosure certificates\u2019 , and thus although \u2018 stepping ORG prevents disclosure in many circumstances to persons other than the police , it does not prevent disclosure by the police in many others including the circumstances under which disclosure was made of CARDINAL of the convictions the subject of this appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON noted that ORG information was used for employment vetting . He observed that CRCs and ECRCs would contain details of spent convictions which , he indicated , provided an important protection to employers . He noted :", "\u201c ... Some emphasis is placed by [ counsel for the intervenor ] that no statutory obligation is placed on the police to retain data under LAW , but on any view Part V of the LAW seems to recognise that the data will be there to be provided . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Taking as an example the case of CARDINAL of the individuals concerned , PERSON considered the purposes for which the data had been recorded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ I]t seems to me to be clear that CARDINAL of the purposes for which the police retained the data on the ORG was to be able to supply accurate records of convictions to the ORG , the courts and indeed the ORG . \u2018 Rendering assistance to the public in accordance with force ORG clearly covers the roles the police seek to perform in those areas and if there was any doubt about it the recipients include \u2018 ORG \u2018 the ORG and \u2018 law enforcement agencies\u2019 . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If CARDINAL then poses the question whether the Data being retained is excessive or being retained for longer than necessary for the above purposes there is , it seems to me , CARDINAL answer , since for all the above a complete record of convictions spent and otherwise is required . That seems to me to be a complete answer to the appeal ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Even if a narrower approach to police purposes were adopted , PERSON considered that the retention of the data was lawful under the DPA DATE . He noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... If the police say rationally and reasonably that convictions , however old or minor , have a value in the work they do that should , in effect , be the end of the matter ...

He continued :", "\u201c DATE . I emphasise the word \u2018 retention\u2019 because if there is any basis for complaint by the data subjects in this case , it seems to me to relate to the fact that in certain circumstances this information will be disclosed , but that is because ORG has made exceptions to LAW . What is more , the circumstances in which there will be disclosure are circumstances in which ORG would be bound to give the correct answer if he or she were asked . It is not as it seems to me the purpose of the DATE [ LAW to overrule the will of ORG by a side wind . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the complaint of CARDINAL of the individuals concerned , PERSON , that she had been assured in DATE that the reprimand she had received aged DATE would be removed from her record when she was DATE if she did not get into anymore trouble and that the retention of the reprimand on the ORG after her eighteenth birthday was therefore unfair under the first data protection principle , PERSON , with whom Lord Justice PERSON agreed , held :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... It seems to me that if it is fair to retain convictions under the new policy it does not become unfair to do so simply because the data subject was told of what the policy then was when being convicted or reprimanded . Furthermore , the deletion of this reprimand leading ( as it would have to ) to deletion of many others would be likely to prejudice the prevention and detection of crime and the apprehension or prosecution of offenders . The court and the ORG need the full information , never mind the fact the police are of the view that for their operational purposes they need the same . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Finally , on the argument raised by the individuals that retention of the data violated LAW indicated that he was not persuaded that LAW was engaged at all in relation to the retention of the record of a conviction . He was of the view that disclosure might be another matter , but reiterated that the appeal before him was not about disclosure . Even if his conclusion were wrong , he considered that the processing was in accordance with the law and necessary in a NORP society .", "CARDINAL . On the Article CARDINAL question , Lord Justice Carnwath noted as follows :", "\u201c DATE . ... [ W]ith regard to LAW , it is significant that the [ ORG ] Directive is itself specifically linked to the need to respect \u2018 fundamental rights and freedoms , notably the right to privacy ... \u2019 , and that it refers in that respect to ORG ( Preamble ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) ) . This suggests that the maintenance of such a complete register of convictions , as implicitly endorsed by Article CARDINAL ) of the Directive , should not normally raise any separate issues under the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He referred to \u201c considerable doubt \u201d as to whether recording the mere fact of a conviction could ever engage LAW in any case , distinguishing PERSON and GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG , on the basis that it concerned the data of unconvicted persons and was , in his view , accordingly no authority for the proposition that a record of the mere fact of a conviction engaged LAW .", "CARDINAL . As regards the specific facts of ORG case , given the assurance that she had received from the police that the reprimand would be removed when she reached DATE and the manner in which the police had sought to justify their subsequent decision not to do so , ORG considered that the decision of the first - instance tribunal that the retention of the data was unfair and in breach of the first data protection principle could not be faulted in law .", "CARDINAL . Permission to appeal was refused by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment in R ( L ) , handed down on DATE , DATE after ORG ruling in Chief Constable of GPE , ORG considered ORG ruling in R ( X ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) in the context of a case concerning disclosure of police information under the predecessor of section CARDINAL ) in the context of an ECRC . The appellant had secured a job as a playground assistant and the school required an ECRC to which the appellant consented . The ECRC disclosed that the appellant had been suspected of child neglect and non - cooperation with social services . The appellant had not been charged with , or convicted of , any offence , nor had she received a caution . Her employment was subsequently terminated and she brought judicial review proceedings , arguing that the disclosure of the information had violated her rights under LAW . At issue was whether the requirement in LAW that chief officers provide information which \u201c might be relevant \u201d and \u201c ought to be disclosed \u201d when an ECRC was requested , was proportionate .", "CARDINAL . As to whether LAW was engaged by the mere retention of data , after reviewing the case - law of this Court , Lord Hope indicated ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c This line of authority from GPE shows that information about an applicant \u2019s convictions which is collected and stored in central records can fall within the scope of private life within the meaning of article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , with the result that it will interfere with the applicant \u2019s private life when it is released . It is , in CARDINAL sense , public information because the convictions took place in public . But the systematic storing of this information in central records means that it is available for disclosure under Part V of LAW long after the event when everyone other than the person concerned is likely to have forgotten about it . As it recedes into the past , it becomes a part of the person \u2019s private life which must be respected . Moreover , much of the other information that may find its way into an ECRC relates to things that happen behind closed doors . A caution takes place in private , and the police gather and record information from a variety of sources which would not otherwise be made public . It may include allegations of criminal behaviour for which there was insufficient evidence to prosecute ... It may even disclose something that could not be described as criminal behaviour at all . The information that was disclosed on the appellant \u2019s ECRC was of that kind . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He therefore considered that decisions taken by chief constables in the context of ECRCs were likely to fall within the scope of Article CARDINAL in every case as the information in question was stored in files held by the police . He noted that the approach taken by the police to questions of disclosure at the time was modelled on Lord PERSON \u2019s ruling in R ( X ) ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG . Lord Hope indicated that the approach to disclosure under the applicable legislation involved a CARDINAL - part test . In the first instance , the chief constable was required to consider whether the information might be relevant . Having concluded in the affirmative , he then had to turn his mind to the question whether the information ought to be included in the certificate . This required consideration of whether there was likely to be an interference with the individual \u2019s private life and , if so , whether the interference could be justified . This raised the question whether ORG in R ( X ) had struck the balance between the competing interests in the right place .", "CARDINAL . Turning to examine the approach of ORG in that case , Lord Hope first endorsed the views expressed there as to the compatibility of the legislation itself with LAW see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . He noted that , as in that case , the appellant in the present case did not argue that the legislation itself contravened Article CARDINAL and accepted that it could be interpreted and applied in a manner that was proportionate . Lord Hope continued :", "\u201c DATE . So the issue is essentially one of proportionality . On the one hand there is a pressing social need that children and vulnerable adults should be protected against the risk of harm . On the other there is the applicant \u2019s right to respect for her private life . It is of the greatest importance that the balance between these CARDINAL considerations is struck in the right place ... [ T]he use that is being made of the requirement to obtain an ORG has increased substantially since the scheme was first devised . The number of disclosures of information by means of ECRCs has exceeded CARDINAL for each of DATE ( CARDINAL for DATE ; CARDINAL for DATE ) . Not far short of MONEY of these disclosures have had section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) [ now section DATE ) DATE see paragraphs CARDINAL above ] information on them ( CARDINAL for DATE ; CARDINAL for DATE ) . Increasing use of this procedure , and the effects of the release of sensitive information of this kind on the applicants\u2019 opportunities for employment or engaging in unpaid work in the community and their ability to establish and develop relations with others , is a cause of very real public concern ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He noted in this regard that it was no answer to these concerns that the ORG was issued on the application of the persons concerned . While he accepted that they could choose not to apply for a position of the kind that required a certificate , he considered that they had , in reality , no free choice in the matter if an employer in their chosen profession insisted , as he was entitled to , on an ECRC . He observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The answer to the question whether there was any relevant information is likely to determine the outcome of their job application . If relevant information is disclosed they may as a result be cut off from work for which they have considerable training and experience . In some cases they could be excluded permanently from the only work which is likely to be available to them . They consent to the application , but only on the basis that their right to private life is respected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Hope considered that the effect of the approach taken to the issue in R ( X ) had been to tilt the balance against the applicant too far . The correct approach , he explained , was that neither consideration had precedence over the other . He proposed that the relevant guidance to officers making a decision on disclosure under the provisions should be amended :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... so that the precedence that is given to the risk that failure to disclose would cause to the vulnerable group is removed . It should indicate that careful consideration is required in all cases where the disruption to the private life of anyone is judged to be as great , or more so , as the risk of non - disclosure to the vulnerable group . The advice that , where careful consideration is required , the rationale for disclosure should make it very clear why the human rights infringement outweighs the risk posed to the vulnerable group also needs to be reworded . It should no longer be assumed that the presumption was for disclosure unless there was a good reason for not doing so . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , who indicated that his judgment largely echoed that of Lord Hope , was also firmly of the view that LAW was engaged in the case , noting :", "\u201c DATE . ... An enhanced criminal record certificate ... which contains particulars of any convictions ( potentially including spent convictions ) or cautions ... , or any other information \u2018 which might be ORG and which \u2018 ought to be included in the ORG ... will often have a highly significant effect on the applicant . In the light of the wide ambit of section CARDINAL ( extending as it does to social workers and teachers , as well as to those \u2018 regularly caring for , training , supervising or being in sole charge CARDINAL children ) , an adverse ECRC ... will often effectively shut off forever all employment opportunities for the applicant in a large number of different fields ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He further observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Even where the ORG records a conviction ( or caution ) for a relatively minor , or questionably relevant , offence , a prospective employer may well feel it safer , particularly in the present culture , which , at least in its historical context , can be said to be unusually risk - averse and judgmental , to reject the applicant ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON also rejected the argument that LAW was not engaged because under the relevant legislation the claimant herself had requested the ORG , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Where the legislature imposes on a commonplace action or relationship , such as a job application or selection process , a statutory fetter , whose terms would normally engage a person \u2019s Convention right , it can not avoid the engagement of the right by including in the fetter \u2019s procedural provisions a term that the person must agree to those terms . Apart from this proposition being right in principle , it seems to me that , if it were otherwise , there would be an easy procedural device which the legislature could invoke in many cases to by - pass Convention rights . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He considered the aim of Part V of LAW , namely to protect vulnerable people , to be unexceptionable and explained how this was achieved by the requirement that relevant information available to the police about an applicant for a post involving responsibility for such vulnerable people be provided to the prospective employer . He continued :", "\u201c DATE . ... It is then for that employer to decide whether the information is relevant , and , if so , whether it justifies refusing to employ the applicant . As already mentioned , however , it seems to me realistic to assume that , in the majority of cases , it is likely that an adverse ECRC ... will represent something close to a killer blow to the hopes of a person who aspires to any post which falls within the scope of the section ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Turning to consider whether there was an infringement of LAW in the case , Lord PERSON was prepared to proceed on the basis that there was \u201c nothing objectionable \u201d in the requirement that an ORG had to contain details of convictions and cautions , even though , he noted , it might on occasions be \u201c rather harsh \u201d on the person concerned . However , like Lord Hope , he was of the view that where other information provided by the chief constable was concerned , the decision on whether to include it in an ORG had to incorporate a proportionality assessment and it might well be necessary to seek the prior views of the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . Lords Saville and PERSON agreed with Lord Hope and , in the case of Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON , in the minority , considered ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that if the compilation and retention of the information was unexceptionable , and the information was relevant to the appellant \u2019s suitability for the employment sought , then it was difficult to see on what basis her attack on the inclusion of the information in the ORG could succeed . He continued :", "\u201c DATE . It is at this point , as it seems to me , that it becomes necessary to remember that it was she who applied for the certificate . I do not doubt that the need for the certificate would have been impressed on her by ORG and that she would have realised that unless she agreed to make the application her chances of obtaining the employment position she desired would be reduced . She may or may not have had in mind the full implications of subsection ( CARDINAL ) of section CARDINAL and it would probably not have occurred to her that the history of her delinquent DATE son and her failure to have controlled his delinquency would be known to the police and might be considered relevant information . But it can not , in my opinion , possibly be said that the police response showed a lack of respect for her private life . It was she who , in making the application for an ORG , invited the exercise by the chief police officer of the statutory duty imposed by section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON accordingly endorsed the approach taken in R ( X ) .", "CARDINAL . Following R ( L ) , the High Court quashed a decision by the chief constable to disclose details of a sexual allegation made against the claimant in an ECRC on grounds of procedural impropriety , because the claimant \u2019s views had not been sought and because the decision to disclose was disproportionate to the level of risk disclosed . The court granted an injunction to prevent future disclosure .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , ORG upheld the decision to quash the disclosure on grounds of procedural impropriety but , emphasising that the primary decision - maker was the chief constable who would take a fresh decision on the basis of the material now before him , allowed the appeal against the injunction .", "CARDINAL . In R ( F and another ) v Secretary of ORG for ORG , the respondents were convicted sex offenders subject to notification requirements under LAW DATE ( ORG DATE ) , whereby all those sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment or more for a sexual offence are registered on the sex offenders register and subject to a lifelong duty to notify police of their living and travelling arrangements , with no right for review . The question in the appeal was whether the absence of any right to review rendered the notification requirements disproportionate to the legitimate aims they sought to pursue and thus incompatible with LAW . Lord PERSON noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The issue in this case is CARDINAL of proportionality . It is common ground that the notification requirements interfere with ORG article CARDINAL rights , that this interference is in accordance with the law and that it is directed at the legitimate aims of the prevention of crime and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . The issue is whether the notification requirements , as embodied in the CARDINAL Act , and without any right to a review , are proportionate to that aim . That issue requires consideration of CARDINAL questions . ( i ) What is the extent of the interference with article CARDINAL rights ? ( ii ) How valuable are the notification requirements in achieving the legitimate aims ? and ( iii ) To what extent would that value be eroded if the notification requirements were made subject to review ? The issue is a narrow one . The respondents\u2019 case is that the notification requirements can not be proportionate in the absence of any right to a review . The challenge has been to the absence of any right to a review , not to some of the features of the notification requirements that have the potential to be particularly onerous . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He found that the notification requirements were capable of causing significant interference with LAW . However , he continued ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c ... This case turns , however , on CARDINAL critical issue . If some of those who are subject to lifetime notification requirements no longer pose any significant risk of committing further sexual offences and it is possible for them to demonstrate that this is the case , there is no point in subjecting them to supervision or management or to the interference with their article CARDINAL rights involved in visits to their local police stations in order to provide information about their places of residence and their travel plans . Indeed subjecting them to these requirements can only impose an unnecessary and unproductive burden on the responsible authorities . We were informed that there are now CARDINAL ex - offenders subject to notification requirements and this number will inevitably grow . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . No evidence has been placed before this court or the courts below that demonstrates that it is not possible to identify from among those convicted of serious offences , at any stage in their lives , some at least who pose no significant risk of re - offending . It is equally true that no evidence has been adduced that demonstrates that this is possible . This may well be because the necessary research has not been carried out to enable firm conclusions to be drawn on this topic . If uncertainty exists can this render proportionate the imposition of notification requirements for life without review under the precautionary principle ? I do not believe that it can .", "CARDINAL . ... I think that it is obvious that there must be some circumstances in which an appropriate tribunal could reliably conclude that the risk of an individual carrying out a further sexual offence can be discounted to the extent that continuance of notification requirements is unjustified . As the courts below have observed , it is open to the legislature to impose an appropriately high threshold for review . Registration systems for sexual offenders are not uncommon in other jurisdictions . Those acting for the first respondent have drawn attention to registration requirements for sexual offenders in GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . Almost all of these have provisions for review . This does not suggest that the review exercise is not practicable .", "CARDINAL .
