THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Sverre Erik Jebens;Vincent A. De Gaetano", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in NORP Town , GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr R Posner , a lawyer practising in GPE with ORG .", "On DATE , the applicant and another man , B , were stopped and arrested in a car that the applicant was driving . B was sitting in the front passenger seat when the car was stopped . The car was searched and , under the front passenger seat , under a flap in the carpet , a package containing heroin was discovered . The men were taken by police van to a police station and charged . The following day , a metal smoking pipe was found by a police officer , Special Constable M , in the police van , in the cubicle where B had been sitting . She also stated that she had heard a metal \u201c clang \u201d in the van when the men were being taken to the police station . The pipe was found to contain traces of cocaine .", "Each man blamed the other for placing the package in the car and denied all knowledge of it . At trial , a police officer , Police Constable W , gave evidence that , on the basis of a test he had conducted , it would have been impossible for someone sitting in the front passenger seat to place the package where it had been discovered . He had also tried the seat in different positions . On this basis , B was acquitted by the judge . The jury was discharged and a re - trial ordered in respect of the applicant .", "At the applicant \u2019s re - trial , PC W gave evidence and Special Constable M \u2019s statement as to the pipe was read to the jury . The applicant was convicted but , on appeal , his conviction was quashed on the basis of fresh expert evidence , which showed it would have been possible for a man of B \u2019s build , sitting in the passenger seat , to place the package . ORG , in quashing the conviction , ordered a second re - trial .", "At the second re - trial , PC W appeared to give different evidence to the effect that he did not move the seat to different positions . He was not cross - examined by the applicant on this inconsistency with his previous testimony because , for tactical reasons , the defence did not wish the jury to know about the previous trials . Special Constable M \u2019s statement was not read at this trial . The applicant did not give evidence in his own defence . In his summing up , the trial judge erroneously directed the jury that the pipe had been found in the car and contained traces of heroin , not cocaine . He nonetheless observed : \u201c you [ the jury ] may think that really nothing turns on the pipe in this case . It does not add or subtract to the case one way or another \u201d .", "The applicant was convicted and appealed . On appeal , he argued that : ( i ) had the trial judge been aware of Special Constable M \u2019s statement he would have directed the jury differently and the applicant would have been able to argue more strongly that B was a drug user , and was thus more likely to have placed the package ; ( ii ) PC W \u2019s change in evidence was highly material but , because of a tactical decision not to refer to the previous trials , he had been deprived of the ability to cross - examine him . The applicant also submitted that , since PC W \u2019s evidence had led to the discharge of B , it also deprived the applicant of the opportunity to cross - examine B. This deprived the applicant of the opportunity to put to B the allegation that the heroin belonged to him and that the applicant knew nothing about it .", "ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE ( [ DATE ] EWCA Crim CARDINAL ) . It gave the following reasons for its decision ( at paragraphs CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL of the judgment :", "\u201c ... The question is whether the conviction of the applicant at the third trial is unsafe . Is it unsafe by reason of any material irregularity in the procedure or by any misdirection of law by the judge ? The answer to each must be no .", "CARDINAL . We deal first with the fact that the evidence of [ Special Constable M ] was not adduced at the third trial . It is clear that this evidence had been adduced at the previous trial . It must have been clear to the applicant that it existed . We think that those who were advising the applicant must have realised of its existence . It is referred to , after all , at the front of the transcript of the summing up of the judge in the second trial . We find it difficult ( if not impossible ) to conclude that its existence was not known to the applicant and the defence team at the time of the third trial .", "CARDINAL . But , in any event , the evidence about the noise in the police van and finding the pipe in Mr [ B \u2019s ] cubicle in the van adds either nothing or very little to the case . The pipe was , as the judge said , of no consequence . It contained traces of cocaine , not heroin . The judge was mistaken when he referred to heroin in his summing up . The pipe is an irrelevance . It does not follow , in our view , that because Mr [ B ] dropped the pipe in the van , therefore he and he alone was concerned with the Class A drugs that were found in the car . We do not accept that [ Special Constable M \u2019s ] evidence would or might have materially affected the minds of the jury as concerns the guilt of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the error of the judge , if such it were , that the pipe had been found in the FAC car , is also an irrelevance . The pipe had nothing to do with the case against the applicant , as the judge made clear in his summing up . If anything , the remark of the judge about the pipe was helpful to the applicant \u2019s case on the third trial .", "CARDINAL . Thirdly , the fact that PC [ W ] had changed his evidence from that given at the first CARDINAL trials and that he now agreed with the experts was , on the face of it , highly favourable to the applicant . The effect was that the CARDINAL experts and PC [ W ] all agreed that it was possible for the heroin to be placed under the carpet under the front passenger seat by a person of PERSON [ B \u2019s ] height and build . It was easier when the seat was in the rear position , but could even have been done with the seat in a more forward position . That evidence all assisted the applicant \u2019s case that it was PERSON [ B ] who had the heroin and it was he who hid it under the carpet when the police arrived .", "CARDINAL . We are unable to see how it could have helped to cross examine PC [ W ] on his previous evidence when the evidence that he gave at the third trial was so much more favourable to the applicant \u2019s case . We do not accept the argument that if ORG [ which heard the first appeal against conviction and ordered the second re - trial ] had thought that the evidence of PC [ W ] was incorrect , then there would have been no retrial . The fact is that on the appeal the ORG knew that there was a possibility of discrepancy with his earlier evidence because they had received , and regarded as entirely credible , the evidence of the experts about how it was possible to get underneath the seat in whichever position it might be . Despite this potential discrepancy , and therefore the challenge effectively to PC [ W \u2019s ] version of the facts , ORG was still prepared to order a second retrial .", "CARDINAL . Accordingly , we have concluded that none of the points raised are capable of demonstrating even an arguable case that this conviction was unsafe . \u201d", "In GPE and GPE a witness is competent if he may lawfully give evidence and compellable if he may lawfully be required to give evidence . Competent witnesses are usually but not necessarily compellable ( [ DATE ] ORG \u2019s Criminal Pleading , Evidence and Practice at DATE ) .", "The test for competence is set out in section CARDINAL of ORG and Criminal Evidence Act DATE , which , where relevant , provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) At every stage in criminal proceedings all persons are ( whatever their age ) competent to give evidence .", "( CARDINAL ) Subsection ( CARDINAL ) has effect subject to subsections ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) .", "( CARDINAL ) A person is not competent to give evidence in criminal proceedings if it appears to the court that he is not a person who is able to\u2014", "( a ) understand questions put to him as a witness , and", "( b ) give answers to them which can be understood .", "( CARDINAL ) A person charged in criminal proceedings is not competent to give evidence in the proceedings for the prosecution ( whether he is the only person , or is CARDINAL of CARDINAL or more persons , charged in the proceedings ) .", "( CARDINAL ) In subsection ( CARDINAL ) the reference to a person charged in criminal proceedings does not include a person who is not , or is no longer , liable to be convicted of any offence in the proceedings ( whether as a result of pleading guilty or for any other reason ) . \u201d", "The effect of subsections ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) is that a co - accused may only give evidence for the prosecution if he ceases to be a co - accused , for example when he has been acquitted .", "In addition , under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , a person charged in criminal proceedings shall not be called as a witness \u201c except upon his own application \u201d . Therefore , a co - accused can only become a competent and compellable witness for any other co - accused once he or she ceases to be a person charged , for example because he or she pleads guilty or is acquitted ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
