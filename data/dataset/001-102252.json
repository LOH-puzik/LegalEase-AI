NORP The public prosecutor 's authority to decide whether to press charges , however , is bound by the principle of legality which requires that he must act whenever there is a reasonable suspicion that a crime subject to prosecution ex officio has been committed . It makes no difference whether the public prosecutor has learned of the incident from a criminal complaint filed by the victim or another person , or indeed even if he has only heard rumours to that effect .", "DATE .

In any event , neither a public prosecutor nor a victim acting in the capacity of a subsidiary prosecutor may request the institution of a formal criminal procedure in the absence of information as to the identity of the alleged perpetrator .", "CARDINAL . It is noted , however , that domestic courts have held in the past that as regards the crime of incitement to ethnic , racial or religious hatred and intolerance society as a whole had to be deemed a victim , not the aggrieved individual personally , meaning that the latter could only , following a possible prosecutorial dismissal , take over the prosecution of the case for another , lesser crime ( opinion adopted at the joint session of ORG , ORG , and ORG of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The relevant paragraphs of this report read as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG is concerned to note that ... there is a climate of hostility against religious minorities [ in GPE ] . This climate is partly created by certain media outlets and politicians . Members of these groups are also attacked , sometimes by members of neo - NORP or far - right groups , and their places of worship are vandalised and/or deliberately set on fire . Despite a decrease in the number of these attacks over DATE , NGOs , some of which have counted CARDINAL attacks per year , note that they have become more violent . Religious communities appear reluctant to report these attacks or talk about them publicly . This might be because the police and the judicial apparatus do not always respond appropriately to this problem . Religious communities deplore the fact that few persons are brought to justice for perpetrating these acts and that those found guilty are often only sentenced to a fine .", "...", "DATE . There is currently a certain climate of hostility in GPE against ... religious groups [ , ] which is fuelled by a number of media outlets and politicians . Far - right groups also help to generate negative feelings towards these communities ... NGOs condemn a certain tendency on the authorities ' part to downplay this climate of intolerance against ... religious minorities and the fact that they have taken few steps to remedy it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Forum DATE is a NORP , NORP , charitable web and e - mail initiative . It provides \u201c original reporting and analysis on violations of the freedom of thought , conscience and belief of all people , whatever their religious affiliation , in an objective , truthful and timely manner \u201d .", "\u201c ... The number of attacks on GPE 's religious communities appears to continue to be declining ... However , the attacks themselves seem to be becoming more violent and , as in DATE , members of religious minorities are especially likely to be attacked . The police continue to be apparently unwilling to protect members of religious minorities or religious sites at risk of attack DATE even if they have already been attacked . Members of religious minorities have in DATE been beaten and stabbed , and places of worship have been the targets of arson attacks . Places of worship of ORG have occasionally been robbed , but the vast majority of attacks have been on ... religious minority individuals and property ... \u201d", "\u201c Despite continuing attacks on religious communities over DATE , ORG has found that NORP authorities appear to be taking few steps to protect their citizens . An extreme illustration of the unwillingness of the authorities to provide justice to religious minority victims is the case of \u017divota Milanovi\u0107 , the only PERSON devotee in GPE ... \u201d", "\u201c ... The most serious problem affecting religion or belief in GPE has been violent attacks , along with the problem of the authorities having shown a lack of willingness to catch and convict the attackers . However , annual surveys by ORG have shown that the numbers of attacks are declining , with fewer attacks in DATE and DATE compared to DATE . GPE 's desire to join ORG , along with politicians placing greater weight on GPE becoming a more open country , appears to be influencing popular attitudes , and hence the possibility of attacks . Many of the attacks and threats against ' non - traditional ' religious communities appear to be by extreme nationalists who think that the communities are in some sense traitors to the nation ... There is a lack of consistency in whether attackers are arrested and court proceedings brought against them . The CARDINAL Serbian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion , and bars the fomenting of religious intolerance and hatred . However , members of religious minorities have told Forum CARDINAL that these ideals have yet to become reality in their DATE experience . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
