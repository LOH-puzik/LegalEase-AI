In the statement to the Prosecutor he was recorded as having complained of having been left naked with cold water being poured on him , of torture by electricity and of having had his testicles squeezed . However the electricity claim was incorrect . He had signed his statement to ORG without reading it over , as nothing detrimental had been said about him .
