In DATE the first applicant turned to the child welfare authorities because she was pregnant and was in a difficult situation : she did not have a permanent home and was temporarily staying with her parents , the fourth and fifth applicants .", "CARDINAL . When the first applicant was CARDINAL GPE pregnant she visited the local hospital and requested a late abortion . On DATE the hospital sent a notice to the child welfare authorities indicating that the applicant was in need of guidance concerning the unborn child and follow - up with regard to motherhood . It also indicated that she needed to stay at a parent - child institution ( \u201c family centre \u201d ) . The child welfare authorities opened a case with the first applicant \u2019s consent . She agreed to stay at a family centre for DATE after the child was born , so that her ability to give the child adequate care could be evaluated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant gave birth to a son , PERSON , the second applicant . The identity of PERSON \u2019s father was unknown to the authorities and the first applicant refused to reveal his name . DATE , on DATE , the first applicant and PERSON moved to the family centre . For DATE the fourth applicant ( X \u2019s grandmother ) also stayed with them . The staff soon became concerned about the first applicant \u2019s parenting abilities and ORG development . On DATE they asked for an emergency meeting with the child welfare authorities because X had lost a lot of weight and the first applicant did not show any understanding of his needs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant withdrew her consent to stay at the family centre . She wanted to leave and take X with her . On DATE the child welfare authorities decided to take X into immediate compulsory care and place him in a foster home on an emergency basis . In the decision they stated that the family centre \u2019s staff had had to check on the family TIME to make sure that X was receiving enough food . Without those checks , they doubted whether X would have survived . After the placement , the first applicant had DATE TIME visits with X. The fourth applicant ( the grandmother ) was present at most of the visits , the fifth ( the grandfather ) at some of them .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the decision of the child welfare authorities to ORG ( fylkesnemnda for barnevern og sosiale saker ) , claiming that she and X could live together with her parents . Her mother , the fourth applicant , was staying at home and was willing to help take care of X. They were also willing to accept help from the child welfare authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the family centre drew up a report of the first and second ORG stay . The report stated , inter alia :", "\u201c The mother does not care for her child in a satisfactory manner . During the time the mother and child have stayed [ at the family centre ] ... , the staff here ... have been very concerned that the child \u2019s needs are not being met . In order to ensure that the child \u2019s primary needs for care and food are met , the staff has intervened and followed - up the child closely day and night .", "The mother is not able to meet the boy \u2019s practical care needs . She has not taken responsibility for caring for the boy in a satisfactory manner . The mother has needed guidance at a very basic level , and she has needed advice to be repeated to her several times .", "Throughout the stay , the mother has made statements that we find very worrying . She has expressed a significant lack of empathy for her son , and has several times expressed disgust with the child . The mother has demonstrated very little understanding of what the boy understands and what behaviours he can control .", "The mother \u2019s mental functioning is inconsistent and she struggles considerably in several areas that are crucial to the ability to provide care . Her ability to provide practical care must be seen in light of this . The mother \u2019s mental health is marked by difficult and painful feelings about who she herself is and how she perceives other people . The mother herself seems to have a considerable unmet care need .", "Our assessment is that the mother is incapable of providing care for the child . We are also of the opinion that the mother needs support and follow - up . As we have verbally communicated to the child welfare service , we believe it to be important that the mother is taken especially closely care of in the time following the emergency placement .", "The mother is vulnerable . She should be offered a psychological assessment and treatment , and probably needs help to find motivation for this . The mother should have an individual plan to ensure follow - up in several areas . The mother has resources ( cf . the abilities tests ) that she needs help to make good use of . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It concluded that it was the first applicant who would be responsible for the DATE care of X , not the fourth applicant , and that the first applicant was unable to provide the care that X needed . Furthermore , the fourth applicant had stayed with the first applicant and PERSON during DATE at the family centre , but had not noticed the first applicant \u2019s lack of parenting skills , even though it had been obvious to the staff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE X was sent to a child psychiatry clinic for an evaluation . The team at the clinic carried out CARDINAL different observations DATE . Their conclusions were set out in a report dated DATE , which read , inter alia :", "\u201c [ X ] was a child with significantly delayed development when he was sent to us for evaluation and observations . DATE he is functioning as a normal DATE baby , and has the possibility of a good normal development . He has , from what can be observed , been a child at high risk . For vulnerable children the lack of response and confirmation , or other interferences in interaction , can lead to more or less serious psychological and developmental disturbances if they do not get other corrective relationship experiences . The quality of the earliest interaction between a child and the closest caregiver is therefore of great importance for psychosocial and cognitive development . [ X ] bears the mark of good psychosocial and cognitive development now . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE to ORG ( tingrett ) which , on DATE , upheld it in full . In the judgment the court found that X had shown signs of both psychological and physical neglect when he was taken into local authority care . Moreover , it did not find that the first applicant \u2019s abilities to take care of X had improved or that the support of the fourth and fifth applicants would be sufficient to ensure that PERSON was given adequate care . The first applicant did not appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . Following the judgment by ORG on DATE , the local authorities applied to ORG for a care order , submitting that the first applicant lacked parenting skills .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG accepted the child welfare authorities\u2019 application . X remained in the foster home where he had already been placed on an emergency basis in DATE , when first taken into care ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG also decided that contact rights for the first applicant should be fixed at TIME visits per year , under supervision . It concluded , on the basis of the report from the family centre , that if X were returned to the first applicant , there would be serious deficiencies in both the physical and psychological caregiving , which could not be remedied with assistance measures . For those reasons the ORG found that it would be in the best interests of X to be placed in care .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the ORG \u2019s decision and again submitted that the authorities had not tried to intervene in other ways before immediately taking X into care , and that the decision was based on insufficient evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG overturned the ORG \u2019s decision and decided that X should be reunited with the first applicant , but that there was a need for a readjustment period . It found , inter alia , that GPE \u2019s problems with weight gain could have been due to an eye infection .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence of the judgment , the first applicant \u2019s visits with X were increased with the goal of reunification . According to the child welfare authorities , the visits were characterised by hostility from the first applicant and her parents towards the foster mother . The authorities claimed that after the visits , X had reacted strongly , he had become tired , anxious and insecure , and his sleeping patterns had changed .", "CARDINAL . The child welfare authorities appealed against ORG judgment and concurrently applied for its implementation to be suspended . They claimed that it was unlikely that the eye infection could have been the reason for PERSON \u2019s slow weight gain . Moreover , the first applicant had had visits with X , but they had not worked well even though she had been given advice on how to improve them . X had had strong reactions after the visits .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided to suspend enforcement of its judgment until ORG had adjudicated the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the child welfare authorities decided to appoint CARDINAL experts , a psychologist , ORG , and a family therapist , E.W.A. , who submitted their report on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , ORG ( lagmannsrett ) granted leave to appeal on the ground that the ruling of , or the procedure in , ORG had been seriously flawed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It also upheld ORG decision to suspend the implementation of the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the High Court appointed an expert to assess the case , psychologist PERSON , who also submitted a report .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG confirmed the ORG \u2019s decision that X should be taken into compulsory care . It also reduced the first applicant \u2019s contact rights to CARDINAL TIME visits per year .", "CARDINAL . ORG had regard to the information in the report produced by the family centre on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also took account of the family consultant \u2019s testimony before the court , in which it had been stated that the first applicant \u2019s mother had lived with her at the family centre for DATE . It went on to state :", "\u201c It was particularly after this time that concerns grew about the practical care of the child . The agreement was that [ the first applicant ] was to report all nappy changes etc . and meals , but she did not . The child slept more than they were used to . [ The family consultant ] reacted to the child \u2019s breathing and that he was sleeping through meals . Due to weight loss , he was to be fed TIME around the clock . Sometimes , the staff had to pressure the mother into feeding her son . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court found that the family centre had made a correct evaluation and DATE contrary to ORG \u2013 considered it very unlikely that the evaluation would have been different if X had not had an eye infection .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG referred to the report of DATE from the child psychiatry clinic ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also took into account the report of the court - appointed expert , PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As the stay at the family centre had been short , ORG found it appropriate to consider the first applicant \u2019s behaviour ( \u201c fungering \u201d ) during the contact sessions that had been organised subsequent to X \u2019s placement in foster care . CARDINAL persons had been entrusted with the task of supervising the sessions , and both had written reports , none of which had been positive . ORG stated that CARDINAL of the supervisors had given an \u201c overall negative description of the contact sessions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG also referred to the report of the psychologist and the family therapist appointed by the child welfare authorities ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . They had assessed X in relation to the reactions that he had shown after visits from the first applicant . In their report , they noted , inter alia :", "\u201c there does not seem to be much contact between the mother and [ X ] , including in the periods with frequent contact sessions . He turns away from his mother and prefers to seek contact with others . He tries to distance and protect himself by protesting against his mother , by refusing to eat , by not looking at her and then seeking out the person to whom he has a secure attachment , namely his foster mother . [ X ] becomes uncertain and insecure when he is not \u2018 read\u2019 and understood .", "...", "... the biggest source of stress for [ X ] is probably not meeting his mother and her extended family during the contact sessions in itself , but the amount of contact and the pressure arising from [ utterances to the effect that ] \u2018 now you \u2019re coming back home\u2019 , and an atmosphere dominated by the mother \u2019s hostility towards the foster mother . It is also a problem that the mother makes negative and offensive statements about the foster mother , so that the atmosphere becomes unpleasant and insecure . It is concluded that [ X ] has reached his tolerance threshold for contact on the occasions when he has fallen asleep immediately once the contact session is over , when he has cried afterwards , been difficult to regulate and calm down , and had difficulties sleeping . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG noted that the court - appointed psychologist , PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , stated in court that the contact sessions had appeared to be so negative that she was of the opinion that the mother should not have right of access to her son . The contact sessions were , in her view , \u201c not constructive for the child \u201d . In conclusion to the question of the first applicant \u2019s competence as a carer , she stated in her report that the stay at the family centre had illustrated that the first applicant \u201c had problems handling and retaining information in such a manner that it could be used to guide her behaviour \u201d . She went on to state :", "\u201c It is not a question of a lack of willingness , but of an inadequate ability to plan , organise and structure . Such manifestations of cognitive impairment will be invasive in relation to caring for the child and could result in neglect . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court agreed with the conclusion of expert GPE , before proceeding to the question whether assistance measures could sufficiently remedy the shortcomings in the first applicant \u2019s lack of parenting skills . In that respect , it noted that the reasons for the deficiencies in competence as a carer were crucial . ORG referred at this point to the expert \u2019s elaboration on the first applicant \u2019s medical history , namely how she had suffered from serious epilepsy since childhood and until brain surgery had been carried out in DATE , when the first applicant had been DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that expert PERSON had also pointed out that the first applicant \u2019s medical history must necessarily have affected her childhood in several ways . Her summary as regards the illness and its consequences read as follows :", "\u201c Anamnestic information from the school , the specialist health service and the family provides an overall picture of weak learning capacity and social functioning from early childhood into adulthood . [ The first applicant ] performed poorly at school despite good framework conditions , considerable extra resources and good efforts and motivation on her own part . It is therefore difficult to see any other explanation for her performance than general learning difficulties caused by a fundamental cognitive impairment . This is underlined by her consistently low IQ score \u2013 regardless of the epilepsy surgery . She also had problems with socio - emotional functioning , which has also been a recurring topic in all documents that deal with [ the first applicant \u2019s ] childhood and adolescence . A lack of social skills and social adaptation is reported , primarily related to social behaviour that is not adequate for her age ( \u2018 ORG ) and poor impulse control . It is also stated that [ the first applicant ] has been very reserved and had low self - confidence , which must be seen in conjunction with her problems . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court based its assessment on the description of expert GPE concerning the first applicant \u2019s health problems and the impact they had had on her social skills and development . It further noted that placement at a family centre ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) had been attempted as an assistance measure . The stay had been supposed to last for DATE , but had been interrupted after DATE . As a condition for staying longer , the first applicant had demanded a guarantee that she be allowed to take her son home with her after the stay . The child welfare authorities could not give such a guarantee , and the first applicant had therefore returned home on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that relevant assistance measures were assumed to consist of a supervisor and further help and training in how to care for children . However , ORG found that it would take so long to provide the first applicant with sufficient training that it was not a real alternative to continued foster - home placement . Furthermore , the result of such training was uncertain . In this connection , ORG attached weight to the fact that both the first applicant and her immediate family had said that they did not want follow - up or assistance if PERSON was returned to them . It agreed with the conclusions of the court - appointed expert , PERSON , who had stated in her report :", "\u201c In my assessment , there are grounds for claiming that there were serious deficiencies in the care the child received from the mother , and also serious deficiencies in terms of the personal contact and security he needed according to his age and development . [ The first applicant \u2019s ] cognitive impairment , personality functioning and inadequate ability to mentalise make it impossible to have a normal conversation with her about the physical and psychological needs of small children . Her assessments of the consequences of having the child returned to her care and what it will demand of her as a parent are very limited and infantile , with her own immediate needs , there and then , as the most predominant feature . It is therefore found that there is a risk of such deficiencies ( as mentioned above ) continuing if the child were to live with his mother . It is also found that satisfactory conditions for the child can not be created with the mother by means of assistance measures under the LAW relating to ORG , section CARDINAL - CARDINAL ( e.g. relief measures in the home or other parental support measures ) , due to a lack of trust and a reluctance to accept interference from the authorities \u2013 taking the case history into consideration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The High Court \u2019s conclusions in its judgment of DATE was that a care order was necessary and that assistance measures for the mother would not be sufficient to allow the son to stay with her . The conditions for issuing a care order under the second paragraph of section CARDINAL of LAW were thus met ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In this connection , ORG also gave weight to the attachment that X had formed to his foster parents , particularly the foster mother .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant did not lodge an appeal against the judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the child welfare authorities requested ORG to deprive the first applicant of her parental responsibility for X , which would then be transferred to the authorities , and to grant PERSON \u2019s foster parents , with whom he had stayed since he was taken into care ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , permission to adopt him . The identity of X \u2019s biological father was still unknown to the authorities . In the alternative , the authorities\u2019 proposed that the first applicant \u2019s contact rights be removed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant applied for termination of the care order or , in the alternative , extended contact rights with X.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant gave birth to Y , the third applicant . She had married the father of Y in DATE . The new family had moved to a different municipality . When the child welfare authorities in the first applicant \u2019s former municipality became aware that she had given birth to another child , it sent a letter expressing concern to the new municipality , which started an investigation into her parenting abilities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL and DATE ORG , composed of a lawyer , a psychologist and a lay person , held an oral hearing at which the first applicant was present together with her legal representative . CARDINAL witnesses were heard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided that the first applicant should be deprived of her parental responsibility for PERSON and that X \u2019s foster parents should be allowed to adopt him . The Board found that there was nothing in the case to indicate that the first applicant \u2019s parenting abilities had improved since ORG judgment of DATE . Therefore she was still considered incapable of giving NORP adequate care . Moreover , the Board stated :", "\u201c In her statement before ORG , the mother maintained her view that the care order was a conspiracy between the child welfare service , [ the parent - child institution ] and the foster parents for the purpose of \u2018 helping a woman who is unable to have ORG . In the mother \u2019s words , it was a question of \u2018 an advance order for a child\u2019 . The mother had not realised that she had neglected [ X ] , and stated that she spent most of her time and energy on \u2018 the ORG .", "The reports from the contact sessions between the mother and [ X ] consistently show that she is still unable to focus on [ X ] and what is best for him , but is influenced by her very negative view of the foster mother and of the child welfare service .", "[ The first applicant ] has married and had another child DATE . Psychologist [ GPE ] has stated before ORG that he observed good interaction between the mother and child and that the mother takes good care of the child . ORG takes note of this information . In ORG opinion , this observation can in any case not be used as a basis for concluding that the mother has competence as a caregiver for [ X ] .", "ORG finds it reasonable to assume that [ X ] is a particularly vulnerable child . He experienced serious and life - threatening neglect during DATE of his life . Reference is also made to the fact that there have been many contact sessions with the mother , some of which have been very stressful for [ X ] . All in all , he has been through a lot . He has lived in the foster home for DATE and does not know his biological mother . If [ X ] were to be returned to the care of his mother , this would require , among other things , a great capacity to empathise with and understand [ X ] and the problems he would experience , not least in the form of mourning and missing his foster parents . The mother and her family appeared to be completely devoid of any such empathy and understanding . Both the mother and grandmother stated that it would not be a problem , \u2018 he just had to be distracted\u2019 , and thus gave the impression of not having sympathy with the boy and therefore also being incapable of providing the psychological care he would need in the event of a return . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In addition , ORG had especially noted the conclusions of expert PERSON They were quoted by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . ORG found that this description of the first applicant was still accurate . In any event , it was decisive that X had established such a connection to his foster family that removing him would result in serious and permanent problems for him .", "CARDINAL . The ORG assumed that the alternative to adoption would have been continued foster care on a long - term basis , and noted that the foster parents were X \u2019s main caregivers and the ones he thought of as his parents . The foster parents were moreover considered suitable and wanted to take care of X as their own child . The ORG made general reference to ORG decision in PERSON ( Rt . ) DATE page CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and found that the considerations underlying the following passage from that judgment \u2013 reiterated in GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE \u2013 were also pertinent to the present case :", "\u201c \u2018 A decision that he should remain a foster child would tell him that the people with whom he has always lived and who are his parents and with whom he established his earliest ties and sense of belonging should remain under the control of ORG \u2014 the public authorities \u2014 and that they are not viewed by society as his true parents but rather as foster parents under an agreement that can be terminated . ... \u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the adoption would be in GPE \u2019s best interests . ORG took LAW into consideration when making its decision .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the decision , claiming that the ORG had made a wrongful evaluation of the evidence when deciding that she was unable to give NORP adequate care . She considered that it would be in PERSON \u2019s best interest to be returned to her and stressed that her situation had changed drastically . The first applicant was now married and had another child that she was taking care of . She had a good support system in her husband and her extended family , and was also prepared to accept help from the child welfare authorities . Moreover , in her view , removing X from the foster home would only cause him problems in the short term ; no long - term problems could be expected . She also claimed that the visits between her and X had worked well .", "CARDINAL . The child welfare authorities opposed the appeal and submitted that the first applicant \u2019s ability to care for X had not changed since ORG judgment of DATE . The visits between X and the first applicant had not worked well . She had had outbursts during the visits and had left before the time was up . Afterwards X had reacted negatively . The first applicant and her mother had manifested a very negative attitude towards the authorities . Moreover , X had a good attachment to his foster family and had lived with them for DATE . He was a vulnerable child and he needed a caregiver who was sensitive to his needs . They also noted that the first applicant had exposed X and their story on the Internet , together with pictures of them , which could be harmful for X. It was in the best interests of X to be adopted by the foster family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , comprised of CARDINAL professional judge , CARDINAL psychologist and CARDINAL lay person , in accordance with section CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , upheld the decision after having held an oral hearing which lasted for DATE and during which CARDINAL witnesses were heard . The first applicant was present together with her legal counsel .", "CARDINAL . ORG initially noted that the first applicant \u2019s general situation had improved . She had married in DATE , her husband had a permanent job and they had a daughter , Y. It also noted that the child welfare authorities in the couple \u2019s current municipality were conducting an ongoing inquiry concerning the mother \u2019s ability to care for Y. A staff member of the authorities in that new municipality had testified at the oral hearing , stating that they had not received any reports of concern other than that from the authorities in the first applicant \u2019s former municipality . As part of their inquiry they had made observations at the first applicant \u2019s home . They had observed many good things but also that the parents might need some help with routines and structure . ORG found that this indicated that the authorities in the municipality to which the first applicant had moved thought that the parents could give Y adequate care if assisted by the authorities . She was not a child with any special care needs .", "CARDINAL . However , on the basis of the evidence , the situation was different with regard to X , whom several experts had described as a vulnerable child . ORG referred in particular to a statement from a professional at FAC and ORG Psychiatric Out - Patient Clinic ( Barne- og ungdomspsykiatrisk poliklinikk \u2013 BUP ) explaining that , as late as DATE , X was easily stressed and needed a lot of quiet , security and support . If he was to have a sound emotional development in the future , the carer would have to be aware of that and take it into account . When the first applicant gave evidence in court , she had clearly shown that she did not realise what challenges she would face if X were to be moved from the foster home . She could not see his vulnerability , her primary concern being that he should grow up \u201c where he belonged \u201d . The first applicant believed that returning him would be unproblematic and still did not understand why the child welfare authorities had had to intervene when he was placed in the emergency foster home . She had not wished to say anything about how she thought X was doing in the foster home . In ORG view , the first applicant would not be sufficiently able to see or understand PERSON \u2019s special care needs , and if those needs were not met , there would be a considerable risk of abnormal development .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , ORG took account of how the foster parents and supervisor had described PERSON \u2019s emotional reactions after contact sessions with his mother in the form of inconsolable crying and his needing a lot of sleep . During the contact sessions , X had repeatedly resisted contact with the first applicant and , as the sessions had progressed , reacted with what had been described as resignation . ORG considered that a possible reason for that could be that the boy was vulnerable to inexpedient interaction and information that was not adapted to his age and functioning . The first applicant \u2019s emotional outbursts in situations during the contact sessions , for example when PERSON had sought out his foster mother and called her \u201c mummy \u201d , were seen as potentially frightening and not conducive to X \u2019s development .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the presentation of evidence had \u201c clearly shown \u201d that the \u201c fundamental limitations \u201d that had existed at the time of ORG judgment still applied . Nothing had emerged during ORG consideration of the case to indicate that the first applicant had developed a more positive attitude to the child welfare authorities or to the foster mother , beyond a statement made by her to the extent that she was willing to cooperate . She had snubbed the foster mother when she had said hello during the contact sessions and had never asked for information about X. The first applicant had left in frustration TIME before the last visit had been scheduled to end . Everyone who had been present during the contact sessions had described the atmosphere as unpleasant . ORG considered that CARDINAL possible reason why the first applicant \u2019s competence at contact sessions had not improved was that she struggled so much with her own feelings and with missing PERSON , that it made her incapable of considering the child \u2019s perspective and protecting him from her own emotional outbursts . An improvement was contingent upon her understanding PERSON and his needs and on her being willing to work on herself and her own weaknesses . The first applicant had not shown any positive developments in her competence in contact situations throughout DATE she had had rights of access . The fact that her parents , the fourth and fifth applicants , had a remarkably negative attitude to the municipal child welfare authorities did not make it any easier for her .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant had claimed in court that she was a victim of injustice and that she would fight until PERSON was returned to her . To shed light on her own situation , she had chosen to post her story on the Internet in DATE with a photograph of herself and X. In that article and several comments posted during the DATE , she had made serious accusations against the child welfare authorities and the foster parents DATE accusations which she had admitted in court were untrue . The first applicant did not consider that public exposure and repeated legal proceedings could be harmful for the child in the long term .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that psychologist PERSON , who had examined and treated the first applicant , had testified that she did not meet the criteria for any psychiatric diagnosis . He had counselled her in connection with the trauma inflicted on her by having her child taken away . The goal of the treatment had been to make the first applicant feel like a good mother . He believed that the previous assessments of the first applicant \u2019s ability to provide care had at that time been incorrect , and argued before ORG that the best outcome for X would be to be returned to his biological mother . However , ORG stated that psychologist PERSON \u2019s arguments had been based on research conducted in DATE , and found them to be incompatible with recent infant research . It noted that the other experts who had testified in court , including psychologists ORG and GPE , had advised against returning PERSON to his mother , as this would be very harmful for him .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion thus far , ORG agreed with ORG that the first applicant had not changed in such a way as to indicate that it was highly probable that she would be able to provide X with proper care . It endorsed ORG grounds , holding that the first applicant \u2019s clear limitations as a carer could not be mitigated by an adapted transitional scheme , assistance measures or support from her network . It did not find reason to discuss other arguments regarding her ability to provide care in more detail , as returning PERSON to her was in any case not an option owing to the serious problems it would cause him to be moved from the foster home . ORG agreed at this point with ORG in its finding that X had developed such attachment to his foster parents , his foster brother and the general foster home environment that it would lead to serious problems if he would have to move . X had his primary security and belonging in the foster home and he perceived the foster parents as his psychological parents . On those grounds , the care order could not be revoked .", "CARDINAL . Turning to the issues of deprivation of parental responsibility and consent to adoption , ORG stated at the outset that when a care order has been issued , it is in principle sufficient for removal of parental rights that this is in the child \u2019s best interests . At the same time , it had been emphasised in several ORG judgments that removal of parental responsibility is a very invasive decision and that therefore strong reasons are required for making such a decision ( see , inter alia , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The requirements in respect of adoption were even more stringent . However , the questions of deprivation of parental responsibility and consent to adoption had to be seen in conjunction , since the primary reason for depriving someone of parental responsibility would be to facilitate adoption . The court also took into consideration that if the mother retained her parental responsibility , she might engage in conflicts in the future about the rights that such responsibility entailed , such as exposing the child on the Internet .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to declare that adoption could only be granted if the CARDINAL conditions in the third paragraph of section CARDINAL of LAW were met ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . In the present case , the decisive factor would be whether adoption was in GPE \u2019s best interests and whether consent for adoption should be given on the basis of an overall assessment . Regarding that assessment , several ORG judgments had stated that strong reasons must exist for consenting to adoption against the will of a biological parent . There must be a high degree of certainty that adoption would be in the child \u2019s best interests . It was also clear that the decision must be based not only on a concrete assessment , but also on general experience from child - psychology research . Reference was made to ORG judgment in GPE . DATE page CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Applying the general principles to the instant case , ORG first noted that PERSON was at the time DATE and had lived in his foster home since he was DATE . His fundamental attachment in the social and psychological sense was to his foster parents , and it would in any event be a long - term placement . X was moreover a vulnerable child , and adoption would help to strengthen his sense of belonging with his foster parents , whom he regarded as his parents . It was particularly important to a child \u2019s development to experience a secure and sound attachment to its psychological parents . Adoption would give X a sense of belonging and security in DATE for longer than the period a foster - home relationship would last . Practical considerations also indicated that persons who had care and control of a child and who in reality functioned as its parents should attend to the functions that followed from parental responsibility .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that adoption meant that the legal ties to the biological family were broken . In its opinion , X , despite spending DATE of his life with his mother and having many contact sessions , had not bonded psychologically with her . That had remained the case even though he had been told at a later stage that the first applicant had given birth to him .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court took account of the fact that even if no more contact sessions were organised , the foster parents had taken a positive view of letting X contact his biological parent if he so wished .", "CARDINAL . Based on an overall assessment , ORG found that it would be in PERSON \u2019s best interests for the first applicant to be deprived of her parental responsibility and for the foster parents to be allowed to adopt him . The court believed that particularly weighty reasons existed for consenting to adoption in the case .", "CARDINAL . ORG lastly stated that since it had decided that X should be adopted , it was unable to decide on contact rights for the first applicant , since that question would be up to the foster parents to decide on . It mentioned that section CARDINAL of LAW provided a legal basis for fixing rights to access subsequent to adoption ( see paragraph CARDINAL below , where that provision is reiterated , and paragraph CARDINAL below , on the \u201c open adoption\u201d-system ) . ORG was , however , not competent to examine or decide on such rights since its competence was dependent on a party to the case having made a request to that effect . In the instant case , none of the parties had done so .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the judgment , claiming that ORG had evaluated the evidence incorrectly when considering her ability to give X the necessary care . She also argued that ORG should have obtained an evaluation by an expert witness concerning her and her husband \u2019s ability to provide adequate care . She submitted an evaluation made by the municipality in which she currently lived , dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG decided not to grant leave to appeal . It stated that the case did not raise any new legal issues of importance for the uniform application of the law . As concerned the new evidence , the court noted that the evaluation dated DATE had been made by , inter alia , an expert who had testified before ORG and that the document would not change the outcome of the case . Moreover , it observed that the first applicant had not asked for an expert witness to be heard in ORG and had not given any reasons as to why it was necessary to appoint an expert before ORG . Thus there were no reasons for leave to appeal to be granted .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed against the decision to ORG ( PERSON ) which , on DATE , refused leave to appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
