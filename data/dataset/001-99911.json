The Government claimed that after that meeting , PERSON had refused to go to see the prosecutor . They produced CARDINAL summonses dated DATE and DATE informing PERSON that her failure to appear before the prosecutor would lead to the discontinuance of the proceedings , and to which PERSON had allegedly failed to respond . They also submitted CARDINAL alleged acknowledgments of receipt of various summonses which had been addressed to PERSON , none of which containing her signature .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted in reply that PERSON had not received any of these summonses . He stated that the prosecutor had met PERSON on DATE but had not asked her any questions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor - in - chief , ORG , submitted a written request to ORG for a copy of the file concerning the alleged car accident of DATE and for information regarding the medical report prepared when PERSON had been taken into the police lock - up .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG responded that the file on the car accident was at the prosecutor 's office for the CARDINALth district . They further indicated that , according to Instruction no .

On DATE the military prosecutor again requested the medical report that had been drawn up when PERSON had been taken into police custody .", "On DATE FAC no . CARDINAL indicated that PERSON medical file had been sent to ORG . It appears from this medical file that the first entries were made on DATE , shortly before PERSON transfer to ORG . The file did not contain any mention of an X - ray that had , allegedly , been performed .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the military prosecutor received the investigation file concerning the alleged car incident on DATE . It appears from this file that on the said date PERSON had been charged only with the offence of driving a car without a valid licence plate . The file contains no mention of any collision with or of any damage to any other vehicle or of any injury to any person .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor PERSON ordered the preparation of a forensic medical report on the body of the deceased by experts from ORG . The experts were asked to express an opinion on the cause of death and to say whether , in their view , the measures taken by the medical staff who had treated PERSON had been correct and appropriate having regard to his condition . They were further asked to advise on whether any signs of injury were evident in the genital area of the deceased and , if so , on the nature of such injury and on the duration of time that would have been required for its healing . A colour photograph showing bruising in the area of the victim 's genitalia which had been submitted by the family was attached to the order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in response to the request of the public prosecutor , PERSON , who had performed the autopsy on DATE , ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) produced his second forensic report , in which he reiterated his previous findings . In addition , he stated that the broken ribs \u201c had no vital character \u201d and that the fracture of the mid - clavicular line \u201c could have been produced post mortem \u201d , during the cardiac resuscitation that was , apparently , carried out at ORG . Moreover , in his opinion , the bruising in the genital area as indicated on the photograph had also been produced post mortem , such bruising being a very common occurrence in his experience .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor decided , in the light of the additional forensic report , not to open criminal investigations into the allegations both of physical assault resulting in the death of the victim and of an inadequate investigation by ORG and PERSON His decision , which was far briefer in its rationale than the decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL ) , concluded that PERSON death was due to \u201c a cardiopathy of a person with pre - existent visceral pathology \u201d and had not constituted a criminal act .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted CARDINAL expert opinions by forensic pathologists , the first by Professor Dr PERSON , from the \u201c PERSON \u201d ORG in GPE , dated DATE , and the second by Professor Dr PERSON , a NORP forensic expert , dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . In his report , Professor PERSON explained that a pulmonary thromboembolism was a sudden biological event which appeared without any symptoms . He noted that PERSON had had a child who had died at DATE and DATE because of a thrombosis of the inferior vena cava , owing to a congenital anomaly of the venous system , and he concluded that it was , therefore , reasonable to suppose that Mr Carabulea had presented similar anomalies of the venous system which had predisposed him to the development of a thrombosis . The report stressed that the alleged traffic accident had not caused any external or internal lesions and that there was no causal link whatsoever between the alleged traffic accident and the appearance of pulmonary thromboembolism and of the thrombophlebitis of the left limb , the first manifestation of which was evidenced on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Professor PERSON 's report described the history of PERSON treatment and subsequent death , as recorded in the medical records that had been presented to him , which he described as \u201c poorly kept \u201d . He noted that when PERSON had arrived at ORG , he was in serious ill - health and had been vomiting blood and that by the time he was transferred to ORG , at TIME , he was in a generalised life - threatening condition requiring admission to the intensive care unit with the intention of addressing , immediately , the problem of saving his life . Life - saving measures having been taken , PERSON was then transferred to ORG on DATE with a diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism . A computerised tomography performed there disclosed a lesion on the surface of the liver , while an ultrasound examination revealed some emboli in the small peripheral arteries of the lung . As a result of these findings , the doctors had been faced with the following dilemma : if the medical treatment required to limit the normal clotting mechanism of the blood ( the emboli ) was to be administered , then this ran the risk of exacerbating the liver haemorrhage which , as a consequence , might in itself have become life - threatening . Therefore , the doctors had administered the anti - coagulant with caution in order to prevent further haemorrhage around the liver . On DATE Mr Carabulea had developed a second severe episode of pulmonary thromboembolism for which he had received emergency treatment and had been successfully resuscitated . His recovery was slow and the physicians had planned a phlebography but before this investigation could be performed , PERSON suffered a third episode of pulmonary thromboembolism and died at TIME on DATE", "CARDINAL . Dr Pounder found that the unequivocal cause of death was pulmonary thromboembolism as a consequence of blunt - force trauma . Assuming that PERSON had been involved in an alleged road traffic collision on DATE , PERSON found that it was more likely than not that the liver injury sustained on that occasion had led to his death . PERSON also considered that PERSON had been at high risk of death from pulmonary thromboembolism , even with the best of medical treatment , \u201c given his initial presentation with shock and the subsequent recurrence of the pulmonary thromboembolism \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON stated that the yellow bruise at the front of the right hip mentioned in the autopsy report could have originated in a number of causes , including the wearing of a seatbelt during a car accident . Having regard to the medical records indicating that resuscitation had been attempted , PERSON considered that the CARDINAL fractured ribs identified at the autopsy had almost certainly been produced during attempts at resuscitation around the time of death .", "CARDINAL . Concerning the autopsy report in general , PERSON acknowledged that there were serious omissions and severe inadequacies in the post mortem autopsy as identified also by PERSON in his report ( see below paragraphs CARDINAL ) . PERSON found the autopsy report deficient in several aspects , both general and specific . It did not meet \u201c normally accepted standards within LOC \u201d ; it originated from an institute belonging to ORG ; it should have been produced expeditiously ; it lacked thoroughness and was too brief ; it contained a number of serious omissions , such as the failure to document the state of the veins in the legs , the presence or absence of thrombus within them and the failure to give an account of the weight of a number of organs . The autopsy report had declared the death to be due to natural causes despite the likelihood that the trauma on the surface of the liver was a precipitant of the pulmonary thromboembolism . PERSON also deplored the fact that the additional opinion obtained from ORG \u201c had not taken the opportunity to acknowledge and correct the errors \u201d contained in the earlier autopsy report .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted CARDINAL expert opinions , CARDINAL dated DATE by PERSON , a forensic pathologist practising at ORG at ORG in GPE ( GPE ) , and the other dated DATE by Professor PERSON , from ORG in GPE ( GPE ) . Their opinions were based on the NORP prosecuting authorities ' file on PERSON , including all the medical documents , the autopsy report and some of the prosecutors ' decisions .", "CARDINAL . According to PERSON , the medical file submitted lacked proper and adequate information , such as laboratory data , routine medical data , including the circumstances surrounding PERSON death , the drugs administered throughout his stay in hospital , their dosage and application . Having regard to the low probability ( CARDINAL in CARDINAL ) of a patient of PERSON age developing a fatal pulmonary thromboembolism , even after a minor uncomplicated surgery , the development of such an embolism required a very thorough clinical analysis of many laboratory tests and other data . However , crucial information was missing from the medical file which , thereby , prevented any genuine appraisal of the case .", "CARDINAL . PERSON also commented upon a number of inconsistencies in the medical documents on file . In the first place , he noted the change of diagnosis from respiratory ( pulmonary ) viral infection , made at ORG , to \u201c upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage \u201d , made at ORG , and later to pulmonary thromboembolism , although no explanation had been provided for such changes . Furthermore , the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism which had been made at ORG , at ORG and later referred to in the autopsy report contained no explanation of how this diagnosis had been reached since no blood clot ( embolus ) was ever mentioned as having been found . He also noted that it was not until DATE that Heparin , \u201c the immediate cornerstone treatment for pulmonary thromboembolism \u201d , was administered , despite the fact that the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism had been made DATE . As to the \u201c thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs \u201d mentioned as one of the causes of death in the Notice issued by ORG on DATE , PERSON stated that \u201c thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs \u201d was not a deadly disease and would not \u201c at all \u201d predispose a patient to thromboembolism . He found no numerical data available to quantify the severity of the pulmonary hypertension mentioned in the said Notice and he expressed the view that the \u201c thoracic and abdominal trauma caused by the car crash \u201d was an insufficient explanation of cause of death since no specific diagnosis had been made and there was no indication of any organs having been affected or of the kind of injuries that were allegedly sustained in the accident .", "He further noted that in ORG a diagnosis of haemorrhage around the liver was made . Since such diagnosis \u201c always raises the strong possibility of blunt abdominal trauma in the near past \u201d PERSON was astonished that no other reference or observation was made in respect of this diagnosis . In his view , such a diagnosis would normally be followed very carefully \u201c because of the potential of sudden blood loss , hepatic rupture and many other potentially life - threatening complications \u201d . He pointed out that the scrotal lesion which could be seen on the pictures taken by the family was not described in the autopsy report although this should have formed part of the external body description . He further found the description in the autopsy report of the fracture of the ribs to be deficient since it provided no information as to the age of the fracture or as to whether it was on the right or left side , both of these elements being important in determining the causal mechanism of the rib fracture ( resuscitation procedures or otherwise ) .", "CARDINAL . With reference to the statement made by PERSON that PERSON might have had anomalies of the venous system , PERSON pointed out that the autopsy indicated that the venous system of the victim was normal . He further stressed that the isolated vena cava developmental anomaly which had caused the death of PERSON child was a very rare condition and that the heredity rate of such a disease was in the region of PERCENT ; moreover , none of the medical records , including the autopsy report , had ever indicated that the victim had thrombophlebitis .", "CARDINAL .

As a consequence , he declared himself \u201c unable to reasonably exclude the possibility of significant trauma contributing to the death \u201d .", "Finally , he pointed out that in similar cases he would have suggested a reautopsy of the deceased , \u201c but in this case , it is highly unlikely that similar action will yield useful information , depending on the technique of conservation of the body \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's second expert , Professor PERSON , noted at the outset that the re - examination of the corpse should not have been done by the same pathologist as the one who had given the primary opinion . He further found the descriptions in the autopsy reports to be sparse and lacking in many aspects . He deplored the fact that photographs had not been taken post mortem , which would have been very helpful in determining whether there were bruises on the corpse or simply post mortem lividity , and he expressed the opinion that the pre - existing diseases of the victim described in the autopsy reports had probably not been of any importance concerning the death . He also confirmed that the cause of death was most probably pulmonary thromboembolism whose precipitating event could have been serious trauma . However , noting that the source of the embolism had not been found \u201c and [ was ] probably not searched for \u201d , he concluded that , having regard to the poor quality and brevity of the autopsy reports , it was not possible to determine the reason for the thrombosis .", "DATE .

PERSON had identified PERSON as the chief of the police officers who had ill - treated him .

As PERSON and PERSON 's wife were leaving the ward , a medical assistant told them that a doctor wanted to talk to them . They went to see the doctor who informed them that PERSON had very little chance of survival and that he was living on a drip . She told them that PERSON had blood in his lungs and liver and a swollen heart and that his kidneys were blocked . PERSON stated that he had returned to the hospital to see PERSON for a second time . As the police officer had not allowed him to enter the room , he had forced the door open and asked PERSON whether he was all right . He heard him shout back \u201c They killed me ! Do n't leave me here , take me out of here otherwise I 'll die ! \u201d The applicant , PERSON and PERSON were also present and heard these cries .

Following a visit to GPE , the Special Rapporteur in his report of DATE , found that there were persistent cases of police abuse aimed at extracting confessions from a suspect and that there was evidence to support the allegations that the GPE were more likely to be victims of police abuse than others . He further criticised as ineffective the system of investigation in which the military prosecutors had the exclusive authority to investigate , thus leading to the perception that the military prosecutors lacked independence and impartiality . He also noted that he had received numerous reports alleging that medical certificates were frequently falsified to cover - up ill - treatment by police and stressed that in most cases the investigations resulted in decisions not to prosecute .", "In spite of a request to the NORP authorities , the Special Rapporteur did not receive any statistics on the number of complaints filed and prosecutions brought under LAW ( Abusive behaviour ) , CARDINAL ( Abusive investigation ) and CARDINAL ) ( Torture ) of LAW .", "Referring to the case of PERSON , the Special Rapporteur indicated that he had been informed by the military prosecutor that there was no reason to reopen the case but that the military prosecutor was prepared to review the facts once again .
