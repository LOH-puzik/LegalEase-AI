This measure is not only used to anticipate his custodial sentence as he is charged with serious and grave offences which impinge on such an important value as public health and present a heightened danger to public order .

The court stated the following :", "\u201c The court does not consider it practical to release [ the applicant ] pending trial . This measure is not only used to anticipate his custodial sentence . Given that [ the applicant ] is charged with grave and serious offences that present a heightened danger to public order , [ his ] detention may be also justified by this fact alone ... Furthermore , if released , [ the applicant ] might abscond , as he has done in the past ... or interfere with the administration of justice . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Furthermore , if released , [ the applicant ] might abscond or fail to appear in court , as he has done in the past . That is the reason why his detention was ordered [ in the first place ] and his name was put on the wanted persons ' list . The length of the custodial sentence to which the applicant may be subjected if found guilty also indicates , although indirectly , that such a development is very likely . Besides , if released , [ the applicant ] might interfere with the administration of justice , given that his line of defence is contrary to the testimonies of most witnesses .", "The lawyers ' argument that [ the applicant 's ] medical condition is serious can not be taken into consideration . No objective data or medical documents have been produced to the court to show that [ the applicant 's ] detention is incompatible with his condition . The court received only a medical report stating that [ the applicant ] is currently unable to participate in the hearing .
