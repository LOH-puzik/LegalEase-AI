He was not sure whether there had been other weapons in the shelter . They had not found any PERSON at the scene but had thought that the terrorists had taken them with them when they fled . The witness said that he would not recognise the sound of a PERSON but that officers would .", "Nor did the witness know what bullet had hit the victim . He stated that any warning shots fired by the military could not have hit the victim , because they had been fired into the air . According to him , it was certain that shots had been fired from the area of the shelter as they were tracer bullets , so that he had been able to see them and determine where they were coming from .", "The witness said that it was not until daybreak that he had seen the industrial plant and realised that he was on the site of a coal - mine .", "CARDINAL . This witness ( born in DATE ) is a lieutenant - colonel in the gendarmerie and at the material time was the head of intelligence and public safety at the gendarmerie headquarters in the town of PERSON . He said that he had been appointed by the governor as investigating officer to carry out an investigation DATE after the incident had taken place .", "CARDINAL . His account of the events was as follows . The security forces had been informed that a wounded ORG terrorist had taken refuge in the area . They had fired warning shots in the direction of PERSON , whom they believed to be a terrorist . Then the security forces , together with about fifty - four of the security guards employed to protect the \u015e\u0131rnak coal - mines , who were on the site , had opened fire . However , they had had no intention of killing the victim , or else he would have been hit by CARDINAL bullet . Their intention had been to arrest a suspect whom they believed to be trying to escape . It was an accident that the victim had been hit by one of the warning shots . The victim was hit in the back of the neck , that is to say , according to the witness , where someone would be hit if running away in defiance of warnings . The security forces were spread out to the right and left of the shelter and in front of it .", "CARDINAL . According to the witness , in circumstances such as those in the case in question , the security forces were under orders to give a suspect CARDINAL verbal warnings ; they used a loud hailer to warn him orally and to order him to stop . If the suspect failed to obey , he had to be neutralised without the use of a firearm , by means of a rifle butt , bayonet or physical restraint . In the instant case there had been a considerable distance between the suspect and the security forces , and the latter had accordingly been compelled to fire warning shots into the air to make him stop .", "The witness acknowledged that the public prosecutor had recorded that shots had been fired at the victim with the intention of stopping him . His response was that the shot had not been intended to kill .", "He asserted that in the circumstances in which the incident had occurred ( snow , fog and darkness ) it was technically impossible to hit a target without night sights . He acknowledged that infantry units like the ones that had been deployed were equipped with infra - red field glasses enabling them to see in the dark . According to him , these were used to observe the terrain , however , and not to pinpoint targets .", "The witness stated that the security forces , the security guards from the \u015e\u0131rnak coal - mines and the mine watchmen were armed with GCARDINAL rifles . They were also entitled to shotguns . According to him , none of the shotguns found at the scene had been entered in the gun - licence register .", "CARDINAL . The witness stated that he had carried out his investigation on the basis of the documents drawn up for the purposes of the preliminary investigation ( the incident report , the public prosecutor \u2019s decision that he had no jurisdiction , the post - mortem report , etc . ) and the oral evidence of CARDINAL of the mine watchmen , PERSON and PERSON , whom the governor had identified . He did not visit the scene of the incident .", "He said that he had not considered it necessary to identify the members of the security forces who had taken part in the operation . He had not questioned any of them , because there had been so many of them and , in addition , village guards and CARDINAL other members of the security service of the \u015e\u0131rnak coal - mines . Nor had he considered it necessary to interview the people who had signed the incident report , although he admitted that that report gave the name or number of the squads participating in the operation and that he could have called the members of those squads in for questioning by applying to the gendarmerie brigade commander . He had not identified the village guards who had taken part in the operation . He had not requested ballistic tests , because he had relied on the incident report and because DATE had elapsed since the events .", "The witness admitted that the finding in his report that warning shots had been fired had been based on the incident report . He had not seen any need to interview the CARDINAL members of the security forces who had signed the incident report because , although he acknowledged that they had been eyewitnesses , he had thought that there was no point in questioning them since it had still not been proved that they had fired .", "CARDINAL . This witness ( born in DATE ) was in post at PERSON in DATE . In DATE , as deputy governor of PERSON , he chaired , in place of the governor , ORG which on DATE decided that the members of the security forces had no case to answer . He did not himself visit the scene of the incident .", "CARDINAL . The witness described as follows the rules governing the prosecution of civil servants . The governor appointed an investigating officer , who gathered all the evidence and submitted his findings to ORG . The case was considered at a meeting of ORG , during which each member of the ORG made comments . The investigating officer did not attend that meeting . The decision whether or not criminal proceedings should be brought was taken by a majority . That decision was referred to ORG , which upheld or quashed it after studying the case file . The special rules governing criminal proceedings against civil servants applied in regions in which a state of emergency was in force . A state of emergency was declared by due democratic process , by a majority vote in ORG .", "CARDINAL . The witness admitted that it was possible to find out the names of the commanders of squads carrying out such operations . He said that the security forces open fire only in self - defence .", "CARDINAL . In DATE this witness ( born in DATE ) was Director of ORG for \u015e\u0131rnak . He was a member of ORG which on DATE decided that there was no case to answer . He did not himself visit the scene of the incident .", "CARDINAL", "He explained that the ORG based its decisions on the documents already placed in the case file by the investigating officer ( appointed by the governor ) and was not strictly empowered to carry out its own investigation . It was the governor who had the duty and the power to investigate . The members of ORG were all subordinate to the governor . ORG generally met DATE , although sometimes there was no meeting . In that event the governor distributed the draft decision to the ORG members for signature . When the ORG did meet , it was chaired by the governor or his representative . The ORG Secretary read out the case file . The members of the ORG could examine the documents in the file . They were then invited to make comments and to sign the draft decision . In theory they could disagree with the conclusions proposed by the governor . Those who were not persuaded of the correctness of the conclusions could ask for further inquiries to be made . But ultimately the procedure was based on trust in the governor . Either the members were convinced and signed the ORG decision or they were replaced by others who were willing to sign it . In practice , it was out of the question for the decision in the form proposed by the governor not to be signed .", "CARDINAL . The witness acknowledged that the decision in the instant case had not been a ruling that there was no case to answer but rather a decision not to bring criminal proceedings against civil servants and not to transfer the case file to the prosecutor for further investigations to be carried out with a view to identifying the probable culprits . He had not been informed of the outcome of the case .", "He stated that the gendarmerie knew the identity of the commanding officer of every operation carried out by the security forces at the coal - mines .", "CARDINAL . The following witnesses were also summoned by ORG but did not appear : PERSON O\u011fur , the applicant and the victim \u2019s mother ; Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr QUANTITY O\u011fur , watchmen at the mine ; and other members of the security forces who had taken part in the operation on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) constitute criminal offences .

If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by LAW on the prosecution of civil servants , which restricts the public prosecutor \u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local ORG ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect \u2019s status ) , which is chaired by the governor , to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . In the instant case the presiding governor had under his command the security forces that carried out the operation in issue . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the ORG .
