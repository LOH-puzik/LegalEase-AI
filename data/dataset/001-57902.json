Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . ORG Mr PERSON is a NORP national born in DATE and resident in CARDINAL Bornes , GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr Pelladoah was arrested at FAC after customs officials found QUANTITY of heroin , some of it mixed with methaqualone ( a synthetic psychotropic drug ) , in a suitcase which he was carrying .", "He was charged primarily with bringing into the country , with or without criminal intent as the case might be , a quantity of a substance containing heroin . This amounts to an indictable offence ( misdrijf ) carrying a maximum penalty of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment ( gevangenisstraf ) and a fine of NLG CARDINAL if committed with criminal intent ( opzettelijk - section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( A ) and section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) but a summary offence ( overtreding ) carrying a maximum penalty of DATE months\u2019 detention ( hechtenis ) and a fine of NLG CARDINAL if committed without such intent ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( A ) and section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) . In the alternative , he was charged with possession ( aanwezig hebben ) of such a substance , with or without criminal intent as the case might be , which is an indictable offence carrying a maximum penalty of DATE imprisonment and a fine of NLG CARDINAL if committed with criminal intent ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( C ) and section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) , but a summary offence carrying a maximum of CARDINAL months\u2019 detention and a fine of NLG CARDINAL if criminal intent is absent ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( C ) and section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE Mr Pelladoah was tried by ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) ; he admitted having \" taken a suitcase off the luggage conveyor ... [ which , when examined by customs , ] turned out to contain a large quantity of a substance subsequently found to be heroin \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on CARDINAL DATE , acquitting Mr Pelladoah of bringing a quantity of heroin into the country with criminal intent , but finding him guilty of doing so without criminal intent ; it sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 detention . By the same judgment it ordered his immediate release as he had already spent that length of time in detention on remand .", "CARDINAL ; ORG Both the prosecution and the defence appealed against ORG judgment to ORG . The applicant was expelled from the GPE pursuant to LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) before the appeals were heard .", "CARDINAL . ORG held a hearing in the case on DATE . The official record of the hearing states that PERSON was declared to be in default and contains the following passage :", "\" Mr PERSON [ counsel for Mr Pelladoah ] declares - in essence - : ... I request the court to allow me to conduct the defence , as my client , in view of his place of residence , is unable to appear at the hearing . \"", "ORG refused this request since \" no compelling reason ( klemmende reden ) had become apparent \" to allow it .", "Witnesses were heard ; the prosecution was allowed to question them but PERSON lawyer was not .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE . In view of information to the effect that an extensive investigation into the drugs trade was under way in GPE , in the course of which PERSON had made statements to the NORP authorities , ORG held that the case had not been fully examined and ordered the case to be reheard . A new summons was issued for PERSON to appear .", "CARDINAL . ORG The second hearing of ORG in the case was held on DATE . Since CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges had not been present at the first hearing , the examination of the case was commenced anew .", "This time PERSON lawyer asked to be allowed to represent his client pursuant to LAW paragraph CARDINAL below ) as regarded the alternative charge .", "This request was refused because \" it had not been stated , nor did it appear , that [ the lawyer ] had been specifically authorised by the accused to represent him ; moreover , the primary charge , for which representation was not allowed , fell to be examined first \" .", "CARDINAL of the witnesses who had been heard at the previous hearing was heard again ; the prosecution was granted the opportunity to question him and make observations as to his statements but again PERSON lawyer was not .", "The prosecution asked that Mr Pelladoah be sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG then suspended the hearing until DATE so as to enable the prosecution to have relevant parts of the report of the NORP authorities translated into NORP .", "CARDINAL . ORG The hearing was continued on DATE . The lawyer asked to be allowed to represent PERSON at the hearing and submitted a written declaration authorising him to do so .", "ORG again refused to accede to the lawyer \u2019s request on the ground that \" the primary charge , which carried a sentence of imprisonment and for which , consequently , representation [ was ] not allowed , fell to be examined first \" .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG delivered a default judgment . It found PERSON guilty on the primary charge , committed with criminal intent , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . According to its judgment , it based the sentence on \" the seriousness of the act concerned and the circumstances in which it was committed , and the person of the accused \" ; it drew attention to the quantity of the heroin - containing substance brought into the country and observed that PERSON had made unlawful use of his diplomatic passport .", "CARDINAL . ORG Through his lawyer , PERSON filed an appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) .", "In his grounds of appeal ( cassatiemiddelen ) he complained essentially of the following : firstly , that at its first hearing on CARDINAL DATE ORG had erred in not considering the reason for the applicant \u2019s failure to appear - the trouble and expense of a journey from GPE to the GPE - to be sufficiently \" compelling \" ; secondly , that representation by the lawyer should have been allowed because even if criminal intent was proven the primary charge did not concern an indictable offence which carried a sentence of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE .", "As to the applicant \u2019s first complaint , it observed that on DATE , a different chamber of ORG had begun a completely new examination of the case and that the judgment of that court had therefore not been based on the hearing of CARDINAL DATE . It held that a complaint concerning the refusal of a request made at the latter hearing could therefore not entail the nullity of that judgment .", "It also rejected the applicant \u2019s second complaint , citing the legal provision according to which the primary charge , in case of criminal intent , constituted an indictable offence carrying a term of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . ORG In general , the accused - if he is not a juvenile ( section CARDINAL h of LAW ) - is not under an obligation to appear at the hearing .", "The court must examine of its own motion the validity of the summons ( geldigheid der dagvaarding - section CARDINAL ORG ) . If , in spite of having been properly summoned , the accused does not appear at the hearing , the court will declare him to be in default ( verstek verlenen ) and proceed with the case in his absence . This is the rule even if the accused gives prior notice of his absence and asks for the hearing to be deferred ( see , inter alia , the judgment of ORG of DATE , GPE ( PERSON , GPE Law Reports ) DATE , CARDINAL ) or submits his defence in writing ( see the judgment of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) and even if the accused can not be blamed for his absence ( see , inter alia , the judgments of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL , and DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) . The court has the power to order the accused to appear or to be produced before it by the police ( section CARDINAL ORG ) but it is rarely made use of unless the accused is a juvenile .", "CARDINAL . ORG An accused who has been convicted in his absence by the first - instance court may file an objection ( verzet - section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ORG ) ; this is an ordinary legal remedy in GPE law . Such an objection entitles the accused to a full retrial by the same court ( section CARDINAL ORG ) .", "An objection may not be filed by an accused who has , or has had , the opportunity to appeal to a higher court with jurisdiction as to both fact and law ( hoger beroep - section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ORG ) . This means that the possibility of an objection is limited to those cases in which the law does not admit of such an appeal , i.e. where the sentence is nothing more serious than a small fine or where a summary offence has been dealt with in first instance by ORG .", "It follows from section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ORG that no objection may be filed against a default judgment given on appeal .", "CARDINAL . ORG In certain cases the accused may be represented in his absence . In cases which are dealt with at first instance by ORG , this possibility exists if the act with which the accused is charged does not carry a prison sentence . However , the representative must be a lawyer who must state that he has been specifically empowered to act as such ( bepaaldelijk daartoe gevolmachtigd - section CARDINAL ORG ) .", "At the hearing the procedural position of the representative is that of the accused himself , i.e. - even if the representative is a lawyer - not that of counsel ( see , inter alia , the judgment of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) . This means that like the accused , he may be cross - examined by the court and the prosecution and his statements may be used as evidence ( see the judgment of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) ; he may also be assisted by a lawyer - or another lawyer - as counsel .", "If representation is allowed at first instance before ORG , it is also allowed on appeal before ORG ( section CARDINAL ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG The question - which was in dispute among learned writers - whether the defendant , having been declared in default , is entitled to have his defence conducted for him by counsel was decided by ORG in its judgment of DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) . Although the Procurator General ( procureur - generaal ) had suggested an answer in the affirmative , ORG came to the opposite conclusion . It reasoned that , were such an entitlement to be recognised , trial in absentia would take on an adversarial character incompatible with the basic idea of LAW that a defendant who had been declared in default and convicted might always file an objection if he felt that he would not have been convicted had the court heard his defence . ORG went on to hold that it was true that since the introduction of LAW the right to file an objection had been considerably curtailed , but pointed out that in so doing the legislature had not changed the character of trial in absentia . In conclusion , no section of LAW nor any principle of unwritten law entitled a defendant who had been declared in default to have his defence conducted in his absence by counsel .", "CARDINAL . ORG has accepted , however , that a trial court may , at its discretion , allow counsel to speak in defence of an accused who has been declared in default . This discretion is quite frequently made use of . ORG strictly maintains the rule that if in such cases a trial court allows counsel to speak at all , it must afford him all rights available to the defence . It may not impose any limitations as to what subjects he may address ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) ; it may not deny him the right to speak last ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) ; if there are witnesses , counsel must be permitted to cross - examine them ( judgment of CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG In principle ORG has held to its rule ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) that a defendant who has been declared in default is not entitled to have his defence conducted by counsel , but since its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) it is its established case - law that there is CARDINAL exception : in that judgment , it ruled , on the basis of , inter alia , LAW , that a trial court is obliged to allow counsel to conduct the defence of an accused who has been declared in default if it is of the opinion that \" compelling reasons \" prevent the accused from appearing at the hearing and it sees no reason to defer its examination of the case . ORG has accepted the corollary that counsel should in any case , if he so requests , be allowed the opportunity to argue that such reasons exist ( judgments of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL , and DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG , in its judgment of DATE ( GPE DATE , CARDINAL ) , has held that a \" compelling reason \" exists not only if it is impossible for the accused to appear , but also if such an important interest is at stake for the accused that - in view of all circumstances that may be considered relevant - he can not reasonably be expected to appear for trial and may therefore expect either that his trial will be adjourned until DATE when he will be able to attend or that his counsel will be allowed to conduct the defence .", "In its judgment of DATE , DD ( ORG , Offence and Offender ) CARDINAL , PERSON . PERSON ( case - law supplement to the Nederlands GPE , ORG , DATE , no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , ORG has recognised that the expulsion of the accused pursuant to LAW generally constitutes a \" compelling reason \" for his absence at the trial .", "CARDINAL . ORG If counsel wishes to act for the defence in the absence of his client , he should expressly ask for permission to do so . His presence alone is not sufficient ( see , inter alia , the judgments of ORG of DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , GPE DATE , CARDINAL ; DATE , DD CARDINAL ) . Neither is a request made by counsel for the hearing to be deferred , as was held in , inter alia , ORG judgment of DATE , DD CARDINAL ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-c"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
