On CARDINAL DATE the police arrested a PERSON and PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , who were suspected of fraudulently using a credit card which did not belong to them when making purchases in various shops in GPE to the value of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) . On CARDINAL May they were detained pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police also arrested the applicant , who was suspected of having aided and abetted Mr and PERSON by forging the signature on the credit card . On DATE he was detained pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr and PERSON were released , and on DATE the applicant was released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge at ORG ( PERSON ) decided to discontinue the proceedings in the light of a graphologist \u2019s finding that it was unlikely that the signatures on the payment slips for the purchases made with the stolen credit card were in PERSON PERSON \u2019s hand and of the fact that the witnesses called by the public prosecutor did not have sufficiently clear memories .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , the public prosecutor \u2019s office ( ORG ) had asked ORG to declare that the applicant and PERSON and PERSON Hauser were not entitled to compensation for their detention under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of ORG DATE ( ORG , \u201c the DATE Act \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , on the ground that the suspicion concerning them had not been dispelled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge interviewed the applicant and Mr and PERSON and told them of the application made by the public prosecutor \u2019s office .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and PERSON and PERSON Hauser sought compensation from the ORG for the pecuniary damage sustained on account of their detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG , sitting in private , refused their compensation claims on the ground that , contrary to the requirements of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of the DATE Act , the suspicion concerning them had not been dispelled . No representative of the public prosecutor \u2019s office attended the deliberations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON and PERSON and PERSON appealed against that decision to ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) . They asked ORG to take further evidence and , in particular , to hear witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the principal public prosecutor \u2019s office ( PERSON ) submitted written observations . It asked ORG to dismiss the appeal and not to take further evidence as the ORG statements were not capable of exculpating the appellants . These observations were not communicated to the applicant or to PERSON and PERSON Hauser .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private , dismissed the appeal .", "It ruled as follows :", "\u201c In the first place , the appellants\u2019 argument that suspicion does not have to be wholly dispelled for compensation to be payable under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of ORG is contradicted by the settled case - law of the NORP courts . It has been consistently held that suspicion must be dispelled sufficiently to establish that the detained person is not punishable , and can not be prosecuted , on account of the conduct in respect of which his detention was ordered . Where that remains only doubtful , suspicion is not dispelled within the meaning of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of the LAW . The appellants\u2019 assertion that this case - law reverses the burden of proof is incorrect , since cogent evidence must be adduced before it can be accepted that suspicion has been dispelled .", "In this connection , there is no justification for giving the appellants , as they demanded , the opportunity to prove their innocence by taking further evidence , since the evidence they propose to adduce can not be considered likely to lead to such a result . Seeing that the suspicion concerning the appellants is based mainly on the witness statements of CARDINAL DATE and that , in addition , it is not possible to determine when the other offences were committed , conclusive results can not be expected if fresh evidence is taken in the form of the appellant PERSON time - sheets and itineraries for CARDINAL and DATE , together with his tachograph discs , because the offences could have been committed during the rest stops on those journeys , or before or after them , especially as there are gaps in the time - sheets submitted by PERSON PERSON . The witnesses it was proposed to call have already been interviewed by the police and have already been confronted with the appellants . The main reason why the prosecution was abandoned was that with the passing of time those witnesses\u2019 memories had begun to falter . However , if their memories were so defective that they could no longer be considered adequate to establish guilt , neither can they in the present proceedings form an adequate basis for awarding compensation .", "The appellants did not dispute that the police inquiries had given rise to real suspicion concerning them . That suspicion was not subsequently dispelled , but on account of some remaining doubt was simply not sufficient to support a finding of guilt . The conditions which must be met under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of ORG in order to be able to claim compensation have accordingly not been satisfied and the appellants\u2019 claims must therefore fail . \u201d", "No representative of the principal public prosecutor \u2019s office attended the deliberations .", "CARDINAL .
