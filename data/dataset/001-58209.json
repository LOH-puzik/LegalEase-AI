The ORG appealed on DATE . On DATE ORG set aside the injunction of DATE and ruled that there were no grounds for using the summary procedure . It held in particular that implementation of a mental health board \u2019s decisions was an administrative act which fell outside the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and that in the present case the administrative authorities had not committed a trespass to the person which was actionable in the civil courts . It gave the following reasons for its judgment :", "\u201c The respondents are subject to a detention order and ORG was designated , by ORG decisions of ... and \u2026 respectively , as the place where they were to be detained . They have not been transferred there and are still being held in ORG psychiatric wing . The appellant submits that , because of a shortage of places in ORG , it has been obliged to draw up a waiting - list , on a \u2018 first come , first ORG basis , and that the person at the top of the list is transferred to ORG as soon as a place becomes available as a result of the release of another inmate whose condition has improved . The appellant adds that extensive work has been carried out in order to increase the capacity of ORG and that the opening of a new building there on DATE has already enabled several detainees on the waiting - list to be transferred ; that the others will be admitted there gradually , for security reasons and to allow the supervisory personnel time to familiarise themselves with their duties ( see the director \u2019s report of DATE ) ; and that it is possible that the respondents will very shortly benefit from the opening of this new building .", "Although the respondents clearly have a right to be transferred to an institution where they will receive a scientifically organised course of treatment devised by psychiatric staff , it has to be recognised that in ORG the chronic overcrowding , resulting in a deplorable lack of privacy not conducive to successful treatment , is now coupled with a marked lack of security and premises that are close to being unhygienic , so that treatment there is failing ( see the descriptions in CARDINAL cases in ORG ) , CARDINAL of CARDINAL , reported in ORG [ Revue de Jurisprudence de Li\u00e8ge , PERSON ] DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( GPE v. PERSON , C. and T. , complaint no . PERSON ) . The appellant has had to postpone transferring inmates subject to detention orders to this centre lest this worsen the situation , and has introduced the waiting - list system , which has been severely disrupted by a number of injunctions \u2013 accompanied by high penalties \u2013 giving certain inmates priority for reasons difficult to justify . The fact that the appellant has complied with these decisions DATE essentially because of the burden represented by the penalties \u2013 can not be interpreted as meaning that it has decided once and for all to waive any challenge to the ordinary courts\u2019 power to intervene in this area ; circumstances which suggest that a right has been waived must be interpreted narrowly and such a waiver can be deduced only where those circumstances are not open to any other interpretation ( PERSON . [ Court of Cassation ] CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , reported in Pas . [ Pasicrisie ] DATE , I , CARDINAL ) .", "Unlike decisions on the release of an inmate subject to a detention order , which count as judgments ( jugements ) by virtue of their subject matter ( see PERSON . CARDINAL in LOC . DATE , I , DATE , and the opinion of Advocate - General Mahaux ) , mental health board decisions designating the institution in which a person subject to such an order is to be detained do not concern liberty of person , but only the manner in which a detention order is to be executed ( see PERSON , \u2018 ORG commissions de d\u00e9fense sociale\u2019 , ORG [ Revue de droit p\u00e9nal et de criminologie ] , DATE , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . By their very nature , they are not covered by LAW .", "The execution of these decisions is an administrative act , not a regulation ( r\u00e8glement ) governed by LAW .", "The appellant does not deny the respondents\u2019 right to be transferred to ORG , but argues that they should not be transferred immediately because of the overcrowding there , the resulting disorder and the potential security problems both for staff and other citizens . The decision to continue to hold the surplus numbers of mentally disturbed offenders in prison psychiatric wings is therefore a choice which the authorities have made after weighing the detainees\u2019 right to the most appropriate medical treatment against general security requirements .", "That choice is an administrative act of exactly the sort not subject to review by the ordinary courts .", "Although the ordinary courts have jurisdiction to order the measures necessary to end or prevent any wrongful infringement of an individual right , they are prohibited from examining the appropriateness of a measure taken by an administrative authority , and from acting as an administrative authority ( see the conclusions of PERSON , now ORG but at that time Advocate - General , in GPE . CARDINAL , Pas . DATE , I , p. CARDINAL , and in particular p. CARDINAL ; and GPE . DATE , RG DATE , GPE v. V.D.E. ( in liquidation ) ) . A judge dealing with applications for injunctions can not , without interfering with the administration \u2019s general policy , question the expediency of a decision to draw up a waiting - list and disrupt the order of that list by ruling , under threat of a penalty , that a mentally - disturbed offender cared for in less favourable conditions in a psychiatric wing must be transferred immediately . There must , in any event , be other possibilities for transfer , since a mental health board \u2013 and in cases of emergency , the chairman alone \u2013 can , even of its own motion , send an inmate to another State - run DATE or , in exceptional cases , private \u2013 institution .", "The only court which has considered this issue on the merits found ( see ORG ) , case of H. and PERSON GPE , DATE ) that the detention was nevertheless still legal , thus ruling out the existence of an arbitrary trespass to the person . The shortage of places in prisons no doubt justifies the building of additional accommodation , but this work \u2013 besides being impossible to complete TIME \u2013 entails financial commitments which are a matter of general policy not subject to review by the courts . The opening of the new building at ORG is an illustration of the appellant \u2019s concern about the problem of dealing with persons subject to detention orders .", "The observations made in DATE by the President of ORG , on the basis of an inspection of the LOC and a judicial investigation , provide a clear comparison between the regimes and types of treatment provided for the inmates at ORG and in the PERSON psychiatric wing ; this comparison excludes any need for a new inspection and enables this court to draw the conclusion that , although the situation of mentally disturbed offenders in PERSON is not ideal , and may jeopardise their recovery , the regime under which they DATE including the respondents \u2013 live there can not be likened to inhuman or degrading treatment as prohibited by ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Therefore , both possibilities should exist side by side .", "ORG , it should be remembered that the wing does have a small number of cells ( individual , twin or CARDINAL - bed ) .", "[ re paragraph CARDINAL of the ORG \u2019s report ]", "It should be explained at the outset that , under section CARDINAL of the Act of DATE \u2018 for the protection of society against mental defectives and incorrigible ORG , mental health boards have the power to decide , quite independently , where a person is to be detained .", "These administrative authorities , CARDINAL of which exists for each psychiatric wing , are totally autonomous and have judicial powers . Thus , for instance , they can decide to release someone without conditions or on probation .", "A release order may be challenged by the public prosecutor . In this event , the case file is referred to a higher mental health board for a ruling . A decision not to release someone , on the other hand , may be challenged by way of an appeal to ORG .", "The boards place persons subject to detention orders in special institutions run by ORG ( ORG ( ORG ) and the mental - health sections of PERSON and ORG ) or in institutions run by GPE ( PERSON for women and ORG for men ) or in private psychiatric hospitals which agree to admit them .", "It appears that there are particular problems with implementing mental health board placement decisions in ORG ; problems of lack of money and of places .", "Historically , the mental health boards in the south of the country have been able to send people subject to detention orders to ORG ( in the case of women ) and ORG ( in the case of men ) . These institutions , which were originally run by the national ORG , and are now run by GPE , bill ORG to defray the cost of looking after the detainees placed with them .", "However , over a very short period and without prior notice , these charges , which are fixed by ORG , have increased very sharply , so that the amount allocated in the budget to cover them has turned out to be insufficient . It was necessary to request a further allocation , but this is granted only for DATE .", "As regards the problems of capacity , we must point out that the number of places in the ORG and ORG is such that , for DATE now , detainees have spent DATE on prison psychiatric wings before they can actually be transferred to the ORG designated by the relevant mental health board . They are therefore \u2018 ORG on a waiting - list in chronological order .", "The fact that it is impossible to admit them immediately to their designated institution has led some of their lawyers to apply , almost systematically , to the president of the relevant court of first instance for an injunction to force GPE to implement the boards\u2019 decisions .", "While ORG has had orders made against it at first instance in several of these cases \u2013 orders backed up by penalties \u2013 it is noteworthy that this has not been the case on appeal , where , for instance , it has been held ( see GPE . GPE , DATE ) that \u2018 it is not for the ordinary courts to substitute their decision for that of the administrative authority and to order a detainee to be transferred regardless of the problems which that will pose for the administration , such as the choice of another ORG institution or , exceptionally , a private one\u2019 and that , \u2018 although LAW is not being fully complied with , the fact that the respondent is forced to mix with persons imprisoned under the ordinary criminal law can not be likened to inhuman or degrading treatment contrary to LAW . Similarly , an appeal decision of the same court of DATE held that ORG could rely on the defence of force majeure as it had neither the LOC nor the staff to comply properly with LAW .", "Although no such case is currently pending before ORG , it should be pointed out that on DATE a person subject to a detention order lodged an application against GPE with ORG . This case is still pending at the present time .", "It should also be pointed out that , in theory , ORG could provide CARDINAL more places . This extra capacity can be fully utilised only if considerable renovation work on the disused building is carried out and the staff is increased . The renovation project is planned for the medium term ( CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) .", "If the spare capacity did become available , the total number of places might attain the \u2018 proper\u2019 level . However , this increased capacity would obviously not save the boards having to send people to ORG , which has specialised equipment and staff . It is important to retain that possibility since ORG and private institutions alone are totally insufficient to meet the demand .", "Finally , it must be pointed out that the various federal and regional authorities involved in the problem of placing and treating persons subject to detention orders will be liaising in an attempt to find solutions . These negotiations will be organised by a working party to be set up by ORG , which will include representatives of the different parties involved . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
