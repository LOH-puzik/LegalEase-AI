The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed burglary . On DATE he was brought before PERSON , a district prosecutor from ORG ( Prokuratora Rejonowa ) , charged with CARDINAL counts of burglary and detained on remand . The prosecutor considered that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences in question because he had been arrested in flagrante delicto . He also relied on the serious nature of the offences in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE on the ground that it was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings . The prosecutor stressed that in the light of evidence gathered during the investigation it was likely that the applicant had also committed other , similar offences and that , in turn , justified a risk that he might obstruct the process of obtaining evidence from witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE , considering that it was necessary to secure the conduct of the investigation , especially as fresh evidence needed to be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on an application made by ORG , ORG ( S\u0105d Rejonowy ) prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and the fact that the investigation could not be completed because evidence from a fingerprint expert and yet another forensic expert needed to be obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the subsequent application by ORG , the ORG prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It found that such further prolongation was necessary to secure the process of obtaining fresh evidence , especially as several new charges of burglary had in the meantime been laid against the applicant . Moreover , evidence from an expert - valuer needed to be obtained to determine the damage caused by the offences .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on a further , similar application by ORG , GPE , a single judge sitting as ORG , prolonged the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .

In the light of the material gathered in the case , that charge has a sufficient degree of verisimilitude ( zarzut CARDINAL zosta\u0142 w wystarczaj\u0105cym stopniu uprawdopodobniony ) . As it emerges from the case - file , new circumstances have arisen which might indicate that it would be necessary to obtain evidence from psychiatrists in order to establish the suspect \u2019s criminal responsibility . That being so and since in this court \u2019s opinion the grounds given for [ the applicant \u2019s ] detention have not ceased to exist but new circumstances have appeared that make it impossible [ for the prosecution ] to terminate the investigation , it has been held as in the operative part of the decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged a bill of indictment with ORG . The applicant was indicted on CARDINAL charges of burglary .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made an application for release to ORG . On DATE judge GPE , sitting as ORG , dismissed the application .

This court dismisses his application since the actus reus of the accused is characterised by a high degree of danger to society ( \u201c zarzucany czyn oskar\u017conego charakteryzuje si\u0119 wysokim stopniem spo\u0142ecznego niebezpiecze\u0144twa \u201d ) \u2013 the accused is amenable to the law under the rules governing relapse into crime defined in LAW .

It found that there were no valid reasons to release the applicant because his child had already been placed under the care of the grandparents .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s trial was to begin on DATE but it was postponed because the applicant , having found out that GPE had been appointed to sit as the presiding judge , challenged his impartiality . In the applicant \u2019s submission , the judge DATE who had dealt with his applications for release at the investigation stage \u2013 had actively participated in the investigation , and had consequently become a party to the proceedings . In particular , the applicant stressed that GPE had made the decision of CARDINAL DATE prolonging his detention . On DATE he had also dealt with , and dismissed , his application for release . On these occasions the judge had evaluated the charges against him and concluded that they had been justified . He had also referred to such aggravating circumstances as the serious nature of the offences in question and the applicant \u2019s criminal record . All those findings were closely related to the assessment of his guilt , criminal liability and to the anticipated sentence . In view of that , the applicant considered that it was clear that the judge had already formed a preconceived opinion on his guilt .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a panel of CARDINAL judges , sitting as ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s challenge as being groundless . The court stressed that the taking decisions on prolongation of detention made at a prosecutor \u2019s application was not tantamount to the taking part in an investigation .", "CARDINAL .

The reason for that decision read , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c The arguments presented by the accused in relation to his family situation are identical to those adduced in his application of DATE . They were already examined by the courts at first and second instance . ORG , in its decision of DATE , indicated to the applicant the way in which care over his child could be secured . Since in this court \u2019s opinion there are no circumstances listed in LAW and the arguments relating to the disqualification of the presiding judge were already dealt with in the [ ORG decision of DATE - it should be held as in the operative part of the decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE judge GPE , sitting as ORG , dismissed the applicant \u2019s fresh application for release on bail . The reasons for the decision read , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c The accused has been charged with numerous counts of burglary committed in the circumstances of relapse into crime specified in LAW . The offence with which he was charged is characterised by a high degree of danger to society . Bail proposed by the accused can not , in this court \u2019s opinion , secure the proper conduct of the trial .", "It should be pointed out that both the fact that an offence has been committed in the circumstances of relapse into crime and the serious danger to society [ represented by the offence ] are autonomous prerequisites for imposing detention on remand ( cf . LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ) - in respect of the accused those prerequisites exist cumulatively . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the applicant \u2019s appeal , ORG upheld the above decision , finding that his detention was justified under LAW ( CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and that no special circumstances militated in favour of his release .", "CARDINAL .

That decision was upheld on appeal on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant again challenged the presiding judge . He repeated his previous arguments . The challenge was dismissed by ORG on DATE . In the court \u2019s opinion , the arguments adduced by the applicant did not justify disqualifying the presiding judge from dealing with the case .", "CARDINAL . Later , the applicant asked ORG to quash the detention order made by ORG on DATE . He argued that that decision was valid only for DATE . He also submitted that he should be released on account of the difficult situation of his family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE judge GPE dismissed the application and upheld the impugned detention order . Referring to the applicant \u2019s family situation , the judge observed that such arguments as the fact that the applicant \u2019s son was not \u2013 allegedly \u2013 being provided with the proper care had to be rejected because the child was under the care of his grandmother .
