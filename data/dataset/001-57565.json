Sometime in DATE , Mr. PERSON , a shopkeeper at PERSON , answered a newspaper advertisement seeking a loan of CARDINAL NORP Schillings ( AS ) . In this way he came into contact with PERSON to whom he advanced , in DATE and DATE , CARDINAL AS in several instalments . At the time of this transaction , PERSON mentioned to PERSON that he needed this money for a Mr. PERSON but PERSON did not meet him . At PERSON \u2019s instigation , a contract was signed in DATE naming the couple PERSON as creditors and the couple ORG , amongst others , as debtors . Subsequently , PERSON repaid CARDINAL AS to ORG . Also in DATE and DATE , PERSON negotiated in the name of Mrs. PERSON a loan of CARDINAL AS from CARDINAL PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINALth DATE , PERSON obtained general powers of attorney from the PERSON couple with whom he had previously had business relations . These powers of attorney were granted in consideration of a loan made by PERSON to the PERSON couple and enabled him to act in their name in dividing up and selling , leasing and encumbering land which they owned at ORG and was entered in ORG , GPE . As part of the same transaction PERSON was given an option to purchase the property ; at the same time the PERSON couple undertook that , in the event of PERSON exercising the option and of approval of the transfer of ownership to him being refused by the competent administrative body , they would not sell the property to anyone else , would refrain from acting as owners , and would grant PERSON the right of exclusive occupation ( letters of CARDINALrd , CARDINALth and CARDINALth DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , PERSON made a contract with Mr. and Mrs. PERSON for the purchase of the property ; the purchase price was CARDINAL AS . The contract for sale was submitted on DATE to ORG ( Bezirksgrundverkehrskommission , hereinafter referred to as ORG \" ) for approval .", "The Upper Austrian Real Property Transactions Act ( Grundverkehrsgesetz ) provides as follows :", "- ( CARDINAL ) Every transfer of ownership and granting of usufructuary rights by legal act inter vivos in respect of a piece of land wholly or partly given over to agriculture or forestry is subject to approval according to the provisions of this LAW .", ".....", "( CARDINAL ) Refusal of such approval renders the transaction null and void .", ".....", "- ( CARDINAL ) Legal transactions must correspond to the public interests in creating and maintaining agricultural or forest areas and in maintaining and reinforcing a productive farming community or in maintaining and creating economic small or medium - sized agricultural properties .", ".....", "( CARDINAL ) Transactions which do not satisfy the requirements of sub - sections ( CARDINAL ) , ( CARDINAL ) or ( CARDINAL ) above , shall not be approved .", ".....", "- In particular , the requirements for approval of a transaction ( LAW ) shall not be satisfied where there is reason to fear", "( a ) that the purpose of the purchaser is to resell the land as a whole or in lots for profit ;", "( b ) that peasant farm holdings or small agricultural businesses or economically substantial parts thereof are being acquired to create or enlarge great estates ;", ".....", "( d ) that estates are to be ... diverted from their use as farmland or forest for no adequate reason ;", "( e ) that only a speculative capital investment is envisaged ;", ".....", "- If a legal transaction requires approval under the provisions of this LAW , the contracting parties shall apply for approval to ORG Commission within DATE of concluding the transaction . \"", "CARDINAL . ORG refused , on DATE , to approve the contract for sale . It found that the property could provide a farming family with a livelihood and that PERSON was an insurance agent and not a farmer . Referring to applications which PERSON had made for the approval of the purchase by him from the PERSON couple of other properties and which had been refused , ORG considered that the files revealed clearly a picture of speculation in land . It also observed that PERSON had already marked out CARDINAL plots for building . In conclusion , ORG remarked that , while fear of certain intentions on the part of a purchaser was sufficient under LAW for refusal of approval , the fact that in this case there was clearevidence that such intentions existed must carry even more weight .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , PERSON had begun to sell part of the property in building sites ; he continued to do this throughout DATE and up to DATE .

PERSON , it appears , has failed to inform prospective purchasers that he was acting under a power of attorney he held from the PERSON couple and if any of them remarked that PERSON was not himself the vendor it was explained that the transaction was being effected in this way for taxation purposes . The purchasers were informed at the time by PERSON that permission had been obtained for building and were assured that work could begin at once . The purchase contracts drawn up by PERSON \u2019s lawyer included a clause stating that ORG approval was necessary to implement them , but PERSON had informed the purchasers that this was a mere formality . The last twenty or so purchase contracts were not concluded through the same lawyer and did not contain that particular clause . In all cases the purchase price was payable immediately .", "In DATE , the PERSON couple purported to withdraw the powers of attorney from PERSON .

These allegations proved , however , to be unfounded . In its decision , which dealt at length with the allegations made , ORG found , in particular , that the approval which Mr. PERSON had mentioned concerned in fact the sale of different property owned by the PERSON couple .", "ORG appeal was also refused by ORG . In the light of enquiries it had caused to be made , it found that , in all , CARDINAL building sites had been marked out on the properties in question ; that PERSON had already concluded contracts for the sale of QUANTITY building plots and that approval of CARDINAL of these contracts had been definitively refused by ORG authorities ; that PERSON had encumbered the different properties with charges for substantial amounts of money and that he had made contradictory statements in his different applications for approval . ORG held that PERSON \u2019s plans were incompatible with the principles enunciated in LAW ) of the NORP Real Property Transactions Act as it was to be feared that CARDINAL of the various properties in question were to be sold for building . The contract for sale of CARDINALth DATE was therefore found to be designed to destroy and break up a farm which had up till then been a workable unit , to bring about the abandonment of farm buildings and to effect a resale of valuable agricultural land for profit ( Section QUANTITY of the Upper Austrian LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON made an appeal on DATE to ORG against this decision . Among other grounds , he reiterated the charges of bias he had made against CARDINAL members , including the president , of ORG ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "ORG rejected the ground of appeal on DATE :", "\" It has not been necessary for the ORG to deal with the allegations in the appeal to the extent that they attempt to show that the challenged members of the ORG were biased within the meaning of LAW and ought therefore to have refrained from acting since , even if these allegations were correct on this point , the applicant was not affected in his right to be judged by the judge established by law by the refusal of his challenges . For a party has no right to challenge a body competent to decide or take part in the making of the decision on the grounds of bias . A board does not cease to be competent because a biased member takes part in the proceedings . Nor does the participation of a biased member - unless a special law expressly provides otherwise - affect the proper composition of a board any more than the competence or proper composition of an authority consisting of a single person ( monokratische PERSON ) is called in question through the bias of the regularly appointed office holder ( PERSON ) .

He referred to the earlier decisions ( CARDINALth DATE , CARDINALth DATE and CARDINALth DATE ) refusing his release in which it had been held that the danger of his committing further offences continued in spite of his having been adjudged bankrupt and he said that this \" fictitious \" reason might have been given either because ORG was not aware of the true facts or because of the intrigues of an official of the prosecution whom he suspected of scheming in the ORG business . In this connection , he alleged in particular that there were political considerations involved : his building schemes would have brought to the district numerous purchasers of modest means whose votes would have reinforced the socialist majority in the town council to which ORG and certain officials were opposed ; the judges in the jurisdiction of ORG were prejudiced against him as many of them served on ORG and the others were influenced by their colleagues as well as by the wide publicity given to his affairs .

He complained of having spent DATE in detention in spite of being innocent . He added that when he had been at liberty from DATE he had not attempted to abscond and there was therefore nothing to show he might do so now . As to the danger of his committing further offences , he stated that the dividing up of the land at ORG was a unique operation which could not be repeated and that , as the PERSON couple has been made bankrupt , their assets were in the hands of the official assignee .", "His application in the fraudulent bankruptcy case referred to that made in the fraud case .", "CARDINAL .

He said he had done all he could to help the purchasers , who were of modest means , to obtain their rights .

As to the danger of his committing further offences , he stated that the passage of time , the advanced stage reached in his bankruptcy and , once again , DATE spent in detention on remand showed that this danger did not exist .
