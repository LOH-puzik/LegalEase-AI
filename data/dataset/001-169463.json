NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is an NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE - Virumaa . He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , who had been the mayor of GPE since DATE , was re - elected to the GPE city council on DATE and on DATE the city council re - elected him as mayor . On the same date the city council confirmed the appointment to office of the members of the municipal government , thereby giving the applicant the authority to exercise his mayoral powers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of accepting substantial bribes . On DATE the applicant was prohibited from leaving his place of residence as a preventive measure . It does not appear from the materials before the ORG how long those measures were in force .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG petitioned ORG to suspend him from office as a precautionary measure . The petition detailed numerous acts which had been investigated and which were deemed to constitute a criminal offence . It was noted in the petition that all the acts in question related to the applicant \u2019s service as mayor of GPE and the issuing of instructions to persons employed by the GPE city government in abuse of his office . ORG found that there was reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence and that if he continued to serve as mayor he might i ) destroy or conceal documentary evidence , or ii ) create new evidence seeking to justify the said acts , or iii ) influence officials of the GPE municipal government to give witness testimony that would be favourable to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hearing was held in ORG to ensure the applicant \u2019s rights of defence . This hearing was postponed to DATE in order to allow ORG to provide the applicant with a copy of its petition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a decision suspending the applicant from the office of mayor of GPE for the duration of the criminal proceedings . The first - instance court determined that there was sufficient evidence to warrant reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the crime of repeatedly accepting bribes for his own benefit and also for the benefit of his political party . In arriving at this conclusion , the court examined all the evidence in the case as provided by ORG . This body of evidence consisted of surveillance reports and extracts from bank statements . The first - instance court did not agree that there was a risk that the applicant might destroy or conceal documentary evidence , as all such evidence had been seized by the authorities during the search of his home and his cars . Nor did it agree that the applicant might create new evidence to justify the said acts . The court did agree , however , that there was a risk that the applicant might influence municipal officials to give favourable witness testimony if he were to continue to serve as mayor . The court found this suspicion substantiated by surveillance reports providing evidence of the applicant issuing instructions to municipal officials to engineer favourable resolutions to the problems of people who had promised him certain benefits . In the light of the specific nature of the alleged crimes and the manner in which the crimes were committed , the court held that there was reason to believe that the applicant might commit offences impeding the administration of justice and thus hamper the effective conduct of proceedings . Given the importance of preventing any such obstruction of justice , the court deemed this risk sufficient to justify the applicant \u2019s suspension from office .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s suspension from office entailed the temporary loss of his remuneration as mayor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against the decision of ORG , requesting that the decision of the firstinstance court be quashed . The applicant argued that the decision did not contain sufficient reasons explaining how he could influence witnesses if he were to continue to serve as mayor . He further argued that the suspension from office was a disproportionate measure for the purposes of achieving ORG Office \u2019s objective .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an oral hearing was held in ORG . ORG submitted to the appellate court all gathered evidence forming the basis for a reasonable suspicion of a criminal offence . At the hearing the applicant \u2019s defence counsel submitted a request for permission to examine this evidence , since in his opinion the ORG guaranteed defence counsel the right to examine such material . ORG noted that in his appeal the applicant had not challenged the existence of reasonable suspicion and held that this request was therefore beyond the scope of the appeal . The defence counsel further stated that he wanted to examine the evidence forming the basis for the prosecutor \u2019s belief that the applicant would influence witnesses . The prosecutor argued that the defence counsel had not made any such request in the firstinstance court , even though the latter was aware that the firstinstance court had also examined all the evidence gathered in the case . The request was therefore not admissible in the appeal proceedings . The prosecutor also argued that the defence counsel \u2019s right to examine evidence could be restricted in these proceedings , which concerned only the applicant \u2019s suspension from the office of mayor . He further submitted that the court \u2019s task was to determine whether sufficient evidence had been gathered in support of his suspension from office .", "CARDINAL . The court of appeal dismissed as premature the request for access to all the evidence on the grounds that it was not until the end of the investigation in the criminal case that the applicant was legally entitled to be acquainted with all the evidence gathered in the case . It also held that the applicant \u2019s counsel was in a position to defend him in the proceedings concerning his suspension from office .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the firstinstance court \u2019s decision to suspend the applicant from office . The appeal court noted that the first - instance court had based its assessment of the risk that the applicant might influence witnesses on the evidence presented in the surveillance reports . It had also considered the substantial power and influence that the office of mayor gave him over his subordinates , the specific nature of the offences , and the manner in which they had allegedly been committed . This included evidence of the applicant issuing instructions to certain witnesses to secure the benefits promised to various individuals in return for bribes . The appellate court noted that it was not possible to give a detailed account of the circumstances described in the surveillance reports as this might prejudice the criminal proceedings . The appellate court found that , based on the information in those reports , the suspect might have influenced witnesses and the testimony they were going to give in court . ORG also stated that it had examined the evidence contained in the surveillance reports and agreed with the firstinstance court \u2019s assessment that the evidence was indicative of the applicant \u2019s behaviour in the past and thus allowed the applicant \u2019s future behaviour to be predicted . It concluded that the risk that the applicant would prejudice the proceedings and continue to commit offences against the administration of justice had been sufficiently demonstrated and that suspension from office was a proportionate measure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal with ORG against the decision of ORG . In addition to the arguments in the first appeal , the applicant argued that the proceedings to suspend him from office had not been adversarial and fair , thereby breaching the civil limb of LAW . The applicant had asked ORG to allow him to examine the evidence forming the basis for the belief that the applicant might influence witnesses , but that request had been rejected .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to examine the appeal .", "CARDINAL . At the time of submission of the present application the pre - trial proceedings were still ongoing .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) of ORG a city or rural municipality mayor acquires the authority prescribed by law and in the by - laws of the respective rural municipality or city with effect from the date on which the appointment of the government to office is confirmed .", "CARDINAL .
