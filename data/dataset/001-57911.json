It observed that the applicant had consented to the arrangement leaving PERSON in the care of the grandparents .

ORG By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , by a majority , held that the applicant should remain PERSON \u2019s guardian but transferred custody to the grandparents , finding that the fact that she had lived with them since DATE militated strongly in favour of her remaining in their care .

No substantial changes should be made to this situation . She should be able to meet the applicant and develop a normal relationship with him .
