Invalidation of results in a polling station was premised solely on the conclusion of an individual ORG member as to whether a protocol should be invalidated . The judgment of a single ORG member that there were deficiencies in the protocol was accepted as established fact without any explanation of the alleged defect or identification of the number of votes involved . Accordingly , there was no factual basis presented publicly for invalidating results in any of the CARDINAL constituencies , which is particularly troubling since the ORG registered few complaints that alleged violations in these constituencies . ...", "The adjudication of post - election disputes in the courts largely disregarded the legal framework , and fell short of internationally accepted norms . ...
