In DATE GPE requested the GPE authorities to extradite the applicant . This request was refused following an unfavourable opinion from ORG ( Arrondissementsrechtbank ) of DATE ; the GPE court took the view that the applicant \u2019s right to defend himself had not been respected .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE made a similar request to GPE , where PERSON was then staying .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judgment of CARDINAL DATE and the warrant for his arrest as a convicted person ( ordine di carcerazione di condannato ) issued by the principal public prosecutor at ORG on CARDINAL DATE , together with an official NORP translation of those documents , were served on the applicant by a bailiff in accordance with LAW of DATE ( \" LAW \" ) and the NORP extradition treaty of DATE .

On DATE the Minister replied to him that the extradition was a matter for the NORP authorities , who might possibly withdraw their request . He advised the applicant to apply to those authorities without delay in that connection , adding that , if the applicant so requested , he could stay the execution of the extradition order ; the duration of such a measure could not however exceed a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . By letter of DATE PERSON again asked the Minister of Justice to stay the execution of the extradition decision . In support of his request he provided statements from various witnesses , according to which he had been in GPE on DATE , the date of the offences for which he had been convicted in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Minister contacted the NORP authorities . He drew their attention to the applicant \u2019s version of events and asked them to state whether they wished to maintain their extradition request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of the GPE extraditions department replied to the above query in the affirmative . He stressed that if there was any new evidence it could serve as the basis for an application for retrial of the case ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "On DATE the Minister sent to the applicant a copy of this letter , notifying him that the extradition procedure would be continued as soon as it was no longer necessary to keep him at the disposal of the NORP authorities for the offences committed in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON wrote to PERSON to ask him to obtain from ORG \u2019s GPE office information which he had himself unsuccessfully sought from the NORP consulate general in GPE .", "As a result the Minister instructed the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office to determine the accuracy of the applicant \u2019s claims concerning his CARDINAL - time presence in GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "A message from ORG to ORG of DATE indicated that the NORP police had questioned the applicant on DATE when he had been in custody in GPE in connection with alleged forgery , attempted theft and receiving stolen goods . He had stated that he had entered GPE on DATE and that it was the first time that he had visited the country . In DATE his wife had affirmed that she had herself arrived in the country on DATE and that her family had lived for a long time near GPE . However , another NORP national , probably residing in the GPE , had maintained in DATE that the couple were living in GPE at the time and that the applicant had visited him on several occasions . A NORP police- officer claimed to remember PERSON but could not certify that he had seen him on DATE .", "The text of the message was transmitted to the GPE criminal police on DATE ; on CARDINAL DATE the principal public prosecutor \u2019s office of that town sent to the Minister of ORG a report on the information obtained from ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime PERSON , having been advised orally that his extradition could take place on DATE , submitted an application for his release to the committals chamber ( Raadkamer ) of ORG on DATE , founded essentially on the alleged unlawfulness of such a measure .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE the committals chamber declared the application inadmissible ; the applicant appealed immediately , relying on Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL , article DATE ) of the LAW . In addition , he requested the Minister of ORG , again on DATE , to stay the execution of the extradition order pending a final decision on his application of DATE . On DATE the Minister sent by telex instructions to this effect to the principal public prosecutor \u2019s office in GPE . The applicant \u2019s lawyer was notified of this by telephone .", "On DATE the indictments chamber of ORG confirmed the order of DATE on the ground , inter alia , that it was not empowered to order the applicant \u2019s release . It noted that the fourth subsection of LAW , which provided for the possibility of applying to the investigating authorities for release , ceased to apply once the detainee had been placed at the disposal of the Government with a view to extradition . It added that the provisions of the ORG cited by PERSON did not in themselves confer on it jurisdiction to rule on the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal filed on DATE . It found that no grounds had been validly and usefully submitted and took the view that the indictments chamber had complied with the essential procedural requirements or the formalities whose disregard entailed nullity and that its decision was lawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an urgent application with the President of ORG seeking an order prohibiting his extradition , which , he contended , would be contrary to Articles CARDINAL para . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ( article DATE , article CARDINAL , article CARDINAL ) of the Convention on account , inter alia , of the incompatibility of the proceedings conducted against him in GPE with the Convention ; he requested further his immediate release on the ground that his detention was also unlawful for the reasons which his lawyer had given before the indictments chamber of ORG on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the Minister of ORG drew the attention of the GPE principal public prosecutor \u2019s office to the desirability of staying the execution of the extradition order until a final decision had been given on PERSON application .", "The NORP State filed its submissions on DATE ; PERSON submitted his at a hearing held on DATE .", "On DATE the President of ORG found that it was not necessary to make an urgent ruling . He noted that under the first paragraph of LAW he was empowered to give \" a provisional ruling where he [ recognised ] that there was urgency , in all matters except those which are excluded by law from the competence of the courts \" and that , according to academic writers and the case - law , this jurisdiction extended to cases of unlawful acts by the authorities ( onrechtmatige overheidsdaad ) . In the present case , however , the contested detention did not represent such an act because it had been lawfully and properly ordered in the context of extradition proceedings in accordance with LAW DATE and the NORP - Italian extradition treaty of DATE . As far as the extradition was concerned , the President considered that it was not for him to determine whether the applicant \u2019s conviction by ORG had infringed the Convention . He added that the applicant could , as the Director of the GPE extraditions department had pointed out ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , file an application for a retrial if the conditions set out in Article CARDINAL of LAW were satisfied .", "CARDINAL . After ORG had served this order on PERSON , the latter filed an appeal against it by a document lodged with the registry of ORG on DATE . By a letter registered on DATE he requested that the case be heard at DATE .", "The NORP State filed its submissions on DATE , but the proceedings remained pending . The NORP lawyer appointed to represent the applicant had withdrawn his services pending payment of an advance . His client claimed that he was not in a position to pay , but he had not informed the authorities of this and had not requested legal aid .", "CARDINAL . By a letter from his lawyer , dated CARDINAL DATE , the applicant informed the Minister of ORG that he no longer opposed his extradition in view of the length of the proceedings instituted both at national and international level , and that he waived his right to rely on the undertaking not to hand him over to GPE pending the outcome of the appeals lodged in GPE .", "DATE PERSON was extradited to GPE .
