The article was entitled \u2018 They have not punished us much for what we are\u2019 ( \u2018 PERSON nas kaznili , kakvi smo\u2019 ) and , in so far as relevant , read as follows :", "\u201c Where will our souls go , we wonder . Are we PERSON [ the most prominent villain from the \u2018 PERSON Ford\u2019 comic book ] of PERSON , who take from the poor and give to the rich ? Are we arrogant spendthrifts who waste money belonging to all NORP citizens , so that poor people have to pay our fines for offensive writing ? Has the judge LOC .... punished us too mildly and should n\u2019t he have satisfied the request of the lawyer PERSON and deservedly ripped us off to the tune of MONEY ? But could n\u2019t our prosecutor , who is surely not a blonde , but is being whistled at by workers on strike , have asked for more , since [ another column in the PERSON newspaper ] ruined his reputation acquired DATE , and in particular over DATE or CARDINAL , when he so \u2018 ORG drafted dismissals to all the [ \u2018 ] non - workers [ \u2018 ] and the opposition from [ a local factory ] ? And what should the citizens who finance our public company do and think ? Could they also wonder who gave us the right to write insulting texts so that the judges of ORG must punish us ? ... Do we have the right to deny that people are tired of such a behaviour of ours ... ? Do we have the right to deny our fellow citizens their wish for a quiet life , free of stress and various court proceedings ? Do we have a soul , we wonder out loud , and if we do , where will it go after we \u2019ve prepared another scandal ? We should be ashamed of ourselves . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the same issue , the second applicant was the editor of the page entitled \u2018 Amusement\u2019 , consisting of anagrams , jokes , a crossword and a horoscope . In the top middle section of the page there was a photo of a blonde woman in her underwear , next to which there was a text , which , in its relevant part , read as follows :", "\u201c ORG and the manager were visited by a blonde the other day .

The court fined each of them MONEY ( ORG , approximately LAW ) , ordering them jointly to pay PERSON CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL ) in respect of the costs of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment , the first - instance court defined insult as a statement or an action objectively humiliating to a certain individual , constituting an attack on his or her honour . Acknowledging that PERSON was a public figure , the court explained that under domestic law an action done by way of a joke was not a criminal offence as long as that joke did not overstep acceptable boundaries and become insulting . The applicants must have known that PERSON considered their articles insulting , since they had previously been convicted of using identical terms about him . The court took particular note of the fact that the applicants mentioned PERSON directly and indirectly on several different pages of the same newspaper , and concluded that PERSON had proved that those texts had insulted him just by instituting the private criminal proceedings . In particular , the court held as follows :", "\u201c Such writing by the defendants demonstrates the intention to demean the private prosecutor [ PERSON ] . This is so because it is clear that the defendants , in different ways and in different sections [ of the newspaper ] , compared the private prosecutor to a female , which comparison is objectively insulting in society . Namely , in our mentality it is insulting to feminise a man , and jokes about blondes are not in the least flattering , because they portray blondes as stupid people subject to mockery . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
