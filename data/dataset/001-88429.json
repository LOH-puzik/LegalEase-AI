The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He is a retired military officer .", "CARDINAL . At the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution in GPE on DATE , the applicant , then a captain ( sz\u00e1zados ) , was serving as an officer in charge of a training course ( tanfolyam - parancsnok ) at the GPE military school for junior officers . Following the demonstrations , gunfight and uprising in the capital on DATE , on DATE martial law was introduced , providing , inter alia , that any person bearing arms without authorisation was punishable by death . The applicant was aware of these provisions , which had been announced on national radio .", "CARDINAL . At dawn on CARDINAL DATE insurgents unsuccessfully attacked the military school . During the exchange of gunfire , an officer was killed and another wounded . Shortly afterwards , the building of the local prison and prosecutor \u2019s office was occupied by the insurgents . The applicant had the task of regaining control of the building . He managed to convince the insurgents , without using force , to leave the LOC .", "CARDINAL . In a similar assignment , the applicant was subsequently ordered to disarm other insurgents who had taken control of the building of the local ORG by force on the afternoon of CARDINAL DATE . Having overcome the resistance of the police forces , the insurgents , including a certain PERSON , armed themselves with guns taken from the police . Among the insurgents , PERSON and another person took command . Their intention was to execute the chief of ORG , but eventually they refrained from doing so . PERSON and a smaller group of insurgents stayed behind in the building , in order to secure their position ; PERSON informally assumed their leadership .", "CARDINAL . As in his previous assignment , the applicant was specifically ordered to organise a group of officers , deploy them at ORG and regain control of that building , using force if necessary . Each member of the applicant \u2019s squad , composed of CARDINAL officers , had a MONEY sub - machine gun and a pistol ; the group was , moreover , equipped with CARDINAL PERSON machine guns and CARDINAL hand grenades .", "CARDINAL . On their way to ORG , the applicant \u2019s squad met CARDINAL young men , CARDINAL of whom was carrying a sub - machine gun . The applicant \u2019s subordinates confiscated the gun and released the CARDINAL individuals unharmed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant divided his men into CARDINAL platoons , CARDINAL of which stayed outside , near the entrance to the police building , while the other went inside . In the yard there were CARDINAL disarmed police officers as well as CARDINAL civilians , the latter belonging to the group of insurgents . On arrival , the officers in the applicant \u2019s platoon aimed their sub - machine guns at the insurgents . CARDINAL of the insurgents , PERSON , stated that they were unarmed . However , one of the disarmed police officers said that PERSON had a gun . PERSON asked the latter to surrender the weapon . Thereupon , a heated dispute , of unknown content , broke out between the applicant and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Finally , PERSON reached towards a pocket in his coat and drew his handgun . The applicant responded by resolutely ordering his men to fire . Simultaneously , he fired his sub - machine gun at PERSON , who was shot in his chest and abdomen and died immediately . CARDINAL of the shots fired on the applicant \u2019s orders hit another person and CARDINAL hit yet another person . A further insurgent was shot and subsequently died of his injuries . CARDINAL individuals ran out onto the street , where the other platoon of the applicant \u2019s men started to shoot at them . CARDINAL of them suffered a non - lethal injury to his head ; the other person was hit by numerous shots and died at the scene . As the applicant was subsequently driving away from the LOC on a motorcycle , he was shot at by unidentified persons , fell off the motorcycle and suffered some injuries .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG passed an LAW ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) which provided , inter alia , that \u2013 having regard to the DATE United Nations Convention on the Non - Applicability of LAW and Crimes against Humanity ( proclaimed in GPE by LAW no . DATE ) \u2013 certain acts committed during the DATE uprising were not subject to statutory limitation . Subsequently , the President of GPE initiated the review of the constitutionality of the LAW prior to its promulgation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted a decision in the matter , laying down certain constitutional requirements concerning the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity . It held that the statutory limitation on the punishability of a certain type of conduct could be removed by the lawmaker only if that conduct had not been subject to a time - limit for prosecution under NORP law at the time when it had been committed \u2013 the sole exception being if international law characterised the conduct as a war crime or a crime against humanity and removed its statutory limitation , and moreover if GPE was under an international obligation to remove that limitation . Consequently , it declared section CARDINAL of the Act unconstitutional , since that provision was aimed at the removal of the statutory limitation on the punishability of such conduct which did not fall within the category of war crimes .", "CARDINAL . The relevant parts of the reasoning of ORG decision ( no . CARDINAL ) read as follows :", "CARDINAL . DATE War crimes and crimes against humanity are criminal offences which did not arise as part of domestic criminal law but are deemed to constitute criminal offences by the international community , which defines their essential elements .", "These criminal offences \u2013 according to the prevailing legal standard of international law that has evolved since the Second World War \u2013 are not simply offences punishable by the domestic law of most countries . ( Therefore , homicide may not , in itself , be classified as amounting to a crime against humanity . ) Their international status is linked with their definition at a supranational level either on the basis of natural law ... or by reference to the protection of the \u2018 foundations of the international community\u2019 , or by citing the threat posed by these activities to all humanity : their perpetrators are \u2018 enemies of the human race\u2019 . Thus , the significance of these offences is too great to allow their punishment to be made dependent upon their acceptance by , or the general criminal - law policy of , individual GPE .", "CARDINAL . It is the international community that prosecutes and punishes war crimes and crimes against humanity : it does so , on the one hand , through international tribunals , and , on the other hand , by obliging those ORG which wish to be part of the community of nations to undertake their prosecution . ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution and punishment of war crimes and crimes against humanity may only proceed within the framework of legal guarantees ; it would be contradictory to protect human rights without such guarantees . But these international guarantees can not be replaced or substituted by the legal guarantees of domestic law .", "( a ) ORG law applies the guarantee of nullum crimen sine lege to itself and not to domestic law . \u2018 Customary international law\u2019 , \u2018 the legal principles recognised by civilised nations\u2019 and \u2018 the legal principles recognised by the community of nations\u2019 constitute a lex which classifies certain types of behaviour as prosecutable and punishable according to the norms of the community of nations ( through international organisations or the GPE belonging to the international community ) , irrespective of whether the domestic law contains a comparable criminal offence or whether the relevant treaties have been incorporated into domestic law . The gravity of war crimes and crimes against humanity DATE namely the fact that they endanger international peace and security and mankind as such \u2013 is irreconcilable with leaving their punishability within the ambit of domestic laws . ...", "LAW which , in its content , matches LAW obliges member GPE to uphold unconditionally the principles of nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege . The reference by international law to the criminal offence defined ( \u2018 [ n]o one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was ORG ) has been interpreted by legal scholars to refer only to those criminal offences which are undoubtedly punishable by domestic law , either through ratification or direct application .", "By LAW , \u2018 [ n]othing in this Article shall prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which , at the time when it was committed , was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by the community of nations\u2019 . ( The content of LAW of LAW is similar , with the distinction that the latter substitutes \u2018 civilised nations\u2019 for the term \u2018 community of nations\u2019 . ) This separation makes possible the prosecution of the previously noted sui generis criminal offences defined by international law even by those GPE belonging to the community of nations whose domestic system of law does not criminalise or punish that action or omission . It follows logically , therefore , that such acts are permitted to be prosecuted and punished in accordance with the conditions and requirements imposed by international law . The second paragraphs of the Covenant \u2019s and ORG relevant articles evidently override the guarantees of domestic criminal law , all the more so since LAW and LAW both imperatively require the prevalence of the principles of nullum crimen and nulla poena , even in situations of war or in states of emergency . For those GPE which incorporate into domestic law the international legal norms concerning war crimes and crimes against humanity subsequent to the commission of these crimes , the second paragraphs of the above - mentioned ORG amount to authorising retrospective criminal legislation in the ORG \u2019s domestic legal system . It is the international , rather than the domestic , law which must have declared , at the time of their commission , these acts to be punishable .", "Historically , this exception has been applied in respect of the punishability of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Second World War . But the development of international law has since separated the sphere of \u2018 international humanitarian law\u2019 from the context of war and made the prosecution and punishment of these crimes independent of the requirements and conditions laid down in the domestic criminal - law system , with regard also to statutory limitations , inasmuch as two conventions on the non - applicability of statutory limitations for war crimes and crimes against humanity have been concluded . ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The definition of , and conditions for , punishing war crimes and crimes against humanity are laid down in international law ; these crimes \u2013 directly or indirectly through the obligations imposed on DATE are prosecuted and punished by the community of nations . The rules on the punishment of war crimes and crimes against humanity \u2013 since these crimes threaten the foundations of humanity and international coexistence \u2013 constitute cogent rules of general international law . Those GPE which refuse to assume these obligations can not participate in the community of nations . ...", "CARDINAL . NORP The regulation under international law of war crimes and crimes against humanity disregards the principle of nullum crimen prevailing in domestic laws , inasmuch as it punishes these crimes , irrespective of whether or not they were punishable under domestic law at the time of their commission . ... It is not the very principle of nullum crimen that is breached in the circumstances but [ only ] its limitation to the sphere of domestic law . Within its system , international law demands that certain criminal acts be characterised , on the basis of the general principles recognised by the community of nations that were prevailing at the time when the act was committed ... as war crimes or crimes against humanity . In the context of these crimes , it is indeed the international community \u2019s criminal - law power that is being exercised \u2013 under conditions and guarantees prescribed by the community of nations \u2013 through the NORP ORG \u2019s criminal - law power . Domestic law is applicable to the extent that international law expressly so requires ( for instance , as is the case with the determination of penalties ) . No domestic law in conflict with an express cogent rule of international law may be given effect . ...", "CARDINAL .

In defining crimes against humanity , paragraph CARDINAL of the Report on the Statute of ORG for the former GPE also makes reference to common LAW . ...", "( d ) A typical feature of war crimes and crimes against humanity is that they are punishable irrespective of whether they were committed in breach of domestic law . ... It is therefore immaterial whether LAW were properly promulgated or whether the NORP State fulfilled its obligation to implement them prior to ... DATE .

The relevant part of the reasoning of the decision states as follows :", "\u201c [ T]he legal provision to be applied by the court is an international convention in respect of its hypothesis , but refers back to the domestic criminal law in respect of the sanctions .", "LAW requires that the relevant international legal instrument be applied , incorporating it into domestic law ; and LAW DATE transforms it into a provision of positive criminal law . Given that the hypothesis of the crime in question has been incorporated into domestic law \u2013 but domestic law does not have its own notions in this connection \u2013 the interpretation of that hypothesis can only be carried out in accordance with the international law .", "Both Act no . CARDINAL of DATE on the enactment of the significance of the DATE revolution and freedom fight and Act no . DATE on the procedure concerning certain crimes committed during the DATE revolution and freedom fight state that in DATE a revolution and a freedom fight took place in GPE . On this basis , as well as according to the [ commonly known ] facts , it can be established that at the time of the perpetration of the crime on DATE a revolution was in progress in GPE . Nevertheless , this definition contained in the domestic legislation does not make it unnecessary to examine whether there was a non - international armed conflict . In its part establishing the hypothesis [ of the crime in question ] , Act no . DATE refers to the ORG signed on CARDINAL DATE ; consequently , the interpretation [ of this hypothesis ] can only be carried out according to the relevant international legal practice or to international legal documents if such exist .", "The above - mentioned Convention defines its own scope of application in LAW as follows : \u2018 in addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peace - time , the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between CARDINAL or more of the High Contracting Parties , even if the state of war is not recognised by CARDINAL of them\u2019 . Moreover , Article CARDINAL provides that its rules have to be applied \u2018 [ i]n the case of an armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of CARDINAL of the High Contracting Parties\u2019 .", "The court had to examine whether at the time of the perpetration of the crime on CARDINAL DATE an armed conflict not of an international character was taking place in GPE .", "The term \u2018 armed conflict not of an international character\u2019 is defined by LAW to LAW of DATE , relating to ORG ) , proclaimed by LAW no .

DATE that is , in an international convention that was concluded after the perpetration of the crime \u2013 is merely illusory , since LAW declares that \u2018 [ t]his LAW develops and supplements LAW common to LAW of CARDINAL DATE without modifying its existing conditions of ORG . Therefore , it can be ascertained that although Protocol II develops and supplements the substantive norms ( that is , the rules of conduct in the case of a non - international conflict ) , it does not introduce any modifications to their existing conditions of application . In view of this , LAW itself establishes that the definition of an armed conflict not of an international character , which is contained in the same paragraph , does not modify the meaning of that term as used by the DATE LAW , but merely interprets it . With respect to [ the original definition ] , [ this one ] is neither a restrictive nor an extensive interpretation , but the very first interpretation defining the meaning of the initial term . ( In the court \u2019s view , this interpretation can not be either restrictive or extensive in any event , since no other international legal document contains a definition of the term with which to compare this interpretation . ) Accordingly , the term \u2018 armed conflict not of an international character\u2019 must be seen as having been already conceived with this meaning at the time when the PERSON was signed .", "When analysing the term , it can be observed that such armed conflicts fall into the category of conflicts that \u2018 take place in the territory of a High Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other organised armed groups which , under responsible command , exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement this Protocol\u2019 . ...", "During TIME to CARDINAL DATE , the first spontaneously organised armed groups came into existence in the territory of GPE , especially in those parts of GPE where they confronted the NORP army which was being deployed unexpectedly . It can be unambiguously established that these armed groups were opposing the central power , although several of them maintained regular negotiations with the government of GPE and ORG . It can also be determined that the armed groups did not operate under any central command , because by the time the joint command of the national guards and the government \u2019s forces was established under the leadership of PERSON , appointed by Prime Minister PERSON , the armed conflicts in the country had already essentially ceased . Consequently , it is self - evident that , although the armed groups maintained a loose network of information between themselves , they did not perform their military operations in various parts of the country in a concerted manner . It seems that it will forever be impossible to ascertain the territories in which and the extent to which the armed groups stood under the control of the various spontaneously organised revolutionary bodies or under that of the former administration , which remained partly operational throughout .", "Comparing the definition of LAW and the statements contained in the opinion of the expert historian , it can be ascertained that LAW no . DATE and , consequently , Convention ( IV ) relative to ORG in Time of War , signed in GPE on DATE , are not applicable to the instant conduct as set out in the indictment .", "This is so because , according to the opinion of the expert historian , on DATE the operating armed groups did not remain under a central command . There were no distinct combatant parties , since the armed groups and persons that were effectively operating , while they might even have been active in the same area yet independent from each other , were often guided by different political motivations . It can not be ascertained which territories of the country were controlled , and to what extent , by armed groups which may have allowed them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations . On no account can it be established that the armed groups reached a level of organisation or submitted to a central command to such an extent that enabled them to implement the regulations of the LAW during the military activities .", "In view of the above , the court has found neither the international Convention promulgated in GPE by LAW no .

On the LOC , he found some policemen who were already disarmed and a few civilians .

Considering this , the defendant was aware that there was a possibility of an armed attack by the insurgents who were already ... in possession of guns and that the lives of all officers entering the police station were thus in danger .", "At the same time , the defendant and his fellow officers did not have knowledge of or training in policing ; thus , they would not have known how to behave when encountering or confronting a hostile group , armed or unarmed .", "The defendant had resolved the assignment at ORG in a peaceful manner . He had persuaded the civilians whom he had found in front of the building to leave the LOC . On their way to ORG , the applicant \u2019s squad encountered CARDINAL young men , CARDINAL of whom was carrying a weapon . Instead of capturing and arresting them , the defendant confiscated the gun and released the CARDINAL individuals unharmed .", "At this juncture , the court draws attention to the case of the \u2018 PERSON fusillade\u2019 , where the officers of the ORG arrested CARDINAL individuals , on whom they had found guns , and accompanied the captured civilians into the yard of the ORG building , where the officers \u2013 on the command of ORG PERSON \u2013 executed them .", "After having received the order to regain control of the police building with the option of using firearms , the defendant and his fellow officers were carrying out a tactical assignment .", "In the testimonies they gave during the repeated proceedings , the defendant and his former fellow officers stated that they had been frightened while carrying out the assignment . Although LAW regarded fear as cowardice and as such , as a punishable act , in the view of this court , fear is a natural human reaction , which , in a given condition or situation , could paralyse a person \u2019s volition .", "Under the influence of these emotional and intellectual impacts which affected his volition , the defendant met PERSON in the yard of the police building , the latter having acquired a gun during the occupation of the building and having intended to execute the chief of ORG . In the court \u2019s view , it is no coincidence that the argument broke out between no other than PERSON and the defendant . The content of their dispute and what actually happened between them can only be assumed , as mentioned by the court in chapter V of the assessment of the evidence . In his testimony , the witness PERSON did not find it impossible that the defendant might have misunderstood PERSON motion in reaching into his pocket , because the order to fire was given immediately afterwards . It is obvious for this court that PERSON must have behaved in a way that increased the defendant \u2019s sense of fear , as a result of which he felt that his and his fellow ORG life and limb was in danger in the situation .
