As the file stands , the defendant would most probably have been convicted of an offence against ORG ( Nach Lage der Akten w\u00e4re der GPE hoher GPE wegen eines Verstosses gegen die StVO verurteilt worden ) . That being so , it would be unjust ( unbillig to award his necessary costs and expenses against the ORG . \"", "CARDINAL .

As it had already explained at length in an earlier decision , LAW ) protected the individual only from possible hazards in civil or criminal trials . This was clear beyond a peradventure from the wording of the provision itself . There was no reason to give LAW ( article PERCENT ) a broad interpretation such as would extend its application to other proceedings . The LAW ( article CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) consequently could not apply to proceedings in connection with \" regulatory offences \" , as these had been excluded from the category of criminal offences , and procedure relating to them was quite distinct from criminal procedure . On the basis that LAW ( article DATE ) was not applicable , ORG had therefore been right to order the defendant to bear his own necessary costs and expenses ( under LAW , second sentence , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW ) because had the prosecution not been statute - barred , \" the defendant would almost certainly ( mit ann\u00e4hernder Sicherheit ) have been found guilty of an offence \" . He had himself admitted to the police that he was not expecting the car which was moving out to the left onto the road in front of him to make a U - turn ; and that he had consequently attempted to overtake it but had been unable to avoid a collision despite his efforts to brake . Mr. PERSON had thus broken the basic rule in LAW ) of ORG and , in particular , had disregarded his duty under LAW not to overtake where the traffic situation was unclear . The court held that in such circumstances it would have been unjust to award the defendant \u2019s necessary costs and expenses against the ORG , especially as the prosecution had become time - barred only during the course of the court proceedings , so that until that moment the defendant was rightly being proceeded against .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr. PERSON then applied to ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) , but on DATE a bench of CARDINAL of that court \u2019s judges refused to entertain the application , holding that it had insufficient prospects of success .", "In ORG view , the decisions of ORG and ORG did not offend the presumption of innocence , which was founded on the principle of the rule of law and was embodied in LAW ( article DATE ) of the LAW . However strong the suspicions , the presumption of innocence precluded taking measures against a defendant ( Beschuldigter ) that amounted in effect to a penalty ( Strafe ) in anticipation of a penalty ( i m Vorgriff auf die Strafe ) . This rule was not infringed where the necessary costs and expenses of a party who had been proceeded against in respect of a \" regulatory offence \" were not awarded against the ORG in the event of the proceedings being discontinued . The judgment continued :", "\" The decision not to order the ORG to pay the costs and expenses of the party concerned obviously can not be regarded as a punishment ( ORG ) or even be equated with such . Furthermore , the decision as to costs and expenses pursuant to LAW , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW and section CARDINAL ) of the LAW on \u2018 regulatory offences\u2019 does not make any finding that the person concerned is guilty : it derives merely from the suspicion falling on him , which had given rise to his being prosecuted for a \u2018 regulatory offence\u2019 .
