The second applicant , Mr Tomm Berntsen , also a NORP citizen , was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . The first applicant is represented by PERSON Ole PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . The second applicant is represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , and by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Background", "In DATE the applicants , together with CARDINAL other persons , founded a limited liability company , ORG , which in DATE was renamed ORG ( hereinafter referred to as VIP ) . The first applicant was Chairman of the company board during most of the period DATE and DATE ; DATE he was a board member and the managing director . The second applicant was the managing director and a board member during a large part of the period between the DATE of DATE and DATE . In addition , the applicants were major shareholders in VIP .", "The company 's trade consisted of acquiring media rights within television and home video industry . It developed into becoming a large - scale holder of film rights for television , cinemas and hotels in various countries . Until DATE , its business was largely concentrated on this kind of activities . While the company experienced a considerable expansion in its trade , its share capital increased from ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in DATE to ORG CARDINAL in DATE . To a large extent , new emissions of shares were used as a means to acquire capital for the purchase of other firms and to cover the running of the company and its financial costs . CARDINAL emissions of shares took place from DATE to DATE .", "In DATE , VIP merged with the company ORG , increasing the number of employees from CARDINAL . From being a relatively small company VIP became a mother company of a large diversified corporation with CARDINAL subsidiary companies involved in a number of different types of activities .", "In DATE , VIP failed to present within the prescribed time - limit the accounts for DATE . Following the discovery of a large unexpected deficit , debt settlement proceedings were opened in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Criminal Investigation", "On DATE ORG ordered the GPE police to open an investigation into alleged criminal activity within VIP and certain other companies involved . On DATE , the police interrogated the applicants for the first time . The investigations , which lasted DATE , concerned suspicion that the applicants were guilty of serious fraud ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) and of serious breach of trust ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) inter alia in relation to the issuing and sales on the ORG stock market of CARDINAL invalid VIP shares in order to meet the company 's financial needs ; the issuing of CARDINAL invalid VIP shares and their transfer to a bank , subsequently replaced as security by CARDINAL equally invalid shares ; partial implementation of an agreement to the effect that CARDINAL of the applicants ' own VIP shares were sold to ORG illegally at a fixed and too high a price . Furthermore , they were suspected of serious embezzlement ( Article CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) in relation to ORG CARDINAL profits derived from an agreement concluded by the applicants without the board 's knowledge giving them a right to repurchase VIP shares at a fixed price . The applicants were moreover suspected of a number of other offences , including various violations of the accounting legislation , insider trading ( second applicant only ) and tax evasion ,", "ORG began to acquaint himself with the case as soon as he received the first recommendation from the police in DATE . Only when he received the last such recommendation in DATE could he gain a complete picture of the case . He then decided that it was too complex to be dealt with by his office and in DATE transferred the case to ORG ( ORG in GPE ) . This is a separate central police and prosecuting authority , set up in DATE - in order to bring together a broad range of expertise for the investigation of complex cases of economic crime - and fully operative since DATE .", "In the course of the investigations , the police heard CARDINAL witnesses and collected some CARDINAL-shelf metres of documents , in part by seizure , in part by voluntary means . The official case documents extended to QUANTITY . Altogether CARDINAL persons were charged ; of whom CARDINAL were finally indicted . At the time , the VIP case was the most extensive case of economic crime ever investigated by the NORP police .", "CARDINAL . Criminal Proceedings", "On DATE an indictment was served on the applicants . In DATE the charges concerning insider trading were dropped . A second indictment was served on DATE . In DATE it was decided not to pursue charges relating to tax evasion and violation of accounting legislation . Those concerning serious embezzlement were also dropped . According to the Government , in some instances this was motivated by the state of the evidence , but in most instances it was done in order to simplify and expedite the proceedings . The indictments were replaced by other indictments on DATE by which the applicants were charged inter alia with fraud contrary to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Penal Code .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) scheduled the case to be examined as from DATE . The main hearing opened on CARDINAL DATE and involved a total of CARDINAL court DATE . The applicants were heard as well as CARDINAL witnesses .", "In decisions of various dates between DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG , ORG and ORG refused the second applicant 's requests for reimbursement of his travel and subsistence expenses - amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL in connection with travelling from GPE to GPE . Moreover , ORG refused his requests for photocopies of the case documents being sent to his address in GPE .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG acquitted the applicants with respect to some of the charges against them but convicted them of violations of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW and of various provisions of LAW DATE ( LAW of DATE no . CARDINAL ) on account of the issuing and sales of shares without the required authority from the company 's governing board . Pursuant to LAW it deferred the issue of sentencing pending a probationary period of DATE . The latter conclusion , which meant that no sentence would be imposed provided that the applicants did not re - offend within the prescribed period , was based on ORG finding of violation of LAW . It observed that , since the entire case had lasted from DATE until DATE , approximately a period of DATE , the requirement in DATE that proceedings be concluded within a \" reasonable time \" had been violated . The applicants were not ordered to pay any costs .", "The Prosecution appealed against ORG judgment , contesting principally its findings as to sentencing and , in the alternative , the ORG acquittals on certain charges . In their cross - appeal the applicants challenged their convictions by ORG .", "By judgment of DATE , ORG ( lagmannsrett ) , sitting with Mr Justice PERSON , PERSON Justice PERSON and ORG , together with CARDINAL lay judges , acquitted the applicants of the charges of serious breach of confidence under LAW , cf . CARDINAL , of the Penal Code but convicted them of various charges under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL and a number of provisions of ORG . It sentenced them to CARDINAL and a half years\u2019 imprisonment of which DATE were suspended with a probationary period of DATE . They were not ordered to pay costs .", "As regards sentencing , ORG judgment included the following reasons :", "\u201c ORG has concluded that the time elapsed - approximately DATE before a final judgment can be expected - is too long , and that the time spent prior to the date in DATE when the summary of evidence was made available and the final indictment of DATE must essentially be attributed to the prosecution . In view of the complexity of the case , - owing , inter alia , to the extensive documentation resulting from investigations of a large number of companies - it must be accepted that the police investigations were planned from the outset to have considerable scope . The amount of time spent at this stage must therefore be viewed against the background of the whole complex of cases . ORG has therefore no particular comment to make on the time spent DATE , when the charge was transmitted to ORG . However , in ORG view , the prosecuting authority has not been able to establish the existence of special circumstances that could justify the excessive lapse of time until the summary of evidence and the final indictment were made available . Had the case been processed with reasonable expediency , it should have been possible to set the case down for trial by DATE , at the latest .", "The final indictment and the summary of evidence were not available until DATE . In the view of ORG it seems reasonably clear that the case should have been tried by ORG by DATE . A period of DATE must be regarded as sufficient for the defence lawyers\u2019 preparation of the case . ORG has an independent responsibility for ensuring that the case be tried within a reasonable time . ORG nevertheless places reliance on the fact that ORG had to give due consideration to the defence lawyers\u2019 requests for time for preparation of the case . All factors taken into consideration , the defence lawyers\u2019 many initiatives in relation to the attempts by the prosecuting authority to set a date for the trial must also be seen as reflecting a wish to delay the trial by making exaggerated demands for preparation time . The additional period of DATE that elapsed before the case came before ORG must therefore be attributed to the indicted persons . For the sake of the record , it should be mentioned in this connection that ORG was able to offer an DATE that was not convenient to the defence lawyers .", "Taken as a whole , the High Court finds that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL\u00bd years that have now been spent on the case can not be regarded as part of \u2018 reasonable time\u2019 , and that the indicted persons could not be held directly responsible for this . This fact must have major consequences for the sentence .", "...", "\u2026 Had the case been tried within a reasonable time , a longer custodial sentence would have been appropriate . The High Court finds , with reference to the long time that has elapsed , that a considerable part of the sentence must be made conditional , but ORG will not make the sentence wholly conditional or grant a conditional deferral of sentence , as was done by ORG . The general deterrent effects are considered to be of major importance in this regard . \u201d", "The applicants sought to appeal against ORG judgment to ORG . They maintained that , in view of the excessive duration of the criminal proceedings against them , the issue of sentencing could be deferred or , at least , they should be given suspended sentences . In any event , they considered that , in view of the nature of the offences , their sentences to CARDINAL\u00bd PERSON imprisonment were too severe . The prosecution requested ORG to reject the appeal . ORG of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts kj\u00e6rem\u00e5lsutvalg ) allowed the appeal in as far as it concerned the issue of sentencing .", "In its judgment of DATE , ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , decided to modify the sentence ordered by ORG to a suspended sentence with DATE , in accordance with the ORG CARDINAL of LAW .", "PERSON , with whom the majority agreed , stated :", "\u201c I have reached the conclusion that the appeal must be upheld so that the whole prison sentence be suspended .", "By way of introduction , I should like to point out that even though ORG has been vested with full powers to review the evidence concerning the question of guilt , the factual basis for ORG will in ORG such an extensive case as this one not be as good as that of ORG . In this connection I mention that the case was heard DATE and that CARDINAL witnesses were heard . The state of the evidence warrants giving the assessments made by ORG considerable weight with respect to the contentious issues of importance to sentencing . In the present case this is of particular importance for the assessment of the questions related to the duration of proceedings .", "The case concerns particularly serious matters and very large amounts of money . Even though no economic loss has arisen directly as a result of the offences , there must have been a considerable risk of such loss being incurred by the injured parties and by others . The central provisions in ORG concerning the expansion of capital have been neglected . Had it been known that invalid shares had been issued in a company registered on ORG , it could have had important repercussions on confidence in the company , irrespective of whether the formal requirements were subsequently fulfilled and its shares were then considered valid . Both the ORG shareholders and its creditors could have suffered losses .", "...", "Even though those convicted were acquitted of the charges of breach of trust , the breach of confidence which they committed vis - \u00e0 - vis the company by abusing their positions must be taken into account in sentencing .", "Those convicted have strongly emphasised that they did not act in order to obtain a personal gain . ORG has not considered this as an adequate description of the situation , something to which I agree . They had considerable share - holding positions in the company and occupied prominent posts . Were the company to have had a financial crisis this would undoubtedly have strongly affected them financially and would have had a great importance for their reputation .", "As regards offences of the kind for which [ the applicants ] have been found guilty , the starting - point must be that a long and unconditional prison sentence should be imposed . I find no reason for departing from the assessment made by ORG that they should receive the same sentence and I refer to ORG statements at this point . The length of the prison sentence , on which ORG unanimously has decided , can not be seen as disproportionate and should in my view be maintained . On the other hand , as already mentioned , I have reached the conclusion that the sentence as a whole should be suspended .", "This is exclusively due to the long period which has elapsed . As regards the relationships between NORP criminal law and Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , I here refer to the decision in GPE ( \u2018 NRt\u2019 ) DATE , p. CARDINAL . As in that case , I find no reason to consider in more detail whether the length of the proceedings must be deemed incompatible with LAW .", "The parties agree that DATE is the starting - point for the period to be taken into consideration in the assessment of the length of time . It has taken DATE to bring the case to the point of a legally enforceable judgment . This in itself is a very long period . In the above - mentioned decision of DATE , it is stated that , in as far as the duration of the proceedings in an extensive case of economic crime is necessary , the length can not be given particular importance in sentencing . Nevertheless , I suppose that this must be subject to qualification in cases of particularly long periods , save if the length is mainly caused by the convicted person \u2019s own conduct , for instance where s / he has been evasive and where for this reason it has not been possible to hear the case within a reasonable time .", "The duration of proceedings in our case is due to several factors . ORG has made an extensive assessment of this question and has concluded that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL\u00bd years which the case at that time had taken , could not be regarded as \u2018 reasonable time\u2019 and could not be attributed to the conduct of those convicted . But it was also stated that a part of the time used was caused by the defence 's own conduct , notably steps which apparently were attempts to delay the decision to set the case down for trial . DATE of the time spent was attributed to the defendants .", "CARDINAL point which was disputed during the proceedings before ORG was how one should consider the time spent on matters which did not lead to indictment before the ORG . When the police , in a case concerning economic crime , have received a report from the trustees in bankruptcy or , as here , from a debt settlement board , pointing to suspicious circumstances in several matters , the police must be given a reasonable time to investigate the case as a whole , without the accused being able to invoke , as a rule , unreasonable length of time solely on the basis that some of the matters of which they were suspected did not lead to formal indictment . In the case before us the investigations were carried out , inter alia , into the ORG accounting and those investigations were time - consuming . I find it clear that the time spent on such investigations in principle can not have any impact on sentencing in a situation where the company was insolvent and where there was suspicion relating to several offences . I note that the indictment of CARDINAL DATE concerned extensive breaches of Article CARDINAL , second sentence , cf . first sentences , cf . LAW ( CARDINAL ) and other provisions , charges which were later dropped in the interest of economy of the procedure . Even though the assessment obviously can not be based on the assumption that those convicted were guilty with respect to matters which were not adjudicated , one would have to take into account in the assessment of the duration of the proceedings that it concerned investigations of a large business corporation and that it inevitably took time to identify the criminal offences in question .", "It thus clearly appears that an extensive and time - consuming investigation was necessary and that , when this was finalised , there remained a considerable task for the prosecution in connection with the preparation of the indictment and for the defence lawyers . In any event , even the prosecution agrees that the duration of the proceedings has been too long and that this must carry weight in sentencing . The delay , which was caused by the fact that the case was taken over by ORG in DATE , must be to the benefit of the accused . Otherwise , I see no reason to deal with the particular matters which have or may have delayed the proceedings .", "Those convicted have been found guilty of particularly serious offences , but in my view there are no penal policy considerations which suggest that , DATE after the investigations started , they should serve a prison sentence . \u201d", "In his dissenting opinion Mr ORG stated :", "\u201c I share the [ above ] views as regards the offences committed by those convicted . I further agree that the duration of the proceedings must be given considerable importance in sentencing . ORG has in my view done so to the extent required when it decided that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL\u00bd DATE of the prison - sentences should be suspended . In my opinion there is moreover reason to consider that the defence must be deemed responsible for a greater share of the unnecessary time consumption than considered by ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Compensation proceedings", "On DATE the first applicant submitted a request to ORG for compensation of pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . In the first place , he claimed ORG CARDINAL in compensation for incurred and future legal costs in connection with his application to ORG concerning the length of the criminal proceedings against him . Secondly , he sought ORG CARDINAL in compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG , sitting with Mr Justice PERSON , PERSON Justice PERSON and ORG , rejected the entirity of the claim .", "The first applicant subsequently challenged the High Court \u2019s decision before ORG of ORG . By decision of DATE , the ORG rejected the appeal .", "As regards the claim for compensation of legal costs , ORG unanimously agreed with ORG that the application to GPE was not necessary in order to expedite the national proceedings and that , accordingly , the conditions for compensation under LAW were not fulfilled .", "As to the claim for compensation for non - pecuniary damage caused by the length of the criminal proceedings , ORG found , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , that there were no grounds for upholding this claim . Mr Justice Gj\u00f8lstad and Mr Justice Tjomsland voted in favour of rejection , while Mr Justice PERSON voted against .", "The majority quoted from passages in ORG judgment of DATE dealing with the reasons why the proceedings had lasted for DATE . Bearing this in mind , the majority based its assessment of the compensation issue on ORG finding that the criminal proceedings had exceeded by DATE what could be considered a reasonable time . The majority first considered that the protraction of the proceedings of DATE must have caused great inconvenience to PERSON . In this connection , the majority emphasised the ORG 's responsibility for ensuring that criminal proceedings be concluded within a reasonable time . On the other hand , the majority considered that a significant factor in the case at hand was that the prison sentence , because of the excessive duration of the proceedings , had been suspended . Had the case been investigated and adjudicated within a reasonable time it could be presumed , on the basis of ORG judgment , that they still would have to serve a prison sentence of GPE DATE . As a consequence of the fact that the proceedings had lasted DATE beyond what would have been reasonable , he had been released from a great burden of having to serve a very long prison sentence .", "The majority further stated :", "\u201c [ I]t would not be correct , when making the very broad assessment foreseen by the statutory provisions , to disregard the penal - law consequences of the duration of the proceedings in the determination of a claim for compensation of nonpecuniary damage . Apart from the claim with respect to costs , no claim has been made for compensation of pecuniary damage in relation to the length of the proceedings . Also in previous cases where ORG has found that the requirement of reasonable length of criminal proceedings has been violated , it has attached significance to whether the length has been taken into account in sentencing in making its assessment of whether non - pecuniary compensation should be award as \u2018 a ORG in accordance with LAW ( see the above - mentioned decision reported in NRt DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "In the light of this , the majority , like ORG , finds that given the importance attached to the duration of the proceedings in the sentencing , there were no special circumstances in the present case suggesting that it would be reasonable to make an award for compensation of non - pecuniary damage . \u201d", "The minority , Mr Justice PERSON , observed that it was primarily the general interest of penal policy , which justified reducing the sentence on the ground of excessive duration of criminal proceedings . The rules on compensation for non - pecuniary damage in LAW were based on different considerations . It was , as was also stated in the provision , a tool for providing the person , who had suffered a disproportionate damage as a result of prosecution , economic compensation for the injury or other non - pecuniary damage which the person had suffered . The rule was related to other statutory provisions on compensation for non - pecuniary damage , in particular LAW . Under LAW it was nevertheless a condition that such compensation from the ORG appeared reasonable in the particular circumstances ( Article CARDINAL ) and that there were particular reasons for the ORG to grant such compensation ( Article CARDINAL ) . Mr Justice PERSON noted that the majority was of the view that the special burden , which PERSON had suffered , was sufficiently compensated by his being released from his duty to serve the prison sentence . However , in Mr Justice PERSON \u2019s opinion , penal policy considerations and the justifications for compensation for nonpecuniary damage should be kept apart .", "CARDINAL . Revision proceedings", "On DATE the first applicant requested that his compensation claim , rejected by ORG of ORG on DATE , be given a fresh examination by ORG so as to amend the earlier decision . He submitted that Mr Justice Tjomsland , because of his previous participation and views expressed in the appeal on sentencing , should have withdrawn from taking part in the ensuing compensation case . The first applicant invoked Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL , of ORG and LAW . Considering that there was no legal basis for amendment , the ORG proposed to examine the request as CARDINAL for revision , to which the applicant did not object .", "On DATE , ORG , sitting in a different composition than in the compensation proceedings , refused to grant revision of the decision of DATE . It recalled that , as a rule , the same judges who examined the question of guilt should determine compensation claims of the kind in issue . While the preparatory works for LAW did not contain any justifications for this arrangement , the latter could not as such be deemed incompatible with LAW . Thus , under the relevant law , a judge 's previous participation in the criminal case against a person claiming compensation was not of its own an obstacle to the judge 's taking part in the compensation case . Under LAW of ORG , the purpose of which provision was to secure the confidence of the public in the impartiality of the judiciary , a judge would not be prevented from taking part solely on the ground that he or she had adjudicated a case concerning the same parties ( NRt DATE , p. CARDINAL ) . The same applied where the new case arose from the same factual background ( NRt ORG had not been required under LAW to withdraw from consideration of the compensation case .", "b. Relevant domestic law", "Article CARDINAL of the Penal Code provides :", "\u201c A person shall be liable for punishment if he by intent seeks to obtain for himself an unjust enrichment", "by causing , strengthening or exploiting a delusion , unlawfully delude someone into an action resulting in damage or a risk of damage for him or the one on whose behalf he is acting , or", "The penalty for fraud is fines or imprisonment of DATE . The same applies to aiding and abetting such conduct . \u201d", "Under LAW , a person who is found guilty of serious fraud shall be punished by up to DATE imprisonment and may also be liable to pay fines . The same applies to the aiding and abetting of such an offence .", "Article CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads :", "\u201c Even though the conditions in LAW are not fulfilled , the court may award the accused compensation for particular or disproportionate damage occasioned by the criminal proceedings if this would be reasonable in the circumstances . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL states :", "\u201c If the conditions for compensation under LAW are fulfilled , the court may , if it is warranted by particular reasons , award the accused a suitable sum in compensation for the infringement or other damage of non - pecuniary character which he has sustained in connection with the criminal proceedings . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , third sentence , provides :", "\u201c For the examination of a request for compensation , the court should in as far as possible be constituted with the judges who adjudicated the criminal case . \u201d", "The relevant provision of Section CARDINAL of ORG ( domstolloven - PERSON of CARDINAL DATE no .
