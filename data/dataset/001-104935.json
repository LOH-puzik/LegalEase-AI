The applicant was awarded compensation of MONEY ( BAM , approximately EUR CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . There are CARDINAL legal regimes applicable to psychiatric detention .", "CARDINAL . First of all , the relevant civil court can order the compulsory confinement of a mental health patient in a psychiatric hospital if it is satisfied on the evidence of a psychiatrist that this is necessary in order to protect the patient concerned and/or the public from serious harm ( see sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , PERSON ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW CARDINAL , PERSON o za\u0161titi osoba sa du\u0161evnim smetnjama , published in ORG ( \u201c OG FBH \u201d ) no . CARDINAL of DATE , amendments published in OG FBH no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the relevant criminal court can impose a hospital order ( obavezno psihijatrijsko lije\u010denje i \u010duvanje u zdravstvenoj ustanovi ) on an offender who , at the time of committing a criminal offence , was suffering from a mental disorder affecting his or her mental responsibility , if it is satisfied on the evidence of a psychiatrist that this is necessary in order to prevent the offender from committing another criminal offence . However , there is an important difference in this regard between the old and new criminal legislation ( the latter entered into force on DATE ) . While a hospital order can still be imposed on those who have been found guilty although suffering from diminished responsibility ( such as the present applicants ) , it can no longer be imposed against those who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity ( see LAW , Krivi\u010dni zakon PERSON i ORG , published in OG FBH no . CARDINAL of DATE , amendments published in OG FBH nos . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) . If a hospital order has indeed been imposed on an offender with diminished responsibility , he or she can now apply once a year to have the application of the hospital order discontinued under LAW ( Zakon o krivi\u010dnom postupku PERSON i ORG , published in OG FBH no . CARDINAL of DATE , amendments published in OG FBH nos .

CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL , ORG of GPE nos . CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE , and PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE ) . The main remedy for a tort is an action for damages , but in some cases permanent injunction can be obtained to prevent repetition of the injury ( see sections CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of this Act ) . Section CARDINAL of this Act prescribes , among other things , that a legal person should be liable for the torts committed vis - \u00e0 - vis a third party by its organs in the course of , or in connection with , the exercise of their functions .", "CARDINAL . LAW or Punishment provides non - judicial preventive machinery for the protection of individuals deprived of their liberty . It is based on a system of visits by ORG for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The ORG periodically draws up reports on individual GPE , which are strictly confidential . Nevertheless , if a ORG fails to cooperate or refuses to improve the situation in the light of the ORG \u2019s recommendations , the ORG may decide to make a public statement . The ORG itself may at any time request publication of the ORG \u2019s report , together with its comments .", "CARDINAL . The relevant part of the report on the visit to GPE carried out from DATE to CARDINAL DATE reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ORG opened as a temporary accommodation for forensic psychiatric patients in DATE . It is the only closed forensic psychiatric unit on the territory of the Federation . With an official capacity of CARDINAL beds , it is located on the first floor of ORG ; at the time of the visit , it was accommodating CARDINAL patients .", "All patients were admitted to the LOC following a court order for \u2018 mandatory psychiatric treatment and placement in an institution of a closed GPE and had been diagnosed as suffering from chronic psychosis , acute psychotic episodes , alcohol psychoses , epilepsy or organic psycho - syndromes . Most of them had committed homicides / attempted homicides and would stay in the LOC for DATE ( on average ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the Prison Director , himself a doctor and psychiatrist , ORG is \u2018 a huge problem which remains unsolved since CARDINAL\u2019 . The Director explained that \u2018 this temporary facility offered conditions which are worse than the conditions for the ordinary prisoners in the other parts of the establishment\u2019 , a situation that he described as \u2018 ORG . He stated that , \u2018 on principle , ORG should not be located within a high security prison\u2019 .", "...", "CARDINAL . The delegation was informed that there was unanimous agreement within the psychiatric and prison system , as well as at a political level , that \u2018 this group of forensic psychiatric patients required hospital conditions and that the treatment and conditions in LOC were not acceptable\u2019 . The delegation was further informed that ORG had allocated MONEY in DATE to allow relocation of the forensic psychiatric annexe and provision of proper facilities . However , this decision was not implemented , as no municipalities within the Federation were ready to accept such a facility on their territory . At the time of the visit , the situation was still unresolved .", "CARDINAL . At the final talks held in GPE in DATE , the delegation clearly indicated that \u2018 placing mentally disordered patients in CARDINAL-bed , overcrowded dormitories in an essentially custodial environment can no longer be ORG and expressed its support for the initiative taken by the authorities in DATE to finance the renovation and relocation programme aimed at remedying the situation , and involving the health authorities to a much greater extent . The delegation asked to receive within DATE further information on this issue , including realistically achievable objectives to resolve this urgent matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the authorities provided the following information to the ORG .", "After the ORG \u2019s visit , an expert team was set up under ORG , which carried out an inspection at FAC . Its findings fully confirm the observations of the ORG \u2019s delegation ( overcrowded dormitories and lack of space in general , lack of nursing staff , no adequate treatment for the patients , very poor hygiene and deficient heating , etc . ) . The expert team came to the conclusion that \u2018 conditions for patients [ were ] extremely inhuman and ORG and that measures had to be taken urgently to remedy the situation .", "In response to this report , ORG and ORG decided to implement the following urgent measures until a new place is found to relocate the forensic psychiatric institution : improvement of hygiene ; reduction of the number of beds in the dormitories ; drafting of specific house rules for the LOC ; setting up a register on cases of use of force / restraint ; \u2018 self - defence\u2019 training for staff .", "CARDINAL . The ORG welcomes the efforts made by the authorities to solve , on an urgent basis , some serious deficiencies observed during the visit of its delegation and would like to receive updated information on the progress made in this domain .", "However , as the authorities themselves acknowledge , this state of affairs can not be prolonged further . The ORG therefore recommends that the authorities provide within DATE a workable strategy to facilitate the relocation of ORG to a site which could offer the potential to remedy the numerous shortcomings observed by the ORG \u2019s delegation .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In preliminary observations on a visit to GPE carried out from DATE , the ORG noted that although FAC was less crowded than during previous visits , the physical conditions had continued to deteriorate and remained wholly unacceptable for a health care institution ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
