The applicant was born in DATE and is currently detained in FAC . He is serving concurrent DATE sentences pursuant to his conviction for CARDINAL counts of attempted murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was permitted to leave detention on TIME leave granted by the prison director . He did not return to the prison when his leave expired . Following a search to trace his whereabouts , he was arrested on CARDINAL DATE . At the time of his arrest he was in possession of a gun and cartridges and was wearing a bullet - proof vest and a woman \u2019s wig . He was transferred to the maximum security wing of the prison and placed in solitary confinement . He was thus confined until DATE , that is , for a total of DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parties\u2019 submissions concerning the conditions of the applicant \u2019s detention during the period of his solitary confinement differed .", "CARDINAL . The Government agreed that the applicant had been detained in the prison \u2019s maximum security wing but maintained that he was detained in a normal cell . The dimensions of the cell were QUANTITY by QUANTITY , that is , QUANTITY . It was furnished with a bed , a cupboard and a table . The cell had CARDINAL windows : an exterior one ( QUANTITY ) and a smaller one above the cell door ( QUANTITY by QUANTITY ) . The cell was opened CARDINAL times a day for a total of TIME . This time was used for personal hygiene purposes and taking meals . It was the applicant \u2019s responsibility to clean his cell and he was provided with all the necessary equipment . He had regular direct contact with prison personnel . Moreover , newspapers had been provided in the wing and he had access to books from the prison library . There was a television set in the wing corridor to which the applicant could listen and he would have been provided with a radio if he had requested CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . During the applicant \u2019s confinement he had spent considerable time outside prison when attending court hearings on CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE and DATE and DATE . He was seen on CARDINAL occasions by the prison doctor ( CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE ) . He was also visited by a welfare officer on DATE and was seen by the prison psychologist on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant was allowed to send letters to his family and friends DATE , he did not attempt to send any such letters . He did not ask to make or receive telephone calls . Visits from family members while the applicant was in solitary confinement were not permitted but during the applicant \u2019s visits to the court , he could meet with his family and friends , and was in fact supplied with food , soft drinks and clothes by his family which he was allowed to take back to prison . On CARDINAL occasion , a mobile telephone given to the applicant by a family member was confiscated upon his return to prison after a hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant disputed the ORG \u2019s description of the conditions of his confinement . He alleged that following his return to prison on DATE he was confined in a cold , damp cell of a maximum of QUANTITY without food , water or suitable clothing . The cell had no external window and the window of the cell door was considerably smaller than the Government had indicated . The applicant was excessively restricted in his ability to use the toilet or have a shower : for DATE of his solitary confinement he was forced to use an empty water bottle to urinate and nylon bags for other needs . These were provided to him by a prison officer through the small window in the cell door . Due to the cold , his arm and shoulder had frozen and he suffered from pain but the doctor was not allowed by the prison authorities to provide him with painkillers . He was nevertheless given an anti - inflammatory gel by the doctor using her own funds . Relying on the prison logbook submitted to ORG , the applicant stated that he had not been allowed to go to the toilet prior to DATE or to have food or the opportunity to shower before DATE , although he was given bottled water and an apple from time to time through his small cell window by a prison officer . He had no access to newspapers , books or television . Further , he was not regularly seen by a doctor and he was not allowed regularly to exit his cell for TIME in TIME in the afternoon , as required by the relevant regulations .", "CARDINAL . While in solitary confinement , the applicant was not permitted to have visits from his family or to make telephone calls . As for the ORG \u2019s allegations that he had not asked to make telephone calls , the applicant replied it was not the practice of the prison authorities to give formal decisions refusing requests to make telephone calls in writing , there were no telephone booths in the maximum security block and , in general , prisoners were not allowed to receive calls from outside the prison . He had no contact with his family in the prison during the period of his solitary confinement and no contact was possible during his court visits . In particular , when he attended hearings at the district court in GPE , he was kept at the GPE central police station \u2019s cells . It was only after the period of his solitary confinement that he could see his family and friends at the court \u2019s hearings .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also alleged that the maximum security wing was used to threaten or punish prisoners given the conditions of detention there and , in particular , the fact that another prisoner would beat up prisoners without any attempt by the authorities to protect them . The applicant alleged that he had been ill - treated in this manner on CARDINAL occasions but did not provide further details .", "CARDINAL . According to the entries in the prison logbook which was submitted to ORG , the applicant was returned to prison on DATE .

The following day , the entry in the logbook records that he met with the prison director and was given food .", "CARDINAL . Although the logbook records that on DATE the applicant used the toilet on several occasions , on others it indicates that he only used the toilet once . On DATE , there is no record of the applicant leaving his cell to use the toilet . Access to shower facilities appears to have been sporadic : at times he showered DATE but on other occasions , according to the logbook , he did not leave his cell to shower for DATE . Similarly , the prison logbook records that on DATE the applicant was given CARDINAL or CARDINAL meals whereas on others , it would appear that he received only one . On DATE , there is no entry recording any meal given to the applicant .", "CARDINAL .

Although the applicant was in solitary confinement until DATE , only entries from the logbook up to CARDINAL DATE have been submitted by the Government .", "CARDINAL . On DATE applicant \u2019s arrest following his failure to return to prison , a police investigation began into alleged offences committed while the applicant was at liberty . According to the Government , this was concluded on DATE with the filing of charges against the applicant for the commission of various offences . The applicant maintained that he was charged on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In parallel , on DATE , the applicant was charged with several disciplinary offences concerning the breach of the terms of his leave . However , the disciplinary proceedings were not pursued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG convicted the applicant of escaping from custody and of other offences associated with his escape . The prison director stated in his evidence before the court that the applicant was placed in solitary confinement in order to protect him from other prisoners who were hostile towards him because of restrictions imposed in the prison affecting everyone as a result of the applicant \u2019s escape . The court noted in its judgment that the applicant had entered a plea of not guilty in respect of the disciplinary offences but that the proceedings were not pursued , no witnesses were heard and no sentence was imposed . Given that there had been no trial , no verdict and no imposition of a sentence in the disciplinary proceedings , the court concluded that the applicant \u2019s confinement could not be treated as a disciplinary sentence .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal against his conviction before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal against his conviction of the offence of escaping from custody given that , at the relevant time , he had been on temporary release and had merely failed to return to prison at the expiry of his release period .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , in a letter to the office of ORG ( \u201c the Ombudsman \u201d ) dated DATE , complained about his detention for an excessive period of time in the maximum security wing , alleging in particular that during this period he was not able to have visits or contact with his family by telephone or correspondence and that he was only allowed to leave his cell in order to go to the toilet , have a bath or pick up his food tray . He subsequently complained that his letter addressed to the ORG dated DATE was delivered late , after having been sent by the prison director to ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG \u2019s report of CARDINAL DATE the applicant had been confined to a cell in the security wing for DATE . Having been contacted by the ORG , the prison authorities stated that the applicant had been put in solitary confinement for his own protection given the possibility of retaliation by other prisoners due to the restrictive measures imposed on them as a result of the applicant \u2019s failure to return from home leave . The prison authorities confirmed that the applicant was not permitted any visits , telephone conversations or letters and that moreover , he was not allowed to exit his cell except in order to wash himself , to go to the toilet and to get his food . It was further noted that although ORG had given instructions on DATE that the applicant be returned to normal detention , the applicant was kept confined to his cell until DATE as the instructions had not been registered in the records of the wing but had merely been noted on a piece of paper which had been misplaced .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s letter to the ORG dated DATE , the report noted that a copy of that letter , as well as copies of CARDINAL other letters addressed to recipients other than the prison authorities , had been sent by the prison director to ORG in order to seek instructions as to whether the particular letters should be sent to the intended recipients . The ORG received the letter addressed to her on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG in her report observed that it did not appear from the file that the confinement of the applicant had been of a disciplinary nature . She also noted that had the applicant \u2019s confinement been a preventive measure or a measure for the protection of the applicant , as claimed by the prison authorities , then under regulation CARDINAL ) of the Prison ( General ) Regulations DATE ( \u201c Prison Regulations \u201d \u2013 see further \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d , below ) the written approval of the prison director would have been required . No such approval had been given . The ORG therefore considered that the applicant \u2019s confinement was a punitive measure .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , the ORG was not convinced that the denial of the applicant \u2019s right to receive visits , correspondence and telephone contact , for example with his DATE son , had aimed to protect the applicant from his fellow inmates . She further observed the following :", "\u201c It is noted that although in theory the total seclusion of a person in combination with his total social isolation is not acceptable , in practice ORG and ORG have tolerated this type of total confinement in exceptional circumstances . However , this was done in cases concerning particularly dangerous terrorists who had been detained pending their trial and who had been allowed to go into the prison yard at some specific time in DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s confinement for a total period of DATE with no right to exit his cell for TIME a day as provided for in FAC , in combination with the denial of the applicant \u2019s right to have contact with family and friends , was in breach of FAC and constituted a violation of the applicant \u2019s rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning the monitoring of the letter he sent to her , the ORG emphasised the importance of allowing prisoners direct and uninhibited access to her office . In this connection she referred , inter alia , to ORG and a report by ORG Committee for the prevention of torture ( see further \u201c International materials \u201d , below ) , as well as the case of Silver and others v.

On DATE the applicant submitted an additional complaint to the ORG against the prison authorities . He complained that the prison authorities had , on DATE , refused to allow him to give his father , who had visited him in prison , a letter addressed to the ORG requesting her to send him copies of past correspondence between them . The applicant claimed that he did not want the contents of his letters to the ORG to be monitored by the prison personnel and that for this reason he had decided to send the letter through his father . He had complained on DATE to the prison director .", "CARDINAL . The ORG , in a report dated DATE , repeated that prisoners should be allowed unrestricted access to her office . She found that there had been unjustified difficulties and unnecessary obstacles in the direct and unhampered communication of the applicant with her office that had negatively affected the exercise of his rights . She noted that on DATE , at a meeting held in ORG , it was decided that a designated letter box would be placed in the central prisons to allow prisoners , freely and without procedural or substantive restrictions , to submit complaints to the ORG concerning their conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant informed the ORG that in DATE , on the basis of a recommendation by the Attorney - General of GPE , CARDINAL prisoners were granted an official pardon by the President and were consequently released .

The ORG produced a report to ORG following its visit to GPE from DATE . As regards allegations of ill - treatment at the hands of other prisoners , the report noted as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG is also concerned by several allegations received by the delegation that prison staff threatened inmates with transfer to ORG ( the maximum security unit ) and used one or more prisoners accommodated in FAC as a means of maintaining control over other inmates .", "In this connection , one prisoner interviewed by the delegation claimed that , on DATE , he had been severely beaten by fellow inmates and subsequently placed in ORG . A criminal investigation had apparently only been initiated after the prisoner concerned succeeded in bringing the matter to the attention of the Minister of ORG and Public Order , who transmitted the case to the competent authority .", "A similar case was brought to the delegation \u2019s attention by an official report of ORG . It would appear that , on DATE , CARDINAL of the alleged perpetrators ( ORG the above - mentioned assault had severely beaten another inmate ; the latter had required hospital treatment as a result . The Commissioner for ORG found that the case had not been investigated thoroughly by the establishment \u2019s management and added that \u2018 the inexcusable delay in investigating such a serious incident gives good reason to suspect preferential treatment vis - \u00e0 - vis I.C.\u2019 .", "CARDINAL . It would be entirely unacceptable for prison staff to threaten prisoners in the above - mentioned manner as a means of control , let alone place prisoners at risk of assault from fellow inmates . The ORG wishes to emphasise that the duty of care which is owed by the prison authorities to prisoners in their charge includes the responsibility to protect them from other prisoners who might wish to cause them harm . In particular , prison staff must be alert to signs of trouble and be both resolved and properly trained to intervene when necessary .", "The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities take the necessary steps with a view to preventing inter - prisoner violence , in the light of the above remarks .", "CARDINAL . The diligent examination by prison management of all information which may come to its attention regarding possible ill - treatment of prisoners by staff or inter - prisoner violence ( whether or not that information takes the form of a formal complaint ) and , if necessary , the instigation of proceedings , is also essential . Indeed , the lack of an appropriate response by prison management can foster a climate in which those minded to ill - treat prisoners can quickly come to believe \u2013 and with very good reason \u2013 that they can do so with impunity . The delegation gained the impression that the management of ORG was reluctant to adopt a proactive approach in this respect ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report also commented on measures of confinement in use in NORP prisons . It observed the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG must also express concern about the potential duration of measures involving the segregation of prisoners for disciplinary reasons ( confinement to a special isolation cell for a period of DATE and confinement to their own cell for DATE ) , and the fact that inmates undergoing segregation for disciplinary reasons were deprived of outdoor exercise throughout their sanction ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "...", "CARDINAL . ...

In this respect , the observations made by the delegation identified important lacunae as regards the guarantees which should surround such a measure . Indeed , no provision is made for those guarantees within LAW themselves .", "CARDINAL . The ORG wishes to stress that the principle of proportionality requires that a balance be struck between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary confinement - type regime , which is a step that can have very harmful consequences for the person concerned . In particular , all forms of solitary confinement should be as short as possible . Further , they should be surrounded by certain guarantees . A prisoner in isolation or confinement or in respect of whom such a measure is extended , should be informed in writing of the reasons therefor ( it being understood that there might be reasonable justification for withholding specific details related to security from the prisoner ) and should be given an opportunity to express his views on the matter and have the right to appeal to an authority outside the prison establishment concerned against the imposition or extension of the measure .

Further , although the application of isolation / confinement for a prolonged period can be necessary in exceptional cases for reasons related to good order and safety , the ORG considers that the application of such a measure for disciplinary purposes is unacceptable ; the use of isolation / confinement for such purposes should be governed exclusively by LAW to CARDINAL of ORG .", "The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities amend LAW accordingly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards the conditions of the cells and the possibility of outdoor exercise for prisoners confined to their cells , the report found as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Material conditions in the cells used for administrative separation or disciplinary purposes ( CARDINAL cells in FAC CARDINAL) were adequate .", "However , from the information received by the delegation during the visit , it emerged that prisoners in isolation or confined to their cells do not benefit from outdoor exercise , sometimes for extended periods . In particular , from an official investigation by ORG , it emerged that one prisoner had been placed in confinement in ORG for DATE without benefiting from outdoor exercise . Such a situation is unacceptable .", "The ORG recommends that the NORP authorities immediately take the necessary steps to ensure that all prisoners placed in an isolation cell or confined to their cells , for whatever reason , benefit from TIME of outdoor exercise each day . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of contact with family and friends , the report noted :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The ORG wishes once again to underline the importance for prisoners of being able to maintain good contact with the outside world . Above all , they must be given the opportunity to safeguard their relationships with their family and friends , and especially with their spouse or partner and their children . The continuation of such relations can be of critical importance for all concerned , particularly in the context of ORG social rehabilitation . The guiding principle should be to promote contact with the outside world ; any restrictions on such contacts should be based exclusively on security concerns of an appreciable nature or considerations linked to available resources .", "CARDINAL .
