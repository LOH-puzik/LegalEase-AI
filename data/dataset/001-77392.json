The visit of the ORG delegation to GPE took place from DATE , in the course of which the delegation inspected inter alia FAC . CARDINAL in PERSON . The ORG recorded \u201c situations of grave concern in terms of conditions of detention \u201d and those at the PERSON were \u201c particularly telling \u201d . It was noted that substantial overcrowding was one of the major deficiencies at the SIZOs . The ORG stressed that the NORP authorities should \u201c increase the current standard of CARDINAL m\u00b2 of living space per prisoner to CARDINAL m\u00b2 \u201d ( paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relevant parts of the ORG report read as follows ( emphasis added by the ORG ) :", "\u201c DATE . Simferopol GPE No . CARDINAL , located within the town , was built at DATE , and had a capacity of CARDINAL persons in CARDINAL cells . At the time of the visit , it accommodated CARDINAL persons , of which CARDINAL women and CARDINAL minors . While the majority of the prison population was on remand , there were CARDINAL sentenced prisoners , including CARDINAL sentenced to life imprisonment .", "Prisoners were held in CARDINAL blocks , CARDINAL dating back to DATE and the other of more recent design , built in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The detention areas reserved for women and juveniles ( both male and female ) offered the best material conditions , in terms of natural light , artificial lighting , cleanliness and furniture . In particular , the ORG welcomes the fact that the shutters covering the cell windows had been removed shortly before the visit , thereby providing not only adequate access to natural light , but also much better ventilation .", "Major deficiencies nevertheless remained . In particular , the occupancy rate was excessive in many cells ( for example , CARDINAL women in an area of QUANTITY m\u00b2 , CARDINAL in an area of CARDINAL m\u00b2 ) and , in addition , not all women had their own beds .", "CARDINAL . The remainder of the prison population ( adult men , most of them on remand ) were subjected to appalling material conditions . These inmates were crammed into severely overcrowded dormitories ( for example , CARDINAL prisoners in an area of CARDINAL m\u00b2 and up to CARDINAL in an area of CARDINAL m\u00b2 ) , with virtually no natural light , often poor artificial lighting and inefficient ventilation . The air was so stifling that most of the inmates remained in their underclothes . Furthermore , the establishment was unable to provide each prisoner with a bed ; consequently , in many dormitories , inmates had to take turns to sleep .", "While some dormitories had been freshly painted , many others were dirty and infested with cockroaches and other vermin . In - cell toilets ( as a rule only partially partitioned ) were in an extremely poor state .", "CARDINAL . The adult men had also greater difficulty maintaining satisfactory personal hygiene , since basic products were severely rationed ( for example , CARDINAL g of soap per month as against CARDINAL g for women and CARDINAL g for minors ) . Further , they were not issued with toilet paper , which was restricted to women and minors . In practice , they were largely dependent on their families in this respect .", "In addition , as at ORG , arrangements for cleaning clothes were unsatisfactory : all prisoners were compelled to wash them in cold water in their cells .", "CARDINAL . As regards activities , efforts were made to offer minors some educational activities ( secondary education ) , particularly with the aid of local authorities , which provided school textbooks and volunteer teachers who visited the GPE in their free time . Further , the staff assigned to minors performed work of a social nature with them , which included teaching them behavioural norms and the rules of day - to - day living . Apart from this , minors had no other form of organised purposeful activities ( such as sporting and cultural activities ) .", "The rest of the prison population had no real form of organised activities . Apart from CARDINAL inmates assigned to prison chores , prisoners had no work or sporting or recreational activities . In practice , the only time they spent out of their cells was for TIME open air exercise per day , taken under conditions which did not allow real exercise ( the exercise areas ranged from CARDINAL m\u00b2 to a maximum of CARDINAL m\u00b2 ) .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , the majority of prisoners were locked up for almost the whole of DATE in severely overcrowded and insalubrious cells , without being offered any activities worthy of the name . Under such conditions , to be incarcerated in PERSON No . CARDINAL could only be a stultifying experience .", "CARDINAL . Lasting improvements to the situation at GPE No . CARDINAL will inevitably take time . This will very largely depend on a substantial reduction of overcrowding . Once more , the delegation 's findings demonstrate the importance and urgency of implementing the recommendation made in paragraph CARDINAL above .", "Nevertheless , measures can and must be taken without delay to palliate certain of the most serious deficiencies observed .", "CARDINAL . As regards material conditions , the ORG recommends that steps be taken :", "- to provide all inmates ( men and women ) with adequate amounts of personal hygiene products and cleaning products for their dormitories , and adequate facilities for cleaning their clothes ;", "- to ensure that each inmate has a bed or sleeping place ;", "- to ensure that material conditions throughout both detention blocks reach the standards prevailing in the women 's and minors ' sections as soon as possible , in terms of natural light ( by removing the shutters on the windows ) , artificial lighting , ventilation and cleanliness .", "As regards activities , the ORG recommends that high priority be given to the development of activity programmes for minors to enable them to enjoy a full programme of educational , recreational and other purposeful activities designed to bring out their potential for social ( re)integration ; physical education should constitute an important part of that programme .", "As regards adult inmates , the ORG recommends that ways of providing them with a minimum of recreational and sporting activities be explored as of now . It is axiomatic that as overcrowding is reduced , fuller programmes of activities must be introduced . In this regard , the ORG draws attention to the long - term objectives for activities set out in CARDINAL and CARDINAL respectively of the reports on DATE visits , which apply to all the GPE 's in the country .", "Lastly , the ORG recommends that the design of the exercise yards be reviewed with a view to enlarging them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As regards medical assistance offered to detainees at the Simferopol GPE , the ORG found as follows :", "\u201c ORG . The DATE visit again highlighted the extreme inadequacy of the arrangements for the supply of appropriate medicines ( for example , Colony No . CARDINAL had no medicines in stock at the time of the visit , while GPE No . CARDINAL did not have a sufficient amount or variety of medicines and none for the treatment of tuberculosis ) . Despite the contributions made by ORG out of its own budget , prisons depended mainly on the humanitarian aid they could secure and on prisoners ' families .", "As the ORG has repeatedly emphasised , this solution is not satisfactory , and is intolerable where the treatment of certain diseases such as tuberculosis is concerned . ORG must point out yet again that it is the responsibility of the ORG to ensure that , irrespective of the prevailing economic circumstances , persons in its custody have access to basic elements of health - care , including the medicines required by their state of health ...", "CARDINAL . Simferopol GPE No . CARDINAL had provision for CARDINAL full - time medical doctors ( general practitioners and specialists in pneumology , psychiatry , gynaecology and dermatology , as well as a dentist ) . However , CARDINAL general practitioner post was vacant . Moreover , the gynaecologist was an outside consultant and many women had no access to this specialist because they were unable to pay for the consultations . Such a situation is not acceptable . As regards feldshers , there were CARDINAL posts , of which CARDINAL were filled .", "Such a team can hardly be deemed sufficient to provide adequate health - care to CARDINAL prisoners , in particular as regards the number of feldshers . The ORG recommends that the vacant doctor 's and feldshers ' posts be filled as soon as possible , and that the question of women 's access to gynaecological care be immediately reviewed .", "The examination / consultation rooms were modestly equipped , but clean . As regards the supply of medicines , reference should be made to the recommendation in paragraph ORG ...", "CARDINAL . Medical screening of newly arrived prisoners was inadequate in several of the establishments visited . It was a perfunctory medical check confined , at best , to weighing the prisoner and measuring his blood pressure ; moreover , at the Simferopol SIZO , this task was left to the feldsher alone , who consulted a doctor only if this was expressly requested by the prisoner .", "Every newly - arrived prisoner should be properly interviewed and physically examined by a medical doctor as soon as possible after his / her arrival ; save for in exceptional circumstances that interview / examination should be carried out on DATE of admission , especially in so far as remand establishments are concerned . Such medical screening on admission could also be performed by a feldsher reporting to the doctor . The ORG recommends that steps be taken to ensure that this is the case in all penitentiary establishments .", "CARDINAL . As regards the recording of injuries observed on prisoners , reference should be made to the recommendations made in paragraph CARDINAL above and in paragraph CARDINAL of the report on its DATE visit .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL of the establishments visited ( PERSON and ORG . CARDINAL ) , neither the medical examinations on arrival nor those performed during detention were confidential , since prison staff attended the consultations . The ORG recommends that all medical examinations of prisoners ( whether on arrival or at a later stage and irrespective of the category of prisoner ) be conducted out of hearing and - unless the doctor concerned requests otherwise in a particular case - out of the sight of prison officers ; the same rule should apply during treatment provided to prisoners .", "CARDINAL . The DATE Report also contains the findings of the ORG concerning the conditions in which detainees were being transferred from CARDINAL place of detention to another :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Concerning road transport of prisoners , the delegation inspected CARDINAL ORG vans in GPE . Each vehicle had collective compartments and an individual compartment . The individual compartments were as small as CARDINAL m\u00b2 ; in paragraph CARDINAL of the report on its DATE visit , the ORG has already recommended that the practice of placing prisoners in compartments of this size cease . Conditions in the vehicle were also similar in other respects to those described in the aforementioned paragraph of the report on the DATE visit ( poor artificial lighting , inadequate ventilation ) .", "CARDINAL . Concerning rail transport , the delegation examined the facilities in CARDINAL of the special carriages used for transporting prisoners . It had compartments measuring CARDINAL and CARDINAL m\u00b2 , with folding benches . The authorised capacity in the smaller compartments was CARDINAL persons for journeys lasting not TIME , and CARDINAL persons for longer journeys . In the larger CARDINAL ORG compartments , CARDINAL persons could be accommodated for short distances and CARDINAL for long distances . The compartments had some access to natural light ; however , ventilation was poor . The toilets for prisoners were in a disgusting state , clogged with excrement , despite the fact that prisoners were due to board TIME for a long journey .", "There were no arrangements to provide prisoners with food , even over long distances ; as for drinking water , only a small container was provided to supply the prisoners throughout the journey .", "CARDINAL . The manner in which prisoners are transported , particularly by train , is unacceptable , having regard inter alia to the material conditions and possible duration of travel .", "The ORG recommends that conditions of prisoners ' transport in GPE be reviewed in the light of the foregoing remarks . As an immediate measure , it recommends that the NORP authorities take steps to :", "- significantly reduce the maximum number of prisoners per compartment in a railway carriage : CARDINAL m\u00b2 compartments should never CARDINAL persons , and CARDINAL m\u00b2 compartments never CARDINAL persons ;", "- ensure that during rail transport , prisoners are supplied with drinking water and that for long journeys , the necessary arrangements are made for them to be properly fed ;", "- no longer use CARDINAL m\u00b2 compartments in vans for transporting prisoners . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
