AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national who lives in GPE . She is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the owner of a plot of land in GPE . Her neighbour owns CARDINAL plots of land . The first one , directly bordering the applicant 's land , is a strip of QUANTITY in width , which is classed as \u201c dividing green \u201d ( Trenngr\u00fcn ) in the area zoning plan ( ORG . For the second plot of land the applicant 's neighbour requested a building permit to erect a workshop for assembling tools . Initially , the neighbour would have had to keep a distance of QUANTITY from the dividing green for any building on the second land , i.e. a total of QUANTITY from the applicant 's land .", "This request was granted by the Mayor ( B\u00fcrgermeister ) of GPE on CARDINAL DATE . Appeal proceedings brought by the applicant remained unsuccessful and on CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed a complaint brought by her .", "An inspection on DATE showed that the neighbour had not fully complied with his building permit and notice to halt the construction ( PERSON ) was issued .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) issued for the first time a construction planning scheme ( GPE ) concerning the plots of land of the applicant 's neighbour . The construction planning scheme allowed for the construction of buildings up to a height of QUANTITY and changed the building line to allow in part building closer to the dividing green which was situated between the applicant 's land and the land of her neighbour . The applicant filed a direct application ( PERSON ) with ORG requesting to have this planning scheme reviewed . This request was rejected by ORG on DATE , because the applicant could have asked for review of the planning scheme in building proceedings concerning the land at issue . In DATE and DATE the planning scheme was modified following amendments to the building legislation , allowing for a maximum construction height of QUANTITY and moving the building line on to the northern edge of the land , opposite to where the applicant 's land was situated .", "In DATE the applicant 's neighbour filed a further request for a building permit for an extension of a part of the building . The permit was granted on DATE by the Mayor . Appeal proceedings brought by the applicant remained unsuccessful . On DATE ORG dismissed a complaint by the applicant as it found that the construction planning scheme and its amendments were lawful .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , a further inspection by the authorities showed that the workshop was not completely in compliance with the permit , because it was QUANTITY too wide and was also built on a small piece of the dividing green .", "Thereupon , on DATE , the applicant 's neighbour requested a retrospective building permit for the workshop . This request was based on a plan that included the demolition of those parts of the workshop that were built on the dividing green .", "At a hearing ( GPE ) on DATE the applicant was present and filed several objections , following which the hearing was adjourned and the neighbour asked to amend his request . Besides the parties several experts were also heard . The landscape protection expert found that the proposed project was an improvement from the point of view of landscape protection . In his view the underlying problem was that initially the workshop for assembling tools had been situated on an isolated plot of land ; subsequently building land had been designated in its close vicinity , and that was what had led to the present tensions . The hearing was resumed and , on DATE , the Mayor of GPE granted the neighbour the building permit .", "On DATE the applicant appealed .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON ) dismissed the applicant 's appeal and allowed the minor breach of the specifications regarding the width of the workshop for assembling tools , because no public interest or rights of third persons had been infringed .", "Subsequently , on DATE , the ORG ( PERSON ) also dismissed the applicant 's appeal ( PERSON ) . It held , inter alia , that the applicant 's subjective rights could not have been infringed by the building permit , because those parts of the workshop erected on the dividing green fell outside the scope of the existing building permit .", "On DATE the applicant filed a complaint with ORG . In her complaint she submitted that her neighbour had not respected all the relevant regulations for the building and that the construction planning scheme had been unlawful and in breach of the principle of equality .", "On DATE ORG , referring , inter alia , to its case law on that matter and its previous decision of DATE in which it had found that the construction planning scheme at issue had been lawful , declined to deal with the applicant 's complaint for lack of any prospect of success . On DATE it referred the case to ORG upon the applicant 's request .", "On DATE ORG instructed the applicant to remedy procedural shortcomings of her complaint . The applicant did so on DATE .", "She submitted that the building authorities had incorrectly applied the provisions of the building legislation and that the building project was not in accordance with the relevant provisions of the area zoning plan and the construction planning scheme .", "On DATE and DATE the applicant 's neighbour and GPE submitted their comments . On DATE the ORG submitted the files and also commented on the applicant 's complaint .", "On DATE the applicant supplemented her complaint and submitted additional evidence . The applicant 's neighbour commented on her submissions on DATE .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's complaint as being manifestly ill - founded since no interference with the applicant 's rights as a neighbour had occurred . This decision was served on the applicant 's lawyer on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
