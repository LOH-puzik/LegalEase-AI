THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , ORG ( GPE ) ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG , are companies registered in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by ORG , solicitors , in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants were companies involved in the timeshare industry , being responsible for finding potential purchasers of timeshare slots in holiday resorts . CARDINAL of the applicants were telesales companies , whose role it was to persuade members of the public to attend a timeshare presentation . The other CARDINAL applicants were responsible for issuing certificates at the end of the presentation which entitled their bearers to a DATE in a resort abroad .", "On DATE , the Secretary of ORG ( \u201c the Secretary of ORG \u201d ) issued petitions to wind up each of the applicants pursuant to section CARDINALA of the Insolvency Act DATE .", "The petitions contained allegations of fraud and deceit by the applicants . The central allegations were that the CARDINAL telesales companies deliberately deceived members of the public into attending the presentations , partly by false statements made on the telephone and partly by the omission of matters that the public ought to have been told . The CARDINAL holiday certificate companies were said to have collected a significant amount in processing fees ( QUANTITY per couple ) and then deliberately organised matters so as to get away with sending the minimum possible number of people on holiday . In effect , the case against them was that , having extracted processing fees out of CARDINAL of couples , they then cheated most of them out of a holiday .", "On DATE , the Secretary of ORG , without notice to the applicants , applied to ORG for the appointment of a provisional liquidator . The application was granted by Mr Justice Lloyd in the absence of the applicants , without any requirement upon the Secretary of ORG to give an undertaking in damages ( an undertaking that , should the application prove subsequently to have been ill - founded , damages could be payable for losses suffered by the companies ) .", "Mr Justice Lloyd \u2019s Order appointed the official receiver as the provisional liquidator . His powers included the ability to ( i ) enter onto the applicants\u2019 premises and take possession , collect in and protect the ORG assets , whether within or outside the jurisdiction , ( ii ) take possession of and secure the books and records of the applicants , ( iii ) retain and pay or dismiss employees at his discretion , ( iv ) terminate , complete or perfect any contracts or transactions relating to the ORG businesses , ( v ) retain and operate the existing bank accounts of the applicants and ( vi ) open and operate new accounts with liberty to pay therefrom any necessary expenses incurred on behalf of the applicants by the official receiver while carrying out his powers and duties under the LAW .", "Mr Justice Lloyd \u2019s Order further ordered that ( a ) notice of it was to be given to the applicants forthwith and that ( b ) the applicants were at liberty to apply to the court to vary or discharge the Order on TIME notice given to the official receiver or to the Secretary of ORG \u2019s solicitor . The applicants did not make any such application .", "On DATE , immediately after the appointment , ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) issued a press release concerning the appointment of the provisional liquidator that , it is alleged by the applicants , was grossly misleading and damaged the applicants\u2019 reputations .", "The official receiver immediately took control of the applicants and their LOC . He dismissed employees and then closed down the applicants\u2019 businesses as quickly as he could . He was in control of the applicants for DATE following his appointment , during which time he failed to deal with ORG telephone queries and did not administer any holiday breaks . The applicants allege that this resulted in a loss of income to them and destroyed their businesses and reputations .", "On DATE , the applicants applied for permission to seek judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision both ( i ) to bring the winding up petitions and ( ii ) to seek the appointment of the provisional liquidator for the companies . On DATE , the question of whether such permission should be granted was ordered by Mr Justice PERSON to be determined by the judge hearing the petitions .", "The action was tried in DATE . By his judgment of DATE , Mr Justice PERSON dismissed the Secretary of ORG \u2019s petitions to wind up the applicants and he discharged the provisional liquidator . The Secretary of ORG \u2019s applications for permission to appeal were dismissed by both Mr Justice Park and ORG .", "Mr Justice Park found that there was no substance in the above allegations made by the Secretary of ORG . In relation to the CARDINAL holiday certificate companies he further found that the ORG had fundamentally misunderstood the nature and the economics of the applicants\u2019 businesses . In relation to other regulations , Mr Justice Park did not find any infringements that would have justified winding up any of the applicants .", "Mr Justice PERSON further expressed his opinion about the ORG \u2019s investigation and actions . He stated that PERSON , the official at the ORG in charge of the investigations into the CARDINAL applicants :", "\u201c ... conducted his investigations almost entirely on the basis of documents ... He had no prior knowledge of the usual way that timeshare marketing was organised , and if he tried to find out about it from other sources he did not say so . He decided to take action against the companies , including the drastic step of applying for the appointment of a provisional liquidator without the companies having notice of the application , almost entirely on the basis of inferences which he drew from the documents . He did not put any of his concerns to P or A [ the directors of the companies ] and ask whether they had an explanation .", "... If , before launching the petition , Mr. PERSON had spoken to P and A ( with their solicitor present if they had wished , as they probably would ) they might have been able to convince him , as they have convinced me , that his conclusions were mistaken . Even if they had not , and Mr. PERSON had still decided to petition for the companies to be wound up and to apply for the appointment of a provisional liquidator , the judge on that application would have been told that the ORG \u2019s allegations were disputed by the companies and the directors . I take it for granted that , if explanations by P and A had been given to Mr. PERSON , he would have described them in his affidavit as fairly as he could , even if he did not accept them himself .", "As matters happened , however , the ORG launched the petition without any warning . It applied for the appointment of a provisional liquidator without notice to the companies . The only evidence before PERSON was Mr. PERSON \u2019s affidavit which presented the matter on the basis that the ORG operations were indisputably and incontrovertibly dishonest . That is , of course , how Mr. PERSON saw the matter and neither I nor Mr. PERSON ( counsel for the companies ) suggest for a moment that Mr. PERSON was influenced by any motive other than his sincere belief about what the protection of the public required . On the material before ORG I do not see how the judge could have done other than accede to the application for the appointment of the provisional liquidator . But thereby the businesses of CARDINAL companies were destroyed . \u201d", "Mr Justice Park awarded costs to the applicants on the \u201c standard \u201d basis , but declined to award on the \u201c indemnity \u201d basis .", "After Mr Justice Park had delivered his judgment , the applicants referred to their application for permission to seek judicial review of the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision to bring the winding up petitions and to seek the appointment of the provisional liquidator . Mr FAC indicated to the applicants that he was not minded to grant such permission on the basis that there was no obligation on the Secretary of ORG to provide compensation for losses caused by the appointment of a provisional liquidator at his request . Therefore , as no compensation could be awarded in judicial review proceedings , no purpose would be served by an application by the applicants for judicial review . The applicants thereafter decided not to pursue the application , on the grounds that to do so would have been pointless .", "The applicants allege that the effect of the appointment and subsequent continuation in office of the provisional liquidator was to destroy the applicants\u2019 goodwill and to devastate their businesses . All the applicants are now in liquidation .", "The applicants allege that , in effect , the Secretary of ORG has a common law immunity from having to give a cross - undertaking in damages upon the appointment of a provisional liquidator at his request , in circumstances in which a private litigant would be obliged to do so . In the absence of any right to seek compensation from the Secretary of ORG , the applicants do not have any means of obtaining financial redress for losses caused by the appointment of the provisional liquidator .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW DATE empowers the Secretary of ORG to require a company to produce documents during the course of an investigation into its affairs .", "Section CARDINALA of LAW DATE provides that :", "\u201c Where it appears to the Secretary of ORG from-", "( a ) any report made or information obtained under Part ORG of LAW DATE ( company investigations , & c. ) ...", "that it is expedient in the public interest that a company should be wound up , he may present a petition for it to be wound up if the court thinks it just and equitable for it to be so . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Insolvency Act CARDINAL allows the court , at any time after the presentation of a winding up petition , to appoint a liquidator provisionally .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE , a provisional liquidator is required to take into his custody or under his control all property and things in action to which the company is or appears to be entitled .", "The effect of an undertaking in damages is that the applicant agrees to abide by any order the court may make as to damages if the court later determines that the company sustained loss as a result of the application . The applicant will also be required to give an undertaking to be responsible for the acts and defaults of the provisional liquidator in such circumstances .", "In ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL at page CARDINAL - i , Sir PERSON set out the position on the general law as follows :", "\u201c First , the general practice is to require an undertaking in damages if a provisional liquidator is appointed ex parte . Second , the general practice is not to require an undertaking in damages if the appointment is made inter partes . The distinction , I think , or a distinction , must be that the protection of the undertaking will be given where the company has had no opportunity of providing any answer or explanation to contentions which may prove to be wholly unfounded , whereas if the company has at least had the opportunity of being heard , the court will be making the appointment after considering what the company has said , if it has chosen to speak , and so can better assess the propriety of making the appointment . \u201d", "However , in Re GPE ( at page CARDINALe ) , the position of the Secretary of ORG was said to be different :", "\u201c ... where , as here , the Secretary of ORG is seeking to have the company wound up not in order to assert some proprietary claim of the ORG but by virtue of LAW DATE , section CARDINAL , [ the then equivalent of section CARDINALA of LAW DATE ] I think that the doctrine of the PERSON case provides sufficient authority and guidance to provide an exemption of the ORG from being required to offer an undertaking in damages as the price of obtaining the appointment of a provisional liquidator , save where the company can establish special circumstances which justify such a requirement being made . \u201d", "The applicants state that the phrase \u201c special circumstances \u201d remains undefined by the courts ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
