NORP The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE in GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON of ORG , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr NORP PERSON of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Either on DATE or DATE the applicant arrived in GPE and claimed asylum shortly thereafter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , with a friend \u2019s assistance , the applicant completed a Statement of Evidence form in which she detailed the reasons for her asylum request . She claimed that she had been ill - treated by NORP Government forces since her husband was a canvassing secretary and an active member of ORG ( \u201c CPN \u201d ) since DATE . He had been arrested by the police on several occasions . In DATE her husband went missing and her son went missing DATE . Neither has been seen since , both presumably have been either arrested or abducted . Since the police were the source of the problem , she could not report these matters . She replied in the negative to a standard question as to whether there were outstanding charges against her or a member of her family .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was interviewed by an immigration officer . As appears from the hand - written record of that interview , the applicant stated that she had claimed asylum on the basis of a fear of persecution by ORG because of her husband \u2019s activities with the ORG . She recalled his disappearance DATE previously , visits and threats by the police who were looking for her husband both at her home and at her son \u2019s school , her ill - treatment on CARDINAL occasions by plain - clothed men who came to her home looking for her husband and her son \u2019s disappearance , DATE after that of her husband .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant was notified that the Secretary of ORG had refused her asylum application under LAW , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention . He considered that the harm the applicant claimed she would suffer on return to GPE would not constitute \u201c persecution \u201d within the meaning of ORG . He pointed out that the unidentified plain - clothed persons whom she claimed ill - treated her could not be considered \u201c agents of persecution within the meaning of LAW \u201d . Her claims did not demonstrate a \u201c sustained pattern or campaign of persecution \u201d against her which was tolerated by the authorities or in respect of which the authorities were unable or unwilling to protect her . In particular , she could have attempted to seek redress through the proper NORP authorities . She had alleged a fear of return to only certain parts of GPE and could therefore be returned to other parts of GPE . The Secretary of ORG also noted significant discrepancies in her evidence relating to whether her husband had been arrested or had \u201c disappeared \u201d and when that had taken place , and concerning her allegations of her own ill - treatment . On the basis of all of the above , there was no \u201c reasonable likelihood of ( her ) fear being realised \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG did not consider that ORG and DATE ( her claim that she would be detained without trial and/or killed on return to GPE ) had extra - territorial effect . Therefore GPE was not the ORG responsible for those aspects of her claim . Her evidence disclosed no substantial grounds for believing that there was a real risk of ill - treatment contrary to LAW return . Her LAW claim did not constitute sufficient grounds for asylum . In light of all of the evidence , the Secretary of ORG concluded that she had not established a well - founded fear of persecution on return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a letter of protest , through ORG in GPE , to the monarch of GPE in support of ORG who had been accused of killing members of the royal family in DATE . The applicant accused the monarch \u2019s son ( Prince Paras ) and a military chief of being involved in these crimes .", "CARDINAL . The applicant then appealed to the Special Adjudicator ( \u201c SA \u201d ) . While the applicant was legally represented before the ORG , the only document submitted containing grounds of appeal to the ORG appears to have been prepared by her . She made numerous submissions concerning the situation in GPE and her fear of persecution . She alleged that she had been arrested and tortured in the past and that she had been detained , had escaped from prison and had left GPE to save her life as soon as her trip to GPE had been arranged . She claimed that her friends and relatives were being arrested and tortured in GPE because of her , that she was receiving threatening letters and that she was on the NORP security forces\u2019 list of targets .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent a further letter of protest through ORG to the monarch of GPE protesting against the proposed accession of his son to the throne .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . He considered that , even allowing for her relative lack of sophistication , language problems and cultural differences , the number and nature of the inconsistencies between her accounts were such that her evidence was unreliable in important respects including in relation to her date of departure from GPE and the circumstances of her husband \u2019s and son \u2019s disappearances . In this latter respect , he found that it was speculative as to whether they had left home voluntarily or not and he noted that the applicant had accepted that members of the ORG were in hiding . She had also accepted that the police did not threaten her thereafter . The ORG did not accept her evidence that she had been assaulted by unknown persons as there were a notable number of inconsistencies about this in her previous evidence .", "CARDINAL . The SA noted the situation between the ORG and the NORP authorities but did not consider that there was any evidence that a wife , with no involvement in politics or public affairs , was likely to have her husband \u2019s political opinions imputed to her ; nor was there any evidence to suggest that a wife was likely to be targeted , detained , tortured , ill - treated or killed . In the opinion of the SA , there was no reasonable likelihood of the applicant suffering in any of these ways on return to GPE . Even if she had a subjective fear , it was speculative and not well - founded . Accordingly , there was no reasonable risk of GPE responsibility being engaged by her expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave the applicant leave to appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision . Her grounds of appeal contested the SA \u2019s conclusions , and reiterated her account of her husband \u2019s and son \u2019s past involvement in the ORG , and of their arrest by the police and gave details of the threats and assaults by the plain - clothed persons who came to her house . The applicant accepted in paragraph CARDINAL of her grounds of appeal that \u201c it is true that I was not an active political lady but my husband was ( a ) very active worker of the NORP party . \u201d In the document the applicant further asserted that inconsistencies were to be explained by language and translation issues and stressed that spouses of activists had been arrested and tortured , giving specific examples . The applicant was not represented before the ORG . Having summarised the SA \u2019s findings , the ORG stated :", "\u201c The grounds restate the applicant \u2019s case at length . GPE evidence is produced annexed to the grounds none of which appears to have been put in front of the [ SA ] . In these circumstances on balance I am satisfied that this appeal does not merit further consideration by the [ ORG ] . The [ ORG ] will require an explanation for the failure to produce the documentary evidence before the [ SA ] . Accordingly , leave to appeal is granted . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Her letter dated DATE addressed to the ORG indicated that she could not attend the hearing fixed for DATE as she was ill . She asked for her case to be decided on the basis of her documents and explained that she had not been able to submit the documents to the SA as she had not yet received them at that stage from GPE . She enclosed a medical certificate dated DATE which indicated that she was unwell and had been started on anti - hypertension medication . She was unable to work for DATE and required rest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard and rejected her application . The applicant was not present or represented at the hearing . The decision of the ORG was sent to her on DATE . The ORG held :", "\u201c Leave was given on the basis of various credibility points made in the grounds of appeal , and of further documentary evidence submitted with them . This evidence has neither been filed in triplicate for the use of the [ ORG ] , as directed , not has any explanation been given , as also directed , for the failure to put it before the [ SA ] . We have not considered it .", "The [ applicant ] and her solicitors were sent notice of hearing on DATE : [ the solicitors ] withdrew by letter on DATE , while she has given no explanation for her failure to appear before us . As required by r. CARDINAL of the Procedure Rules , we have gone ahead with the hearing . While the grounds of appeal assert that the [ applicant ] arrived here on DATE , the statement attached to the statement of evidence form , apparently forwarded by the [ applicant \u2019s ] own solicitors , not only says she did so on CARDINAL May [ DATE ] , but gives circumstantial details of what is said to have happened then . There has been no explanation ... , either before the [ SA ] or us , for this serious discrepancy , and he [ the SA ] must be regarded as justified in the view he took of the [ applicant \u2019s ] credibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to the ORG for leave to appeal to ORG and lodged detailed grounds of appeal . As to her non - attendance at the ORG hearing , she repeated that she had been ill with hypertension and had been advised by her doctor to rest . She had not been able to pay her lawyers so they had to withdraw from her case . Accordingly , she had requested the ORG to decide her case on the basis of the documents presented . It was unfair to reject her asylum claim because she had not lodged documents in triplicate : she would have done so had she been told that it was necessary . As for the inconsistencies referred to by the ORG , she referred to her lack of knowledge of the LANGUAGE language , her memory losses due to the traumas she had suffered and differences between the LANGUAGE and NORP calendars which made for confusing calculations . Indeed her first interpreter spoke Hindi but was not familiar with the NORP calendar : when the applicant indicated that she could not follow , the interpreter reassured her that it did not matter as she would have the chance to change her statement at ORG . Nor could she follow ORG interpreter , as the latter spoke PERSON ( another language spoken in GPE ) and not NORP . She went on to describe again her experiences in GPE , the current situation there and why she feared persecution . She indicated that her husband and son were being tortured in prison and that CARDINAL close relatives had been recently killed by the police on the basis of involvement with the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE she addressed a further detailed letter of protest to the \u201c Premier of GPE \u201d through ORG in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG refused leave to appeal on the basis that there was no arguable point of law and that her grounds of appeal did not address the reasons for the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for leave to appeal against the ORG decision . She submitted further detailed grounds of appeal : she explained that she could not afford a lawyer for the ORG proceedings , that she was unwell , that she was suffering from depression and that she had language difficulties and difficulties with legal procedures . She explained that she had been unable to submit certain documentation to the ORG as it was impossible to bring the documents with her when she left GPE and she had to wait until friends could deliver them to her . She again explained why there were inconsistencies in her evidence as to her date of arrival in GPE . She pointed out that not all of the circumstances of her case had therefore been taken into account and she again described the situation in GPE , her experiences there and her fears about being returned there . In particular , she claimed that her husband and son had been incarcerated and that she had learnt from friends that they were being \u201c tortured very much \u201d and that all her \u201c fellow comrades \u201d were being arrested , tortured and killed every day by the NORP government . She also explained that one of the reasons for any inconsistencies in her account was her fear of GPE authorities following her bad experiences in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a single judge of ORG heard her application . The applicant was present with an interpreter . The judge rejected her application . The ORG considered that her appeal had no prospects of success because :", "\u201c No error of law was made by the ORG . The [ SA ] did not believe the applicant \u2019s claim as to her historic persecution , and was not satisfied that there was evidence that she might be at risk if she returned to GPE . In the circumstances before it , the ORG was within the permissible limits of its practice not to look at the new material . Although , in the unusual circumstances of PERSON allegations , the court made enquiries of her former solicitors , any unreasonable failure by them to assist her ( which the court does not find demonstrated ) can not be found an error by the ORG . The explanation for not producing the new material before the [ SA ] is not satisfactory , particularly as some of it ( e.g. some of the material about protests in the GPE ) must have been in PERSON \u2019s hands at the time of the hearing . I have also to express some scepticism as to whether someone who signs long letters in good LANGUAGE as \u201c Chair , ORG \u201d was as incapable of attending to her own defence as PERSON claims to have been .", "If PERSON can demonstrate by the new material that her situation is markedly different from that which was before the ORG her only course is to approach the [ Home Secretary ] : although I must not be taken to have formed any view as to whether that course would be justified or successful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed that no appeal lay to it from a refusal by ORG to grant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . By notice dated DATE the applicant was served with removal directions , the removal being foreseen for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an application against GPE with this Court , submitting a document dated DATE in NORP and its translation . It is said to be a letter from her lawyer in GPE to her and the translation reads as follows :", "\u201c This office has [ received ] this arrest warrant against [ the applicant ] on the instruction of LOC ... dated CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the charge of treason . I am unable to prepare , ... plead and [ proceed with ] her case because of ... harassment [ by ] the police , court officers and judges and fear of being arrested ... myself due to her protest letters against the present PERSON family , government and army on the direction of [ the ORG ] . Now her son and husband are in PERSON and NORP jails , respectively . Now the Government has declared a state emergency against the [ CPN ] . All ... human Rights are being suspended and [ the ] press totally are being censored . It is certain that PERSON will be arrested , tortured , killed or disappeared at the airport on her arrival to this country . Her protest letters against the royal massacres and against Crown Prince ... have really increased her threat of life . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The document referred to in that letter was also submitted in NORP together with its translation . It is described as an arrest warrant issued by ORG and dated DATE and its translation reads as follows :", "\u201c On the instructions of ORG , hereby this office issues an arrest warrant [ in ] the name of PERSON - CARDINAL of Ka . PERSON . Na . GPE no . CARDINAL [ who is ] CARDINAL\u2019 CARDINAL \u2019\u2019 [ in ] height [ and has ] olive complexion , black hair and CARDINAL broken tooth on the charge of treason . It is ordered to search and arrest and bring her to this office without letting her escape on the way until the withdrawal of this arrest warrant . If she is not arrested in DATE time except[ing ] the period of your journey , be active to arrest her after delivering this arrest warrant to her home on DATE until her arrest . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant also submitted to ORG a medical certificate dated DATE which refers to her having undergone treatment for hypertension and cellulitis affecting her legs for which she had been treated in the accident and emergency service of a hospital and a letter dated DATE from the ORG in NORP and its translation . It congratulated and thanked the applicant for her courage in protesting against ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request to ORG for further consideration of her case enclosing a copy of the warrant for her arrest , a copy of the letter from her NORP lawyer and a copy of the letter from the ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG decided not to treat her representations as a fresh application . It found , inter alia , that the arrest warrant and the lawyer \u2019s letter had already been fully considered and dismissed by the domestic courts . Following further representations by the applicant , ORG conceded that the documents had not in fact been considered by the ORG but maintained its refusal to consider the representations as amounting to a fresh application on DATE , explaining that as no reason had been given as to why the originals had not been submitted to them on this occasion , it was unable to examine the new evidence . It concluded that , having considered the findings of fact made by the ORG and the ease with which such documents could be obtained and their timing and content , it was unable to place any reliance on them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently applied for permission for judicial review . On DATE , following an oral hearing , ORG refused her application upon the assurance given by the Secretary of ORG that the applicant would not be removed by ORG if further representations were made to it within DATE and until a decision was made on those representations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant made further representations to ORG . Her arguments centred on the fact that the above mentioned documents ( namely the copy of the warrant for her arrest in GPE , letters from the ORG and a copy of a letter from her lawyer in GPE ) had never been considered . Her representatives asserted that she could not have produced these documents at the time of her first asylum claim as they were not then available to her . It was further contended that the applicant had become a marked person so far as the Government of GPE was concerned due to her numerous protest letters against the ORG regime during her stay in GPE which had \u201c doubled her risk to life as compared to her pre - arrival risk as a consequence of imputed political opinion \u201d . It was finally maintained that the Secretary of ORG had failed to consider the risk the applicant would face in the light of the changed political situation in GPE . In particular , the NORP King \u2019s actions had \u201c plunged the country into a human rights crisis and put any NORP , even sympathisers , at a real risk of torture , disappearance or being killed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE these representations were accepted as amounting to a fresh claim by ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a decision was made to refuse to grant the applicant asylum under paragraph CARDINAL of ORG CARDINAL ( as amended ) and on DATE a decision was made to refuse her leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard the applicant \u2019s appeal , in the applicant \u2019s absence on medical grounds without the latter seeking an adjournment , and the appeal was refused on DATE . The presiding Immigration Judge did not find the applicant to be credible and noted numerous inconsistencies in her account . In particular , he found that she had vacillated as to the exact date of her arrival in GPE and she had produced a letter attesting to the fact that she was the Chairperson of a NORP protest committee in GPE , yet , had answered that she was not the Chair but just a member when later questioned on this point . Furthermore , the fact that the applicant had not been cross - examined on the new evidence , thus depriving the Secretary of ORG of an opportunity to challenge her account , did little to enhance her credibility . It appeared also that the applicant had never taken part in any political activity in GPE and that there had been no reason for the NORP authorities to issue an arrest warrant when she had left the country , let alone DATE as the document she had proffered suggested . Ultimately , the ORG concluded that only in an exceptional case would a risk of persecution or treatment contrary to LAW be held to arise by virtue of being , or being perceived , as a NORP and that the present was not such a case . Even assuming that the applicant \u2019s account was true , country guidance reflected the fact that there was no risk to individuals on the basis of imputed political opinion by way of association with family members and internal relocation to GPE , GPE \u2019s capital , appeared to be a viable option .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s application for reconsideration of the ORG \u2019s decision under section CARDINAL of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act DATE was refused by a Senior Immigration Judge sitting at the ORG on the basis that the grounds on which reconsideration was sought did not disclose any error of law .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of ORG Treatment of Claimants , etc . ) stipulates the following :", "( CARDINAL ) In determining whether to believe a statement made by or on behalf of a person who makes an asylum claim or a human rights claim , a deciding authority shall take account , as damaging the claimant \u2019s credibility , of any behaviour to which this section applies .", "( CARDINAL ) This section applies to any behaviour by the claimant that the deciding authority thinks\u2014", "( a ) is designed or likely to conceal information ,", "( b ) is designed or likely to mislead , or", "( c ) is designed or likely to obstruct or delay the handling or resolution of the claim or the taking of a decision in relation to the claimant .", "( CARDINAL ) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection ( CARDINAL ) the following kinds of behaviour shall be treated as designed or likely to conceal information or to mislead\u2014", "( a ) failure without reasonable explanation to produce a passport on request to an immigration officer or to the Secretary of ORG ,", "( b ) the production of a document which is not a valid passport as if it were ,", "( c ) the destruction , alteration or disposal , in each case without reasonable explanation , of a passport ,", "( d ) the destruction , alteration or disposal , in each case without reasonable explanation , of a ticket or other document connected with travel , and", "( e ) failure without reasonable explanation to answer a question asked by a deciding authority . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s country guidance case entitled KG ( review of current situation ) ORG [ DATE ] PERSON DATE , after examining available country information , concluded the following as to the potential risks to NORP upon return to GPE :", "\u201c So far as the issue of risk on return to NORP from the current government is concerned , we consider that the latest background evidence , which includes reference to the dropping of all terrorism charges against NORP rebels and to a clear commitment from the interim government to include NORP both in the interim government ( at some stage ) and in a new regular government following elections , demonstrates that even active members of the ORG and members of the ORG would not be at risk on return to GPE . In our view it would only be in the exceptional case that an appellant could show a continuing risk of persecution or serious harm or treatment contrary to LAW by virtue of being , or being perceived as , a NORP . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG published on DATE ( ORG , DATE ) cite at paragraph CARDINAL ORG ( ORG ) Country Profile on GPE , which was last updated on DATE and which states ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) the following as regards the current political climate in GPE :", "\u201c A peace agreement between the Government of GPE and the NORP was signed in GPE on DATE thereby ending DATE of conflict in GPE . Under the terms of the agreement ORG and NORP cadres will be confined to barracks and cantonments .

The agreement also provides for elections to a ORG by DATE and for the NORP to become part of the political mainstream as a legitimate political party . Subsequently an arms management agreement was signed on DATE between the NORP and the government under the auspices of the ORG . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
