After being tackled by CARDINAL of the officers the applicant lay on the ground without resisting . Both officers knelt on him and CARDINAL of them started to strangle him with an unknown object and shouted \u201c the pig should die \u201d .

If these QUANTITY techniques had not worked the officers would have needed to use professional blows , which were more likely to cause injuries .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , the statement given by officer ORG corresponds to the above described version of events relied on by the Government ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

He assumed that the bruise had been incurred while the applicant was lying face down on the ground and trying to stand up .", "CARDINAL .

Subsequently , while I was lying face down , the officer who had thrown me to the ground and hit me started kicking me in the back and kidney area until my wife arrived and then he stopped .
