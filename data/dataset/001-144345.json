THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The first applicant is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . The second applicant is her mother , who was born in DATE and is a GPE national who lives in GPE . The third applicant is her brother , who was born in DATE and is a NORP national who also lives in GPE . All CARDINAL applicants are represented by FAC .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant is an ethnic GPE who holds GPE citizenship . On DATE she arrived at FAC airport on a flight from GPE via GPE . She held a valid visitor \u2019s visa for GPE and passed through immigration controls .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant went to stay with her brother , the third applicant , who was resident in GPE . Her mother , the second applicant , resided with the brother .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant subsequently instructed a solicitor who , by letter to ORG dated DATE , indicated that she wished to make an asylum claim on the ground that she feared mistreatment because of her imputed political opinion if returned to GPE . The letter recorded that she claimed to have a well - founded fear of persecution because she was an ethnic GPE from northern GPE ; she had been detained and tortured by the Sri NORP authorities ; the Sri NORP authorities had a record of her as a suspected NORP sympathiser ; she was \u201c confused and psychologically scarred \u201d ; she would be returning from GPE , which the GPE authorities regarded as a centre of NORP activity and fundraising ; and she had escaped from GPE government custody .", "CARDINAL . She attended an asylum screening interview on DATE . Her interviewer was female . According to the applicant the interview was conducted with the aid of a male , GPE - speaking interpreter . She was asked if she had a preference whether she was interviewed by a man or a woman and answered that she did not .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant \u2019s asylum interview took place . The interview was conducted by a female interviewer assisted by a female , GPE - speaking interpreter . The first applicant maintained her claim for asylum or humanitarian protection on grounds of an alleged risk of illtreatment if returned . She claimed that on DATE , she had been stopped at an army checkpoint in GPE . Because her identity card listed her place of birth as PERSON , a town in a predominantly NORP area of northern GPE , she had been accused of planning acts of violence and detained by government agents for DATE at an unknown location . Her husband and others had managed to secure her release , provided that she report to the authorities DATE .", "CARDINAL . She further alleged that on DATE , she had been assaulted by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) officers who had come to her home looking for her husband while he and their CARDINAL sons were out . She had been taken to a remote camp in an unknown , governmentcontrolled area of GPE for questioning , where she had been tortured . She had subsequently become ill and had been transferred to a hospital with a ORG guard stationed in the hospital grounds . She had escaped after DATE , at TIME when there was no guard , with the help of a nurse and her husband , who was a taxi - driver . She had paid them with a gold earring . She had not returned to her home in GPE but had spent DATE at the house of her husband \u2019s friend in PERSON before leaving the country with the help of an agent , whom she had paid with her jewellery and the title deeds to her home . She had not contacted her husband or sons since her arrest but had heard that they were no longer living at her former home . She had entered GPE on a visitor \u2019s visa which she had obtained in DATE to enable her to visit the third applicant and his wife , who were resident in GPE and had just had a baby .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG refused the first applicant asylum and humanitarian protection on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On the question of the credibility of her account of events in GPE prior to her arrival in GPE , the Secretary of ORG made a number of comments . First , she did not accept as credible , having regard to immigration control procedures , the first applicant \u2019s claim at the asylum interview that she did not speak to an immigration officer when passing through immigration control . She concluded that the first applicant had gained illegal entry to GPE by verbally deceiving the immigration officer and placed \u201c significant weight \u201d on the mandatory damage done to her credibility in this regard . She further found that her credibility was damaged by the fact that she had not claimed asylum immediately on arrival at FAC but \u201c DATE \u201d after ( in their written submissions , the ORG accepted that the reference to \u201c DATE \u201d was an error and should have read \u201c DATE \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . Second , in respect of the first applicant \u2019s alleged arrest in DATE , the Secretary of ORG found that , having lived in GPE for DATE , the first applicant would already have registered with the authorities there ( referring to information contained in GPE for GPE , DATE the \u201c COI Report DATE \u201d ) . Doubt was cast on her account of events because her claim that she was detained for the reason that her ID card stated that she was from PERSON was not considered consistent with the purpose and use of compulsory registration in GPE , which was to identify and question further those not from the area at the time of registration . Her account was also vague : she could not say who the people who had come with her husband to collect her were , or how her husband had secured her release . Despite having been released with an obligation to report on a DATE basis , she did not know to whom she had reported , where she had reported or how many times she had reported . The Secretary of ORG considered that her vague responses cast doubt on her claim . She therefore did not accept that the first applicant had been arrested and detained in the circumstances claimed , and this damaged her credibility .", "CARDINAL . Third , in respect of her alleged arrest in DATE , the Secretary of ORG considered the first applicant \u2019s claim that she was of interest to the ORG to be inconsistent with her account that the guard left the hospital , enabling her to escape . The Secretary of ORG also noted that she had all the necessary documents and means to leave GPE legally and would not have required the assistance of an agent . Her account that she was assisted by an agent was therefore not consistent with her personal circumstances . Further , since the first applicant had been too afraid to return to her home address , she had not explained how she had obtained her DATE passport for travel . This , too , cast doubt on the claim that she had left GPE in the circumstances described . The Secretary of ORG was of the view that although the first applicant had stated that she had had no contact with her husband or children since her arrest , it was unlikely that she would have fled GPE without attempting to warn them of the ORG \u2019s interest in her husband . For all of these reasons , the Secretary of ORG did not accept that she had been arrested or detained in DATE and her credibility was damaged as a result .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG considered the risk to the first applicant on return to GPE in light of these adverse credibility findings and the relevant case - law . As the material facts of her claim were not accepted , the Secretary of ORG concluded that the Sri Lankan authorities would have no adverse interest in her . In terms of the risk factors identified by ORG in the leading country guidance case of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) , the only ones applicable to her were her NORP ethnicity , her return from GPE and the fact that she had made an asylum claim abroad . These did not create , either separately or cumulatively , a real risk of ill - treatment on return .", "CARDINAL . As for DATE , the Secretary of ORG noted that the first applicant relied on her relationships with her mother , brother and sister ( who had arrived in GPE with the first applicant and had also claimed asylum ) . There was no evidence that these relationships involved more dependency than the usual emotional ties , and she had failed to show family life with her sister . There was equally no evidence that she had established private life in GPE since her arrival on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed to the First - tier ORG ) . Her appeal was heard with that of her sister , who had also been refused asylum . The hearing took place before a male Immigration Judge and with the assistance of a male interpreter . The judge had before him , inter alia , a copy of the screening and asylum interview records , the Secretary of ORG \u2019s reasons for refusal and the grounds of appeal . He also had before him a witness statement in which the first applicant set out full details of her account , and claimed in particular that she had never registered in GPE ; that her passport had been in a locker at the bank ; and that her husband \u2019s friend had recovered her passport on her behalf . The applicants relied on the COI Report DATE together with relevant case - law and other supporting documents and objective material . The judge heard oral evidence from the applicant , her sister and her brother .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was dismissed on DATE . The judge made a number of findings of fact , explaining that he had given careful attention to the oral evidence in the case , the reasons for refusal letter , the grounds of appeal , the applicant \u2019s witness statement and the supporting documents , including the country evidence and the country guidance cases of ORG and ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . He upheld the Secretary of ORG \u2019s finding that the first applicant would have had to register with the police in GPE , explaining that had she not done so , she would have been stopped at checkpoints long before DATE . He also observed that the Sri NORP authorities had issued her with a passport in DATE , even though they knew she was from PERSON . He commented on her description of her release from the DATE period of detention , noting that her husband could not have known where she was being detained when she herself did not know and that she was unable to provide details of the reporting requirement imposed . He made an adverse finding of credibility .", "CARDINAL . As regards the second period of detention in DATE , the Immigration Judge found that her account of her arrest made no sense : if the ORG had wanted to find her husband they would have waited for him or gone to look for him , and would not have taken her instead . The judge described the ill - treatment that she alleged had taken place , namely that a polythene bag with petrol in it had been placed over her head and her head had been repeatedly submerged in water , and found it not credible that during this treatment her gold earrings would have remained in place , allowing her to use them to bribe the nurse later . If the ORG were interested in her and wished to obtain information through torture , the judge considered it not credible that they would have arranged for her medical treatment by a doctor and a nurse . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... Despite the fact that the ORG had apparently seen fit to place a guard on the door they did not see fit to ensure that the guards changed shifts simultaneously thereby allowing the appellant to escape , dressed as a nurse having first given the genuine nurse her earrings which were also used to pay the nurse \u2019s brother to pick her up in his rickshaw taxi and then to deliver her to a friend \u2019s house even though he could not possibly have known in advance how long the journey would last or whether he would have enough petrol to make the trip because he did not know where the destination would be and [ the first applicant ] did not know where she was being held . I am trying to work out what was the point of dressing up as a nurse when there was nobody around to see her but there seems little point in picking up on small points when the entire story is so ludicrously lacking in credibility that it would struggle to be acceptable even as the plot of a \u2018 Carry - on\u2019 film \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant \u2019s seeking refuge with her husband \u2019s friend in PERSON , the judge observed that she and her driver \u201c would have woken up the entire village \u201d by knocking on doors to find out where her friend lived . He further observed that the first applicant had \u201c apparently forgotten \u201d , when claiming that she could not go home because no - one was there , that her husband and children would have come home and wondered where she had gone . He found her explanation that her friend had told her that they were living elsewhere to be \u201c an embellishment designed to plug a gap in the evidence \u201d . The judge made critical comments about the ORG accounts of how they contacted each other by mobile phone and rejected the first applicant \u2019s account of having used an agent , on the basis that she had a passport with a valid visitor \u2019s visa so had no need for one . Her claim of having sold the house to pay the fees he said was \u201c a total fabrication \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The Immigration Judge found that the sisters had obviously put their heads together and that their escape from GPE was nothing more than \u201c a coordinated pleasure trip with a sinister intention , namely to deceive the GPE authorities by cooking up a story once they had arrived at their brother \u2019s house \u201d . The judge had no doubt that they had been in regular contact with their respective husbands and that the first applicant had been in contact with her sons . He reviewed all the applicable risk factors set out in LOC ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and concluded that the first applicant and her sister could be returned to GPE . In particular , there was no evidence that a failed asylum - seeker was per se subject to persecution on return and the first applicant and her sister were of no interest to the authorities . There was nothing about them save their ethnicity which could possibly cause any authority to make inquiries .", "CARDINAL . As to the manner in which the first applicant had claimed asylum , the judge commented on her failure to make a claim at FAC airport or immediately upon arrival at her brother \u2019s house . He found that her mother \u2019s alleged ill - health was not sufficiently serious to have prevented her from contacting the authorities immediately . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The appellants claim to suffer from the effects of torture but I find that this is all part of the smokescreen . They have persisted in maintaining a false story and their conduct in seeking anonymity [ in the course of proceedings before the ORG ] is but another aspect of the smokescreen which they have thrown up . They have taken advantage of the [ ORG ] and the local school system . Their brother has abused the society which gave him refuge . I have no hesitation in finding that their conduct adversely affects what remains of their credibility . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge concluded :", "\u201c CARDINAL . I find in each case that the appellant is sufficiently resourceful to be able to return and to re - establish herself in a country where she spent most of her life and where her family still lives . She is not suffering from any life - threatening illnesses ... I find on all the evidence adduced that there are no compassionate circumstances or other matters showing why the appellant could not return to GPE . I find that her ties are to GPE and not to GPE . Removal is appropriate and proportionate .", "...", "CARDINAL . Given the conclusions as outlined above , I also find in each case that the appellant has not shown substantial grounds for believing that she will face a real risk of serious harm in her country of origin or that she is unable , or owing to such risk , unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her country of origin ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first applicant and her sister sought permission to appeal against the ORG \u2019s determination on grounds , inter alia , of bias and the fact that the Immigration Judge had failed properly to consider their case under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the application was dismissed by a different Immigration Judge of the First - tier ORG who explained :", "\u201c The Immigration Judge spent some time dealing with the NORP cases and for a number of perfectly clear reasons disbelieved the entirety of their accounts . It is clear that he expresses himself in very forceful terms ; however , for each matter he disbelieves he gives clear reasons [ which ] do not display bias , but which simply explain why he has reached the conclusion , and whilst many might not have expressed themselves so forcefully the expressions themselves do not display an arguable error of law .", "While it is true that there is no clear evaluation in relation to article CARDINAL , in looking at the appellants\u2019 and [ their ] witness \u2019s statements there is nothing in them to suggest any real family life or private life for either appellant save for presence with other adult family members . I see no skeleton argument for either , which suggests that no real article CARDINAL case was put forward . As a result there appears to me to be no realistic prospect of success on appeal in relation to article CARDINAL ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The first applicant and her sister renewed their application to ORG . On DATE the application was dismissed for the reasons given in DATE by the First - tier ORG . The Senior Immigration Judge added that , although the initial NORP Judge \u2019s opinions had been robustly expressed , there was no evidence of bias .", "CARDINAL . With the rejection of the application to appeal , the first applicant \u2019s appeal rights were exhausted .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant \u2019s ORG counselling psychologist informed her general practitioner that she was \u201c having suicidal thoughts of throwing herself in front of a train or traffic \u201d and that she claimed to have stepped out in front of DATE , which had fortunately stopped in time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the general practitioner confirmed that the first applicant suffered from depressive illness \u201c due to her family situation \u201d , that her antidepressant medication was not working , that she had been referred to a psychiatrist and that her prognosis would be poor until support for her to remain in GPE had been achieved . He referred to her \u201c suicidal ideation \u201d and problems with her status in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c UKBA \u201d ) issued directions for the first applicant \u2019s removal to GPE by charter flight at TIME on DATE . She was taken into immigration detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE medical personnel at the immigration removal centre recorded in an ORG report that the first applicant had told them that she had been tortured by the GPE army and that , as part of that torture , had been raped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , with the assistance of new legal representation , the first applicant made further submissions to the Secretary of ORG . Her representatives submitted that details of her ill - treatment while in detention had not previously been disclosed because she was too traumatised to give full disclosure to her brother , her male lawyer and the male interpreter at the asylum interviews , and that trauma could cause individuals to block out painful events . They explained that she had been referred to ORG for further investigation and included a copy of the ORG report .", "CARDINAL . The further submissions also referred to the fact that the first applicant had disclosed suicidal thoughts and that there were concerns for her well - being . The various letters from her ORG and counselling psychologist were enclosed . Relying also on LAW , the first applicant submitted that return to the place where torture and illtreatment had taken place could cause further mental deterioration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG informed the first applicant that her removal would proceed as planned . In her letter , the Secretary of ORG reiterated that it had not been accepted that the first applicant had ever been detained by the Sri NORP authorities and that the First - tier ORG had not believed her account , even to the smallest degree . The Secretary of ORG further noted that while the first applicant claimed that her former reticence to disclose details of the rape was because she had male solicitors and interpreters , she had shown no compunction in raising the claim when removal became imminent .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant \u2019s mental health , the Secretary of ORG noted that she had not told her ORG about her torture , and had attributed her depression and suicidal ideation to an undisclosed family situation and her placement in immigration detention . It was considered that she had not been honest with GPE authorities and was seeking to claim that she had been raped as a means of remaining in GPE , perhaps to obtain medical treatment or to resolve problems with her family . The Secretary of ORG added that there was no reason to believe that she would not have access to medicine and treatment in GPE , and that her mental health problems did not meet the LAW threshold .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Secretary of ORG maintained her position that removal would also be a proportionate interference with the first applicant \u2019s rights under LAW since there was no evidence of the required level of dependency in her relationship with her mother and adult siblings ; she had failed to come \u201c even close to showing \u201d that her moral and physical integrity would be breached on return to GPE ; and she had not demonstrated anything more than the usual personal ties to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the Secretary of ORG found that the points made by the first applicant in her submission , taken together with material previously considered , did not create a realistic prospect of success before an NORP Judge ( see paragraph DATE below ) . The submissions did not therefore amount to a fresh claim and there was no right of appeal against that decision .", "CARDINAL . According to the first applicant \u2019s detention records , on DATE she attended a bail hearing where she claimed that she had tried to kill herself several times . Upon her return to the immigration removal centre , an immediate action plan was put in place . It was decided that she would be observed TIME in order to ensure that she remained safe . A healthcare appointment was arranged for her that TIME and a doctor \u2019s appointment was arranged for DATE to explore her mental health issues . Regular case reviews subsequently took place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was interviewed by an independent male psychiatrist with the assistance of a female interpreter . According to his report of DATE , in that interview she gave further details of her rape by CARDINAL men in uniform during her first period of detention in DATE and her beating and gang rape by CARDINAL Sri NORP officers during her second period of detention in DATE . The psychiatrist noted that she had displayed clear signs of distress consistent with emotional trauma when giving her account of events .", "CARDINAL . The psychiatrist was of the view that that the applicant presented with symptoms consistent with depression . He identified the main perpetuating factors as her pending repatriation and her current detention . He considered that on a balance of probabilities she was suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder , based on the assumption that the alleged detention and abuse in GPE had taken place .", "CARDINAL . He recorded that he was fully aware of the unexplained discrepancies between the account given to him and that given to ORG . He explained that he could not comment on her credibility , which was a matter for the courts . However , he observed that it was not unusual for patients who had suffered significant trauma to recollect peripheral information at the expense of other information , or to distort memories .", "CARDINAL . The psychiatrist noted that the first applicant could not explain why she had not shared the information earlier . He considered that there was not enough evidence to suggest that she had dissociated herself from the traumatic events and therefore did not believe that dissociation was responsible for her previous omissions . However , he noted that during his interview with her , he was assisted by a female GPE - speaker from GPE , and hypothesised that this might have reduced the threat of cultural stigma from the disclosure .", "CARDINAL . Finally , the psychiatrist recorded that the first applicant had expressed a desire to commit suicide if returned to GPE , claiming that this would be preferable to being tortured and killed by soldiers . He recorded that officials at the immigration removal centre had placed the first applicant on suicide watch , and recommended that this be maintained . He was of the view that her recent detention had significantly contributed to worsening her mental state . He noted that she had no active plans to end her life unless sent back to GPE . He recommended various therapies but could not comment on whether they would be available in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant \u2019s detention record logs the results of the hourly observations of the first applicant from TIME on DATE until TIME on DATE . Aside from legal and medical appointments and discussions with staff members about her removal , the record shows that she regularly ate meals with friends , she attended church , she talked to other detainees , she washed her clothes and she slept .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on the basis of the psychiatrist \u2019s report and other fresh evidence , including a letter from a GPE lawyer stating that the she had been detained in DATE and had appeared before ORG , represented by him , the first applicant made further , urgent representations to the Secretary of ORG .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , her further representations were rejected . The Secretary of ORG noted that the first applicant had previously made no mention of having been produced before ORG . There were also inconsistencies between the lawyer \u2019s account and that of the first applicant : he said that she had been released on cash bail to report to a particular police station ; she said that she had been released with a DATE reporting requirement but did not know where . The Secretary of ORG therefore concluded that the letter was not reliable .", "CARDINAL . As regards the first applicant \u2019s mental health , the Secretary of ORG noted that according to the psychiatrist \u2019s report this had been worsened by her detention and concluded that it would therefore improve after removal . There was no clear evidence of a real risk that the first applicant would commit suicide if returned . Despite the first applicant \u2019s representations to the contrary , the GPE health system provided adequate treatment for depression . There were no exceptional or extreme circumstances in her case . Her ability to travel had been assessed and had there been any doubts , her removal would not have proceeded . However , there had been no doubts .", "CARDINAL . Finally , as regards LAW , the Secretary of ORG accepted that the first applicant had family life in GPE but maintained that her removal would be proportionate .", "CARDINAL . Upon receiving the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision the first applicant commenced judicial review proceedings in ORG . She claims that the papers were lodged at some time prior to TIME on QUANTITY DATE . In her judicial review application , she alleged that the Secretary of ORG \u2019s failure to treat the post - appeal evidence concerning her rapes , psychiatric illness and suicide risk as a fresh claim violated domestic law as well as ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention . She also sought an injunction to stop the Secretary of ORG removing her prior to consideration of her judicial review claim . The various tribunal decisions were not lodged with the claim .", "CARDINAL . According to the detention records , the first applicant was asked by immigration removal centre staff on TIME whether she would go to the airport without causing problems and answered that she would . She was therefore taken to reception for transfer to the flight at CARDINAL a.m. , and no problems were reported . According to the first applicant , she was carried on to the flight to GPE at or TIME by CARDINAL men .", "CARDINAL . Many of the CARDINAL other NORP on the flight manifest had also applied to ORG for permission for judicial review on the basis that they faced a real risk of torture upon arriving in GPE . CARDINAL individuals were removed from the flight manifest prior to departure as ORG ordered that they were not to be removed pending those proceedings . However , the first applicant \u2019s case was not considered in time to prevent her removal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and no order was made to suspend removal pending consideration of her case .", "CARDINAL . The flight departed with CARDINAL NORP nationals on board at CARDINAL p.m. on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused permission to seek judicial review on the papers . As to the failure to consider the applicant \u2019s claim before her deportation , ORG judge stated :", "\u201c The claimant was due to be removed to GPE at CARDINAL on DATE . The directions for her removal had been served on her on DATE . However , it was not until DATE that her claim for judicial review proceedings challenging the directions for her removal was lodged . Her application for a stay on her removal directions came before me on DATE as the \u2018 immediates\u2019 judge . The claimant was CARDINAL of CARDINAL failed asylum - seekers due to be removed on the same flight who were asking for a stay on their removal . Although some of the applications could be considered by other judges when they became available , it was plain by CARDINAL that I would not be able to consider all the remaining applications by CARDINAL .", "In those circumstances , I was informed by [ ORG \u2019s Operational Support and Certification Unit ] which of the remaining applicants were on the main manifest , and which were on a reserve list \u2013 and therefore liable to be included on the main manifest only if someone on the main manifest was removed from the flight . Although my priority was to deal with the applications of those on the main manifest , I had not reached the claimant \u2019s case by CARDINAL when I was told that the doors were about to close . I was informed DATE that the claimant had been on the flight . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On the merits of the claim , the judge noted that if he had considered the first applicant \u2019s case on DATE , his difficulty would have been that her solicitors had not included in the bundle of documents the decision of the Immigration Judge . He said :", "\u201c It would not have been possible for me to conclude that it was arguable that the rejection of the claimant \u2019s solicitors\u2019 representations , and the refusal to treat those representations as fresh claims , was legally flawed without reading that decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge concluded that since the applicant had now been removed to GPE , no purpose would be served by reconsidering the matter once the decision of the Immigration Judge had been provided or by permitting her claim to proceed .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant renewed her application for permission to seek judicial review on DATE . The application was refused on DATE following an oral hearing . The judge summarised the applicant \u2019s case as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]he claimant \u2019s case was that there was in this case post appeal evidence of additional brutality and its after effects , in particular creating an increased dependency on her family in the GPE and a risk of suicide , those justifying the Secretary of ORG in treating this application as a fresh application for asylum , engaging both issues of LAW and human rights consideration in addition pursuant to LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He reviewed the determination of the First - tier ORG and observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is clear that , having heard evidence from both the claimant and her sister ... the judge concluded , in emphatic terms , that neither sister was credible in any relation to the claims for asylum . In short , he concluded that both the claimant and her sister had told a pack of lies .", "CARDINAL . It follows that it is against that very unpromising background of evidence from the claimant having been heard and considered by a judge and effectively damned in such strong terms that the question whether the Secretary of state was right to conclude that any further claim based on additional materials stood no reasonable prospects of success . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He noted the arguments of the first applicant \u2019s counsel , namely that the Secretary of ORG had failed adequately to take into account the psychiatrist report in reaching her conclusion on the LAW issue ; that it was not open to the Secretary of ORG , in light of that report and the Sri NORP lawyer \u2019s letter , to conclude that the first applicant \u2019s evidence was inconsistent and untrue ; and that it was perverse for the Secretary of ORG to have reached the findings she did on the first applicant \u2019s suicide risk , given the evidence . He continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In my view , the problem with the submissions that [ counsel for the applicant ] has advanced ... is that they overlook the fundamental question of credibility and the context in which this new evidence was raised very much at TIME . The immigration judge \u2019s determination was , as I have indicated , a savage series of findings in terms of the credibility of the claimant \u2019s account . On the face of it , in circumstances where this claimant had given evidence dealing with her alleged treatment in custody in GPE in DATE and the brutal treatment meted out to her , all of which evidence was considered by the immigration judge , it seems to me that the Secretary of ORG was well entitled to conclude that there was no realistic prospect of success in circumstances where completely new allegations were now being advanced DATE before removal directions were set and in circumstances where none of that evidence , including the medical evidence ... , provided a sensible or satisfactory explanation for the failure to mention these important allegations at the time of the original appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He found that in these circumstances , it was impossible to characterise the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision as unlawful and dismissed the renewed application for judicial review .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant alleges that , after arriving at FAC , she was detained and interrogated by GPE authorities . CARDINAL of her interrogators struck her on the forehead . She further claimed that , when released from this initial detention and preparing to leave the airport , she was abducted , blindfolded and removed to an unknown location by an unknown person . Her clothing was forcibly removed . Her captors asked whether she was \u201c still \u201d linked with the ORG and had taken part in NORP activities while living in the GPE . They accused her family of funding the ORG . The men showed her copies of her asylum papers they had found in her bag , which she claimed had been packed by GPE officials at the immigration removal centre , and asked her questions about them . They then beat her , kicked her , stabbed her with a broken ballpoint pen and did further \u201c unspeakable bad things \u201d to her . Eventually they forced her to sign statements written in NORP .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant alleges that her interrogators ultimately released her from their custody .

A woman who faces a male interviewer or interpreter can be reluctant to speak freely and give a full account of the violence she has experienced , whether gender based or not . Moreover , the officials involved in the asylum procedure often lack adequate training on gender issues and therefore fail to ask the right questions or to analyse the evidence before them properly .
