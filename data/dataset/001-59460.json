The facts of the case , particularly concerning events during DATE when GPE and PERSON went missing , were disputed by the parties . The Commission , pursuant to former LAW ( a ) of the LAW , conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties .", "CARDINAL . The Commission Delegates ( PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ) heard witnesses in GPE on DATE and on CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE . These included the applicant ; her son PERSON ; PERSON , wife of PERSON ; PERSON , the wife of PERSON ; PERSON , the muhtar of PERSON ; PERSON , a villager ; PERSON , a villager ; PERSON , a former ORG team commander ; PERSON , a former high ranking member of the ORG ; PERSON , ORG district gendarme commander ; PERSON , commander of the local gendarme station at GPE ; PERSON , deputy commander at GPE ; PERSON , ORG public prosecutor ; and PERSON , ORG prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . The DATE \u2019s findings of fact are set out in its report of CARDINAL DATE and summarised below ( Section A ) . The applicant accepted the ORG \u2019s findings of fact . The Government \u2019s submissions concerning the facts are summarised below ( Section B ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was a small village of about QUANTITY houses , situated in the region of ORG in the south - east of GPE . The nearest gendarme station was QUANTITY away at GPE . PERSON was QUANTITY from GPE , where the district gendarme headquarters were based .", "CARDINAL . PERSON was QUANTITY from the highway leading from PERSON to ORG . While the ground between the village and the highway was generally described as being open and flat , there was higher ground behind the village and a forested area . TIME behind the village to the south was the mountainous area known as Anadere . As elsewhere in the region in DATE , ORG activity was intense . Anadere was used by them as a base for their activities . PERSON lay in the so - called CARDINALst district of Garzan ( the name given by the ORG to this region ) and was known by the security forces to be under the command of a man code named \u201c Berham \u201d . There was another member of the ORG , a woman known as \u201c NORP \u201d , who was active in visiting the villages in this district .", "CARDINAL . NORP The village school was close to the main highway . In DATE , it was closed , apparently due to fear that it would be subject to attack . The evidence from villagers indicated that the district gendarme commander Captain PERSON had instructed them to protect their village . Captain PERSON denied giving any such instructions to persons who were not part of the security forces or official village guards . The Commission noted that he might have nonetheless \u201c encouraged \u201d them to do what they could to protect their school . In any event for a short period before DATE , villagers , armed with their own shotguns , stood guard during TIME at the school .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , CARDINAL villagers , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were on guard at the school at PERSON . According to their statements taken by the gendarmes DATE , CARDINAL armed men arrived in a vehicle below the school from the direction of the tarmac road at times given variously as TIME . After PERSON challenged the approaching men , the villagers started firing first and the men responded with automatic weapon fire . The shooting continued for not TIME before the men drove off in the direction of the tarmac road once more . The villagers gathered to see what had happened . They dispersed to their homes , the CARDINAL guards also .", "CARDINAL . The applicant relied on the statement of her husband PERSON to ORG in ORG ( \u201c HRA \u201d ) that the men who came to the school were soldiers in a green military vehicle and pointed to the unlikelihood that the ORG would have arrived from the patrolled FAC highway or that they would have fled in that direction . She considered that a security force operation took place at that time in the vicinity of the village , perhaps an ambush of the ORG who were expected to arrive in the village . When the villagers challenged the soldiers arriving to position themselves near the school on the outskirts of the villagers , a clash mistakenly broke out .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that a standard form incident report dated DATE indeed referred to an armed clash having taken place at TIME at PERSON when security forces were in ambush positions round the village expecting the PERSON to arrive for a meeting at the school . A conflict broke out when terrorists were seen at the school . Fire was also opened on the security forces from terrorists on the hill to the south . A description was given of intense firing , involving mortars and tanks , which continued until TIME and which necessitated a request for reinforcements . This document was not provided to the ORG before the hearing of witnesses and was not put to Captain Ertu\u011frul , the district gendarme commander who gave oral testimony that there was no operation at GPE that night . He described an altogether different scenario , according to which the ORG opened fire on a mechanised team patrolling the road near the village at TIME , after which there was only a brief TIME conflict . The team , on his account , did not enter the village and would not have been able to do so without permission , which they did not request . On this version , the security forces did not enter the village until TIME at TIME , after the applicants\u2019 children had been taken away . This account mirrored the report dated CARDINAL DATE issued by the gendarmes investigating the incident .", "CARDINAL . The Commission considered that the standard form incident report cast grave doubts on the reliability of Captain Ertu\u011frul \u2019s evidence . As district gendarme commander , it would have expected that he would be informed of operations conducted in his jurisdiction . Though the document is incomplete at the bottom and no signatory appears , it was sent from the ORG district gendarme command which was under his responsibility . It appeared likely from the description of the units involved in the operation that some of his own men were involved . The ORG noted that there was other evidence to support the incident report :", "\u2013 the written statements of the villagers almost all referred to firing occurring after the incident at the school ;", "\u2013 the applicant in her oral testimony described heavy firing , which lit up the sky ;", "\u2013 PERSON and PERSON described firing as occurring over a long period during the night ;", "\u2013 the other villagers PERSON and PERSON also referred to more firing occurring . Only PERSON recalled hearing no more firing after the first clash at the school .", "\u2013 notwithstanding Captain Ertu\u011frul \u2019s denial that the mechanised team would have entered the village , they were already present on the outskirts of the village when he and PERSON arrived at first light . He also had with him a special team , specifically trained in counter - terrorism , whose role in events was unspecified .", "CARDINAL . The Commission concluded that an operation took place in close proximity to PERSON during TIME , involving heavy firing . While there was some evidence that there were security forces at the school at some point during TIME , it would appear at least likely that there were ORG men also in the vicinity . There was no allegation that the security forces were firing punitively at the village as a target throughout TIME . On the evidence , it was unable to establish whether the men fired at by the villagers at the school were ORG members or soldiers .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE , CARDINAL armed men arrived at PERSON house . These CARDINAL men required PERSON to take them to the house of PERSON . There , they found that his daughter PERSON was absent and leaving PERSON at the PERSON house , took the son PERSON to show them the house of LOC where GPE was spending TIME . They left that house with GPE , GPE and GPE . After a while , they released PERSON and disappeared with GPE and GPE , who were never seen by any of their family or the villagers again .", "CARDINAL . The Commission identified the crucial point of disagreement as being whether the CARDINAL men were soldiers or members of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The evidence which supports the allegations that they were members of the security forces included principally :", "\u2013 PERSON statement to the ORG of DATE ;", "\u2013 the oral evidence given to the Commission delegates by the applicant and her CARDINAL daughters - in - law , PERSON and PERSON , all of whom were present during the incident ;", "\u2013 an inference which could be drawn from the letter of DATE from the gendarmes in answer to a letter from the ORG public prosecutor that an allegation had been made to the prosecutor that GPE and PERSON had been taken into custody , indicating that a complaint was made shortly after the event that the security forces were responsible for the disappearance of the applicant \u2019s children .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted that there was considerably more evidence which identified the CARDINAL men as members of the ORG . This included principally :", "\u2013 the written statements taken on DATE from the applicant , the muhtar , PERSON and the CARDINAL village guards ;", "\u2013 the written statement taken on DATE from PERSON by a public prosecutor ;", "\u2013 the oral evidence given by CARDINAL eye witnesses PERSON and PERSON which described the men as wearing civilian clothes and items of dress consistent with ORG usage ;", "\u2013 the oral evidence of the CARDINAL \u201c confessors \u201d PERSON and PERSON , who as members of the ORG , alleged that GPE and PERSON were taken to join the ORG and were executed when they tried to return to their home ;", "\u2013 the oral evidence of gendarme witnesses that PERSON family were known sympathisers and GPE and ORG had left voluntarily .", "CARDINAL . The Commission found that there were difficulties with the evidence on both sides . The patchy nature of the investigative work of the gendarmes was in the circumstances of this case however as equally consistent with negligence and bad practice as with deliberate manipulation of the evidence . The written statements taken by the gendarmes gave largely similar but not identical versions of events and were also supported by the oral evidence of PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The Commission noted the ORG assessment of the villager witnesses , PERSON and PERSON , who were found to be frank and convincing witnesses in the way they told their stories . There was no element in the evidence of either man which cast doubt on their credibility . The ORG \u2019s delegates found no indication , for example , that these CARDINAL witnesses were motivated by fear in giving their testimony .", "CARDINAL . The Commission gave little weight to the oral evidence of the CARDINAL \u201c confessors \u201d or ex - members of the ORG . The account of PERSON was riddled with contradictions while PERSON made an unfavourable impression in the cold - blooded manner in which he gave his testimony . Neither was found to be credible by ORG and no satisfactory explanation was given as to how they were identified as being able to give relevant testimony , since neither had apparently made any statement to the authorities that they had knowledge of events . While neither witness was a member of the so - called ORG CARDINALst district and both were at pains to point out that members from CARDINAL district were unable to involve themselves in the affairs of other districts , both claimed to have obtained information about the alleged execution of GPE and PERSON by the ORG over the radio . Yet neither were apparently aware of the existence of a female terrorist code named \u201c NORP \u201d well - known as active in that area . The ORG found their evidence unsatisfactory and unreliable and was not prepared to base any findings of fact on their testimony .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the evidence that GPE and PERSON were ORG sympathisers , Captain Ertu\u011frul \u2019s opinion was based on information which he had received from ORG informers in the villages . The CARDINAL other gendarme officers from the local station had however no knowledge that the PERSON family were suspected sympathisers . PERSON expressed the opinion nonetheless that ORG had left voluntarily with the ORG , but was unable to give any firm ground for that belief beyond that this was being said in the village . As pointed out by the applicant , all the written statements referred to their abduction . The oral evidence of the applicant and PERSON and PERSON also indicated that the men used force . PERSON referred to seeing the men drag some - CARDINAL out of the PERSON house while PERSON described PERSON as acting under duress . The Commission found therefore that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that GPE and PERSON left with the men voluntarily .", "CARDINAL . The Commission stated that it could give little weight either way to the written statements of PERSON , his statement to the ORG accusing the soldiers and his later statement to the public prosecutor apparently contradicting this version . He had died and was unable to provide any explanation for these differences .", "CARDINAL . The Commission took the view therefore that the key issue in this respect was whether the applicant \u2019s oral evidence , supported by her daughters - in - law , was of such a nature as to outweigh and cast substantial doubt on the oral evidence of the other villagers .", "CARDINAL . As regarded the credibility and reliability of the oral evidence given by the applicant , PERSON and ORG , the ORG found that their description of the incident at the house when the men arrived varied in significant details . According to the applicant , CARDINAL men entered the house , wearing camouflage uniform , CARDINAL of whom wore a red mask . PERSON said that the CARDINAL men all wore red masks , specifying that they had beards and moustaches attached to the masks . According to ORG , all CARDINAL men , CARDINAL of whom had masks , came inside . She and PERSON described them , in contradiction of the applicant , as speaking only NORP . The Commission which had not heard in any previous case of a practice of any security forces wearing masks , found this to be a puzzling feature and that this aspect of their testimony was unconvincing . It further noted that the applicant , who was relatively old , had demonstrated a selective memory , in particular in categorically denying recent events . She was not altogether clear in her evidence on some points . Whether this was due to the lapse of time or her own advanced years , it detracted in the QUANTITY view from the reliability that could be placed on it . They also found that ORG , who was CARDINAL at the time of events , gave an impression of being rehearsed in her account .", "CARDINAL . The Commission concluded that it had not been established , to a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the CARDINAL men who came to the applicant \u2019s house were from the security forces . Nor however was it established that they were from the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Captain PERSON and the deputy station commander ORG entered the village at dawn on DATE . The station commander PERSON arrived at TIME . A search was carried out of the houses . The task of drawing up the incident report , damage evaluation report , sketch map and the taking of statements were assigned to PERSON as the local station commander . Explosive devices were found during the search and a villager GPE was taken into custody .", "CARDINAL . A number of villagers went to the local station DATE to make statements \u2013 the applicant , the muhtar , the CARDINAL villager guards and PERSON . PERSON who had talked to the muhtar about his part in events was not summoned to give a statement by the gendarmes . The evidence as to whether any statement was taken from PERSON conflicted . No written statement has been produced by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . A complaint that the security forces were involved in detaining GPE and PERSON was made to the ORG public prosecutor on or shortly before DATE . The Commission was satisfied that this derived from the applicant \u2019s family . The only step taken by the ORG public prosecutor was to enquire from the district gendarme command whether they held the missing people . Captain PERSON on his own account made no investigation and discussed the matter with CARDINAL as he stated that he knew that they were not in custody .", "CARDINAL . The PERSON gendarmes submitted the evidence which they had gathered to the ORG public prosecutor \u2013 this consisted of the sketch map , scene of incident report , damage evaluation report and the statements of the applicant , PERSON , PERSON and the CARDINAL villager guards at the school . It is not established whether or not a statement was ever taken from PERSON . There is no evidence however that CARDINAL was ever received by a public prosecutor dealing with the case . The ORG public prosecutor PERSON considered this material was sufficient to establish the offences clearly and proceeded to issue a decision of lack of jurisdiction on DATE in respect of the kidnapping of GPE and PERSON by CARDINAL ORG terrorists , sending the case to the ORG SSC prosecution .", "CARDINAL . A further petition was lodged with the ORG public prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE , in which the uncle of the missing persons claimed that GPE and PERSON had been taken away by the security forces , asked whether they had been brought before a judge and if not that they should be immediately , and that he requested the necessary steps be taken .", "CARDINAL . The ORG SSC prosecution sent a standard letter to district authorities on DATE requesting them to continue the search for the kidnappers and to report DATE , providing copies of any relevant confessions , statements etc . No information was forthcoming . The request made on DATE for statements to be taken from the applicant , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and the CARDINAL villagers guards was in light of the communication to the Government of the application to the ORG . CARDINAL statement , that of PERSON , was taken . The public prosecutor , PERSON , attributed this to the fact that all the villagers had moved and could not be found . However , a letter dated DATE from the ORG district gendarmes gave the towns to which the persons were thought to have moved . There was nothing to indicate that any further steps were taken to trace any of them . That PERSON , PERSON and PERSON could be found is indicated by their appearance after being summoned to the hearing in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG prosecutor sent a reminder , DATE , that the earlier instruction of DATE for reports to be made regularly as to the investigation , had not been complied with . He told the Delegates that this was to obtain more effective action from the district authorities . It is not apparent from the material provided that any information was forthcoming . While by this time the CARDINAL confessors , PERSON and ORG , had surrendered ( in DATE and DATE respectively ) any information provided by them or the fact that they might be in a position to provide information was not passed on to the ORG SSC public prosecutor , who told the Delegates he would have regarded it as relevant to the investigation . Nor is it evident that any information relating to the alleged execution of the CARDINAL missing persons was passed on to the local gendarme station which made occasional reports to the ORG public prosecutor or to the ORG district gendarme command .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the file was transferred following a decision of lack of jurisdiction to the ORG prosecutors who on DATE made the standard request for reports to be made on the investigation DATE . It is not apparent that they have been provided with any further information . The latest report from ORG district gendarme command stated that no information was available concerning the abductors of GPE and PERSON but that the search was continuing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a statement was taken from the applicant \u2019s lawyer PERSON by the ORG SSC chief public prosecutor . This stated that PERSON was registered at the ORG bar and vice president of the ORG , as well as President of the ORG branch . He recalled PERSON coming to see him DATE before , telling him that his son and daughter had disappeared . He told PERSON that domestic remedies had to be exhausted . He recalled writing to the Governor and ORG chief prosecutor for him and telling him to go to the ORG chief prosecutor . After a long while , PERSON came back to the ORG , saying that he had obtained no results from the authorities save a document which said that his son and daughter had been kidnapped by the ORG . As he disagreed with this , PERSON told him that he could apply on the basis of the ORG \u2019s ratification of the Convention . He confirmed that it was his signature on the document shown to him . His signature was not based on any power of attorney but on the basis of the purpose of the ORG .", "By an indictment dated DATE by ORG SSC chief public prosecutor , PERSON was accused of violating PERSON no . ORG DATE and DATE . It was stated that the defendant had prepared an application titled ORG without a client - solicitor relationship having been established . The purpose of this was to degrade the ORG and make propaganda in favour of the ORG . His prosecution under PERSON no . CARDINAL as well as appropriate action under PERSON no . ORG and CARDINAL was requested .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that at TIME on DATE ORG terrorists arrived as LOC and opened fire on the school . At TIME , CARDINAL armed ORG terrorists wearing local pe\u015fmerge dress came to the applicant \u2019s house and took away her son GPE . They went to a neighbour \u2019s house and took PERSON away also .", "CARDINAL . At TIME , a mechanised team patrolling the ORG arrived at the village and fire was exchanged between them and the terrorist group . After TIME , the terrorists ran away towards the Anadere region . At TIME , the security forces entered the village for investigation . It was established that the village school had been damaged and GPE and ORG taken away by ORG terrorists . The evidence of PERSON and PERSON indicated that GPE and PERSON had been aiding and abetting the terrorists and when their identity had become known it was necessary for the ORG to kidnap them . They joined the ORG in the mountains under the code names \u2018 Roken\u2019 and \u2018 Dilge\u00e7\u2019 . When they tried to leave , they were executed by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant in her statement to the gendarmes , which accorded with the statements of the other villagers , identified the ORG as the perpetrators .", "CARDINAL . The Government have provided the ORG with a copy of the decision of ORG No . CARDINAL , dated DATE , acquitting the lawyer PERSON of the charge under section CARDINAL paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON no . ORG . The court found that the statement taken from PERSON by PERSON did not contain expressions of written propaganda .", "CARDINAL . The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW all forms of homicide ( Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) and attempted homicide ( Articles CARDINAL and DATE ) constitute criminal offences . It is also an offence for a government employee to subject CARDINAL to torture or ill - treatment ( Article CARDINAL in respect of torture and Article CARDINAL in respect of ill - treatment ) or to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty ( Article CARDINAL generally , Article CARDINAL in respect of civil servants ) .", "CARDINAL . The authorities\u2019 obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by ORG CARDINAL to CARDINAL of LAW . Offences may be reported to the authorities or the security forces as well as to public prosecutor \u2019s offices . The complaint may be made in writing or orally . If it is made orally , the authority must make a record of it ( LAW .", "If there is evidence to suggest that a death is not due to natural causes , members of the security forces who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal court judge ( Article CARDINAL ) . By Article CARDINAL of LAW , any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor \u2019s office an offence of which he has become aware in the exercise of his duty is liable to imprisonment .", "A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In the case of alleged terrorist offences , the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of ORG prosecutors and courts established throughout GPE .", "CARDINAL . If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties , the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by LAW on the prosecution of civil servants ( sometimes referred to as LAW ) , which restricts the public prosecutor \u2019s jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings . In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council ( for the district or province , depending on the suspect \u2019s status ) to conduct the preliminary investigation and , consequently , to decide whether to prosecute . Once a decision to prosecute has been taken , it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case .", "An appeal to ORG lies against a decision of the ORG . If a decision not to prosecute is taken , the case is automatically referred to that court .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of DATE , paragraph ( i ) , of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE on the authority of the governor of a state of emergency region , the DATE PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) also applies to members of the security forces who come under the governor \u2019s authority .", "CARDINAL . If the suspect is a member of the armed forces , the applicable law is determined by the nature of the offence . Thus , if it is a \u201c military offence \u201d under LAW ( Law no .
