I think that the judgment will be disappointing in terms of the intention and capacity of the justice system to succeed in discovering the truth \u2013 this indeed being the mission of the courts and the public prosecutor \u2013 beyond the politics .

In a judgment of DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of attempted fraud , under LAW combined with LAW , LAW and LAW , and sentenced him to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) .

After the delivery of the judgment , the president of the trial court of ORG published a statement . He commended the efforts of his fellow judges to bring the trial to its conclusion in a calm manner , notwithstanding the various comments about the procedure that had been reported in the media . Noting that some of those comments could be regarded as an attempt to influence the court \u2019s work , the president emphasised the following points : that throughout the trial the judges had acted pursuant only to the provisions of criminal law ; that the purpose of the trial was different from that of the parliamentary commission of inquiry ; and that as professional judges the members of the bench had been able to resist any pressure that might result from the media statements made in connection with the case by various journalists and politicians , or even by certain members of the commission . Pointing out that a statement such as his in the present case was unusual , in view of the judiciary \u2019s duty of discretion , the president explained that he could not refrain from mentioning the remarks made by the author of the article entitled \u201c Before the judgment \u201d , which had been published in the period when the case was under deliberation and which could be regarded , in his view , as an attempt on the part of the journalist to influence the outcome ; such statements were , in his view , inadmissible and blameworthy , even in connection with a case which , like the present one and rightly so , had attracted significant media interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the public prosecutor \u2019s office each appealed against the judgment of DATE . In his statement of appeal the applicant alleged , among other things , that on account of the influence of the commission \u2019s work on the judges , exacerbated by the press coverage of the CARDINAL sets of proceedings , his trial had been devoid of the requisite fairness under LAW .", "CARDINAL . At the end of its last session on DATE , the commission adopted its final report , concluding that the applicant had acted alone . Several commission members submitted their own draft reports to the PERSON . After examining it at the plenary of CARDINAL DATE , the PERSON rejected the commission \u2019s report and expressed its preference for that of the MP PERSON , which was regarded as the most radical . It can be seen from the file that this report was drafted with a view to having the persons concerned held to account before ORG . In view of doubts as to the weight of the vote of CARDINAL May , the PERSON endorsed the report by the MP PERSON by its final vote of DATE . The position taken in that report was as follows :", "\u201c PERSON , Prime Minister , PERSON , junior minister in ORG , PERSON , the Prime Minister \u2019s chief of staff , PERSON , chair of the board of directors of the company ORG , and PERSON , member of ORG , committed , by deliberate and concerted action in DATE , the offence of bribery , within the meaning of LAW of LAW taken together with LAW thereof ; in that they , [ while ] influencing the content of LAW being amended and the parliamentary proceedings related thereto , in DATE , through the intermediary of PERSON , acting as agent of the \u2018 power - holding group\u2019 , made a corrupt proposal to the representatives of ORG , namely on DATE to PERSON and PERSON and on DATE to PERSON , consisting in demanding a financial reward of MONEY ( ORG ) , the appointment of PERSON as chairman of the channel ORG and an undertaking from the company ORG that the newspaper ORG would refrain from publishing any criticism of the Prime Minister or government . In return , provisions would be inserted in LAW that would be beneficial for ORG , allowing it to purchase the television channel ORG .", "The evidence gathered in this case renders highly plausible ( w wysokim stopniu uprawdopodabnia ) the above - mentioned account , to the extent of justifying the prosecution of the above - named persons . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The report , disseminated by the media , was widely discussed and commented on by the various public stakeholders .", "...", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , the applicant \u2019s trial continued before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the parties that the charge against the applicant was likely to be reclassified to aiding and abetting influence peddling ( pomocnictwo do p\u0142atnej protekcji ) , an offence under LAW of LAW taken together with LAW .", "ORG adjourned the proceedings until DATE to allow the defence to adapt its strategy to the intended change of classification . On the scheduled date the defence submitted their observations .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG found Mr GPE guilty of aiding and abetting influence peddling ( pomocnictwo do p\u0142atnej protekcji ) , an offence under LAW of LAW taken together with LAW , and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of PLN CARDINAL .", "In its reasoning , ORG found that the applicant had facilitated the perpetration by other individuals \u2013 whose identity had not been established DATE of the offence of bribery . In this connection it found it established that , on CARDINAL and DATE , the applicant had presented to PERSON and PERSON an offer devised by the above - mentioned individuals who , on the strength of their positions at the level of the ORG , had proposed their assistance as intermediaries to amend LAW in a manner favourable to ORG , thereby enabling it to purchase the television channel ORG , in exchange for MONEY , a sum that was to be paid to ORG ( ORG ) via the bank account of a company belonging to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In response to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the proceedings of the commission and their media coverage had undermined the fairness of his trial , ORG found that this complaint was not substantiated by any tangible evidence ; the applicant had not explained concretely how the media reports on the commission \u2019s work had influenced the reasoning of the judges in their deliberations or the outcome of the criminal proceedings , or how the commission \u2019s proceedings and report might have had any impact on the impartiality of the judges or on the reliability of the testimony given before the trial court . ORG took the view , in sum , that this was tantamount to implying that only an adjournment of the criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the commission \u2019s work could have preserved its fairness . Noting that the courts were frequently confronted with media interest in a given case , ORG was of the view that this fact , in itself , did not suffice for the fairness of the criminal proceedings against the applicant to be called into question .", "CARDINAL . As to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the testimony used in support of his conviction had been vitiated by the fact that the witnesses had been heard by ORG after being questioned on the same circumstances by the commission , in public sittings that had received significant media attention , ORG regarded it as ill - founded ; testimony was always assessed by judges in accordance with the rules in LAW and in the light of all the evidence . In the present case , ORG could not identify any circumstance that would lead it to believe that the witnesses heard by ORG had been influenced by the content of their previous statements to the commission or by those of other witnesses .", "CARDINAL . With reference to the applicant \u2019s complaint that the reasoning of ORG judgment was insufficient , ORG acknowledged that in certain respects the reasoning had been succinct . Nevertheless , it endorsed that reasoning to a large extent , noting that ORG had examined the relevant aspects of the case and that its conclusion was justified .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning ORG refusal to admit in evidence certain items proposed by the defence ; the court below had rightly found them superfluous for the outcome of the case . In the view of ORG , the exercise of defence rights could not consist in requests made ad infinitum , and in particular those that were irrelevant for its resolution .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and the public prosecutor \u2019s office appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . In a decision ( postanowienie ) of DATE ORG dismissed the CARDINAL appeals , endorsing the reasoning given by ORG . ..."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-2"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
