The applicant was born in DATE in GPE , GPE . She was a citizen of the former GPE and continued to hold its citizenship until DATE ; thereafter she became a stateless person . The applicant lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to the passport department at the \u201c GPE \u201d police station in GPE for residence registration . She produced her GPE passport , a consent form signed by the flat owner and certified by the housing maintenance authority , an application form for residence registration , a document showing payment of housing maintenance charges and an extract from the ORG list .", "CARDINAL . NORP The Director of the passport department refused to process the application for residence registration . He told the applicant that she could not be registered because she was not a relative of the flat owner .", "CARDINAL . The applicant insisted on a written refusal . She was given a printed form on which a checkmark was placed next to the statement \u201c failed to provide a complete set of documents \u201d . It was not specified which documents were missing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant challenged the refusal before ORG of GPE . She submitted that there had been no legal basis for a restriction on her right to obtain residence registration in the flat , expressly provided to her for that purpose by its owner , and that the registration authorities had no discretion in granting residence registration once the appropriate documents had been produced , as had been the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of the passport department filed his observations on the applicant \u2019s claim . He contended that the applicant did not have NORP citizenship and that she had originally come from GPE . NORP citizens were required to have an appropriate visa to enter GPE , which the applicant could not produce , and , in any event , the registration of foreign citizens was a matter for ORG local visa departments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE ruled on the applicant \u2019s claim . A representative of the flat owner stated before the court that the applicant had been living in the flat since DATE and that the owner had no objections to her registration . The court dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim , giving CARDINAL reasons for its decision .", "CARDINAL . Firstly , referring to the provisions of ORG regulating the joining of family members and other persons to existing municipal - tenancy agreements and emphasising the absence of a family relationship between the applicant and the flat owner , the court ruled that the matter should be examined not as a challenge to the ORG official \u2019s refusal to grant registration , but rather as a civil action for determination of the applicant \u2019s right to move into the flat .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , the court held that the applicant had failed to prove her LANGUAGE citizenship or to confirm her intention of obtaining it and pointed out that \u201c a treaty \u201d between GPE and GPE provided for visa - based exchanges .", "CARDINAL . The judgment concluded as follows :", "\u201c Given that the applicant failed to produce information confirming her right to move into the flat in question , information on [ her ] citizenship and the lawfulness of [ her ] entry into GPE , the ORG accordingly dismisses her claim . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE confirmed certain amendments to the hearing record , as submitted by the applicant \u2019s representative . In particular , the record was to reflect the applicant \u2019s statements about the non - applicability of municipal - tenancy provisions to her situation , given that the flat had been in private ownership , and about the flat owner \u2019s consent to her residence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative filed a statement of appeal . He submitted , in particular , that ORG had incorrectly referred to the applicant \u2019s NORP citizenship and to a visa requirement for her entry into GPE , since the applicant had never held NORP citizenship and , in any event , the residence regulations applied uniformly to all persons lawfully residing within GPE , irrespective of their citizenship . He indicated that ORG had failed to advance any justification for the restriction on the applicant \u2019s right to choose her residence . He also contended that ORG reliance on tenancy provisions had been invalid because the flat owner had had clear title to the flat and there could be no dispute as to the applicant \u2019s right to move in , since she had the flat owner \u2019s explicit consent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment . It reiterated ORG findings that the applicant \u2019s claim had to be dismissed because she had failed to prove her NORP citizenship or an intention to obtain it and because she had failed to provide any documents confirming her right to move into the flat in question . ORG did not address the arguments advanced by the applicant \u2019s representative in the grounds of appeal .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides for the equality of all before the law and the courts of law , and equality of rights and liberties .", "CARDINAL .

Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that foreign citizens and stateless persons shall have the same rights and obligations in GPE as NORP citizens unless otherwise provided in a federal law or an international treaty to which GPE is a party .", "CARDINAL . At the material time the issues related to NORP citizenship were governed by the Citizenship of GPE ( Law no . CARDINAL-I of DATE , as amended on DATE ) , which provided that all citizens of the former GPE who were permanently resident in GPE on DATE ( the date of entry into force of the Act ) automatically obtained NORP citizenship unless they expressed their wish to the contrary before DATE . The basis for establishing whether a person was permanently resident within GPE was the propiska stamp ( internal residence registration ) in his or her GPE passport . Section CARDINAL(g ) of the law provided for a simplified procedure ( \u201c by way of registration \u201d ) for obtaining NORP citizenship for citizens of the former GPE who arrived in GPE after DATE and expressed their wish to become NORP citizens before DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the powers vested in him by law , on DATE the President of GPE adopted the Regulations on the procedure for consideration of issues of citizenship of GPE ( Decree no . CARDINAL \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) . Section II(CARDINAL ) stated that the notion of \u201c a citizen of the former GPE \u201d applied only to those individuals who did not obtain the citizenship of one of the newly independent GPE which had previously been members of the GPE . The same section stipulated that after DATE all citizens of the former GPE who had not obtained NORP or other citizenship would be considered to be stateless persons .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE the status of foreign citizens and stateless persons in GPE was regulated by LAW on the legal status of foreign citizens in the GPE ( no .

On DATE CARDINAL member GPE of ORG ( ORG ) , including GPE , signed in GPE an Agreement on visa - free movement of citizens of member ORG throughout their territory ( \u201c the Bishkek Agreement \u201d ) . GPE acceded to LAW on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG denounced GPE as of DATE . In the absence of a bilateral agreement on visa - free movement between GPE and GPE , NORP citizens were required to apply for a NORP entry visa from DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE adopted a PERSON on the right of NORP citizens to liberty of movement and freedom to choose their place of temporary and permanent residence within GPE ( Law no . MONEY \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) . LAW guaranteed the right of NORP citizens to liberty of movement and freedom to choose their place of residence , and extended the law \u2019s application to non - NORP citizens lawfully residing in NORP territory . Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL required a person to apply for residence registration at a new address within DATE of moving . Section CARDINAL contained an exhaustive list of territories where this right could be restricted ( such as military settlements , environmental disaster zones , etc . )", "CARDINAL .

LAW , as worded at the material time , provided that the registration could be refused if the applicant had not submitted written consent or had produced manifestly false documents ; the list of grounds for refusal was exhaustive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE struck down certain provisions of the Regulations as incompatible with LAW . It ruled , in particular , that", "\u201c ... the registration authorities are entitled only to certify the freely expressed will of a citizen in his or her choice of ... residence . For this reason , the registration system may not be permission - based and it shall not entail a restriction on the citizen \u2019s constitutional right to choose his or her place of ... residence . Thus , the registration system in the sense which is compatible with LAW is merely a means ... of counting people within GPE , ... is notice - based and reflects the fact of a citizen \u2019s stay at a place of his or her temporary or permanent residence . \u201d", "The Constitutional Court emphasised that , upon presentation of an identity document and a document confirming the person \u2019s right to reside at the chosen address , the registration authority should have no discretion and should register the person concerned at the address indicated . The requirement to submit any additional document might lead to \u201c paralysis of a citizen \u2019s rights \u201d . On that ground ORG ruled that the registration authorities were not entitled to verify the authenticity of the submitted documents or their compliance with NORP laws and , accordingly , any such grounds for refusal were unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE authorities passed a PERSON on the conditions of residence in GPE for foreign citizens who have the right to enter GPE without a visa ( Law no . CARDINAL ) .
