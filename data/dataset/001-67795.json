Soon thereafter some NORP believers and activists of the NORP religion in the country sought to replace the leadership of their religious organisation . They considered that PERSON , who was the Chief PERSON at that time , and the members of ORG had collaborated with the communist regime .

The ORG appointed a CARDINAL - member interim governing body of the ORG religious organisation , considering that that was \u201c the only possible means of preventing the organisational disintegration of the NORP denomination \u201d .", "CARDINAL . A national conference of NORP , organised by the interim leadership , took place on DATE . It elected Mr PERSON as Chief PERSON and also approved a new statute , which was registered in accordance with sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . After DATE the supporters of PERSON obtained full control over the property and activities of the NORP community .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , who claimed that he remained the Chief Mufti , challenged the decision of DATE before ORG . The proceedings ended with a final judgment of DATE . ORG , while considering that the impugned decision was not amenable to judicial review , nevertheless commented that the ORG \u2019s decision to declare Mr PERSON \u2019s election null and void had been within its competence . In so far as the impugned decision had also proclaimed \u201c the removal \u201d of PERSON LANGUAGE from his position of Chief PERSON , this had been ultra vires . However , it was unnecessary to annul this part of the ORG \u2019s decision as in any event it had no legal consequences .", "CARDINAL . NORP The leadership dispute between Mr LANGUAGE and PERSON continued throughout DATE and DATE . The official position of ORG remained that PERSON was the legitimate Chief PERSON of NORP . At the same time the ORG apparently sought to \u201c resolve \u201d the dispute through the \u201c unification \u201d of the CARDINAL factions under a common leadership .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supporters of PERSON held a national conference , which proclaimed itself the legitimate representative of NORP believers . The conference elected a leadership and adopted a statute . Mr PERSON was elected President of ORG . After the conference the newly elected leaders applied to the ORG for registration as the legitimate leadership of NORP in GPE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the Deputy Prime Minister issued a decree approving the statute of the NORP denomination as adopted by the supporters of PERSON on DATE . On DATE the ORG registered the leadership elected at that conference and effectively removed PERSON and his supporters . In DATE the faction led by Mr PERSON assumed full control over the property and activities of the NORP community in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON appealed to ORG against the decision of the ORG registering Mr PERSON leadership . Mr PERSON submitted , inter alia , that the conference of DATE had been organised by people outside the NORP religious organisation presided over by him . Accordingly , they could register their own religious organisation but could not claim to replace the leadership of another . PERSON asked ORG either to proclaim the DATE decision null and void as being contrary to the law or to declare that it constituted the registration of a new religious community , the existing NORP organisation being unaffected . The ORG did not have the right , he argued , to impose a single leadership on the NORP .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court stated that under LAW enjoyed full discretion in its decision as to whether or not to register the statute of a given religion . ORG jurisdiction was therefore limited to an examination of whether the impugned decision had been issued by the competent administrative organ and whether the procedural requirements had been complied with . In that respect the decision of DATE was lawful .", "CARDINAL . As regards the request for interpretation of the DATE decision , it was not open to ORG , in the context of those particular proceedings , to state its opinion as to whether it had the effect of creating a new legal person , or introducing changes , and whether after this decision there existed CARDINAL parallel NORP religious organisations .", "CARDINAL . Following the removal of PERSON , in DATE the NORP believers who supported him held their own assembly and re - elected him Chief Mufti , while introducing changes in the organisation \u2019s statute and leadership . PERSON then applied to ORG for registration of the amended statute and the new leadership . Not having received any response , PERSON appealed to ORG against the tacit refusal of his application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered its judgment . It noted that in DATE the Chief ORG as represented by PERSON had been duly registered as a religious denomination and had thus obtained legal personality of which it had not subsequently been deprived . Therefore , ORG was under an obligation , pursuant to sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , to examine a request for registration of a new statute or of changes in the leadership of the existing religious denomination . Accordingly , ORG ruled that the ORG of ORG tacit refusal had been unlawful and remitted the file to ORG , which was required to examine it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prime Minister refused to register the DATE statute and leadership of the Chief ORG as represented by Mr PERSON . He sent him a letter stating , inter alia , that ORG had already registered a leadership of the NORP community in GPE , which was that elected by the DATE conference with PERSON LANGUAGE as President of ORG . The Deputy Prime Minister concluded that the request \u201c [ could not ] be granted as it [ was ] clearly contrary to the provisions of LAW \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON appealed to ORG against the refusal of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the refusal of the Deputy Prime Minister to register the DATE statute and leadership headed by PERSON PERSON on the ground that it was unlawful and contrary to LAW . That refusal was , moreover , \u201c an unlawful administrative intervention into the internal organisation of [ a ] religious community \u201d . ORG again ordered the transmission of the file to ORG for registration .", "CARDINAL . Despite ORG judgments of DATE and DATE ORG did not grant registration to the religious leadership headed by Mr Hasan .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the government of the ORG stepped down and an interim cabinet was appointed . At the general elections that followed in DATE the ORG obtained a majority in ORG and formed a new government .", "CARDINAL . The new Deputy Prime Minister and ORG urged the CARDINAL rival leaderships , of PERSON and of PERSON GPE , to negotiate a unification .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a letter to the Deputy Prime Minister and the ORG , the religious leadership presided over by PERSON demanded the removal of PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG headed by Mr LANGUAGE , also in a letter addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Directorate , proposed the holding of a unification conference to be organised by a joint committee composed of representatives of the opposing factions . The Deputy Prime Minister was asked to serve as guarantor of the unification process and to ensure full representation at the conference of all NORP religious communities . The letter also indicated that the current official leadership presided over by Mr PERSON agreed to freeze any movements of staff or disposals of community property pending the conference .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the contact groups elected by the rival factions \u2013 composed of CARDINAL members DATE signed an agreement to convene a national conference of all NORP believers . The agreement was also signed by the Deputy Prime Minister and ORG . It provided , inter alia :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The all - NORP conference shall be organised on the basis of full representation of the NORP denomination . It shall not be based on the CARDINAL existing statutes [ of the rival leaderships ] . [ The ] Deputy Prime Minister ... and ORG undertake to guarantee the implementation of this principle .", "CARDINAL . NORP ... The [ rival groups ] undertake not to obstruct the spirit of unification underlying the conference , failing which the ORG shall take appropriate administrative measures against the persons suspected of [ obstruction ] .", "CARDINAL . Pending the conference , the [ leadership headed by Mr NORP ] undertakes to refrain from any administrative decisions , [ such as ] appointments ...", "CARDINAL . The [ leadership headed by Mr NORP ] consents to a freeze on all bank accounts ... and declares that pending the conference it will not enter into any transaction ...", "CARDINAL . The joint committee shall draw up rules and a procedure for the organisation of the conference ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the joint committee ruled that the assembly of each local community attending a mosque should elect CARDINAL delegates to the national conference . It also decided that TIME of the assemblies\u2019 proceedings had to be entered on a form provided by ORG and certified by the local mayor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the joint committee decided that the conference should be held on DATE and also agreed on the distribution of expenses .", "CARDINAL . Local assemblies for the election of delegates were held on DATE throughout the country . The local mayors issued letters certifying the results of the elections .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant organisation has submitted copies of CARDINAL complaints to the ORG dated DATE , CARDINAL by a local religious leader and CARDINAL by the mayor of a village . The letters stated that persons connected with the ORG had used threats to take possession of the results of the elections of delegates in the CARDINAL localities concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE Mr LANGUAGE and those who had signed the unification agreement on behalf of ORG headed by him wrote to the Prime Minister and ORG stating that the conference planned for DATE was not being organised in accordance with the statute of the NORP religious organisation and that it was therefore unlawful . Those who had signed the agreement of DATE stated that they had been forced to do so by ORG and declared the withdrawal of their support for that agreement . The letter signed by PERSON further described the participation of the ORG in the preparation of the conference as unacceptable ORG interference in the ORG internal affairs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL delegates attended the conference . Only those whose election had been certified by the mayors were allowed to participate . According to the press , the verification of the delegates\u2019 credentials was carried out by employees of ORG . Its Director addressed the conference , stating , inter alia , that PERSON , who did not attend , had \u201c failed the test \u201d . With these words the Director apparently blamed Mr PERSON for having withdrawn from the unification process .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant organisation , the ORG , a political party with a large majority of ethnic NORP among its members , was involved in the organisation of the conference . The party was allegedly very close to the ruling ORG and was implementing the political decision to replace the leadership of the NORP community . According to the applicant organisation , CARDINAL of the delegates on DATE were mayors elected on the ORG ticket .", "CARDINAL . The conference adopted a new statute of the NORP denomination in GPE and unanimously elected a new leadership comprising CARDINAL members of the leadership of PERSON and other persons . It appears that no leader of the applicant organisation was among the newly elected leadership . The conference passed a resolution authorising the new leadership to conduct an audit and to seek the prosecution of PERSON for alleged unlawful transactions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Prime Minister registered the newly elected leadership , relying on sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . The new leadership took over all the organisational aspects and assets of the NORP community in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , who claimed that he remained the President of ORG , appealed on its behalf to ORG against the ORG \u2019s decision to register the new leadership . He claimed that the persons who had signed the agreement for the holding of a unification conference on behalf of the applicant organisation had never been officially authorised to do so ; that the conference had been unlawful because of that fact and since those persons had in any event withdrawn ; and that the authorities had interfered in an inadmissible manner in the internal affairs of the NORP community . That was so because ORG had prepared the forms on which the results of the local elections for delegates had been recorded and also because those results had been certified by the mayors . Furthermore , among the elected delegates there had been a number of persons who were local mayors or active members of CARDINAL political party , the ORG . Finally , the applicant organisation argued that there had been irregularities and manipulation in the election of delegates .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing . It admitted in evidence the material submitted by the applicant organisation but refused its request for a disclosure order against ORG . That request apparently concerned documents about the preparation of the DATE conference and the election of delegates . The court also refused to hear witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a bench of CARDINAL judges , rejected the appeal as being inadmissible . It found that ORG headed by Mr PERSON had no locus standi to lodge an appeal as it had never been validly registered . The registration acts of CARDINAL and DATE had been based on a decision by a Deputy Prime Minister who had not , however , been duly authorised by ORG to approve the statutes of religious denominations . As a result ORG headed by PERSON had never legally existed and all its acts DATE were null and void .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant organisation , on CARDINAL DATE a CARDINAL - member bench of ORG quashed the decision of DATE and remitted the case for examination on the merits . The bench noted that by judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG had found that the DATE registration of ORG headed by PERSON had been lawful . That finding was final and binding . Therefore , the applicant \u2019s appeal could not be rejected for lack of locus standi .", "CARDINAL . In the reopened proceedings a CARDINAL - member bench of ORG examined the appeal on the merits and dismissed it on DATE . The presiding judge was the same person who had presided over the previous examination of the case , which had ended with the inadmissibility decision of DATE . He was also CARDINAL of the CARDINAL judges who had delivered judgment on DATE in the case concerning PERSON PERSON \u2019s removal in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court found that the acts of the authorities did not constitute an interference with the internal organisation of the NORP community . The decision to hold a unification conference had been taken freely by representatives of the CARDINAL rival groups . The rules and procedures for the election of delegates and for the holding of the DATE conference , including those concerning the results of the local elections for delegates and their certification , had been drawn up by the joint committee . ORG had contributed to the organisation of the conference purely at the parties\u2019 request . It had acted in accordance with the agreement between the CARDINAL leaderships and the decisions of the joint committee . The ORG \u2019s task had been to contribute to and guarantee tolerance and respect in inter - religious relations as well as in the relations between different groups belonging to CARDINAL and the same religion . The fact that ORG presided over by PERSON had withdrawn at TIME did not call into question the validity of the conference , which had taken place in accordance with the negotiated rules . It was true that these rules derogated from the statute of the NORP community as in force at the relevant time but the derogation had been decided upon freely by the CARDINAL leaderships in order to resolve the conflict within the community . It followed that the impugned act , the decision of DATE registering the newly elected leadership of the NORP community , was in accordance with the law .", "CARDINAL . The applicant organisation submitted a cassation appeal against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . It alleged , inter alia , that not all the relevant evidence had been collected and examined .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the appeal was dismissed by a CARDINAL - member bench of ORG , which upheld the reasoning of the impugned judgment . It also found that the relevant facts had been clarified and that the additional evidence submitted by the applicant organisation in the cassation proceedings had been the same as that submitted earlier . The applicant organisation was legally represented in the above proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The divide within the NORP community in GPE continued . It appears that the legitimacy of a community assembly held in DATE was disputed by some leaders . Divisions also persisted at local level . In a letter of DATE , ORG certified that it had not registered the local leadership of the NORP community in GPE as CARDINAL separate local assemblies had elected their leaderships and were in dispute . Similar problems occurred in GPE and Russe in DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the ORG appointed QUANTITY persons to represent the NORP community in GPE temporarily , pending judicial proceedings concerning the validity of the election of a new leadership at a national conference held in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of the DATE LAW read as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG shall be free .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP institutions shall be separate from the State ...", "( CARDINAL ) Religious institutions and communities , and religious beliefs shall not be used for political ends . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) NORP The freedom of conscience , the freedom of thought and the choice of religion or of religious or atheistic views shall be inviolable . The ORG shall assist in the maintenance of tolerance and respect between the adherents of different denominations , and between believers and non - believers .", "( CARDINAL ) The freedom of conscience and religion shall not be exercised to the detriment of national security , public order , public health and morals , or of the rights and freedoms of others . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE interpreting the above provisions states , inter alia , that the ORG must not interfere with the internal organisation of religious communities and institutions , which must be regulated by their own statutes and rules . The ORG may interfere with the activity of a religious community or institution only in the cases contemplated in LAW and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW . An assessment as to whether there is such a case may also be undertaken at the time of registration of a religious community or institution .", "CARDINAL . The Religious Denominations Act DATE was amended several times . The relevant provisions of the LAW , as in force at the time of the events at issue , read as follows .", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A religious denomination shall be considered recognised and shall become a legal person upon the approval of its statute by ORG , or by a Deputy Prime Minister authorised for this purpose .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG , or a Deputy Prime Minister authorised for this purpose , shall revoke the recognition , by a reasoned decision , if the activities of the religious denomination breach the law , public order or morals . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Every religious denomination shall have a leadership accountable to the ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The statute of the religious denomination shall establish its governing and representative bodies and the procedure for their election and appointment ... \u201c", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The national governing bodies of the religious denominations shall register with ORG , and local governing bodies with the local municipalities , and they shall submit a list of the names of all members of these governing bodies . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Act also laid down rules regarding the activities of a religious denomination , imposed requirements as regards its clergy and gave ORG wide supervisory functions . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ORG , while agreeing that certain provisions of LAW were clearly unconstitutional ( the court cited as examples several provisions concerning the powers of the ORG to dismiss clergymen and to control the activities of religious organisations ) , found that it was not its task to repeal legal provisions adopted prior to the entry into force of the DATE LAW , the ordinary courts being competent to declare them inapplicable .", "CARDINAL . Under Decree No . CARDINAL of ORG of DATE , as amended , the competence of ORG includes \u201c contacts between the ORG and religions denominations \u201d , assistance to central and local administrative authorities in solving problems which involve religious matters and assistance to religious organisations as regards education and publications .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the Regulations on the registration of the local leadership of religious denominations , issued by the Government in DATE ( ORG no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , such registration is only possible if the election of a local leadership has been approved by the registered national leadership of the religious denomination .", "CARDINAL . The Religious Denominations Act DATE has been interpreted in the administrative practice of the ORG and ORG as requiring that each religious denomination must have a single leadership and that parallel organisations of the same religious denomination are not allowed . The judicial practice during the relevant period evolved from the initial position that ORG and the ORG enjoyed unfettered discretion in the registration of the leadership and statute of a religious denomination ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) to the position that the courts , when asked to rule on the lawfulness of a Government decision registering a new religious leadership , had to examine whether the new leadership had been appointed in compliance with the religious denomination \u2019s statute , in its version as registered by ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above and also the following judgments of ORG : judgment no . DATE of DATE in case no . CARDINAL , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Religious Denominations Act DATE was repealed with effect as from DATE , upon the entry into force of the new Religious Denominations Act DATE .", "CARDINAL . The new LAW provides for judicial registration of religious denominations as legal persons . Before deciding , the court may request an expert opinion from ORG .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that CARDINAL registration may be made concerning a religious denomination with the same name . Section CARDINAL provides that a person who acts on behalf of a religious denomination without authorisation is to be fined by ORG . Paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions to the LAW provides that persons who had seceded from a registered religious institution before the LAW \u2019s entry into force in breach of the institution \u2019s government - registered internal rules are not entitled to use the name of the religious institution or its assets .", "CARDINAL . In DATE CARDINAL members of ORG asked ORG to repeal certain provisions of LAW as being unconstitutional and contrary to the Convention . The Constitutional Court gave judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL were not among the provisions challenged but paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions was ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG could not reach a majority verdict , an equal number of judges having voted in favour and against the request to declare that provision unconstitutional . According to ORG practice , in such circumstances the request for a legal provision to be struck down is considered to be dismissed by default . The judges who voted against the request considered , inter alia , that the principle of legal certainty required that persons who had seceded from a religious denomination should not be allowed to use its name . Further , it was obvious that they could not claim part of its assets , as the assets belonged to the religious denomination as a legal person . The judges who considered that the provision was unconstitutional stated that it purported to regulate issues that concerned the internal organisation of religious communities and thus violated their autonomy . Those judges further stated that the provision , applied in the context of existing disputes , favoured CARDINAL of the groups in a divided religious community and , therefore , did not contribute to maintaining tolerance but rather frustrated that aim .
