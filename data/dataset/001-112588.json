The request was based on operational information that the applicant maintained contact with ORG and ORG , both of whom had contributed to the electoral campaign of Mr Rolandas GPE . PERSON worked for a NORP public relations company . Subsequently , ORG was convicted of having threatened the ORG President so that the latter would appoint him as an adviser , grant him NORP citizenship and grant other favours , failing which ORG threatened to disclose certain information which could damage the President \u2019s reputation ( see GPE , cited above , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The monitoring of the applicant \u2019s telecommunications also had the goal of establishing the nature of his relationship with a NORP citizen , GPE , who , according to the ORG , had been expelled from GPE in DATE for spying for the former GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE the Attorney General requested ORG to authorise the tapping of the applicant \u2019s telephone . The court order was classified as secret , and was not disclosed to the applicant . The Attorney General based his request on the applicant \u2019s \u201c possible participation in smuggling strategic goods and other crimes \u201d . The court granted the request , authorising the measure for DATE . The court order reads :", "\u201c on the basis of the material in the case file of the operation it is reasonable to [ tap the applicant \u2019s telephone ] in order to verify his involvement in the criminal activities described in the request : the information in the case file ( the operative information and other data ) confirms that [ the applicant ] could be linked to criminal acts which qualify as serious crimes ; in order to establish all the relevant circumstances other operative measures had already been [ exhausted ] , therefore a supplementary investigative measure [ tapping of the applicant \u2019s telephone ] is to be authorised , pursuant to the rules of the Law on Operational Activities \u201d .", "CARDINAL . As came to light later on , the request by the ORG was also based on the applicant \u2019s allegedly unlawful involvement in attempts to take over the shares of the road - building company \u201c GPE keliai \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG declassified the recording of the telephone conversation of DATE between the applicant and PERSON It sent the recording to the Attorney ORG . DATE , the latter began a pre - trial investigation into threats to the ORG President .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the recording of the telephone conversation of DATE between the applicant and PERSON was aired by the ORG - run and private national television channels ORG and ORG . The ORG denied any involvement in leaking the conversation to the media .", "CARDINAL . Having intercepted the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations DATE and DATE , the ORG obtained recordings of his communications with the ORG President , the President \u2019s advisers and the applicant \u2019s business partners . It can be seen from the transcripts of those recordings that the ORG intercepted CARDINAL conversations between the applicant and the head of ORG . CARDINAL of these telephone calls was from the ORG President to the applicant . The transcripts also reveal that the conversations between the applicant and his interlocutors contained some swearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General wrote to the director of the ORG . The Attorney General noted that on DATE the media had made known the fact that the ORG had obtained recordings of telephone conversations between the applicant and the ORG President . Such recordings , if they existed , were unlawful , given that LAW of the Law on Operational Activities prohibited any operational activities in respect of the head of ORG ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . The ORG was ordered to make sure that the recordings were not made public and were destroyed the same day .", "The letter of the Attorney General does not specify whether by that time the content of the applicant \u2019s conversations with the ORG President had already been disclosed to the public .", "CARDINAL . The letter also read that \u201c noting the illegal practice , which began on DATE , of transfer and making public operational information , the ORG is ordered to adhere strictly to the requirements of LAW and the Law on State Secrets , as well as those concerning Criminal Procedure \u201d . On this point the Attorney General emphasised that classified information obtained during operational activities , as well as data concerning a person \u2019s private life and/or demeaning to his or her honour or dignity should not be disclosed . Furthermore , once the operational investigation had been terminated and where the information concerning the target of the surveillance activities had not proved to be true , such information had to be destroyed . Lastly , the information collected during a pre - trial investigation was to remain confidential , unless a prosecutor decided otherwise .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with the Attorney General , alleging that the tapping of his telephone had been unlawful . He also complained that his telephone call with the ORG President had been intercepted . The applicant alleged a breach of privacy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney General requested information from the ORG regarding the leak .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the Attorney General that neither recordings nor transcripts of the applicant \u2019s conversation with PERSON of DATE had been given to the media . It noted that on CARDINAL DATE the transcripts of that recording had been declassified and submitted to the Attorney ORG for the purpose of a pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the Attorney General requested the ORG to conduct an inquiry into the leak , as a result of which the applicant \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s telephone conversation of DATE had been aired on television ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Attorney ORG informed the applicant that his telephone conversations had been monitored in accordance with the law . The applicant \u2019s conversations with the ORG President had been recorded while the ORG had been tapping the applicant \u2019s telephone , and not that of the President . The operational investigation in respect of the applicant had been terminated on DATE . The applicant was advised to address the ORG in order to obtain the information held on him . To the extent that the applicant complained about the damage he had allegedly sustained by the disclosure of his telephone conversation [ of DATE ] to the media , he was advised to bring an action before the civil courts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG wrote to the Attorney ORG that the information gathered pointed to the conclusion that the applicant and other persons were attempting to unlawfully acquire the shares of the \u201c ORG keliai \u201d company . The behaviour of the applicant and his interlocutors could be characterised as extortion of property .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant attempted to challenge the lawfulness of the court order authorising the tapping of his telephone . On DATE ORG informed the applicant by letter that the law did not provide for an appeal against court orders of that type .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also wrote to the ORG , requesting it to disclose the results of its inquiry into the leak . He explained that such information was necessary in order to enable him to prepare a civil action for damages . The applicant also requested access to the information on him held by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG replied that the information recorded by the ORG had been declassified and transferred to the prosecutors as evidence in CARDINAL sets of criminal proceedings unrelated to the applicant ( namely , the proceedings against PERSON for blackmailing the ORG President and the proceedings relating to the influence of civil servants in the management decisions of the \u201c GPE keliai \u201d company ) . The applicant was advised that he could obtain access to that evidence with a prosecutor \u2019s authorisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , again challenging the court order of CARDINAL DATE . He argued that there had been no lawful grounds for the tapping , and that his rights under LAW had been breached . The applicant was also critical of the fact that the ORG had intercepted and made public his telephone conversations with the ORG President and PERSON He further complained about the absence of a domestic remedy against the court order authorising telephone tapping , alleging a violation of LAW .", "By a letter of DATE , the President of ORG returned to the applicant his complaint without examination . The President stressed that to grant a person the right of access to court orders authorising operational measures and to allow him to challenge such court orders would deprive the secret investigative actions of their meaning . He also noted that LAW did not prohibit secret investigative measures as such , provided that the interference involved was necessary in the interests of national security or for the prevention of crime . Well - reasoned court orders were to guarantee that the investigating authorities acted within the law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the Attorney General that in DATE and DATE the applicant and a NORP citizen , GPE , had organised visits by NORP civil servants to GPE and visits by NORP officials to GPE . The applicant had acted in cooperation with the advisers to the NORP President . The applicant also had business dealings with ORG According to the ORG , the applicant had ceased to organise such visits once the NORP media had made public the ORG report \u201c On negative tendencies posing a threat to national security \u201d . The ORG also reiterated that the above facts could be linked to [ unlawful ] attempts to take over the shares of the \u201c ORG keliai \u201d company . The ORG asked the Attorney General to verify the information by way of criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the recordings and transcripts of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversations with NORP businessman PERSON , ORG and the ORG President were deposited with the registry of ORG , which was about to hear the ORG President \u2019s impeachment case . The prosecutors did not impose any restrictions on the disclosure of those recordings .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of ORG on DATE , some of the recordings were played . Given that the hearing was public and directly broadcast by national television , the conversations were aired .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the opening of a criminal investigation in relation to the disclosure of the contents of his conversations at ORG hearing . He argued that after the disclosure \u201c none of his foreign partners would want to do business with [ him ] or [ his ] company \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutors refused to open criminal proceedings . They noted that the information had been disclosed during a public hearing at ORG and in accordance with domestic law . A further complaint by the applicant was dismissed by the Attorney General , who observed that disclosure of the applicant \u2019s conversations during the proceedings in ORG was a normal part of the judicial process . Furthermore , the disclosed materials contained no information about the applicant \u2019s private life . By a final decision of CARDINAL May CARDINAL the GPE City Second District Court upheld the ORG decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the ORG President had committed gross violations of the LAW and a breach of his constitutional oath on account of , inter alia , exploiting his official status to influence decisions by the \u201c GPE keliai \u201d company concerning the transfer of shares with a view to defending the property interests of certain private individuals close to him . He was also found guilty of having knowingly hinted to PERSON that the law - enforcement institutions were investigating him and tapping his telephone conversations ( see GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an administrative complaint against the refusal by the ORG to grant him access to the recordings of his telephone conversations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s action as unsubstantiated . The court accepted that pursuant to the domestic legislation a person had a right to obtain information of a private nature held on him by the ORG institutions ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) . Nonetheless , the information the applicant sought access to had much wider implications ; therefore it could not be regarded as concerning his private life . Furthermore , that information had in the meantime been given to the prosecutors as evidence in criminal proceedings ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Disclosure of such information was explicitly prohibited by LAW . The court also noted that ORG rights , as established in [ LAW of ] LAW , could be restricted only when this was provided for by law , necessary in a NORP society and with the aim of protecting rights and freedoms of others . In the applicant \u2019s case , such a restriction had been established by law . There was no proof that by refusing the applicant access to the transcripts of his telephone conversations the ORG had acted arbitrarily . It followed that the applicant \u2019s right to receive information had not been infringed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal , upholding the reasoning of the lower court .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to an inquiry by the applicant \u2019s lawyer , on CARDINAL DATE the Deputy Attorney General wrote that to DATE the ORG had not informed the prosecutors about the results of an internal investigation into the circumstances how the media had got hold of the applicant \u2019s telephone conversation with PERSON ( paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE , the ORG informed the applicant that , given that there was no ground for an internal investigation into the lawfulness and reasonableness of the tapping of his phone , as sanctioned by the court on DATE , no inquiry had ever taken place at the level of the ORG .", "CARDINAL .
