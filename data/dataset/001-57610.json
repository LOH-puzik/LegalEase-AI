THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 6-1;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "C. Russo;N. Valticos", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , a NORP citizen born in DATE , lives in GPE . In DATE , she met a Mr. B , with whom she started living . Her son , A , was born on CARDINAL DATE , shortly after Mr. PERSON \u2019s release from a term of imprisonment . She had a second child , PERSON , on DATE and a third - who is not the subject of the present proceedings - in DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE after her discharge from hospital after the birth of A , the applicant was severely assaulted by Mr. PERSON He again assaulted her in DATE , during a visit to A in hospital . Although the applicant was not aware of it at the time , this incident caused ORG of the local authority ( \" the ORG \" ) in whose area she lived to put A on the \" at - risk register \" ; such registers , which are maintained on a non - statutory basis by each local authority for reference purposes as an administrative aid for agencies with professional responsibilities for children , record particulars of children identified as being actually or potentially at risk of abuse .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after a period of accommodation in hostels , the applicant and Mr. B obtained the tenancy of a flat , but difficulties arose because of his drinking , his constant assaults on the applicant and his failure to pay the rent . The applicant acknowledges that at this time she was managing to look after A but unable to give him enough love and attention . From DATE , the family was regularly visited by a social worker , who assisted it notably with its financial problems .", "In DATE , the applicant was visited by a social worker who told her of ORG \u2019s entry on the \" at - risk register \" . On another occasion , the social worker warned Mr. B that , if he did not \" buck his ideas up \" , A would be taken away . In DATE , Mr. PERSON sought treatment for his drinking problem , but when on DATE leave relapsed and again assaulted the applicant .", "CARDINAL . During the course of a visit by the applicant , A and Mr. B to the latter \u2019s family in GPE in DATE , Mr. PERSON was arrested on fraud charges . On returning home with A , the applicant discovered that Mr. B had permitted squatters to enter the flat and had \" sold \" them the key . The ORG advised the applicant to put A into voluntary care ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) for DATE until the flat could be recovered and it placed A with short - term foster parents employed by its ORG . The ORG subsequently evicted the squatters ; the applicant , who was again pregnant , followed its advice to leave A in voluntary care until after her confinement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s second child , J , was born on DATE , by which time Mr. B had returned from GPE , having been given a suspended sentence . On DATE , he arrived at the foster GPE home , drunk and in an aggressive mood , to collect A to visit the applicant in hospital . On being notified by the foster parents , the ORG sent a social worker to accompany Mr. PERSON A. It was worried that Mr. B would remove A from care and the night - duty staff were warned to apply for a place of safety order ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) should he try to do so . The social workers also warned Mr. B that , unless his behaviour improved , the ORG might assume his parental rights ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The applicant was discharged from hospital on DATE and A was returned home in DATE , but the situation with Mr. PERSON did not improve .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant was admitted to hospital urgently . She and Mr. PERSON decided that since he was incapable of looking after the children , they should be put into the voluntary care of the ORG , which placed them with foster parents . Whilst in hospital , the applicant decided to leave Mr. PERSON With the assistance of a social worker she went to a women \u2019s aid refuge where she stayed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was fearful as to Mr. B \u2019s likely reaction to the applicant \u2019s decision to leave him and the possibility that he might discharge the children from voluntary care . In DATE , the Chairman of the ORG \u2019s ORG approved the passing of a resolution assuming Mr. B \u2019s parental rights over the children - although , since they were illegitimate , he did not in fact have , for the purposes of the relevant legislation , any such rights - , on the ground that his \" habits or mode of life render[ed ] him unfit to have the care of the child[ren ] \" . He was told of this resolution , but made no objection ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He continued to receive support from the social services and was admitted to hospital in DATE for alcohol detoxification , but relapsed .", "CARDINAL . Whilst at the women \u2019s refuge , the applicant visited A and J frequently at their foster GPE home . She told the social worker responsible that she wanted to discharge the children from care when she had recovered from the period in hospital . She also took legal advice with a view to excluding Mr. PERSON from contact with her or the children , as the ORG had made this a condition for offering her accommodation with them .", "Following a case conference held in DATE - in the absence of the applicant , who had not been informed of the meeting - , the ORG decided to place J , in addition to A , on the \" at - risk register \" in view of the uncertainty of the family \u2019s position . Nevertheless , the social worker responsible told the meeting that it was hoped that in time the children would be re - united with the applicant ; the possibility that she might resume living with Mr. PERSON was also discussed , but no decision was reached as to the consequences which this should have for her and the children .", "On DATE , A and J were discharged from care and went to live with the applicant at the refuge .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had applied to the local ORG for an injunction excluding Mr. B from the flat and on DATE she heard from her solicitor that the proceedings were to come on for hearing on DATE . On the basis of the good relations existing between them , the applicant arranged with the short - term foster parents , with whom the children had been placed before , that they would look after the children on DATE of the hearing ; this was an informal arrangement in which the ORG was not involved .", "On DATE , the applicant met Mr. B outside the court and they agreed to try to resume their relationship despite the proceedings . The facts relating to the subsequent TIME are in dispute . According to the applicant , she asked the foster parents to look after the children for a further night so that she could establish the effectiveness of the reconciliation with Mr. PERSON She also states that she was told to contact a senior social worker , whom she had never met , who informed her that she could not have her children returned to her if she intended to resume her relationship with Mr. B ; she understood the position to be that she should leave the children with the foster parents until DATE , that the ORG would take no action in the meantime and that , on that date , she should discuss the matter with the social worker whom she knew . According to the social worker \u2019s records , the applicant and Mr. B were both warned on DATE that the ORG would have to obtain some legal authority over the children , although a parental rights resolution was not mentioned .", "CARDINAL . During a discussion on DATE , the CARDINAL social workers responsible for the case agreed that an application should be made to assume the applicant \u2019s parental rights . The relevant notes record :", "\" ... In the longer term , consideration should be given to spelling out to [ the applicant ] what we would expect of her prior to discharging the children to her again , and that if she appears unable to provide long - term satisfactory care for them we would move to considering freeing them for adoption . \"", "The applicant , who had not been contacted by the ORG on DATE either in respect of this discussion or otherwise , attended ORG on DATE as , according to her , she had arranged . She states that she was informed on DATE that the ORG had passed a resolution assuming her parental rights over A and J.", "CARDINAL . The circumstances surrounding the exact date and the manner of the passing of the resolution are confused . In all subsequent proceedings the ORG maintained that it was passed on DATE , but ORG investigation ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) reveals that it was dated DATE , possibly as a result of delay in typing the document . Although at the time the children were de facto placed with the foster parents who had looked after them when they were in voluntary care ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , it appears to be very doubtful whether they were then , as a matter of law , in the voluntary care of the ORG and therefore whether the resolution was lawfully made ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to ORG , the ORG believed the resolution to be lawful and its officers had acted in good faith . The grounds for the purported assumption of the applicant \u2019s parental rights were that she had consistently failed , without reasonable cause , to discharge the obligations of a parent so as to be unfit to have the care of the children .", "CARDINAL . After service by the applicant , on DATE , of a counter - notice objecting to the parental rights resolution , the question of its appropriateness was referred by the ORG on DATE to the juvenile court for decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Various hearing dates were set , but had to be vacated ; in the meantime , A and J , who had been placed with short - term foster parents , remained subject to the resolution and were visited by the applicant , approximately once a week . The social worker responsible informed her that if Mr. B obtained work and if their flat was improved , the social worker would not oppose the children \u2019s return home . On DATE , the applicant was offered increased access of CARDINAL visits per week . According to ORG report , the applicant told a social worker in DATE that she was very anxious about the children returning home because of Mr. PERSON \u2019s behaviour and , on DATE , that she felt \" unable to look after the children \" . In DATE , the juvenile court hearing was adjourned because the applicant \u2019s solicitor was ill and to enable her to obtain a medical report on Mr. PERSON", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. B got drunk and broke into a safe in a hospital where he and the applicant had started voluntary work . After going to GPE and spending the proceeds there , they were both arrested and charged , the applicant subsequently being released on bail . On DATE , she was sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment but on DATE , following an appeal to ORG , she was released on DATE probation . Mr. PERSON was imprisoned until DATE , and there has been no further contact between him and the applicant .", "CARDINAL . At a case conference on DATE , the ORG took the contingent decision that if the parental rights resolution did not lapse - because the applicant either withdrew her objection thereto or failed in challenging it before the juvenile court - , her access to A and J would be stopped and they would be placed for adoption with long - term foster parents . The applicant was not notified of the conference or its outcome and the fact that this decision was taken was only revealed subsequently .", "CARDINAL . The adjourned hearing before the juvenile court was held on DATE , but on that occasion the applicant withdrew her objection to the parental rights resolution : her then solicitors had advised her that , being in prison at the time , she could not realistically contest the resolution , although she should be able to retain contact with the children .", "On her release from prison on DATE , the applicant asked to see her children . She was told that she could not , firstly because she had been in prison and secondly because of her relationship with Mr. B ; she also learned , for the first time , that it was proposed to place the children for adoption in the very near future . They were in fact so placed in DATE , with long - term foster parents to whom they had been introduced on DATE . The applicant , who had last seen A and J on DATE , did not see them again until DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Having taken further legal advice , the applicant applied on DATE to the juvenile court for the discharge of the parental rights resolution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . She was no longer able to maintain that she had opposed the resolution throughout , but submitted that its discharge would be in the children \u2019s best interests . Due to court delays the case was not heard until CARDINAL and DATE , when the juvenile court decided by a majority that the resolution should stand . It considered that there was a risk that the applicant would resume her relationship with , and hence expose the children to the influence of , Mr. PERSON ; further , that it would be disruptive for the children to move them from the long - term foster parents .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant to ORG of ORG against this decision was heard on DATE and was dismissed . The judges took the view that it would cause the children unjustifiable disruption to remove them from their foster parents and concluded that , on balance , the children \u2019s interests were best served by their remaining in care . The applicant had argued that if her appeal were not allowed , the question of her access to the children would be decided by the ORG in its sole discretion and unfavourably to her , given its commitment to their adoption . Whilst it considered this argument , ORG was not able to examine the question of access as a separate issue ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Both judges referred to the effects of the passage of time between the placing of the children with prospective adopters in DATE and the hearing of the appeal , the President of ORG stating :", "\" I do not suggest anyone is to blame for this . It may merely be the result of circumstances ... It can not be sufficiently stressed that in a case such as the present , where continuity is seen by all concerned to be highly relevant , and indeed was the very basis of the decision of the court below , expedition is all in relation to the possible success of an appeal . There is no reason why an interlocutory application should not be made in this court to expedite the hearing of an appeal . \"", "The applicant was given leave to appeal to ORG against ORG decision , but did not pursue the matter .", "CARDINAL . After taking further advice , the applicant applied to ORG in DATE to make the children wards of court ( see paragraphs DATE and DATE below ) , in order to raise the issue of her access to them . On DATE , ORG , following the principles set out by ORG in A v. ORG , declined to exercise its jurisdiction to continue the wardship : it found it impossible to say that there had been some clear abuse by the ORG in the exercise of its discretion ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . It considered , inter alia , that it would have been \" premature \" for the ORG to have informed the applicant in DATE of its contingent decision of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The applicant was granted leave to appeal against this decision but was advised that there were no grounds for doing so ; she was also told at that time that there were no further remedies available to her for the resumption of access to the children .", "CARDINAL . The applicant referred the matter to ORG , who has the task of investigating complaints made by a member of the public claiming to have sustained injustice in consequence of maladministration in connection with action taken by a local authority in the exercise of its administrative functions .", "The applicant alleged maladministration in that ( a ) there were shortcomings in the way in which the ORG assumed her parental rights in DATE and ( b ) the ORG failed subsequently to keep her informed of its intentions for her children . In his report of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found maladministration on the first but not on the second of these grounds , although he added that ideally the applicant should have been told of the decision taken at the case conference of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In considering the injustice suffered as a result of the maladministration found , he stated :", "\" I can not now speculate what would have happened had the errors not occurred . Events may quite well have turned out no differently , but it is impossible to say . The clock can not be put back and , as I have made clear , the future of the children is in the hands of the courts . Accordingly there is little that the [ ORG ] can now do to remedy the possible injustice , except to apologise to [ the applicant ] and reimburse her for any costs she has incurred in making her complaint to me , and to review [ its ] procedures . I am pleased to note that [ it is ] already carrying out such a review . \"", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE , the foster parents applied to adopt A and J. In DATE , whilst adoption proceedings were pending before ORG , the applicant applied to it for the children to be made wards of court , notably because the prospective adopters had separated and in order to seek access to and care and control of the children . In DATE , the ORG , by its own decision , rescinded the parental rights resolution . On DATE , ORG confirmed the wardship and also dismissed the foster GPE application to dispense with the applicant \u2019s consent to the adoption ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; the question of access was adjourned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an order was made in ORG authorising the guardian ad litem ( see paragraph DATE below ) to arrange and supervise up to CARDINAL visits per year between the applicant and A and J ; the latter are still wards of court and are living with the foster mother . Such visits took place in DATE and DATE and , at the time of the hearings before ORG , another was in prospect for DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the law of GPE and GPE , there are a number of different and partially co - ordinated procedures for dealing with the welfare of children . Whilst the oldest of these is the wardship jurisdiction of ORG , it has for DATE co - existed with , but not been ousted by , various statutory provisions whereby a child who is at risk may be put into the care of a local authority .", "Although the terms are not wholly accurate , the legislation is commonly divided into CARDINAL categories : the first provides for \" compulsory care \" , by establishing machinery whereby a local authority can obtain a court order committing a child to its care ; the second concerns \" voluntary care \" , the machinery here being originally designed to meet an emergency situation without the need of recourse to the courts . At any given time , there are CARDINAL children in public care in GPE and GPE , of whom CARDINAL are not living with their parents or a relative .", "The statutory provisions have been amended on several occasions and many of them were repealed and replaced by LAW ( \" LAW \" ) , a consolidating measure the greater part of which came into force on DATE . In the following summary of the law in force at the time of the present case , the original enactments are cited first and any corresponding provision of the DATE Act in force at the relevant time is indicated in square brackets .", "By way of general background information , the summary covers all CARDINAL of the procedures referred to above ( namely those relating to compulsory care , voluntary care and wardship ) , but in the present case it was the machinery for voluntary care and the wardship jurisdiction of ORG which were directly relevant .", "CARDINAL . The principal statute concerning compulsory care is ORG \" LAW \" ) , as amended by LAW DATE and then partly replaced by LAW ; it enables a local authority to obtain , as a temporary measure , a \" place of safety order \" and , as longer - term measures , a variety of other orders .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL ) of the CARDINAL Act , any person , including a local authority , may apply to a justice of the peace for authority to detain a child and take him to a place of safety ; the justice may grant the application if he is satisfied that the applicant has reasonable cause to believe , inter alia , that the child \u2019s proper development is being avoidably prevented or neglected or his health is being avoidably impaired or neglected or he is being ill - treated , or that he is exposed to moral danger .", "A \" place of safety order \" so granted lasts for a maximum of DATE and can not be extended . The person detaining the child must as soon as possible take such steps as are practicable for informing his parent of the detention and the reason for it .", "If the local authority wishes to retain the child in protective surroundings after the DATE period , it has either to make the child a ward of court ( see paragraphs DATE below ) , or to institute care proceedings under LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , or to apply to a justice or a GPE court for an interim order under section PERSON ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; if an application of the last kind is refused , the child \u2019s immediate release \" may be ordered \" .", "CARDINAL . Under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , a local authority which reasonably believes that there are grounds for making an order as to the care and control or supervision of a child is , subject to certain exceptions , under a duty to institute care proceedings by bringing the child before a juvenile court .", "CARDINAL . In care proceedings instituted by a local authority , the parties are the local authority and the child , but not the latter \u2019s parents . The child is entitled , subject to his means , to legal aid and it is open to him to have his parents conduct the case on his behalf either directly or through a lawyer . If the child is of sufficient competence , he may decide that he wishes to be separately represented .", "A natural parent who is not acting on behalf of the child is entitled to be notified of and to attend the hearing and to give and call evidence challenging the allegations made by the local authority . As a matter of practice , the court will also allow such parent to cross - examine witnesses on behalf of the local authority and to have separate legal representation .", "CARDINAL . If the court before which the child is brought is satisfied that CARDINAL of the grounds specified in section CARDINAL of the DATE Act exists and that the child is in need of care or control which he is unlikely to receive unless an order is made , it may make , inter alia , a supervision order , a care order or an interim order . The specified grounds include those on which a place of safety order may be made ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . A supervision order is an order placing the child under the structured supervision of the local authority ; subject thereto , he may continue to live with his parents .", "CARDINAL . A care order is an order committing the child to the care of the local authority . The latter will have the same powers and duties with respect to the child as his parent or guardian would have apart from the care order ( section CARDINAL of the DATE Act [ ORG ) of the DATE Act ] ) , except that it can not cause the child to be brought up in any religious creed other than that in which he would otherwise have been brought up and it can not agree to the child \u2019s adoption .", "CARDINAL . An interim order is a care order limited to a specified period not exceeding DATE ; it may be renewed on application ( section QUANTITY of the DATE Act ) . It may be made if the juvenile court hearing the care proceedings is not in a position to decide which of the other specified orders ought to be made ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) or , alternatively , during the currency of a place of safety order ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The powers and duties of the local authority under an interim order are the same as under a full care order ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . A full care order normally terminates when the child in question attains DATE ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(b ) of the CARDINAL Act ) .", "In addition , under sections CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) , the juvenile court may , on application by the child or his parent on the child \u2019s ( but not his own ) behalf and if it considers it appropriate , discharge the care order and may , on discharging it , make a supervision order in respect of the child . Such applications may be made DATE or , with the juvenile court \u2019s permission , more frequently ( section ORG ) ) . The paramount consideration in deciding whether to discharge the order is the interests of the child .", "CARDINAL . Under sections ORG ) and CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act , the child in respect of whom the care order was made , or his parent on the child \u2019s ( but not his own ) behalf , may appeal to ORG against the making of a care order , against the refusal of an application to discharge a care order or against the making of a supervision order on its discharge . ORG will review the decision by way of re - hearing the case . From ORG a further appeal may , with leave , be made to ORG by way of case stated ; thereafter an appeal lies to ORG and , in rare cases , to ORG .", "The local authority has no general right to appeal against a juvenile court \u2019s refusal to make a care order , except on a point of law to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The principal statute concerning voluntary care is LAW DATE ( \" LAW \" ) , as amended by LAW DATE and then replaced by LAW . This legislation in effect enables a parent to place his child into the care of a local authority ; at the initial stage the authority acquires no special status in relation to the child but a different situation may arise subsequently .", "CARDINAL . LAW [ CARDINAL of the DATE Act ] imposes on the local authority a duty to receive into its care a child under CARDINAL where it appears , inter alia , that his parents or guardian are for the time being or permanently prevented by illness , incapacity or other circumstances from providing for his proper accommodation , maintenance and upbringing and that the intervention of the authority is necessary in the interests of the child \u2019s welfare . Whilst the authority must , save as otherwise provided in the LAW , keep the child in its care so long as his welfare requires it and he has not attained the age of DATE , it is also under a duty to endeavour to secure the resumption of parental care where this appears consistent with the child \u2019s welfare .", "CARDINAL . LAW [ CARDINAL of the DATE Act ] specifies that it does not entitle the local authority to keep the child in care if any parent or guardian desires to take over that care . However , if the child has been in care throughout DATE , no person may take him away unless he has given CARDINAL days\u2019 notice of his intention to do so or has the authority \u2019s consent ( section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) [ CARDINAL ) ] ) .", "Moreover , if a parent requests the return of the child , the authority is not compelled to comply regardless of his welfare ( ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . If it then considers the transfer of care to the parent to be inconsistent with that welfare , it may either pass a parental rights resolution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or apply to make the child a ward of court ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . If it appears to a local authority in relation to any child who is in its care under LAW [ CARDINAL of the DATE Act ] that , inter alia , a parent of his is unfit to have the care of the child on account , notably , of his habits or mode of life or of having consistently failed without reasonable cause to discharge the obligations of a parent , the local authority may resolve that there vest in it the parental rights and duties with respect to that child ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) [ CARDINAL ) ] ) . The rights and duties which so vest are all rights and duties which by law the mother and father have in relation to a legitimate child and his property , including \" a right of access \" but excluding the right to agree or refuse to agree to the making of an adoption or certain related orders ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act [ CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ] and section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE ) .", "Before passing a parental rights resolution , the local authority must consider a report from its ORG on the desirability of assuming parental rights , which report should contain all the material necessary for the proper exercise of the authority \u2019s discretion . In deciding the matter , the authority is to regard the interests of the child as of paramount importance and the views of the parents on the proposal are to be taken into account .", "CARDINAL .

If such objection is made , the resolution lapses on the expiry of DATE from service of the counter - notice ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) [ CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ] ) . However , within that period , the local authority may \" complain \" to a juvenile court , in which event the resolution will not lapse until the complaint is determined ; on hearing the complaint , the court may order that the resolution is not to lapse , provided that it is satisfied that the grounds for the resolution were made out when it was passed and subsist at the time of the hearing and that the continuation of the resolution is in the child \u2019s interest ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) [ CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) ] ) .", "CARDINAL .

A further appeal lies to ORG and , with leave , to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG of ORG has an inherent jurisdiction , independent of statutory provisions and deriving from the prerogative power of the ORG acting in its capacity as parens patriae , to make a child a ward of court .", "CARDINAL . The effect of wardship is that custody , in a broad sense , of the child is vested in the court itself ; it assumes responsibility for all aspects of his welfare and may make orders on any relevant matter whatsoever , notably as regards the care and control of and access to the child and his education , religion or property . In making such orders , the court is required to treat the child \u2019s welfare as the \" first and paramount consideration \" ( Guardianship of Minors Act DATE , section CARDINAL ) . Unless terminated earlier by order of the court , the wardship continues until the child attains his majority .", "Where there are exceptional circumstances making it impracticable or undesirable for the ward to be , or continue to be , under the care of his parents , the court may make an order committing him to the care of the local authority ( LAW DATE , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ) , subject to the power of the court to give directions ( Matrimonial Causes Act DATE , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) ) . In such circumstances , custody of the child remains with the court and it is for the court , and not the local authority , to take major decisions regarding the ward \u2019s future ; it retains , inter alia , jurisdiction to make orders for access to the child .", "CARDINAL . PERSON proceedings may be instituted by anyone who can show an appropriate interest in the child \u2019s welfare . An application for a wardship order has to be made by originating summons . The child becomes a ward immediately the summons is issued but the wardship automatically lapses after DATE unless within that time an appointment is made for the hearing of the summons . This appointment is normally held before a registrar who , subject to an appeal to a judge , may give interim directions on such matters as access to the child and may decide that other interested parties be joined in the proceedings .", "A judge will hear contested wardship proceedings and also applications - which can be made at any time by any party - for the variation or discharge of an existing wardship order or for directions on such matters as access to or the education of the child . From the judge \u2019s order , an appeal lies to ORG and thence , with leave , to ORG .", "The child may be represented in wardship proceedings by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court ; this is usually the Official Solicitor , who is a full - time public employee entirely independent of the executive .", "Under the Rules of ORG , it is possible to seek an order expediting the proceedings , notably if a party thereto is dilatory .", "CARDINAL . The functions of a local authority in child - care matters are exercised and decisions are taken either by its ORG or by a sub - committee or an officer to whom powers have been delegated . At the time relevant to the present case , the practice varied from authority to authority , there being no precise requirements or guidance even of a non - statutory kind , and much depended on the nature or gravity of the decision to be taken . Whether the child is in its care by virtue of the DATE [ DATE ] or LAW , the local authority must give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the child \u2019s welfare throughout his childhood , and must so far as practicable ascertain his wishes and feelings regarding the decision and give due consideration to them , having regard to his age and understanding ( section CARDINAL of LAW DATE [ CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ] ) .", "Authorities\u2019 decisions in this area are , in fact , often based on the outcome of case reviews or case conferences . The authority is under a statutory duty to review the case of each child in its care at DATE intervals ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act ) and , as a matter of practice , the child \u2019s position will in addition be regularly examined at case conferences . Reviews and conferences will be attended notably by the social workers responsible and senior officials of the authority \u2019s ORG , as well as by such other persons as health visitors , doctors and police officers .", "CARDINAL . A parent may on occasion be allowed or invited to attend a case review or case conference or part thereof , although he has no legal right to do so . His contacts with the social workers constitute the most usual channel for the communication of his views on matters to be decided by the authority .", "In the absence of legal proceedings , the parent can not compel the local authority to produce or permit inspection of TIME of its relevant meetings or reports produced thereat , although the authority has a discretion to allow such inspection . In proceedings for judicial review ( but not in juvenile court proceedings ) , the court may order the pre - trial disclosure of such documents , but only after leave to institute the proceedings has been obtained ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; however , this would be a rare occurrence , the general rule being that the documents are privileged and not open to inspection .", "CARDINAL . A parent whose child is in the care of a local authority is not automatically deprived of access to him . The continuation of access is , however , a matter within the discretionary power of the authority ( per Lord PERSON in ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . Thus , under LANGUAGE law , the question whether and to what extent a parent is to have access to his child who is in public care was , at the relevant time , within the competence of the local authority to decide , without any application to a court .", "Both the DATE [ CARDINAL ] Act and the DATE Act reflect the general idea that continuation of parental access to children in public care is in many cases normal and desirable : the former allows the local authority to contribute to the costs of parental visits and the latter makes special provision for certain cases where the parents have not visited the child during a certain period of time .", "CARDINAL . The statutory remedies described in paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL and CARDINAL - CARDINAL above , whereby a parent may challenge or seek the discharge of a care order or a parental rights resolution , are directed to the order or resolution as such , there being , at the relevant time , no specific statutory remedy whereby he could contest the isolated issue of a decision to restrict or terminate his access to his child .", "A decision of a local authority concerning access can , however , be challenged by way of an application for judicial review . Anyone who wishes to make such an application must first seek , normally within DATE of the decision , the leave of the court . The circumstances where judicial review will lie may be briefly summarised as follows :", "( a ) the authority acted illegally , ultra vires or in bad faith ;", "( b ) the authority failed to take into account relevant considerations , took account of irrelevant considerations or came to a decision to which no reasonable authority could have come ( Associated Provincial Picture Houses , Ltd. v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL ORG Bench Reports CARDINAL ) ;", "( c ) the authority failed to observe statutory procedural rules or to act fairly ( see notably R v. ORG , ex parte C and R v. GPE , ex parte B , ORG , DATE ) .", "The remedy of judicial review is concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision in question but rather the decision - making process itself , and the court will not act as a \" court of appeal \" from the body involved . Thus , where on a successful application for judicial review the court quashes an authority \u2019s decision , it will normally remit the matter to the authority for reconsideration ; it may , however , also direct the authority to reach a conclusion in accordance with the court \u2019s findings ( Rules of ORG , Order CARDINAL , rule ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . In certain circumstances , the wardship jurisdiction may also be invoked to question the decisions of a local authority or a juvenile court relating to a child in the former \u2019s care . The general rule is that the prerogative power of the ORG is not for all purposes ousted or abrogated by the exercise of the duties and powers conferred on local authorities by legislation . In the leading case of ORG , ORG examined the relationship between the wardship jurisdiction and the authorities\u2019 statutory powers . Their Lordships were unanimously of the view that the courts had no reviewing powers as to the merits of local authority decisions , notably on such matters as access to the child : the general inherent power of the court in its wardship jurisdiction was available to fill gaps or supplement the powers of local authorities but not to supervise ( except on judicial review principles ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) the exercise of discretion within the field committed to them by statute . Sometimes , however , the local authority itself may invite the supplementary assistance of the court and the wardship may then be continued with a view to action by the court .", "The foregoing limits on ORG powers apply only where the wardship proceedings concern a child who is already in public care . If he is not , ORG can examine fully such questions as access and make such order as it considers to be in his best interests .", "CARDINAL . The inability of parents to approach the courts , save as explained above , where decisions are made by a local authority affecting access to their children led ORG , in ORG Social Security Adjudications Act CARDINAL , to modify the law on this point .", "Under the new provisions - which came into force on DATE , that is after the events giving rise to the present case - , a local authority may not refuse to make arrangements for access to a child in care and may not terminate such arrangements unless it has first given notice to the parent . The latter then has a right to apply to a juvenile court for an access order , requiring the local authority to allow access subject to such conditions as the court may specify . Where an access order has been made , there is a right to apply for variation . An appeal against the juvenile court \u2019s decision lies to ORG . Any court dealing with the matter must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration .", "This new remedy applies only to decisions refusing or terminating access ; in all other cases , the nature and extent of access remain within the local authority \u2019s discretion .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the ORG published a Code of Practice on Access to Children in Care . This document stresses the importance of involving the child \u2019s natural parents in the local authority \u2019s decision - making process in this area and of informing them fully and promptly as to the substance of decisions concerning access .", "CARDINAL . A court can not make an adoption order in respect of a child unless , inter alia , it is satisfied that each parent freely and unconditionally agrees ( Children Act DATE , section CARDINAL ) . However , such agreement may be dispensed with upon a number of grounds specified in that section , notably that the parent is withholding consent unreasonably or has persistently failed without reasonable cause to discharge his parental duties . In reaching any decision relating to the adoption of a child , a court must have regard to all the circumstances , first consideration being given to the need to safeguard and promote his welfare throughout his childhood ( Children Act DATE , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Adoption proceedings in respect of a child who is a ward of court may not be instituted without the leave of ORG . On an application for leave , the court \u2019s function is to consider whether the proposed adoption application is one that might reasonably succeed , the merits of the matter being examined subsequently , once leave has been granted and after compliance with the requirements concerning notices and reports ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
