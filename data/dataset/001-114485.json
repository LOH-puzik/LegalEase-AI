A request by the lay representative ( bisidder ) that the applicant be placed in an institution in GPE during the investigation was disregarded .", "CARDINAL . After DATE , the applicant was transferred to GPE and brought before ORG in GPE ( Retten i Aalborg ) which on DATE , by virtue of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) , of ORG ( Retsplejeloven ) , extended the detention on remand until DATE and until his placement in an appropriate home or institution could be secured as set out in section CARDINAL , subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) of ORG . It further decided that the applicant should undergo a forensic psychiatric examination . The latter was formally requested by the public prosecutor on DATE and commenced at ORG at ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to a closed young offender institution . On DATE he was transferred to a secure residential institution called \u201c PERSON \u201d for young people aged DATE who had committed a crime or otherwise displayed dangerous conduct . One of the objects of that particular institution was that the young people placed there were given such care , upbringing and help with development that they would be able to function in society later on . The young people had a well - structured DATE routine with education , workshops and leisure - time activities , and with limit - setting adults with strong contact skills to support them .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was extended , inter alia , in order for ORG ( PERSON ) to be heard on the forensic psychiatric report .", "CARDINAL . ORG in GPE extended the applicant \u2019s detention by DATE on DATE , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . On DATE dates the domestic courts added that the conditions for extending the detention were fulfilled , also under section ORG , which entered into force on DATE ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the report from ORG was submitted , which concluded that the applicant was considered to fall within LAW , of LAW . Moreover , if the applicant were convicted , a sentence of placement in an institution for persons with extensive mental disabilities as provided by LAW , second sentence , was recommended as the most expedient measure to prevent further similar offences .", "CARDINAL . As a standard practice regarding persons falling within section DATE , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , on DATE the public prosecutor requested an opinion from ORG for the Mentally Disabled ( Samr\u00e5det for udviklingsh\u00e6mmede ) of GPE on the basis of the forensic psychiatric report and the recommendation of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , an opinion was received from ORG for the Mentally Disabled , which found that the documentation for considering the applicant to fall within section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL of LAW was inadequate . It therefore urged a further examination of the case before a decision was made . Accordingly , a new forensic psychiatric report was requested .", "CARDINAL . Originally , the trial was scheduled to commence on DATE , but it had to be re - scheduled for CARDINAL and DATE pending the completion of the second forensic psychiatric report . On DATE , for the first time the applicant objected to an extension of the pre - trial detention . He referred to the fact that section CARDINALa of ORG , which had entered into force on DATE , specifically limited pre - trial detention of persons DATE to a period not exceeding DATE .", "CARDINAL . By decision of DATE , still by virtue of section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) , of ORG , ORG in GPE extended the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention until DATE and stated :", "[ The applicant ] is charged with rape and homicide committed on DATE . The pre - trial detention is thus justified by a charge of a very serious crime which has also been admitted to by [ the applicant ] , and according to the information available it must be concluded that the reason why the case has not yet come to trial is the need to clarify the most expedient sanction , both in consideration of society and in consideration of [ the applicant ] himself . Although the length of the pre - trial detention exceeds the period stated as the maximum period in section CARDINALa of ORG , the court therefore finds that such very particular circumstances ( helt s\u00e6rlige omst\u00e6ndigheder ) apply as to provide a reason for deviating from the maximum period in section CARDINALa , and the request for extension is therefore allowed .", "CARDINAL . On appeal on DATE ORG PERSON ) , henceforth ORG , upheld the decision .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not apply for leave to appeal against the decision to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE extended the applicant \u2019s detention in the closed youth institution by DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG in GPE extended the applicant \u2019s detention by DATE . It noted that the second forensic psychiatric report had been submitted on DATE and that it was of significant importance to hear ORG in this respect . It repeated that such very particular circumstances applied as to provide a reason for deviating from the maximum period in section CARDINALa of ORG and that an extension could not be considered in breach of LAW . Accordingly , the trial had to be rescheduled anew .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , which on DATE upheld the decision . Leave to appeal to ORG was refused on DATE by ORG ( Procesbevillingsn\u00e6vnet ) .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the second report from ORG was submitted . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s case did not fall under LAW , subsection CARDINAL , of LAW , as found in its first report , but under LAW of LAW in that his actions had been conditioned by deficient development , reduction or disturbance of mental functions which , from a medical point of view , on the one hand could suggest a sentence to structured , controlled socio - psychiatric treatment , and on the other hand could not rule out ordinary imprisonment . ORG was unable to point to any other measures under LAW , second sentence , of LAW that were more expedient than ordinary punishment . ORG did find it relevant though , from a purely medical point of view , to order the applicant to undergo a structured , supervised socio - pedagogical measure as provided for by section DATE of LAW . If such sanction was not feasible , the imposition of ordinary punishment was recommended .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , in the meantime , on CARDINAL and DATE , and subsequently on CARDINAL DATE ORG in GPE extended the applicant \u2019s detention , stating expressly that an extension would not be contrary to LAW . The trial had been scheduled to take place on DATE , and if necessary also on CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG in GPE convicted the applicant in accordance with the indictment and his own confession . It was established as a fact that the applicant had gained access to the victim \u2019s apartment because he wanted access to a telephone . Having raped the victim , he killed her by inflicting several blows , kicks and knife lesions to the head , neck and body . Thereafter he had left the scene of the crime , walked to town and called the youth school institution to be collected . He did not talk to anybody about the crime until he had been arrested . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment . ORG refuted the applicant \u2019s complaint about the length of the detention and the length of the trial and stated that even though the proceedings had taken DATE from the applicant \u2019s deprivation of liberty , their length could not lead to a reduction of the sentence as the completion of the CARDINAL mental status examinations of the applicant- and the submission of the case to ORG had been of vital significance for determining the sanction to be imposed . Moreover , it found that the public prosecutor had conducted the proceedings with due diligence .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , on DATE ORG upheld the judgment in its entirety and stated , among other things : \u201c For the reasons stated by ORG and because the length of the proceedings can not be attributed to \u2018 periods of inactivity\u2019 of any importance for sentencing purposes in view of the nature of the case , [ ORG ] agrees that the length of the proceedings has not been attributed importance as a mitigating factor . Accordingly , and in view of the very significant gravity of the offences , including the particular ruthlessness exhibited by [ the applicant ] , the fact that the offences were committed in the victim \u2019s own home , and the fact that the victim was a defenceless DATE woman , ORG upholds the sentence of DATE imprisonment despite the fact that [ the applicant ] was DATE at the time of the offence , see section DATE , subsection CARDINAL(i ) , of the LAW \u201d . On DATE , ORG decided that the applicant should remain in alternative detention until the enforcement of the sentence could commence .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant did not submit a request to ORG for leave to appeal against ORG judgment to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The rules on detention on remand are laid down in part CARDINAL of ORG ( Retsplejeloven ) , which reads in so far as relevant :", "CARDINAL . A person charged ( en sigtet ) may be detained on remand when there is a reasonable suspicion that he has committed an offence which is subject to public prosecution , provided that under the law the offence may result in imprisonment for DATE and DATE or more , and", "( i ) according to information received concerning the suspect \u2019s situation , there are specific reasons for assuming that he will evade prosecution or execution of judgment , or", "( ii ) according to information received concerning the suspect \u2019s situation , there is specific reason to fear that , if at large , he will commit a new offence of the nature described above , or", "CARDINAL . A person charged may also be detained on remand when there are strong reasons for suspecting that he has committed :", "( i ) an offence which is subject to public prosecution which , under the law , may result in imprisonment for DATE or more , and it is deemed necessary for law enforcement reasons , according to the information obtained on the gravity of the offence , that the person is not at large ( hensynet til retsh\u00e5ndh\u00e6velsen ) ; or", "( ii ) an offence in violation of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL , section CARDINALa , section CARDINALa(CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL , section CARDINAL or section CARDINAL read with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) or section CARDINAL , section GPE ) , sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL , section CARDINAL or CARDINAL of LAW or violation of LAW committed against a child of DATE , in case the offence may be expected , due to the particulars of the seriousness of the circumstances , to be punished with a non - suspended sentence of imprisonment for DATE and due regard for enforcement of the law is found to require that the accused shall not be at large . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Detention on remand may not be imposed if the offence can be expected to result in a fine or imprisonment for a period not exceeding thirty days , or if the deprivation of liberty would be disproportionate to the inconvenience so caused to the life of the person charged , the importance of the case and the legal consequence to be expected if the person charged is found guilty .", "CARDINAL . The court shall decide , upon request from the prosecution , if an accused person shall be detained on remand . A request for continued remand detention shall be submitted to the court in writing and the request shall state the detention provision(s ) relied on by the prosecutor , the factual circumstances on which the request is based and the most significant investigative steps expected to be taken .", "...", "CARDINAL . ... If detention on remand is continued beyond the time limits set out in section ORG , subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , the [ court ] must state in its decision necessitate continued detention on remand ...", "CARDINAL . Where the conditions to apply detention on remand are met , but if the purpose of detention on remand may be obtained by less radical measures , the court decides on such measures in lieu thereof subject to the consent of the person charged .", "CARDINAL . The court may thus decide that the person charged shall", "...", "( iii ) be placed in an appropriate home or institution", "...", "CARDINAL . Except for situations where the person charged is not present in GPE , the court order must state a period for the pre - trial detention or the measure . The period must be as short as possible and may not exceed DATE . The period may be extended but not by DATE at a time . The extension is made by court order unless the defendant accepts the extension . Until judgment is rendered in the first instance , the rules of section CARDINAL apply correspondingly to court hearings and court orders about extension of periods . A defendant who is held in pre - trial detention or is subject to another custodial measure does not , however , have to be brought in person before the court if he waives this or the court finds that such attendance will involve undue difficulties .", "Detention on remand or measures in lieu hereof , shall if necessary be terminated by a court order if prosecution is dropped or the conditions for instituting proceedings no longer exist . If the court order finds that the necessary speed has not been used to proceed with the matter and that detention on remand or other measures are not reasonable , the court shall terminate it .", "CARDINAL . Unless the court finds that there are special circumstances to the contrary , the maximum period of detention on remand must not be extended for a continuous period of", "( i ) DATE , when the accused is charged with an offence that can not carry a sentence of imprisonment for DATE or", "( ii ) DATE when the accused is charged with an offence that may carry a sentence of imprisonment for DATE or more .", "CARDINAL .

The periods mentioned in subsections CARDINAL and CARDINAL comprise the period until the beginning of the trial at first instance .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINALa was inserted into ORG by act no . CARDINAL of DATE and entered into force on DATE with the aim of reducing lengthy criminal charges and detention on remand . The reasons for the proposal were explained in the general remarks to the LAW , inter alia by a reference to a specific ORG , DATE , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL :", "\u201c The ORG notes that detention on remand is a particularly serious interference in criminal procedure , and that this especially is the case for persons DATE . The strain that flows from detention on remand - in the view of ORG caused not only by the uncertainty that follows from the charge and the imprisonment , but also uncertainty with respect to the length of the detention and the consequent questions , inter alia , whether the detainee can resume his work or his education after the detention ends , relationships with family and friends , etc . The strain must normally be presumed to grow concurrently with the length of the interference and especially for this reason the length of detention should be limited as far as possible . Against this background , the ORG finds that there is a need for further measures to reduce the length of detention on remand . Considering the serious character of the interference , the ORG further notes that it must be incumbent on the police , the prosecution authorities and the courts that , in the organisation of their work , they pay special attention to expediting these cases in order for detention on remand to be of the shortest possible duration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As appears from the wording of section ORG , deviation from pre - trial detention periods of defendants under DATE is only possible if the court finds that \u201c very special circumstances \u201d apply . As explained in more detail in the preparatory notes ( see ORG on Parliamentary Proceedings DATE ( CARDINALnd sitting ) , Addendum A , p. CARDINAL ( Bill No . L CARDINAL ) ) , it depends on a specific assessment of all the circumstances of each case whether there is a basis for deviating from the maximum periods of pre - trial detention , as concerns both charged persons under and over DATE . When assessing this , the court must start from the reason for detention applied , that is , the reasons for pre - trial detention under section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL(i ) ( danger of absconding ) , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL(ii ) ( danger of reoffending ) , or CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ( public interest ) of ORG . The preparatory notes set out :", "In case of pre - trial detention pursuant to the said provisions , the requirement of particular circumstances implies that a total assessment must be made on the basis of a strict assessment , both of the circumstances mentioned in LAW ( that is , particularly whether the investigation is being conducted with the requisite expedition ) and of the necessity of continuing the detention pursuant to the detention reason applied .", "The strict attention to the necessity of continuing the detention also implies that the court must pay special attention to the proportionality requirement under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG and , particularly in connection with the detention reason stipulated in subsection ( l)(i ) ( danger of absconding ) , to the possibility of using alternatives to detention as prescribed in section CARDINAL . Concerning the application of alternatives , it should be noted in that connection that the court , the public prosecutor as well as defence counsel should be aware at all times of the need to try to apply alternative detention in cases where that would be an adequate measure .", "...", "In all cases , the offence charged will be of significant importance so that continued detention after the maximum periods stated may particularly be applied in serious criminal cases , that is , in cases of aggravated offences against the person and other cases of particular public interest in which the expected sanction will be DATE of imprisonment . Thus , following an overall assessment , the court must make a critical assessment of the necessity of continued pre - trial detention in light of the length of the detention so far .", "...", "In the assessment of the question of continuation of the detention in case of the most aggravated offences , for example in cases of homicide , the most aggravated drugs offences , etc . , the nature of the actual aggravated offence will naturally be included in the assessment of whether detention may be continued in excess of the periods stated . Particularly in cases where prosecution has been instituted , and where there is a rather strong suspicion , the criminal nature of a very serious offence may , in addition to the specific reason for detention , be included as an essential factor resulting in a finding that particular circumstances exist in accordance with the provision proposed .", "CARDINAL . Particularly concerning continued pre - trial detention of charged persons under DATE in excess of the maximum periods , the preparatory notes stated the following :", "Whether pre - trial detention of young people under DATE may occur in excess of the normal periods stated in subsection ( CARDINAL ) must normally depend on an assessment corresponding to the one to be made when determining whether there is any basis for deviating from the periods stated in subsection ( CARDINAL ) , see above . However , the condition for deviating from the periods stated in subsection ( CARDINAL ) is qualified , as exceptional circumstances must apply . This pertains to both the circumstances referred to in LAW of ORG ( that is , particularly whether the investigation is being conducted with the requisite expedition ) and to the necessity of continued pre - trial detention in accordance with the reason for detention applied , see above for details . Also the nature of the offence charged will be of significant importance so that continued detention after the maximum periods stated may particularly be applied in very serious criminal cases ( that is , in cases of severely aggravated offences against the person and other cases of particular public interest in which the expected sanction will be DATE of imprisonment ) .", "CARDINAL . The Penal Code contains various provisions on the significance of the perpetrator \u2019s mental status at the time of the offence , inter alia :", "( CARDINAL ) Persons who , at the time of the act , were irresponsible on account of mental illness or a state of affairs comparable to mental illness , or who are severely mentally defective , are not punishable . Provided that the perpetrator was temporarily in a condition of mental illness or a state of affairs comparable to mental illness on account of the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicants , he may in particular circumstances be punished .", "( CARDINAL ) Persons who , at the time of the act , were slightly mentally defective are not punishable , except in particular circumstances . The same shall apply to persons in a state of affairs comparable to mental deficiency .", "Where an accused is acquitted in accordance with LAW , the court may decide on the use of other measures which it considers to be expedient for the prevention of further offences . If less extreme measures such as supervision , decisions on place of residence or work , addiction treatment , psychiatric treatment and so on are considered insufficient , the court may decide that the person in question must be taken to a hospital for the mentally ill or to an institution for severe mental defectives , or that he must be put into care suitable for the mentally deficient , or that he must be taken to a suitable home or to an institution where he can receive special nursing or care . Safe custody is possible under the conditions stated in CARDINAL of this LAW .", "Where the offender was , at the time that the punishable act was committed , in a condition resultant upon inadequate development or an impairment or disturbance of his mental abilities , although not of the character referred to in LAW of this LAW , the court may , if considered expedient , decide upon the use of measures such as those referred to in the second sentence of LAW above , in lieu of punishment .", "CARDINAL . The Administration of Justice Act contains the following provision on mental status examinations of the perpetrator :", "CARDINAL . The defendant must be subjected to a mental status examination when this is found to be of importance for the decision of the case . If he does not explicitly consent to the examination , it can only take place pursuant to a court order . If the defendant is being detained , he can not be examined without a decision of the court .", "CARDINAL . Mental status reports are prepared by consultants in psychiatry . The cases of forensic psychiatry that are submitted to ORG ( Retsl\u00e6ger\u00e5det ) for an opinion concern the question of whether , at the time of the offence , the defendant was mentally ill or in a comparable state as stated in LAW of LAW and questions of determination of the most / more expedient measure , see sections DATE and CARDINAL of LAW . CARDINAL of all mental status reports are submitted to ORG . Cases not submitted to ORG typically concern less serious crimes and where the examination gives no basis for recommending a special psychiatric measure . The detailed rules for the organisation and work routines of ORG are laid down in the Rules of Procedure of the Council . Rule CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the Rules of Procedure provides that :", "If the written material submitted to the ORG is deemed not to provide a sufficient basis for the ORG \u2019s assessment of the case , the ORG shall inform the submitting authority of what further information will be of importance for such assessment . At the same time , the ORG shall state whether it is deemed most expedient that such information is provided : ...", "through examination of the person in question by CARDINAL or more of the ORG members or experts at the request of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In cases where it is concluded , on the basis of the mental status examination of the perpetrator , that the perpetrator is slightly retarded ( \u2018 mentally PERSON ) , it is standard practice for the public prosecutor of ORG , who conducted the criminal proceedings against the applicant before ORG , to request an opinion from ORG for the Mentally Disabled ( Samr\u00e5det for ORG ) of GPE . ORG for the Mentally Disabled , which includes a forensic psychiatrist and a psychologist as well as a representative of ORG , assesses the conclusion of the mental status report on the perpetrator \u2019s mental status and recommends the sanction which should be imposed on the perpetrator , including the type of institution in which the perpetrator should be placed ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
