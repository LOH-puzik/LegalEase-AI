GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 5-1;Violations of Art. 5-4;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic and Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "Peer Lorenzen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE . At the date the application was lodged , he was living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , after hearing representations from the applicant , ordered his detention on remand . The applicant was assisted from this point on by counsel . ORG found that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had evaded taxes on CARDINAL occasions DATE and DATE . He had been working as a self - employed commercial agent for several firms in GPE since DATE and been running a telephone service since DATE . In DATE the company ORG GPE had paid him commission amounting to CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL Deutschmarks ( DEM ) . The court found that , according to the documents before it at that date , the applicant was suspected of having evaded turnover taxes of MONEY ( ORG ) , income taxes of EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL and trade taxes of ORG CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the applicant , who had availed himself of the right to remain silent , was strongly suspected of tax evasion on the basis of the business records that had been seized when his home was searched . He had to be placed in pre - trial detention because of a danger of collusion ( GPE ) ( see section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The documents seized were incomplete . There was therefore a risk that the applicant , if released , might destroy the missing documents or conceal further business transactions and accounts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a motion for review of his detention order ( GPE ) with ORG . His counsel also requested access to the case files . He argued that he had a right to inspect the files in order to examine all the facts and evidence on which the arrest warrant and , in particular , the strong suspicion that an offence had been committed were based and that domestic law prohibited the court from considering facts and evidence to which defence counsel had been refused access pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant \u2019s counsel that he was being refused access to the case files pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW as access would jeopardise the purpose of the investigation . It added , however , that the public prosecutor in charge of the case was prepared to inform counsel orally about the facts and evidence . The applicant \u2019s counsel did not take up that offer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG heard representations from the applicant and his defence counsel . The applicant argued that there was no risk of collusion or of his absconding . Should the court nevertheless consider that he might abscond if released he was ready to comply with any conditions imposed by the court , such as handing over his identity papers . The applicant \u2019s counsel complained that he had still not had access to the case files .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , ORG , which had before it the case files of the proceedings , upheld the arrest warrant . It found that there was still a risk that , if released , the applicant would tamper with factual evidence or interfere with witnesses . The applicant had so far tried to conceal his true place of residence and other personal details from the authorities and had acted with the intent to mislead which ,", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s appeal , which was lodged on CARDINAL DATE and was followed up by detailed reasons on CARDINAL DATE , ORG informed the applicant in a letter dated DATE that it considered that the risk of his absconding could serve as a ground for his continued detention . As to his counsel \u2019s request for access to the case files , it stated that he should be informed orally about the content of the files in the first instance .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE , the applicant contested that view . He claimed , in particular , that in his case mere oral information about the content of the case files would not be sufficient .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing representations from ORG and considering the case files , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG decision dated DATE . It found that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had evaded income , turnover and trade taxes . Furthermore , there was a danger of his absconding within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as the applicant had connections in foreign countries and faced a heavy sentence .", "CARDINAL . In view of defence counsel \u2019s refusal to accept the offer made by ORG to explain the content of the case files orally , ORG found that it was impossible to assess whether the information given in this manner would be sufficient . At the present stage of the proceedings , counsel for the defence could not , however , claim to be entitled to unlimited access to the complete case files .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a further appeal against the detention order . He again claimed that he had a constitutional right to be given access to the facts and evidence on which the detention order was based .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided , without giving further reasons , not to amend its decision of CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG , which had the case files , drafted a report which was sent to ORG with the files DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in its submissions to ORG , stated that it was not prepared to give the applicant access to the case files . It argued that it was sufficient for the applicant to be notified of the overview of ORG on the amount of his income and amount of the taxes evaded in DATE in question . The submissions and the case files reached ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sent further observations to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who had been sent the submissions of ORG on DATE , contested its arguments . He stated that the overview was merely a conclusion of ORG the merits of which he could not examine without having access to the documents and records on which it was based .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on the applicant \u2019s further appeal , quashed ORG decision dated CARDINAL DATE and ORG decision dated DATE upholding the applicant \u2019s detention , and remitted the case to ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG , which had the investigation files before it , found that the detention order issued by ORG on DATE did not comply with the legal requirements . Therefore , the decisions taken in the judicial review proceedings by ORG on DATE and by ORG on DATE ( but not the detention order of DATE itself ) had to be quashed . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the facts leading to a strong suspicion that the accused had committed a particular offence and the reasons for detention had to be set out in the detention order . In order to comply with the constitutional rights to be heard and to a fair trial , the facts and evidence on which the suspicion and the reasons for the defendant \u2019s detention on remand were based had to be described in sufficient detail to enable the accused to comment on them and defend himself effectively .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that , in its decisions on the applicant \u2019s detention , ORG had , however , merely stated that the applicant was strongly suspected of tax evasion \u201c on the basis of the business records seized when his home was searched \u201d . It should , at minimum , have summarised the results of the evaluation of those records in order to enable the accused to oppose the decision on detention by making his own submissions or presenting evidence . This defect had not been remedied in the course of the subsequent decisions on the applicant \u2019s continued detention . As counsel for the defence had also been refused access to the case files under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , these defects amounted to a denial of the right of the accused to be heard .", "CARDINAL . ORG declined to take its own decision on the applicant \u2019s detention itself pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) or to quash the detention order of DATE , which it considered to be defective in law ( rechtsfehlerhaft ) , but not void ( unwirksam ) . It stated that it would only quash the detention order if it was obvious that there was no strong suspicion that the accused had committed an offence and that there were no reasons for the arrest . It was for ORG to inform the accused of the reasons on which the suspicion of his having committed an offence were based and to hear representations from him on that issue . Should ORG persist , in the interest of its investigations , in not informing the accused of the reasons , the detention order would have to be quashed .", "CARDINAL . As a consequence , the applicant remained in custody .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to issue a fresh amended detention order against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG again heard representations from the applicant , his defence counsel , ORG and an official in charge of investigations at ORG on the applicant \u2019s motion for judicial review of the detention order . The applicant \u2019s counsel was given copies of CARDINAL pages of the voluminous case files containing an overview by ORG of the amounts of income and taxes evaded by the applicant DATE . Relying on the applicant \u2019s rights to be heard and to a fair trial , the applicant \u2019s counsel complained that he had not been granted access to the case files before the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP ORG then issued a fresh detention order against the applicant . It stated that there was a strong suspicion that the applicant had evaded taxes on CARDINAL occasions DATE and DATE . Listing in detail the applicant \u2019s income from his various activities as a self - employed commercial agent and the amounts of tax payable , ORG found that there was a strong suspicion that he had evaded turnover taxes of ORG , income taxes of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL , solidarity taxes of ORG and trade taxes of DEM CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It based its suspicion on documents whose content was explained by a tax official present at the hearing , witness statements of the owners of the firms the applicant was working for , the applicant \u2019s contracts of employment and the wage slips and commission statements that had been issued by the firms .", "CARDINAL . ORG further found that there was a risk of the applicant \u2019s absconding , which was a ground for detention under LAW CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL of LAW . He faced a lengthy prison sentence which could no longer be suspended on probation , had not notified the authorities of his place of residence for DATE and had claimed that he was living in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . By an order of DATE , ORG decided to suspend the execution of the arrest warrant on condition that the applicant , who in the meantime had complied with his duty to inform the authorities of his address , informed the court of every change of address , complied with all summonses issued by the court , ORG and the police , and reported to the police CARDINAL times a week . It suspended the execution of the order to release the applicant at the request of ORG , which had immediately lodged an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after hearing representations from the applicant and ORG , ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against the detention order . It likewise dismissed the appeal lodged by ORG against the decision to suspend the execution of the detention order on the additional conditions that the applicant hand over his identity papers to ORG and deposit DEM CARDINAL as security .", "CARDINAL . Having deposited the security , the applicant was released from prison on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a further appeal against ORG decision , complaining that his counsel had still not been granted access to the case files .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE , ORG granted the applicant \u2019s counsel access to the case files . It stated that it had intended to send the files to him at an earlier date . However , this had not been possible as the files had been at ORG and had only recently been returned to ORG . The applicant \u2019s counsel received the files for inspection on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant withdrew his further appeal on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against the decision of ORG dated DATE and the detention order issued by ORG on DATE . In his submission , his rights to liberty , to be heard in court and to be informed promptly by a judge of the reasons for his detention on remand as well as his rights to be heard within a reasonable time and to a fair trial as guaranteed by LAW had been violated . He argued in particular that his right to liberty , the deprivation of which was only constitutional if it was in accordance with the law , had been breached by his illegal detention on the basis of a void detention order . The complete refusal to allow his defence counsel access to the case files pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW had violated his right to be heard in court as guaranteed by LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and his right to liberty under LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The impugned decisions disregarded both the case - law of ORG and the ORG \u2019s case - law as laid down in its judgments of CARDINAL DATE in the cases of PERSON , PERSON and GPE . ORG refusal to quash the detention order and to take a decision itself and its decision to remit the case to ORG instead had also breached his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant extended his constitutional complaint to include the decisions of ORG dated DATE and the decision of ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without giving further reasons , declined to consider the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against the detention orders issued by ORG on DATE and DATE , the decision of ORG dated DATE and the decision of ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant on CARDINAL counts of tax evasion and sentenced him to a total of DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment suspended on probation . The court found that the applicant , who had confessed to the offences , had evaded turnover taxes of DEM CARDINAL , income taxes of ORG and trade taxes of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Sections CARDINAL et seq . of LAW ( Strafprozessordnung ) concern detention on remand . Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code , a defendant may be detained on remand if there is a strong suspicion that he has committed a criminal offence and if there are grounds for arresting him . Grounds for arrest will exist where certain facts warrant the conclusion that there is a risk of his absconding ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL ) or of collusion ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW , detention on remand is ordered by a judge in a written arrest warrant . The arrest warrant names the accused , the offence of which he is strongly suspected , including the time and place of its commission , and the grounds for the arrest . Moreover , the facts establishing the grounds for the strong suspicion that an offence has been committed and for the arrest must be set out in the arrest warrant unless national security would thereby be endangered .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , remand prisoners may ask at any time for judicial review ( GPE ) of the decision to issue an arrest warrant or for the warrant to be suspended . They may lodge an appeal under section CARDINAL of LAW ( Haftbeschwerde ) against a decision ordering their ( continued ) detention and a further appeal ( PERSON ) against ORG decision on the appeal ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . If the appeal court considers the appeal against the ( continued ) detention to be well - founded , it will take a decision on the merits at the same time ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) . However , according to the domestic courts\u2019 case - law , a detention order which does not comply with the duty to set out the grounds for suspecting the accused of an offence is not void , but merely defective in law . If , in such a case , the prosecution also refused access to the case file , the defective reasoning amounts to a refusal to hear representations from the defendant . In these circumstances , the court of appeal \u2013 by way of an exception to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 may remit the case to the district court ( see ORG , no .

Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that defence counsel is entitled to consult the files which have been or will be presented to the trial court , and to inspect the exhibits . Paragraph CARDINAL of this provision allows access to part or all of the files or to the exhibits to be refused until the preliminary investigation has ended if it might otherwise be at risk . At no stage of the proceedings may defence counsel be refused access to records concerning the examination of the accused , acts in the judicial investigation at which defence counsel was or should have been allowed to be present or expert reports ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the said Code ) . Pending the termination of the preliminary investigation , it is for ORG to decide whether to grant access to the files or not ; thereafter it is for the president of the trial court ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .
