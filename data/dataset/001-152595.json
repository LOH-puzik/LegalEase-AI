On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of knifepoint rape with an accomplice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG ( \u201c the Town Court \u201d ) remanded him in custody pending trial . The court noted that the applicant was suspected of a serious criminal offence , and held that if he remained at large he might abscond from the investigation and the court and continue his criminal activity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the preventive measure should remain unchanged and should be extended until DATE . The court reiterated that the applicant had been charged with a serious criminal offence and that gave grounds to believe that if released he might continue his criminal activity . In addition the court noted that he should not be released , because this might prevent the investigator from performing certain investigative actions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the extension of the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . It endorsed the reasons for the extension of his detention which had been given before . It also noted that the investigating authorities needed time to perform certain investigative actions , to draft a bill of indictment , and to provide him with an opportunity to study his case file . It further observed that the applicant \u2019s neighbours had given negative references regarding his character .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the investigator \u2019s request to extend the applicant \u2019s detention . The request was based on the arguments that the applicant was suspected of a serious crime , and that if released he might abscond . The investigator also noted that he had to perform certain investigative actions and ensure that the applicant had the opportunity to acquaint himself with the case file . The applicant argued that he was a student who had a stable place of residence , and that he could not abscond as he required in - patient medical treatment for his hepatitis PERSON also provided some positive references concerning his character . The court accepted the investigator \u2019s arguments , and extended the detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the investigator applied for an extension of the applicant \u2019s detention for DATE to give the applicant an opportunity to study the case file . In response to the applicant \u2019s arguments , ORG noted :", "\u201c ... The circumstances cited by the investigator [ concerning the need to ensure the applicant \u2019s familiarisation with the case file ] were already [ sufficient ] grounds for the detention orders of DATE and CARDINAL DATE .", "The case file contains the order of DATE , which provides that [ the applicant ] had until DATE to study the case file . Accordingly , the extension of his detention for DATE is an excessive measure . During the hearing the investigator and the prosecutor referred to their busy schedule , which prevented the authorities from ensuring [ the applicant \u2019s ] familiarisation with his CARDINAL-page file on a DATE basis . The study of the file required the applicant to be transported from a temporary detention facility to a court building . However , those arguments can not be accepted by the court , as they are not compatible with the requirements of LAW , which provides that everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph CARDINAL ( c ) of this Article shall be ... entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial . Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial . \u201d The court finds that the investigating authorities unnecessarily extended the investigation .

On DATE ORG quashed the decision of DATE on procedural grounds , finding that ORG only had power either to uphold the investigator \u2019s request or to reject it . LAW GPE did not allow such requests to be granted in part .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .

It noted that the applicant was suspected of a serious criminal offence , and held that if released he might abscond from the investigation and the court and obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case . The applicant applied for release on bail , stating that he was suffering from hepatitis C and that there were no circumstances which would be capable of justifying the excessive length of his detention . The court refused his application . It held that the grounds for his detention remained unchanged and that he could receive medical treatment for hepatitis C in a detention facility . The applicant \u2019s detention was extended until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE . The court once again relied on the seriousness of the charges against the applicant . No other grounds for his detention were provided by the court .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of DATE . His claim was received by the appeal court on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the impugned decision of DATE on appeal . The appeal court added a new argument . It stated that the parties had significantly contributed to the length of the trial proceedings . This was due in particular to the fact that the last court hearing was adjourned owing to the absence of the defence lawyer , who was unwell . Taking into account the above and the information on the applicant \u2019s character , ORG found that his detention should not be lifted . By virtue of a decision of DATE the higher court refused to review the applicant \u2019s detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG examined a new application by the prosecuting party for an extension of the detention . Relying on the seriousness of the charges and the risk of absconding , the court extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , referring to the progress of his hepatitis C , the applicant asked the court to change his detention to house arrest .
