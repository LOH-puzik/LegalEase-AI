He was arrested in GPE and remanded in custody on DATE in connection with a heroin - trafficking operation involving CARDINAL other people . He was charged with illegally importing controlled substances ( QUANTITY of heroin ) and of conspiring with a co - accused to import drugs and of being his accomplice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG sentenced Mr PERSON to DATE imprisonment and made an order permanently excluding him from NORP territory . It also ordered confiscation of the drugs that had been seized and imposed a fine of MONEY ( ORG ) jointly on the applicant and the other convicted defendants in lieu of confiscation and ordered them , pursuant to LAW ( \u201c CC \u201d ) , to pay a like amount , equal to the value of the unlawfully imported substances , to the customs authorities . The applicant \u2019s joint liability was limited to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL . Lastly , the court ordered Mr PERSON \u2019s continued detention pursuant to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , for a period not exceeding the maximum period for imprisonment in default DATE which , under LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) was DATE , until the ORG penalties had been paid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on an appeal by Mr PERSON and a cross - appeal by the prosecution , ORG upheld both the applicant 's conviction and sentence and the orders made in favour of the customs authorities . The applicant 's appeal to ORG was dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG to be transferred to GPE under PERSON on ORG . On DATE the ORG rejected the application on the ground that the customs fine had not been paid . It added that the application could be reconsidered if all or part of the sum was paid , and that to that end the applicant could , if he so wished , contact the customs authorities with a view to a settlement .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions Mr PERSON , who was held in LOC detention centre , sought a \u201c settlement with the customs authorities \u201d . On DATE he applied for the order for imprisonment in default to be discharged offering to pay ORG CARDINAL . Further applications , in which he offered to pay ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL and then ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , were unsuccessful as the Director of ORG had fixed the sum required for discharge of the order at FRF CARDINAL,CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a letter of CARDINAL DATE , Mr PERSON renewed his offer of ORG CARDINAL while at the same time asking the customs authorities to advise him urgently what they would consider a \u201c reasonable offer \u201d as his prison sentence for the criminal offences was due to end on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the customs authorities replied that his offers were too low compared with the penalties imposed , that his tax return showing a nil liability to income tax could not be taken into account as profits derived from drug trafficking were necessarily undeclared and , lastly , that the order for his imprisonment in default would not be discharged until the sum of FRF CARDINAL , which had previously been indicated , had been paid . That decision would be reviewed once he had served CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment in default . Having regard to the position taken by the customs authorities , ORG also rejected further requests by the applicant to be transferred to GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the applicant had , on DATE , lodged an application with the President of the PERSON tribunal de grande instance to have the order for his imprisonment in default discharged as he was insolvent , insolvency being a ground for not enforcing such orders ( Article CARDINAL of LAW \u201c ORG \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The President rejected that application on DATE on the ground that it was devoid of purpose , since the applicant was still detained by virtue of the criminal conviction and sentence , \u201c a sentence unconnected with imprisonment in default \u201d .", "CARDINAL .

In an order made in that capacity on DATE the President asked the public prosecutor \u2019s office , pursuant to the first paragraph of LAW and to LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , to refer the difficulty to ORG , which had sentenced the applicant .

That document does not by itself suffice to show that he is insolvent or justify discharging the order for imprisonment in default .", "In these circumstances it is appropriate to ask the public prosecutor \u2019s office to refer the difficulty to ORG , which passed the sentence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE ORG heard the applicant , the lawyer officially assigned to represent him and the customs authorities ; the latter submitted that ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ORG were not applicable in the case .

The applicant was released on DATE after paying the sum of FRF CARDINAL to the customs authorities .", "CARDINAL . Imprisonment in default is an invention of NORP law originally designed to guarantee execution of a court order to pay a sum of money either to the ORG or to a private individual . It consists in detaining the recalcitrant debtor in a short - stay prison , where he is not obliged to work . It is not an alternative to payment , as the person against whom the order is made remains liable to pay the sum due ( LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , but it may not be imposed a second time for the same debt . Its scope has gradually been whittled away since DATE , when it was seen as a real means of punishment available to creditors , who could apply to have insolvent civil debtors committed to prison . It was permanently abolished in civil and commercial proceedings by the PERSON of DATE , surviving in respect of debts to the ORG only ( LAW CCP \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and the rules governing its enforcement have become more lenient ( exempting insolvent individuals from imprisonment in default was the most important feature of a reform introduced on DATE by PERSON no . DATE , LAW see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "Imprisonment in default now serves to guarantee recovery of debts to the ORG , such as pecuniary penalties DATE with the exception of those imposed for political or press offences \u2013 or any other payment to the ORG not in the nature of civil damages .", "It is governed in many respects by the same principles as those governing execution of sentence : it can not be executed once the time - limit for enforcing sentence has expired . In extradition cases ( PERSON of DATE ) and for the purposes of rehabilitation ( ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ORG ) its execution is deemed the equivalent of payment . The criminal - law principles that sentences must be adapted to the individual and that consecutive sentences must not be imposed apply .", "In spite of these aspects , imprisonment in default is regarded not as a form of imprisonment in lieu of payment but as a guarantee of enforcement directed at the debtor 's person . On DATE , on an appeal on points of law by an offender sentenced to pay CARDINAL fines of ORG CARDINAL each for contravening a d\u00e9partement health regulation on manure tipping , ORG pointed out : \u201c Imprisonment in default is not a penalty .
