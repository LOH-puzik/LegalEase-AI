The other applicants ( listed in the Annex ) are members of the first applicant . They are companies registered under NORP law . The applicants were represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The applicants listed in the ORG are companies which operate pharmacy networks in GPE and are as such members of the first applicant , HGYSZ . Each member of ORG holds shares ( usually majority shares ) in a number of different pharmacies or directly operates ( usually CARDINAL ) pharmacies . As a result of their respective shareholdings , ORG members own part of the equity , take part in the management and share the profits of a number of pharmacies in GPE .", "CARDINAL . DATE , the operation of pharmacies in GPE was governed by LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . ( GPE . ) ORG , under which the opening of new pharmacies was allowed without any geographic or demographic limitation . During this period , the number of pharmacies in GPE increased by PERCENT to CARDINAL pharmacies .", "CARDINAL . From the adoption of Act no . ORG of DATE onwards , and until DATE , the operation of pharmacies was governed by different rules , according to which the opening of new pharmacies was still without obstacles and the takeover / operation of existing pharmacies by companies was possible . However , geographic and demographic barriers to the opening of new pharmacies were introduced , requirements concerning inter alia the qualification of pharmacists and their influence on the management of the pharmacies were applied , and the legal form of companies that may operate pharmacies was prescribed . At the same time , there was no limitation on the number of pharmacies that could be operated by one entity , provided the relevant sector - specific conditions were met .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , new rules contained in Act no . XCVIII of DATE ( \u201c the PERSON . \u201d ) abolished most limitations on the establishment of pharmacies and the legal form of companies that could operate pharmacies .", "CARDINAL . DATE , a number of foreign investors entered the NORP pharmaceutical retail market by acquiring shares in pharmacies . The majority of HGYSZ PERSON shareholdings date back to the period DATE . Despite the limitations in place DATE , there was no indication that shareholdings in pharmacies would be limited or that any future limitation on shareholdings would affect already existing shareholdings in pharmacies .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , NORP legislation introduced limitations on the shareholdings in pharmacies . These limitations , which Act no . CLXXIII of DATE ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) incorporated into the PERSON . \u2013 as of DATE require that the shareholdings of pharmacists in the pharmacies where they work must exceed PERCENT by DATE and PERCENT by DATE and moreover that no one may have shares in CARDINAL pharmacies . The restrictions do not only apply to pharmacies which are established after the amendments entered into force , but ownership in already existing pharmacies must also be brought into line with the limitations by the respective deadlines of DATE and DATE . Moreover , any change in the ownership of the non - pharmacist shareholders entails an immediate obligation to meet the above thresholds , even before the deadlines of CARDINAL DATE and DATE . The amendments do not contain any guarantee for an appropriate compensation for those shareholders who are obliged to give up part of their shareholdings .", "CARDINAL . The DATE amendments introduced by the LAW entail in particular the limitations outlined below .", "Previously , in cases where pharmacies were operated by enterprises , it was sufficient for the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy concerned to have a PERCENT share in the enterprise operating that pharmacy . Pursuant to the amendment to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the PERSON . , introduced by LAW ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW , enterprises are now only allowed to operate pharmacies if the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy concerned and the pharmacist(s ) employed in the pharmacy exceed PERCENT .", "According to section CARDINAL/A ( CARDINAL ) of the PERSON . , introduced by LAW , these ownership rules enter into force DATE and DATE according to the following schedule .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , with some exceptions ( such as the death of the pharmacist ) , changes in the ownership structure of the enterprise operating a pharmacy entail an immediate obligation under which the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s ) employed in the pharmacy must exceed PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s ) employed in the pharmacy must exceed PERCENT and , again with some exceptions , changes in the ownership structure of the enterprise operating a pharmacy entail an immediate obligation under which the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s ) employed in the pharmacy must exceed PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . As of DATE , the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s ) employed in the pharmacy must exceed PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . According to section CARDINAL/A ( CARDINAL ) of the PERSON . , introduced by LAW , once the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s ) employed in the pharmacy have exceeded PERCENT , it is prohibited , even before the time - limit of DATE , to reduce those combined shares to PERCENT or below .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that it was difficult to estimate the exact value that they would obtain in exchange for the shares they were required to transfer to pharmacists by DATE . However , they argued that , in the absence of any provision concerning compensation for the required transfer of shares and in light of the limited financial means of pharmacists in GPE , the price offered for the shareholdings in question would inevitably be substantially below pharmacies\u2019 normal market value . Indeed , the limited number of cases where ORG members had sold shares since DATE showed that , subsequent to the amendments made to the PERSON . in DATE , purchase prices were far below the market value .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , before the amendments introduced by the LAW , there was no restriction on how many pharmacies a single shareholder could have shares in .

Given the shareholdings of ORG members , the applicants would need to give up substantial shareholdings in order to bring their shares below the PERCENT threshold by DATE and below the PERCENT threshold by DATE . Additionally , with the exception of CARDINAL applicant that holds shares in CARDINAL pharmacies , all others would need to give up completely their shareholdings in a number of pharmacies in order to reduce the number of pharmacies in their respective networks to CARDINAL . For instance , PERSON . , the largest member of ORG , which holds shares in CARDINAL pharmacies , would need to surrender its shares in CARDINAL pharmacies and reduce its shares in the remaining CARDINAL pharmacies PERCENT by DATE and PERCENT by DATE .", "CARDINAL . The value of the shareholdings that the applicants would need to give away DATE because of the restriction on the size of shareholdings \u2013 by DATE is estimated at MONEY ( ORG ) , and the value of the shareholdings that they would need to surrender by DATE is estimated at an additional ORG CARDINAL . These figures exclude the further shareholdings to be alienated on account of the restriction on the number of pharmacies owned by CARDINAL shareholder , whose value will be dependent on the choice of pharmacies to be surrendered .", "CARDINAL . In the face of the forced sales of these shares representing a very substantial amount of money , the legislation does not guarantee any particular form of compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected , without an examination on the merits , ORG \u2019s complaint alleging that the amendments brought about by the LAW amounted to a breach of constitutional rights . According to the decision , the complaint was inadmissible , partly because PERSON was not directly affected by the impugned provisions in that it could not possibly sustain a direct violation of any constitutional right in this context , and partly because the subject matter of the complaint was essentially the same as that of cases previously adjudicated by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , a number of new laws were enacted , which amended several health- and health - insurance - related Acts , amongst others , the PERSON .

The shares and the combined shares can be taken into consideration in respect of a maximum of CARDINAL pharmacies .", "CARDINAL . The requirements for a pharmacist to be entitled to run a pharmacy are regulated by the PERSON . As of DATE , a new element was included in the LAW , namely that such principal pharmacists must figure in a dedicated register and that , once registered , he or she exercises his or her operational rights independently .", "CARDINAL .
