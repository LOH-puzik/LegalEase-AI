ORG gave its decision on DATE . Upon appeals by ORG , ORG upheld it on DATE and ORG on DATE , the latter by means of a final and irrevocable decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before all the courts that dealt with the case , ORG argued that certificate no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE , used by the applicant in order to prove her ownership title , was false as it contained a series of irregularities .", "CARDINAL . The first - instance court and the appeal court rejected the argument on the ground that the defendant had not brought evidence to prove the allegations . Moreover , the courts noted that , according to the information in their possession , no criminal proceedings had been started on the matter .", "CARDINAL . The court of last resort rejected ORG request that the proceedings be stayed until the courts had ruled on the nullity of the certificate ( procedure described at CARDINAL below ) . On the merits , it noted as follows :", "\u201c The [ defendant \u2019s ] allegations about the existence of irregularities in certificate no . DATE of CARDINAL DATE ... seem well - founded . However , this certificate established a prima facie case [ \u00eenceput de prob\u0103 scris\u0103 ] which entitled the firstinstance court to examine additional evidence ; witness testimonies confirmed that the property title in dispute had been transferred from the ORG to ORG , who exercised public and peaceful possession without causing any nuisance ...

On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s ownership title was recorded in the land register .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG lodged with ORG an action against the applicant , seeking that the CARDINAL DATE certificate above be set aside because it contained irregularities .
