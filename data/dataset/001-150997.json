FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 - Right not to be tried or punished twice-{general} (Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 - Right not to be tried or punished twice)", "JUDGES": "Guido Raimondi;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;P\u00e4ivi Hirvel\u00e4;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the applicant \u2019s CARDINAL companies were subject to a tax inspection . The tax inspection was concluded with a final report on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the tax authorities imposed on the applicant additional taxes as well as tax surcharges ( veronkorotus , skattef\u00f6rh\u00f6jning ) for DATE as he had , inter alia , received disguised dividends from the companies . The amount of tax surcharges varied MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant sought rectification from ORG ( verotuksen oikaisulautakunta , pr\u00f6vningsn\u00e4mnden i beskattnings\u00e4renden ) , requesting it to quash the decisions of DATE and DATE concerning DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant lodged a material appeal ( perustevalitus , grundbesv\u00e4r ) with ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) in respect of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s applications for rectification concerning DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed against the rectification decisions of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , requesting that the taxation decisions concerning DATE and DATE be quashed and the tax surcharges be withdrawn . He referred to the ne bis in idem principle and claimed that the taxation decisions violated that principle .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG cancelled some of the tax surcharges in respect of tax DATE and quashed the relevant tax decisions . For the rest , it rejected the applicant \u2019s appeals . The court found that there was no impediment to imposing taxes on disguised dividends even if there was already a final criminal judgment in this respect , because imposing taxes on disguised dividends was not considered criminal . There could thus be no question of double jeopardy in this respect . The taxation decisions for DATE and DATE were thus upheld . As far as the tax surcharges and the right to impose additional taxes were concerned , the court found that the tax surcharges and the charges on tax fraud concerned the same matter . The tax surcharges thus related to acts in respect of which the applicant had already been convicted or acquitted . As both matters were pending simultaneously and not consecutively , there was no impediment to continuing the taxation proceedings . Even if the criminal proceedings became final while the taxation proceedings were still pending , this did not prevent the continuation of the taxation proceedings . There was thus no reason to change the tax surcharges as far as the corresponding criminal charges had been dismissed , namely , in respect of the disguised dividends received during DATE and DATE . As far as the proceedings led to both criminal conviction and imposition of tax surcharges , the situation was contrary to LAW and the tax surcharges were therefore cancelled in respect of tax DATE . The decision was not unanimous .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE , the applicant appealed against the ORG decision to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG . He argued that his acquittal prevented the further examination of the same matter in taxation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal but granted ORG ( veroasiamies , skatteombudet ) leave to appeal . It quashed ORG decision regarding cancellation of the tax surcharges and upheld the lower court \u2019s decisions . The court found that it had , in its decision of DATE , examined the scope of the ne bis in idem principle and the ORG \u2019s case - law in this respect . In the present case the charges and the tax surcharges concerned essentially the same matter . However , the ne bis in idem principle was applicable only when the first set of proceedings had become final before the second set of proceedings started . In the present case the proceedings had been simultaneous . Tax surcharges could thus be imposed on the applicant even if the criminal proceedings against him had already become final . ORG decision thus needed to be quashed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant , inter alia , for aggravated tax fraud ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 veropetos , grovt skattebedr\u00e4geri ) concerning DATE . According to the charges , the applicant was accused of aggravated tax fraud as he had avoided taxes . The tax authorities joined the charges and presented a compensation claim totalling EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL plus interest , which was the amount of avoided taxes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicant of aggravated tax fraud , and sentenced him to a suspended prison sentence of DATE . He was ordered to pay the tax authorities ORG plus interest in compensation for the avoided taxes . The court found that the applicant had avoided taxes during DATE but dismissed the charges as far as they concerned the disguised dividends , for lack of proof .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , requesting that the charges of aggravated tax fraud be dismissed as tax surcharges had already been imposed in the matter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the ORG judgment . It found that possible tax surcharges imposed on the applicant did not prevent him from being convicted of tax fraud and sentenced .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , ORG granted the applicant leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment . It found that the charges of aggravated tax fraud undisputedly concerned the same failure to declare income for which tax surcharges had been imposed for DATE . The court found that the fact that taxation proceedings became final while criminal proceedings were still pending did not prevent the examination of the charges being continued . In the present case , the charges had been brought before the time - limit for lodging an application for rectification had run out . The tax surcharges in respect of DATE were thus all still pending before ORG . As the charges had been brought while the taxation proceedings had not yet become final , there was no impediment to examining the charges of aggravated tax fraud . This judgment was published ( ORG ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P7"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P7-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
