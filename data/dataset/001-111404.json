A court may appoint an advocate to represent a defendant whose place of residence is not known ( LAW . LAW ( Law no .

NORP Parties to the case must be notified of the time and place of court hearings ( LAW ORG and LAW ORG ) .

A court may hold a session outside the court - house if , for instance , it is necessary to examine evidence which can not be brought to the court - house ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the old ORG and ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The Penitentiary Code provides that convicted persons may be transferred from a correctional colony to an investigative unit if their participation is required as witnesses , victims or suspects in connection with certain investigative measures ( Article CARDINAL ) . The Code does not mention any possibility for a convicted person to take part in civil proceedings , whether as a plaintiff or a defendant .", "CARDINAL . On several occasions ORG has examined complaints by convicted persons whose requests for leave to appear in civil proceedings have been refused by courts . It has consistently declared those complaints inadmissible , finding that the contested provisions of LAW and LAW do not , as such , restrict the convicted person \u2019s access to court . It has emphasised nonetheless that the convicted person should be able to make submissions to the civil court , either through a representative or in any other way provided by law . If necessary , the hearing may be held at the location where the convicted person is serving his sentence , or the court hearing the case may instruct the court with territorial jurisdiction over the correctional colony to obtain the applicant \u2019s submissions or to take any other procedural steps ( decisions CARDINAL of DATE , CARDINAL of DATE , and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL .

The federal or regional treasury shall also be liable for damage sustained by an individual as part of the administration of justice , provided that the judge \u2019s guilt has been established in a final criminal conviction ( LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . By a ruling of DATE , ORG provided an interpretation of Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW . It held that a judge \u2019s criminal conviction was a necessary element of a claim for damages on account of an unlawful judicial decision issued by that judge in the context of civil proceedings . It reasoned as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL ... This special precondition for State liability for damage caused as part of the administration of justice is justified by the criteria for the activities of the judiciary , established by LAW and detailed in the legal provisions on [ civil ] procedure ( including adversarial proceedings , wide margin of appreciation of the judges , and so on ) , and by the existence of a special procedure for review of judicial decisions . Review of judicial decisions , that is assessment of their lawfulness and justification , must be carried out through special procedures established by law : appeal , cassation and supervisory review proceedings . Review of a judicial decision in separate tort proceedings would have amounted to an additional review of its lawfulness and justification ...", "This is unacceptable ... because it would have led to a situation where a party to judicial proceedings which considers that it has been a victim of unlawful actions by a judge would have recourse not only to appeal proceedings , but also to a tort action , and the judges would have had to prove each time absence of fault on their part . This would have undermined the existing system of review of judicial decisions by higher courts , which is intrinsic to the judiciary and is established by law .", "CARDINAL . Administration of justice is a special type of ORG power . When applying a general legal rule to the circumstances of a given case , a judge provides an interpretation of the rule , takes a decision within the scope of his ( at times wide ) margin of appreciation provided by the law and , often , assesses the circumstances without the benefit of sufficient information ( sometimes concealed from him ) ...", "Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL not only excludes a presumption of fault on the [ judge \u2019s ] part , but also requires the establishment of the judge \u2019s guilt in a criminal judgment as an additional condition of ORG liability . Thus , Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL links State liability to a criminal act by a judge , which is premeditated ( pronouncement of a deliberately unlawful conviction , judgment or another decision , an offence under LAW of GPE ) or negligent ( improper exercise of his powers by a judge as a result of a negligent or careless attitude to his duties , which results in a substantial breach of ORG rights or legitimate interests , an offence under LAW of GPE ) .", "It follows from Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , taken together with its LAW and the above - mentioned and other provisions of LAW on the basis of which a judge may be held criminally liable , that the ORG is liable for damage in all cases where it has been caused by a criminal act committed by a judge as part of judicial proceedings .", "The specific nature of the disputed provision which provided for an exception to the general rules governing compensation for damage warrants a conclusion that the term \u201c administration of justice \u201d does not cover judicial proceedings in their entirety , but only extends to judicial acts touching upon the merits of a case ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further held that other judicial acts , mainly those of a procedural nature , fell outside the scope of the notion of \u201c administration of justice \u201d . State liability for damage caused by such procedural acts or failures to act , such as a breach of the reasonable length of court proceedings , could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge , if the fault of the judge has been established in civil proceedings . An individual should be able to obtain compensation for any damage incurred through a violation by a court of his or her right to a fair trial within the meaning of LAW . ORG held that ORG should legislate on the grounds and procedure for compensation by the ORG for damage caused by unlawful acts or failures to act on the part of a court or a judge in such cases , and should determine territorial and subject - matter jurisdiction over such claims ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
