The first phase of the partition proceedings consists of a court interim decision which determines the identity of the joint owners , the object to be partitioned and the corresponding parts belonging to each owner . In the second phase of the partition proceedings , the court determines the value of the various objects to be partitioned , after having received a prior opinion of experts . Any inequality in the value of the objects included in the shares is to be compensated in money .
