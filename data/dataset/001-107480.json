CARDINAL the Grand Chamber of the ORG found that both GPE and GPE responsibility was engaged with regard to the acts complained of and held that there had been violations of various Articles of the Convention ( see below , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In the first place , the ORG found that ORG was the only legitimate government of GPE under international law , but that it did not exercise authority over that part of its territory that was under the effective control of the \u201c GPE ( FAC ) . Nevertheless , in the ORG \u2019s opinion , ORG were under a positive obligation under LAW to take the diplomatic , economic , judicial or other measures that were in their power to take and that were in accordance with international law to secure to the applicants the rights guaranteed by ORG , ORG and PERSON v.

When faced with a partial or total failure to act , the ORG \u2019s task was to determine to what extent a minimum effort was nevertheless possible and whether it should have been made . Determining that question was especially necessary in cases concerning an alleged infringement of absolute rights such as those guaranteed by ORG and CARDINAL of the Convention ( ibid . \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG noted that until DATE , the GPE authorities had taken various measures aimed at obtaining the applicants\u2019 release and that as a result , Mr PERSON was released in DATE . It considered that even after Mr PERSON \u2019s release in DATE , it was within the power of ORG to take measures to secure to the applicants their rights under LAW . It further noted that the negotiations for a settlement of the situation in GPE , in which GPE was acting as a guarantor ORG , had been on - going since DATE without any mention of the applicants or without any measure being taken or considered by the GPE authorities to secure the applicants their Convention rights , although it was within the power of ORG to take such measures ( ibid . , \u00a7 PERSON CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "The ORG therefore held that GPE \u2019s responsibility was capable of being engaged under the Convention on account of its failure to discharge its positive obligations with regard to the acts complained of which occurred after DATE ( ibid . , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .
