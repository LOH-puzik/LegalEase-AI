GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Andr\u00e9 Potocki;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant , ORG , ( \u201c the applicant company \u201d ) , is a stock company based in GPE . It currently operates under the name Tipp CARDINAL ORG . The applicant company was represented before the ORG by Mr T. ORG and Mr PERSON , both lawyers practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In GPE , jurisdiction over gambling is divided between ORG and the L\u00e4nder . In most of the L\u00e4nder , there is a regional monopoly on the organisation of sports betting and lottery games , while the organisation of betting on horseracing and the operation of gaming machines and casinos are entrusted to duly authorised private operators . By way of LAW on lottery games ( Staatsvertrag zum Lotteriewesen in GPE ) , which entered into force on DATE , the ORG created a uniform framework for the organisation , operation and commercial presence of games of chance . Under this treaty , the professional intermediation of lottery games was lawful without special licensing , so long as retailers complied with certain conditions .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE ( CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) the German ORG held that the regional monopoly on sports betting in the Land of Bavaria infringed LAW , which guaranteed freedom of occupation . The court held in particular that , by excluding private operators from the activity of organising betting , without at the same time providing a regulatory framework capable of ensuring the effective pursuit of the aims of reducing the passion for games of chance and combating gambling addiction , the monopoly had a disproportionately adverse effect on the right to freedom of occupation .", "CARDINAL . A majority of the NORP L\u00e4nder later concluded LAW on games of chance ( ORG \u2012 \u201c the LAW \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which established a new uniform framework for their organisation , operation and intermediation . LAW was ratified in the L\u00e4nder of GPE and GPE on DATE and entered into force on DATE , subject to certain transitional provisions . It subjected the organisation and intermediation of games of chance to a licensing system whereby licences could be issued by separate ORG and were limited to the territory of the respective Land . Furthermore , LAW prohibited outright the online organisation , intermediation , and advertising of public games of chance .", "CARDINAL . From DATE , the applicant company operated an Internet platform which allowed the placing of bets with lottery operators run by ORG . This intermediation was operated on a contractual basis with the lottery operators , who paid a commission to the applicant company . The applicant company held PERCENT of the overall market share in this area . By DATE , it had CARDINAL registered customers .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before the entry into force of LAW , the applicant company requested the ORG authorities to grant it permission to continue its professional activity under LAW of LAW for a transitional period of DATE . Only the L\u00e4nder of GPE and ORG granted such permission . Accordingly , the applicant company continued its activity in these ORG until DATE . Following that date , the applicant company ceased all its activities relating to the intermediation of the ORG - run lottery . Instead , it continued to use its Internet platform for hosting so - called \u201c ability games \u201d , which , however , attracted significantly fewer customers .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company lodged a constitutional complaint against a number of provisions of LAW as implemented by the laws of the L\u00e4nder of GPE and GPE . The applicant company alleged , in particular , that the prohibition on online organisation and intermediation of public games of chance set out in LAW violated its right to freedom of occupation under LAW . It further complained of a violation of its property rights , and of its rights to freedom of expression and equal treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting as a CARDINAL - judge panel , refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication . The court observed that LAW restricted and ( as from DATE ) prohibited outright the online intermediation of public games of chance , and thus the carrying out of a professional activity which had until then been exercised by the applicant company in a lawful way . Furthermore , LAW , by subjecting the organisation of public games to ORG licensing , restricted the applicant company \u2019s right to carry out a specific professional activity . These provisions were closely linked to LAW , which provided that licences were issued by the ORG authorities and were limited to the territory of the respective Land . ORG concluded that these provisions interfered with the applicant company \u2019s freedom to provide services . The same applied to the provisions relating to advertising and to its prohibition on television , the Internet and via other means of telecommunication . Conversely , the applicant company \u2019s complaint did not come within the scope of the right to protection of property ( LAW , as that right only applied in case of interference with the use of acquired property , but not in cases concerning interference with specific professional activities .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that the provisions at issue were sufficiently precise and complied with the distribution of powers within ORG . Furthermore , they respected the principle of proportionality . In this connection , the court noted that the provisions primarily pursued the aim of protecting the population , and in particular minors , from the dangers of dependency on games and gambling - related crime . The court considered that these were important aims serving the public interest , which were capable of justifying objective restrictions on the freedom to carry out a specific professional activity .", "CARDINAL . The court further considered that gambling dependency could entail serious consequences not only for the person concerned , but also for his or her family and the wider community . It was true that certain types of games of chance were more likely to cause dependency than others , and that the lottery games intermediated by the applicant company were less likely to cause problematic or even pathological gambling behaviour than , for example , gaming machines and casino games . However , this did not call into question the legitimacy of the aims pursued .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court considered that the legislature enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation when it came to making a prognosis on dangers to be averted from the public . This margin of appreciation was only exceeded if the legislature \u2019s considerations were obviously erroneous to such a degree that they could not serve as a basis for the legislative measure in issue . Against this yardstick , ORG did not find reason to object to the legislature \u2019s considerations . It noted that these considerations were supported by scientific research carried out by ORG , from which it could be concluded that lottery games could lead to the development of symptoms of addiction .", "CARDINAL . The court further held that the provisions were suitable for achieving the aim pursued . The prohibition on and special licensing of the organisation of games of chance created a channelling effect leading to a restriction on which games were offered and enhanced the transparency of the betting industry . In particular , the licensing system allowed the ORG authorities to directly influence the number of persons actively working in the betting industry . The restrictions on advertising also pursued the aim of preventing dependency and protecting minors .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court considered that the prohibition on the online organisation and intermediation of public games of chance was intended to curtail problematic forms of participation in such games . Online gambling was characterised by a high degree of convenience and unrestricted availability of the games in question . The high degree of abstraction from traditional ways of gambling could cause a player to lose perspective and , in particular , ignore the possibility of losing stakes . By cutting off the option of online gambling , participation became more difficult and the individual player was made more aware of the process of the game , which could prevent him or her from drifting off into problematic behaviour . Furthermore , there remained doubts as to whether the requirements of protecting minors could be effectively implemented on the Internet .", "CARDINAL . As regards the proportionality of the interference , the court further held that the ORG stayed within their margin of appreciation . It was , in particular , acceptable to ban any form of online advertising , as the ORG - run games of chance were exclusively devised to channel the natural play instinct , but they should not turn into a branch of the national economy . Lastly , the court held that there was no indication that any of the other basic rights relied upon by the applicant company had been violated .", "CARDINAL . NORP The decision was served on the applicant company \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , a new LAW amending LAW entered into force . Under LAW , the ORG may allow the organisation and intermediation of public games of chance on the Internet , provided specific prerequisites are met . The operator must , in particular , ensure the effective exclusion of minors or prohibited players . Furthermore , stakes must , as a rule , not exceed LAW per player and DATE ; particular incitements to dependency by rapid draws are prohibited ; a programme of social measures adapted to the specific conditions of the internet have to be established and operated and bets and lotteries must not be offered via the same Internet domain . Advertising for public games of chance on television , on the Internet and via means of telecommunication remains , as a rule , prohibited , but the ORG may allow advertising for lotteries and horse- and sports bets on the Internet and on television in accordance with the principles laid down in LAW .", "CARDINAL .

NORP establishment and operation of a programme of social measures adapted to the specific conditions of the Internet , the effectiveness of which is to be assessed scientifically . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG of ORG ( CJEU ) issued several judgments relating to the compatibility of the rules on sports betting with ORG ( GPE ) PERSON ( case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , Winner PERSON ; joined cases ORG , C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL to C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL and ORG , PERSON and Others v. Wetterauskreis and Others ; and C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG v. ORG and Others ) . The ORG found that the NORP rules did not regulate games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . In such circumstances , the objective of preventing incitement to squander money on gambling and combating addiction to the latter could no longer be effectively pursued by public monopoly , so that the latter could no longer be justified having regard to Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services ; see PERSON and Others , ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In its judgment in the case of ORG ( ibid . , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , the ORG , in addition , answered the question as to whether a prohibition such as that set out in LAW ( referred to below as \u201c the Gl\u00fcStV \u201d ) could be regarded as suitable for pursuing the objectives of combating the risk of dependency on games of chance and protecting minors from the betting industry as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Concerning , first , the prohibition on the organisation and intermediation of games of chance on the internet , it should be noted that the referring court has confined itself to casting doubt on the conformity of that prohibition with ORG law in the very general terms which have just been referred to in paragraph CARDINAL of this judgment .", "CARDINAL . Since the referring court has not been more specific about the nature of the doubts which it has in that regard , merely referring to positions which the ORG is said to have adopted in a reasoned opinion addressed to GPE following notification by the latter of the draft of the Gl\u00fcStV [ ORG , see \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE , above ] , without however explaining them in any way , the ORG will limit its examination to the question whether a measure prohibiting offers of games of chance on the internet such as that contained in [ LAW ) of the Gl\u00fcStV may , in principle , be regarded as suitable for achieving the objectives of preventing incitement to squander money on gambling , combating gambling addiction , and protecting young people .", "CARDINAL . In that regard , it should be noted as a preliminary observation that the ORG has previously acknowledged that a measure prohibiting , purely and simply , the practice of a form of gambling on the territory of a Member ORG , in that case lotteries , is capable of being justified by such overriding reasons in the public interest ( see PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . In the main proceedings , the prohibition in dispute concerns not the marketing of a particular type of gambling , but a channel through which games of chance may be offered , namely the internet .", "CARDINAL . The Court has already had occasion to emphasise the particularities concerned with the offering of games of chance on the internet ( see ORG Profissional and ORG , paragraph DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . has thus observed in particular that , because of the lack of direct contact between consumer and operator , games of chance accessible via the internet involve different and more substantial risks of fraud by operators against consumers compared with the traditional markets for such games ( ORG Profissional and ORG , paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It should be noted that , in the same way , the characteristics specific to the offer of games of chance by the internet may prove to be a source of risks of a different kind and a greater order in the area of consumer protection , particularly in relation to young persons and those with a propensity for gambling or likely to develop such a propensity , in comparison with traditional markets for such games . Apart from the lack of direct contact between the consumer and the operator , previously referred to , the particular ease and the permanence of access to games offered over the internet and the potentially high volume and frequency of such an international offer , in an environment which is moreover characterised by isolation of the player , anonymity and an absence of social control , constitute so many factors likely to foster the development of gambling addiction and the related squandering of money , and thus likely to increase the negative social and moral consequences attaching thereto , as underlined by consistent case - law .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , it should be noted that , having regard to the discretion which Member GPE enjoy in determining the level of protection of consumers and the social order in the gaming sector , it is not necessary , with regard to the criterion of proportionality , that a restrictive measure decreed by the authorities of CARDINAL Member ORG should correspond to a view shared by all the Member GPE concerning the means of protecting the legitimate interest at issue ( see , by analogy , ORG GPE [ DATE ] ECR I-CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the whole of the above , it must be acknowledged that a prohibition measure covering any offer of games of chance via the internet may , in principle , be regarded as suitable for pursuing the legitimate objectives of preventing incitement to squander money on gambling , combating addiction to the latter and protecting young persons , even though the offer of such games remains authorised through more traditional channels .", "CARDINAL . Secondly , concerning the establishment of a transitional period such as that at issue in the main proceedings , it needs in particular to be verified whether the latter might not undermine the consistency of the legislation concerned by leading to a result contrary to the objective pursued .", "CARDINAL . NORP In that respect , it should first be noted that the transitional measure at issue in the main proceedings applies only to lotteries , and not to other types of gambling .", "CARDINAL . Next , the explanations provided by the referring court show that that transitional measure is designed only to allow certain economic operators , who had hitherto legally offered lotteries via the internet in the Land concerned , to carry out a conversion of their business following the entry into force of the prohibition affecting their initial business , and that it is limited in duration to DATE , which can not be regarded as unreasonable in the said perspective .", "CARDINAL . Finally , it should also be emphasised , first , that , according to [ Article ] CARDINAL ) of the Gl\u00fcStV and [ LAW , during the said transitional period , the operators concerned are obliged to comply with a series of conditions concerning the exclusion of minors and prohibited players , the limitation of stakes , the rules for and the frequency of the offer of games and the implementation of social measures , and , secondly , that ORG has stated before the ORG that the benefit of that transitional measure was to be available , without discrimination , to all lottery operators who might be concerned .", "CARDINAL . It does not therefore appear that such a transitional period , in appearance justified by considerations of legal certainty ( see , by analogy , Case C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL ASM GPE [ CARDINAL ] ECR I\u2011CARDINAL , paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL ) , is likely to affect the consistency of the measure prohibiting the offer of gambling on the internet and its suitability for achieving the objectives which it pursues ( see , by analogy , in relation to a temporary exception from a prohibition on the operation of pharmacies by non - pharmacists , Joined Cases C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL and C-CARDINAL/CARDINAL Apothekerkammer des Saarlandes and Others [ DATE ] ORG , paragraphs CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to all the foregoing , the answer to the fourth question is that , on a proper interpretation of Article CARDINAL ORG , national legislation prohibiting the organisation and intermediation of games of chance on the internet for the purposes of preventing the squandering of money on gambling , combating addiction to the latter and protecting young persons may , in principle , be regarded as suitable for pursuing such legitimate objectives , even if the offer of such games remains authorised through more traditional channels . The fact that such a prohibition is accompanied by a transitional measure such as that at issue in the main proceedings is not capable of depriving the said prohibition of that suitability . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
