Whether it reached the police of Feodosiya I am not sure , but as far as I understood it [ did ] .", "In order to execute the request , [ officer ] Go . and I set off for ORG in possession of a copy of the international request .", "Having arrived in ORG , we contacted ORG and asked them to be present during the search and other activities within the framework of the request . On DATE we attended the search at [ the applicant \u2019s ] place of residence . The search of [ the applicant \u2019s ] apartment was conducted by the [ Feodosiya ] police officers and they drew up a record in this respect . Go . and I were present at the search , but did not actively participate in it . After the search [ the applicant ] was invited by the [ Feodosiya ] police officers to the premises of ORG for questioning .", "I was informed by one of the [ Feodosiya ] police officers that [ the applicant ] refused to answer any questions concerning the matter . No documents were given either to me or to Go . We were only given a copy of the search record .", "I knew that we had no right to carry out any operative search activities on the territory of GPE , and therefore we did not personally participate in the verbal exchanges with [ the applicant ] .

At once we set off for the sales office and , since very few tickets were sold , managed to buy tickets for seats close to [ the applicant ] so as to be able to observe him . The plane was not full , since few people were flying to GPE . We did not show any interest or attention towards [ the applicant ] . I do n\u2019t know whether [ the applicant ] recognised us . In any event , had he had any concerns , he could have expressed them to the officers [ of the law enforcement agencies in the airport ] . [ The applicant ] did not do this , from which I deduce that he was not aware of either me or Go . , nor had he recognised [ us ] , and he expected to go into hiding in GPE .", "We knew about the investigator \u2019s decision to arrest [ the applicant ] because he had no place of residence in GPE . Upon his arrival in GPE , we decided to arrest [ the applicant ] and bring him [ to the police station of LOC ] for investigative actions ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator from the ORG \u2019s office questioned officer Go . in connection with the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s arrest in GPE . Go . repeated word for word the statements given earlier by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE an investigator from the ORG \u2019s office rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint on the grounds that the applicant had travelled to GPE of his own free will and had been detained on arrival in accordance with domestic law . The prosecutor relied principally on the evidence given by the CARDINAL NORP police officers , who explained that they had happened by mere chance to be on the same plane to GPE as the applicant . They denied that they had taken an active part in the events in GPE and stated that the applicant had been released after the search and had then bought a plane ticket to GPE on his own . The officers had been tipped off by an undisclosed source within the NORP police and had managed to buy tickets for the same flight , \u201c sitting not very far from the applicant \u2019s seat \u201d . On arrival in GPE the officers arrested the applicant in the airport terminal and took him to the investigating authorities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator from the ORG \u2019s office questioned the applicant in connection with the circumstances of his arrest in GPE . The applicant stated :", "\u201c ... I was arrested on DATE in the town of ORG , in LOC . The arrest was carried out by QUANTITY police officers from the Feodosiya Town Police and QUANTITY other police officers , who I later learned were from GPE . Once the policemen had identified me I was handcuffed . Thereafter they conducted a search of my home . I was shown a search warrant signed by the Prosecutor from ORG of GPE but no other documents were provided . After the search I was brought to the police station in ORG . I was not shown any documents justifying my arrest . I was refused a phone call . After that I was transported to hotel \u201c Sailor \u201d in Feodosiya where the policemen from GPE were staying and where I was handcuffed to a radiator . We spent TIME in the hotel but after that I was taken to the police station because the hotel manager objected to the presence of CARDINAL men in a room designed only for CARDINAL . The rest of the night I spent in an office belonging to the police , attached by handcuffs to the radiator . TIME the policemen from GPE took me to the passport office of ORG to collect my ORG card and thereafter we went by car to the airport . At the airport I was in the car with the policemen from ORG . The policemen bought a ticket in my name . Then we took flight CARDINAL from GPE to GPE . Before boarding we went through the customs and border control . As we were passing it , my handcuffs were removed and the policemen showed their licences to use special devices . Upon landing in GPE , the policemen and I did not go through the border and customs control , but went out through [ a special ] exit . Thereafter I was put in a car and brought to the [ police station ] of LOC of GPE ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , in response to further complaints by the applicant , the prosecutor reiterated his earlier findings .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG of the city of GPE confirmed the prosecutor \u2019s decision to dispense with criminal proceedings in respect of the allegedly unlawful arrest , search and detention . Among other things , the court referred to LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG quashed this judgment on DATE on the grounds that the questions of the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s arrest and the search of his apartment were inextricably linked to the merits of the applicant \u2019s criminal case and could not be decided before the trial court judgment .", "CARDINAL . The case was remitted for fresh examination at first instance and on DATE the ORG of GPE rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . This judgment was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant subsequently tried to institute court proceedings in respect of the same questions before the domestic courts . By a judgment of DATE , given in the applicant \u2019s absence , ORG of GPE rejected these arguments . The court held , in particular , that :", "\u201c ... as is apparent from the case file , [ the applicant ] was arrested by the [ police officers ] Go . and PERSON . on DATE at PERSON airport as ordered by the investigator in his decision of DATE ...", "When questioned in this connection , Go . and PERSON . stated that they did not arrest [ the applicant ] in GPE and did not take any part in the search of his apartment , but were simply in attendance .", "According to the search record of DATE , the search was carried out in [ the applicant \u2019s ] apartment in ORG by the local police and the request to carry it out had been made to the ORG prosecutor by the prosecutor of ORG of GPE .", "The order to execute the request is defined by the party to which the request is addressed . In accordance with LAW of RSFSR and LAW , the said norms applied only on the territory of RSFSR but they did not contain any rules preventing [ investigation and operative ] activities on the territory of another state . The [ GPE ] Convention sets out the possibility of legal assistance and does not contain a ban on procedural actions on the territory of ORG , recognising the lawfulness of such actions if they are authorised by the law of the party to which the request was addressed ( LAW ) . According to part CARDINAL of LAW , the presence of officers acting for the requesting party during such actions is possible .", "In the view of the above , the court considers that the search was carried out fully and properly . In the present case the prosecutor \u2019s office was only competent to assess the events which took place on the territory of GPE , as the norms of the code of criminal procedure of RSFSR only applied there , and any decision concerning events which took place on the territory on GPE could only be taken by the competent body in GPE and the corresponding investigation could only be initiated upon a request from the party to which the request was addressed , that is to say GPE . However , no such request was ever made , and , as is apparent from the letter from the ORG prosecutor , the request to bring a criminal case in this connection had been refused ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he received only a copy of the judgment on CARDINAL DATE and tried to appeal against it on DATE . His request for restoration of the time - limits for appeal , submitted on DATE , was refused by ORG of GPE on DATE for the applicant \u2019s failure to justify the filing of the appeal outside of the CARDINAL days\u2019 statutory time - limit . ORG upheld the decision of DATE on CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . After the ORG had communicated the case to ORG on DATE , police officers PERSON . and Go . wrote explanatory reports to their superiors dated DATE concerning the events of CARDINAL and DATE , with the following content :", "\u201c ...

At TIME on DATE an investigator from ORG in GPE drew up a report on the applicant \u2019s arrest , having ascertained that the applicant was wanted on suspicion of murder . The report noted that the applicant had the status of an accused in the case and confirmed that he had been notified of his rights .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant \u2019s detention was first authorised by a decision of DATE taken by ORG office in GPE . The decision stated that the applicant had been detained on DATE . It further referred to the gravity of the charge against him , the risk of his fleeing or interfering with the course of the investigation , and the fact that he had no permanent residence in the GPE region . The decision neither specified the term of the applicant \u2019s detention nor commented on the lawfulness of his arrest in GPE , his transfer to GPE and his subsequent detention in custody by the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The detention was subsequently extended by order of the prosecutor on DATE . The order described the course of the investigation into the case and mentioned the progress achieved so far . More specifically , the investigation identified and located Sm . and PERSON . , CARDINAL other persons allegedly directly implicated in the murder of the businessman in question . It also included a number of expert examinations , a forensic examination of the body of the businessman , CARDINAL ballistic examinations and a dactylographic examination . The investigator had mentioned that he still needed to study the network of the applicant \u2019s and PERSON . \u2019s connections and to bring new versions of charges against the applicant , as well as against PERSON . and PERSON . The order extended the applicant \u2019s detention until DATE .", "CARDINAL . By order of DATE the applicant \u2019s detention was extended until DATE . It was based on the same reasoning as the detention order of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution concluded the investigation and remitted the case for examination on the merits . It does not appear that there was any procedural decision authorising the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG conducted a preliminary examination of the applicant \u2019s case and , without examining the question of the lawfulness of his detention DATE , further remanded the applicant in custody . No time - limit was indicated .", "CARDINAL . Thereafter the court again extended the applicant \u2019s detention on DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE as well as on DATE , without specifying any time - limit for his detention . All these decisions were taken with reference to the gravity of the charge against the applicant and the fact that the proceedings in the case had not been completed .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his counsel were not invited to attend the hearing of DATE .", "CARDINAL . It does not appear that the applicant lodged any complaint about the repeated extension of his detention by the prosecutor or by the court prior to the decision of CARDINAL July CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s complaints of CARDINAL and DATE against that decision were rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , he and his counsel were not invited to attend the hearing of DATE . However , the ORG submitted that the applicant and his counsel had been informed about the hearing of CARDINAL DATE on DATE . The applicant \u2019s counsel had not given the appeal court any reasons for her failure to appear , and did not ask for the hearing to be postponed . At the same time , the applicant \u2019s request to attend in person remained unexamined .", "CARDINAL . It appears that on DATE and DATE the trial court extended the applicant \u2019s detention once again . The applicant submits that he challenged these decisions on DATE and DATE respectively but received no reply .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , the applicant \u2019s appeals against the decision of DATE were dated DATE and CARDINAL DATE , whilst the decision of DATE was appealed against on DATE .
