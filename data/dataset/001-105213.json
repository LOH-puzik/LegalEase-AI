The first applicant , who is the second applicant \u2019s nephew , also has NORP citizenship . They are represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON and PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the public prosecutor filed an indictment with ORG ( \u201c the trial court \u201d ) charging the applicants and PERSON , PERSON and Mr ORG with drug trafficking . According to the indictment , on DATE the first applicant and PERSON had bought QUANTITY of heroin from a certain Mr Dz . N. in GPE , GPE . After the drugs had entered the respondent ORG , they had been handed over to Mr R.A. so that he could take them to GPE . On DATE the applicants , together with PERSON , had arrived at a car park near FAC . Mr GPE and Mr ORG had also arrived and had loaded the drugs into Mr ORG \u2019s truck . CARDINAL cakes of heroin had been stored in the spare tyre and CARDINAL cakes had been put in a special compartment in the front of the truck . The charges were based , inter alia , on an expert opinion of DATE , CARDINAL search reports , CARDINAL certificates for temporarily seized objects , and a list of passengers ( \u201c the list \u201d ) indicating the names of the first applicant and Mr PERSON as having travelled in a bus from GPE to GPE on CARDINAL and DATE . The list had been sent by border police on DATE to ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) , as was the case with a special report , no.CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL - CARDINAL of DATE , produced by ORG . According to the latter , on DATE ORG had requested ( request no.CARDINAL.CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , and the public prosecutor had ordered , an audio - visual recording of the car park . The recording had been made on that date between TIME and TIME CARDINAL digital video cameras and CARDINAL digital photo camera had been used .", "In the proceedings before ORG , the Government submitted a copy of the ORG \u2019s request ORG - CARDINAL of DATE , according to which ORG had requested that the public prosecutor authorise the audio - visual surveillance because it believed that a significant quantity of heroin was to be trafficked and prepared for transportation outside the respondent ORG . For that purpose , unidentified persons had been expected to arrive at the car park in a vehicle with NORP car plates and meet with other unidentified persons . They also submitted another report by ORG dated DATE ( report no.CARDINAL.CARDINAL - CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , according to which the total duration of the video of the car park recorded with both cameras was TIME and TIME . This report was admitted in evidence in the domestic proceedings . They also submitted a copy of the search report of the truck dated DATE . That search had been ordered by an investigating judge and had been attended by PERSON ORG and CARDINAL witnesses .", "At a hearing on DATE , the first applicant stated that he had not met PERSON in GPE , as alleged by the prosecution , but rather on the bus while travelling to the respondent State . He had never met him before then . On that occasion , they had discussed the possibility of trading coffee machines . For that reason , he had gone to GPE with the second applicant , who was a taxi driver . He had not told the second applicant the reason for , or the duration , of his stay in GPE .", "The second applicant stated that he had gone to GPE at the request of the first applicant so that the first applicant could discuss business matters with a third person . The first applicant had told him that their stay would be short , a DATE or CARDINAL . He denied that he had known Mr GPE and Mr P.G.", "Mr ORG stated that he had not known , and had never seen , the applicants before .", "On DATE the trial court found the defendants guilty and sentenced them to a prison term . The second applicant received the shortest sentence ( DATE imprisonment ) . All the other defendants , including the first applicant , were sentenced to DATE imprisonment . An expulsion order of indefinite duration ( \u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0448 ) was also issued against the applicants . PERSON and PERSON were convicted in absentia because they had escaped from the car park and had not been found since . The applicants had had no prior criminal records in the respondent ORG .", "The trial court found that the defendants had acted in concert , as described in the indictment . It established that on DATE the first applicant and PERSON , having bought the heroin from Dz . ORG , had arrived in the respondent ORG on a bus from GPE . The list supported that finding . The first applicant had continued on to GPE . On DATE the applicants had arrived in GPE . During their stay , they had met up with PERSON and Mr I.N. several times . Mr ORG had arrived in GPE with his truck . On DATE he had met up with Mr ORG at a previously determined place . As already agreed upon , all the defendants met at the car park near FAC , where Mr GPE and Mr ORG had loaded the drugs into the latter \u2019s truck , as described above . After Mr PERSON had left the scene , the remaining defendants had embraced each other and had left , satisfied with the job done . The applicants\u2019 car had been stopped by police upon leaving the city . These facts were established , inter alia , on the basis of a VHS tape of the video recording of the car park on DATE . In the proceedings before the ORG , the applicants submitted a copy of the ORG tape used in court . The total length of the video material recorded on the car park was TIME and TIME .", "The trial court rejected the applicants\u2019 denial that they had been involved in the crime . It further rejected their arguments that a purely visual recording without sound could not be relied upon to establish the facts : the court explained that it had been impracticable to obtain an audio recording .", "The applicants appealed against this decision , arguing that , inter alia , there had been no evidence supporting the trial court \u2019s opinion that the first applicant had bought the heroin in GPE and that the defendants had acted in concert . They stated that the visual recording , as the only evidence on which their conviction rested , had been incomplete and inaccurate . They further reiterated that there had been no audio recording , as required under section CARDINAL-b \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , which consequently made the recording inadmissible .", "At a public session held on DATE , ORG allowed the ORG appeal and quashed the trial court \u2019s decision , which it found to have been inconsistent and unreasoned . It also held that the video material had not been properly admitted in evidence .", "At the new trial , the applicants reiterated their objections concerning the credibility and probative value of the video material recorded on the ORG tape . In this connection , they argued that there had been time gaps and interruptions in the video and requested that the trial court admits the original video material in evidence . The court refused this request and said that there was no doubt that the video material recorded on the ORG tape was identical to the original video material recorded by the digital cameras . The applicants further argued that the recording had been unlawful because it had been authorised by the public prosecutor , instead of by an investigating judge , on the basis that the ORG had known the identity of the possible perpetrators ( see section LAW of LAW ) . In this connection the court allowed the GPE request and admitted the public prosecutor \u2019s order for the audio - visual recording of the car park ( order PERSON ) . According to the order , the recording would DATE and be stopped should the identities of the suspects be discovered . The court , however , refused to admit the ORG \u2019s request ORG - CARDINAL of DATE and said that it was irrelevant to the validity of the order .", "On DATE the trial court convicted the applicants of the same offence and imposed the same sentences and expulsion orders as before . Relying on the public prosecutor \u2019s order , the court rejected the applicants\u2019 arguments that the video material had been unlawfully obtained . Noting the lack of synchronisation between the video cameras used for the recording , the court stated that the time gaps and interruptions in the video material had not affected the credibility of the video evidence . It further referred to a discrepancy in the ORG statements given during the trial . It rejected their arguments that they had been in a restaurant with Mr PERSON at the time when the drugs had been loaded into the truck , as there had been no such place in the vicinity of the car park . Even if they had been in a restaurant , the nearest CARDINAL was located far away from the car park and would have required the applicants to walk for a considerable period of time , which the court found unreasonable given the weather conditions at the relevant time . Lastly , and for the reasons provided in its first decision , the court rejected the applicants\u2019 complaints regarding the absence of audio recording .", "The applicants appealed arguing that , inter alia , the trial court had refused to admit in evidence the original video material , which the applicants had sought to have admitted so that light could be shed on the doubts concerning its credibility . They also complained about the refusal to admit the ORG \u2019s request of DATE that prompted the public prosecutor \u2019s order , arguing that this was crucial for establishing the lawfulness of that evidence . The public prosecutor also appealed against the decision .", "At a public session on DATE , ORG allowed the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal and increased the applicants\u2019 sentence : the first applicant \u2019s sentence was increased to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and the second applicant \u2019s sentence was increased to DATE imprisonment . It dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal , finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and the reasoning given by the trial court . It stated that the trial court had examined the ORG tape and had confirmed its credibility by watching it and by describing the events as filmed .", "On DATE the applicants lodged an appeal with ORG on points of law ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430 ) , in which they reiterated their complaints that their conviction was based on inadmissible evidence namely , the ORG tape , whose credibility and lawfulness they challenged . They further complained that court transcripts in the case file had been modified after the trial and did not correspond to the copies in their possession .", "In a decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the ORG appeal and upheld the lower courts\u2019 decisions . It did not have jurisdiction to consider the complaints about the court transcripts and , otherwise it adhered to the reasons given in the lower courts\u2019 decisions of DATE and DATE respectively . The decision was served on the applicants on DATE .", "On DATE the applicants complained to ORG ( PERSON ) that modifications had been made to the transcripts . Having examined the case file and interviewed the trial judge , ORG , in a letter of DATE , informed the applicants that there had indeed been certain modifications , which had concerned only structure and not content . In the absence of any evidence , no responsibility for the amendments could be attached to the trial judge .", "As regards the modification of the transcripts , ORG of ORG , acting upon the ORG request , opened a file . No decision as to any prosecution has yet been taken .", "Under section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW , in respect of criminal offences subject to automatic prosecution by the ORG , the public prosecutor can order the use of a special investigative technique in pre - trial proceedings under the conditions and in the way specified by law .", "Section CARDINAL-b of the LAW provides that special investigative techniques may be ordered where there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that certain criminal offences have been committed by , inter alia , an organised group . Secret surveillance and audio - visual recordings are among the permitted special investigative techniques ( section CARDINAL-b \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "Section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that information , documents and objects obtained by means of a special investigative measure may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings .", "Under section CARDINAL-d \u00a7 CARDINAL , at the pre - trial stage , the use of special investigative techniques may be ordered by an investigating judge in a reasoned written decision following a reasoned written request by the public prosecutor , or by the public prosecutor in a reasoned written decision following a reasoned written request by ORG , but only in respect of a person whose identity is unknown .", "Under section CARDINAL-e \u00a7 CARDINAL of the LAW , evidence obtained through special investigative techniques can not be used at trial if the techniques were applied without an order by an investigating judge or the public prosecutor or contrary to the LAW .", "Section CARDINAL-f \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW provide that , inter alia , the Ministry shall prepare , after the expiration of the period within which a special investigative technique was used , a report and shall submit it to the public prosecutor if the order for the technique used was issued by the latter ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
