NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP Government ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON of ORG . The applicant was represented by PERSON , lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at TIME the applicant was stopped by the police during a routine traffic check . He was arrested , as there was an arrest warrant pending against him in the context of criminal proceedings concerning , apparently , a minor case of fraud . During the arrest he informed the officers that he suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for which he took medication . He was taken to hospital for a check - up . The results confirmed that he suffered from the condition . The doctor examining him did not find it necessary to prescribe any medication .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was subsequently taken to a police station , where he spent TIME in a cell . He was given no medication . On DATE he was transferred to FAC .", "CARDINAL . His requests to be allowed to take painkillers were refused . He was told that he would be examined by the prison doctor and put in a cell .", "CARDINAL . On TIME , at TIME , the applicant fell off his bed and could not get up . The prison guard called by his cellmate did not enter the cell , but ordered him to help the applicant climb back onto the bed , which the cellmate did . Shortly afterwards the applicant fell off the bed again . He remained on the floor until TIME .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the applicant could not get up and had difficulty moving . He was taken to see the prison doctor , who diagnosed stroke . It was established that he suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and type CARDINAL diabetes . The applicant was then taken to a nearby hospital for treatment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had partial paralysis in CARDINAL of his arms and legs . On DATE he lodged a compensation claim with ORG . He claimed CARDINAL NORP zlotys ( ORG ) in respect of alleged pecuniary and non - pecuniary damage on account of the fact that he had been left permanently disabled as a result of the stroke , and ORG CARDINAL as reimbursement of his treatment costs . The applicant argued that the conduct of the prison authorities after his arrest on DATE had caused his health to deteriorate and left him unable to work . He referred to the refusal of the prison guards to give him anti - inflammatory drugs and painkillers for his rheumatoid arthritis . He further submitted that the prison guards had failed to provide him with any medical assistance during the night in question . TIME had passed between the incident and him receiving medical care , which was only offered to him in the morning . He argued that this delay had contributed to the seriousness of his condition . Had he been given assistance earlier , his condition would not have become so serious .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified later date the applicant was exempted from the obligation to pay court fees and granted legal aid for the purposes of proceedings before the first- and second - instance courts .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the proceedings before the first - instance courts , experts in neurology , rheumatology and diabetology confirmed that the applicant suffered from rheumatoid arthritis , although it was noted that he had failed to submit any medical records concerning his treatment prior to the arrest . The rheumatologist stated that , even assuming that the applicant had been treated for the condition prior to his arrest , a DATE interruption in taking the relevant medication could not have caused a stroke . The expert further stated that left untreated , diabetes might have contributed to its occurrence . The neurologist stated that an earlier diagnosis of the stroke could have limited the damage to the applicant \u2019s health .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s claim was dismissed on DATE . In issuing its judgment ORG relied on the expert opinions . It noted that the applicant had failed to submit medical records showing that he had been in some form of treatment prior to his arrest . The court found no causal link between the conduct of the prison authorities after the applicant \u2019s arrest and the stroke he had subsequently suffered .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He argued , inter alia , that the court had erred by failing to examine whether there had been a causal link between the failure to assist him during TIME in question and the condition he had developed as a result of the stroke . He referred to the opinion given by the neurologist ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the contested judgment and remitted the case to the lower court . It considered that the first - instance court had failed to establish the facts of the case correctly , in particular as to the applicant \u2019s medical history prior to his arrest . It instructed the lower court to take additional evidence regarding this aspect of the case .", "CARDINAL . The case was examined again by ORG . During these proceedings the court ordered the applicant to restate his claim . The applicant ultimately claimed compensation in the amount of ORG CARDINAL . He referred to LAW . This amount covered LAW in respect of loss of income and ORG CARDINAL for the treatment costs he had borne after the accident . He further claimed a DATE pension of ORG , referring to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim . It found that he had been arrested on DATE and placed in detention in FAC DATE , on DATE . He had felt unwell TIME and fell out of bed twice . After the first fall his cellmate had helped him up , as directed by the prison guard . When he had fallen out of bed for a second time , he was unable to get up , even with the assistance of his cellmate . He had remained on the floor until TIME . When TIME came a nurse had decided that he should be taken to the doctor , who had realised that the applicant had suffered a stroke during TIME . He had subsequently been taken to the neurological ward of a nearby hospital , where he had undergone treatment for DATE .", "CARDINAL . The court referred to medical expert opinions prepared for the purposes of the case . The experts had found that it had not been established that prior to his arrest the applicant had been regularly taking medication for his rheumatoid arthritis . However , even assuming that he had , the fact that he did not receive any after his arrest during DATE preceding his stroke had had no bearing on the stroke itself . It had probably been caused by his circulation problems , which could have also been caused by his previously undiagnosed and untreated diabetes .", "CARDINAL . ORG referred to the supplementary expert opinion of a neurologist , who observed that the refusal to provide the applicant with painkillers / anti - inflammatory drugs after his arrest could not have caused the stroke , even though it might have caused him some suffering . He was of the view that the stroke would likely have occurred even if the applicant had not been arrested , as deterioration of health leading to stroke was normally a long - term process .", "CARDINAL . The court had regard to evidence given by PERSON , the inmate who had shared a cell with the applicant on TIME CARDINAL DATE . He testified that when the applicant had fallen off the bed , no medical assistance had been given to him . The court observed that leaving the applicant in the cell until TIME without any help from the prison guards was inappropriate . However , it was of the view that this failure was of no relevance to the applicant \u2019s compensation claim , as the stroke had most probably been caused by the applicant \u2019s pre - existing condition prior to his arrest . Hence , even the fact that no medical assistance had been given to him during the night in question , could not be regarded as giving rise to the ORG \u2019s liability in tort in respect of the obvious damage to his health caused by the stroke .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the applicant had essentially relied on the refusal of the police officers and prison guards to give him medication during his arrest and afterwards . In the absence of a demonstrated causal link between the refusals to give the applicant medication and his stroke on DATE , the statutory conditions for the ORG \u2019s liability in tort had not been met .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed . He complained , inter alia , that the firstinstance court had failed to examine the issues crucial to the case . In particular , the court had failed to address the shortcomings of the medical attention given to the applicant during the critical night . He referred again to the fact that the prison authorities did not do anything to help him and that he remained on the cell floor from TIME He submitted that that fact had had an impact on the development of his condition and that the failure to give him proper and timely medical assistance had resulted in subsequent serious damage to his health . He referred to a statement made by CARDINAL of the expert witnesses who had confirmed that the lack of such prompt attention resulted in the scope of that damage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the judgment . It fully shared the findings of the first - instance court and its legal assessment of the case . Under the applicable law , the applicant \u2019s legal aid expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not lodge a cassation appeal ( appeal on points of law ) against the appellate court \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the social insurance authorities certified the applicant was suffering from a serious and permanent disability , in need of assistance in everyday life and unable to work . He received no income apart from disability benefit . He was not entitled to receive a pension because , as he was self - employed prior to his arrest , he had not been paying social insurance contributions .", "CARDINAL .
