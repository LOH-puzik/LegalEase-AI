The applicant , Mr Steingrim Wolland , was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE . He ran a law firm in his own name in GPE until his licence to practice was suspended as a result of the opening of bankruptcy proceedings against him personally in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the prosecuting authority ( ORG \u2013 ORG ) issued charges ( siktelse ) against the applicant for aiding and abetting fraud in connection with art sales ( kunstbedrageri ) , an application for a bank loan ( l\u00e5nebedrageri ) , and forgery of documents in connection with the latter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( tingrett ) , finding that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion ( skjellig grunn til mistanke ) in respect of the charges , decided at the request of the prosecuting authority to authorise that a search be carried out at the applicant \u2019s premises , including his office . The applicant did not lodge an appeal against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police were at the applicant \u2019s premises \u2013 his home and office . In accordance with LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) a third party \u2013 a lawyer acquaintance of the applicant DATE was present . As there was a presumption that some material would be covered by the applicant \u2019s statutory legal professional privilege as a lawyer , and therefore be exempt from seizure pursuant to LAW ibid . ) , documents were put in sealed bags instead of being searched for evidence by the police . The police also collected a hard disk and a laptop . The third party had no objections as to how the police had proceeded .", "CARDINAL . Mirror copies ( speilkopier ) of the hard disk and laptop were taken ; the hard disk and laptop were returned to the applicant DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the prosecuting authority \u2019s office , the applicant went through the paper documents that had been collected and sorted out those which he considered to be covered by legal professional privilege . This material was stored separately and placed under seal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecuting authority applied to ORG to examine the paper material that had been collected at the applicant \u2019s LOC and to have those documents that could lawfully be seized made available to it for search . As to the mirror copies , the prosecuting authority proposed that ORG authorise a staff member at ORG \u2019s computer department to acquaint him or herself with the material . The prosecution authority would thereafter return to ORG with an application for a decision on whether specific documents would be exempt from seizure owing to legal professional privilege . ORG accepted this procedure ( see , however , paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Subsequently , the prosecuting authority , upon discussions with the applicant as to which keywords ( s\u00f8keord ) should be used when looking for documents on the mirror copies , made keyword - searches which gave results in CARDINAL files .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer disputed the lawfulness of what he categorised as the \u201c seizure \u201d ( \u201c beslag \u201d ) , arguing that there had been no reasonable grounds for suspicion against the applicant and requested that ORG quash the \u201c seizure \u201d decision and order that the collected material be returned to him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecuting authority submitted the CARDINAL files from the mirror copies to ORG for examination .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the letter from the applicant \u2019s lawyer of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG wrote a letter of CARDINAL DATE , pointing out that the procedure applicable to material allegedly covered by legal professional privilege had been set out by ORG ( PERSON ) in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , reported in PERSON ( FAC . ) DATE page CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . In line with that procedure , there were no grounds on which ORG could at that time hold a court hearing devoted to the discontinuation of any \u201c seizure \u201d and return of the material . No seizure had been decided \u2013 the court was at the time carrying out the task of reviewing the material collected in order to decide on what should be made available to the prosecuting authority for it to search . ORG would obtain the views of the parties in a hearing before making a formal decision as to whether to authorise the search of the prosecution . Its decision would be amenable to appeal . Since the handling of the case so far had taken considerable time , ORG examination would be expedited .", "CARDINAL . The applicant and his lawyer disagreed with ORG description of the procedure to be followed . After further exchanges between the parties , ORG reiterated in a letter of CARDINAL DATE which was formally a judicial decision amenable to appeal ( see paragraphs DATE below ) \u2013 that a decision on seizure had not yet been taken . There was a presumption to the effect that documents and other materials in the office of a private lawyer were subject to legal professional privilege . In such cases the court would first go through the material in order to examine what could be made available to the prosecuting authority for it to search . ORG also informed the parties that it was about to complete this task , having examined each document . It also reiterated its disagreement with the applicant \u2019s view that before carrying out its perusal of the material it ought to consider anew whether there were reasonable grounds for suspicion against him , failing which its examination of the material would be unlawful , and that in the absence of such grounds it ought to return all the material to him with the seals intact .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE not to examine the merits of his request to quash what was in his view a \u201c seizure \u201d , and to return the material .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( lagmannsrett ) dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The High Court , as had ORG , reiterated that the relevant procedure for the search and seizure of material allegedly subject to legal professional privilege had been thoroughly examined by ORG in GPE . DATE page CARDINAL ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above and CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) . ORG was at the time in the process of sorting out which documents could be lawfully searched by the prosecuting authority , and there had been no decisions on seizure taken .", "CARDINAL . From the above it was apparent , in the High Court \u2019s view , that the applicant was not at that stage of the procedure entitled to have the question of whether to maintain the \u201c seizure \u201d in force ( sp\u00f8rsm\u00e5let om opprettholdelse av beslaget ) under LAW reviewed ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , and it could not see how him disputing the existence of reasonable grounds for suspicion in his case could lead to a different result . ORG decision contained no statements suggesting that the procedure should be different in such cases . Nor could ORG find that there were other grounds , even if regard were had to Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW , as invoked by the applicant , suggesting that the accused had a wider right to judicial review in cases where he or she disputed the grounds for suspicion .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that LAW contained several provisions conferring on the accused a right to judicial review in respect of enforcement measures taken in the form of search and seizure , inter alia could a decision by a court to the effect that documents were to be handed over to the prosecution authorities after perusal of the documents in accordance with LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) \u2013 which was what ORG was doing at DATE be appealed against . ORG considered that the LAW did not give the applicant any rights to have the legality of searches and seizures judicially reviewed beyond what followed from LAW . The search had been authorised by ORG on DATE , finding that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion against the applicant . The applicant had not filed any timely appeals against the decision and the search had been effectuated .", "CARDINAL . From the reasoning above it also followed that the applicant \u2019s alternative submission that he ought to have a right to judicial review of whether there was a legal basis for an \u201c ongoing search \u201d ( om det er grunnlag for en \u201c p\u00e5g\u00e5ende ransaking \u201d ) could not succeed .", "CARDINAL . It was also clear that the accused did not on a general basis have a right to judicial review of the reasons for the charges brought against him , whether there were reasonable grounds for suspicion or not , regardless of the use of any enforcement measures . The existence of such reasons could be examined again but then only in connection with , for instance , future investigative measures where the latter were required . The Convention provisions relied on could not lead to any different result .", "CARDINAL . Against this background , ORG concluded that ORG procedure had suffered from no defects . Its decision of CARDINAL DATE had been based on a correct approach to the handling of the material gathered at the applicant \u2019s LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG Leave Committee of ORG ( H\u00f8yesteretts ankeutvalg ) , whose jurisdiction was limited to reviewing ORG procedure and interpretation of the law , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal in both respects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the issue of which materials could be sent to the prosecuting authority for it to search . In the court records it was registered that the court had informed the parties that it was desirable if a decision could be reached as soon as possible and preferably within DATE . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , it ruled that CARDINAL documents collected from the data carriers could be handed over . The applicant accepted the decision with respect to CARDINAL of the documents , but appealed in respect of the remaining CARDINAL and some of the paper documents . The prosecuting authority also appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the prosecuting authority \u2019s appeal and rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal except for CARDINAL issue relating to a bank account transcript .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG decision in so far as it had rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal ( ORG . DATE page CARDINAL ) . It found , in essence , that ORG had applied a too narrow understanding of what was lawyer \u2019s work ( egentlig advokatvirksomhet ) that could bring legal professional privilege into play .", "CARDINAL . During its reconsideration of the case , ORG , on DATE , concluded that CARDINAL of the disputed CARDINAL documents could be submitted to the prosecuting authority for it to search . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected an appeal by the applicant against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to have some of the material , including the mirror copies , returned to him . ORG , on DATE , refused his application in so far as it concerned the mirror copies , but granted the other parts thereof .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision to ORG , which on DATE ordered that the mirror copies were to be returned to the applicant unless the prosecuting authority promptly ( relativt omg\u00e5ende ) requested that ORG examine them . It referred , inter alia , to the general obligation to ensure progress in investigations , as reflected in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Upon an appeal by the prosecuting authority , ORG , on DATE ( ORG . DATE page CARDINAL ) agreed with ORG that the prosecuting authority \u2019s continued possession of and searches on the mirror copies ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) had been unlawful . The mirror copies should , like the paper documents , have been placed under seal and transferred to ORG without the prosecution authority having accessed material on them through keyword - searches . Unlike ORG , however , ORG did not for that reason find that the copies should necessarily be returned to the applicant . It quashed ORG decision in order for that court to further assess the prosecuting authority \u2019s submissions that the copies should instead be kept with ORG , as ORG had not sufficiently considered that possibility .", "CARDINAL . The prosecuting authority transferred the mirror copies to ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . When , on DATE , ORG contacted the prosecuting authority , its decision concerning the mirror copies having been quashed by ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the authority responded by informing ORG of the developments in the criminal case against the applicant ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It moreover stated that the seizure had been lifted on DATE and requested that the case therefore be dismissed . The material could be deleted by the court or the data carrier could be handed over to the applicant . The applicant argued that the case should not be dismissed and requested that the ORG examine the merits of his application to have the mirror copies returned , in order for him to have a judicial review of whether his Convention rights had been violated .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE ORG set out its views on the matter . It stated , inter alia , that the case concerned the applicant \u2019s application to have the mirror copies returned . This request would be met if the copies were actually returned , which was what the prosecuting authority had proposed . This made it difficult to see why the applicant should have legal standing to require that the courts examine his application . Moreover , the court assumed that the applicant could obtain a review of his LAW claims in other ways . The case as concerned the mirror copies was ultimately dismissed on DATE . There is no information about the applicant having appealed against this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant of having obtained credit by way of fraud ( l\u00e5nebedrageri ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . On DATE ORG convicted him for having shown gross negligence in that respect . This judgment became final when ORG refused leave to appeal on DATE . The charges concerning forgery of documents ( ibid . ) were dropped on CARDINAL DATE . Some of the charges concerning aiding and abetting art fraud ( kunstbedrageri ) ( ibid . ) were dropped on DATE and the remainder on CARDINAL DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
