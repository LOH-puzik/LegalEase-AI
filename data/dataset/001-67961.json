The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was arrested in connection with an investigation concerning a case of arson committed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of ORG refused to extend the validity of the arrest warrant . On appeal , ORG of ORG overturned that decision and prolonged the applicant 's pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge rescinded the warrant concerned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively ORG and ORG , ruling on the action to be taken on the basis of the investigation to date , held that there was insufficient evidence to commit the applicant for trial and discontinued the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant claimed compensation for unwarranted pre - trial detention , relying on the Law of CARDINAL DATE ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) .", "CARDINAL .

That requirement was justified , according to the Minister , in the case of an order or judgment discontinuing criminal proceedings , given that a discontinuation decision was not a bar to the reopening of the case if new information or evidence were to come to light .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant contested the Minister 's decision by means of an application to the Unwarranted Pre - trial ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appeared before ORG , which upheld the refusal of his claim by a decision taken on DATE and served on the applicant on DATE . It noted that the grounds for presuming the guilt of the applicant , who had always denied committing the offence he stood accused of when appearing before the courts investigating the charge , had been held to be insufficient to justify committing him for trial . It observed that , although the applicant had announced his intention of submitting a pleading setting out the evidence in the file which \u201c amply \u201d proved his innocence , he had not done so and had not replied to the ORG 's submissions . Consequently , ORG found that he had not proved his innocence as the law required ( dat verzoeker derhalve het bij de wet van hem vereiste bewijs van onschuld niet bijbrengt ) .", "CARDINAL .
