NORP The applicant , PERSON , was born in DATE in GPE and is currently living in the GPE . She was represented before the ORG by Ms S. den Boer , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG were represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. B\u00f6cker , of ORG . ORG , who had been invited to intervene under LAW of ORG , were represented by their Agent , PERSON , and their co - Agent , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The following summary of the facts of the case is based on the submissions of the applicant and on the replies received from ORG and GPE to factual questions put to them under LAW ( a ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant claims to be a national of GPE because both her parents were nationals of that country . She had lived in GPE all her life when she left that country in DATE , out of fear of deportation to GPE , where she would have to undertake military service . Subsequently , having stayed for some time in GPE and GPE , the applicant arrived in GPE on DATE , where she applied for asylum under another identity . She was granted a residence permit in GPE which was valid for DATE until DATE and was later extended for DATE until DATE . However , she left GPE for the GPE in DATE because , having been granted a residence permit , she purportedly received no other support . She was not provided with ( money for ) food or medical assistance , and was forced to live on the street . Allegedly , she applied to ORG authorities and human rights organisations for help on a number of occasions , but without success .", "CARDINAL . At the time of her entry to the GPE in DATE , the applicant was pregnant . She was subsequently diagnosed as being HIV - positive .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for asylum in the GPE on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave birth to a daughter in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of Justice ( Minister PERSON ) rejected the applicant \u2019s request , finding GPE responsible for the determination of her asylum application , pursuant to ORG ( ORG ) no . CARDINAL of DATE ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) . The Minister dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that , given her appalling living conditions in GPE DATE , she would risk treatment contrary to LAW if returned to GPE , considering that that claim remained wholly unsubstantiated . The general reports relied on by the applicant , which contained negative accounts of the situation of asylum - seekers in GPE , were not considered specific facts and circumstances relating to her individual case such as to form a basis for assuming that GPE would not comply with its obligations flowing from the Convention . Lastly , the applicant \u2019s contention that her medical situation did not allow her transfer to GPE was rejected by the Minister , who considered that the applicant was not receiving any specialist medical treatment in the GPE and that , moreover , it had not been alleged or demonstrated that adequate medical treatment would not be made available to her in GPE .", "CARDINAL . An appeal by the applicant against the Minister \u2019s decision was rejected by ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE sitting in GPE on DATE . It upheld the Minister \u2019s decision and reasoning .", "CARDINAL . A further appeal , together with a request for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) staying her removal , was lodged by the applicant with ORG ( GPE bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG . On DATE the President of the ORG granted the request for a provisional measure , deferring the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE pending the outcome of the further appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG allowed the further appeal . It quashed the judgment of DATE , as well as the Minister \u2019s decision , as it found that he had failed to have due regard to the general reports submitted by the applicant concerning the situation of asylum - seekers in GPE , which might be relevant to the applicant \u2019s individual case . As to the merits of the case , the ORG found that the reports submitted by the applicant were insufficient to assume that her transfer to GPE would result in a violation of LAW due to the general living conditions of asylum - seekers in that country . Furthermore , as the applicant had been granted a residence permit in GPE earlier , she was not at risk of expulsion to her country of origin . The ORG ordered that the legal consequences of the refusal of the applicant \u2019s asylum request should be maintained .", "CARDINAL . No further appeal lay against that decision . On an unspecified date the applicant was informed that she and her child would be placed in an GPE detention centre ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) for removal purposes .", "CARDINAL . The application was lodged with the ORG on DATE , and on DATE the applicant asked the ORG to issue an interim measure within the meaning of Rule CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in reply to questions put to them under LAW ( a ) , ORG informed ORG of practical aspects of the applicant \u2019s scheduled transfer to GPE . A copy of that reply was sent to the applicant for information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the Section decided , under Rule DATE , to indicate to ORG that it was desirable , in the interests of the parties and of the proper conduct of the proceedings before the ORG , not to expel the applicant to GPE for the duration of the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of the Section decided that ORG should be invited , under Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , to answer factual questions about the applicant \u2019s situation in GPE when she had lived there previously and about the general accommodation , subsistence and medical care offered to asylum - seekers in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The Government of GPE submitted their answers on DATE . The applicant \u2019s comments in reply were received on DATE . Additional information was received from ORG on DATE . A copy was sent to ORG and the applicant for information .", "CARDINAL . On DATE additional factual questions were put to ORG about the practical effects given to the ORG \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the case of LOC v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ( extracts ) ) .", "CARDINAL . In their reply of DATE , ORG indicated DATE following the LOC judgment and where a case concerned the transfer of a family with minor children to GPE \u2013 the GPE authorities would only transfer such a family after guarantees had been obtained from the NORP authorities that the family would remain together , and where information was available about the specific facility where the family was to be accommodated , in order to guarantee that the conditions there were age - appropriate in respect of the children . For this reason , the actual transfer to GPE would be announced DATE beforehand , in order to give the NORP authorities the opportunity to provide information on the specific facility where the family was to be accommodated , to guarantee that the conditions in this facility were suitable , and to guarantee that the family would not be split up . If these guarantees were not received within the time - limit for transfers , as laid down in the Dublin Regulation , the persons involved would be channelled into the GPE asylum procedure . However , as long as a Rule CARDINAL indication was in place , the Government were not in a position to commence the preparations for the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE .", "CARDINAL .

NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG submitted a copy of a circular letter dated DATE and sent by ORG of the NORP ORG ( GPE dell GPE ) to the GPE Units of the other member GPE of ORG , in which ORG set out the new policy of the NORP authorities on transfers to GPE of families with small children . The relevant part of ORG letter reads :", "\u201c A new policy was considered necessary in view of the fact that reception facilities , specifically reserved for such families , frequently remained unavailed of as a result of families having left for an unknown destination prior to transfer , or having obtained a court order barring their transfer . In order to safeguard appropriate facilities where families may stay together , the NORP authorities earmarked a total of CARDINAL places , distributed over CARDINAL projects under ORG ( ORG ) . The authorities confirmed that this number will be extended should the need arise . As may be inferred from the letter of DATE , this comprehensive guarantee is intended to avoid the need for guarantees in specific cases .", "ORG will continue to inform its NORP counterpart at an early stage of an intended transfer of a family with minor children . On DATE , the NORP , NORP and NORP migration liaison officers to GPE issued a report on ORG in general , including on the requirements the accommodations must fulfil , and on CARDINAL projects they had visited on the invitation of ORG .

They also submitted a copy of a letter of CARDINAL DATE from ORG , ORG , received by ORG of ORG ( Immigratie- en ORG ) via e - mail as a document titled \u201c Tarakhel Garanzie \u2013 [ the applicant \u2019s name ] \u201d .

The letter enclosed a note from ORG , detailing a reception project regarding the transfer of the applicant and her child .", "CARDINAL . ORG further submitted a copy of the standard form \u2013 prescribed under LAW ( ORG ) no . MONEY of ORG and of ORG by which the NORP authorities had been notified on DATE of the applicant \u2019s transfer to GPE , scheduled for DATE . It was indicated in that form that the applicant had health problems and that a medical report was attached to the form .

NORP The applicant \u2019s comments on the Government \u2019s submissions of CARDINAL and DATE were submitted on DATE . On DATE she asked the ORG to issue a fresh indication under LAW , submitting that the information provided by ORG contained only general guarantees , which were insufficient to ensure that she and her child would be provided with suitable accommodation and adequate medical care in GPE , emphasising her special needs as a HIV - positive person . The applicant further contended that the CARDINAL places in ORG projects which were earmarked for families with minor children were far from sufficient , taking into account the high number of migrants having arrived in GPE in DATE . The applicant argued that , without individual and specific guarantees , she ran a considerable risk of ending up living on the streets , without the special care she and her child needed .", "CARDINAL .
