The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the events giving rise to this application , the applicant was the manager of the post office in GPE , GPE . He wrote an article entitled \u201c An open letter to PERSON , former Director of the GPE PTT \u201d , in which he criticised PERSON negligence in the project to restore the ORG post office building and blamed her for the dilapidated state and partial collapse of the building . In DATE , the article was published in the ORG issue of the ORG magazine , a nonprofit - making publication of the ORG postal service ( \u201c the PTT \u201d ) , which has CARDINAL employees .", "CARDINAL . In the same edition of the magazine , in an article entitled \u201c ORG and ORG office \u201d , the editor - in - chief also criticised the restoration project and claimed that the amount paid for the project suggested that it had been carried out to make certain people richer . He concluded that those who were responsible for the current state of the building or had been negligent had been put on trial , but that the unlawfulness and abuses would soon be forgotten and the accused would get away with the offences . He pointed out that justice delayed was not justice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON sent a letter of correction to the editorinchief of the magazine , requesting him to publish her replies to the allegations made against her . This letter was received by the editor - in - chief on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Since the magazine did not publish the letter , PERSON brought an action in ORG seeking an order for the publication of her letter .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the publication of the correction letter . However , it decided that certain passages in the letter should be deleted as the statements contained therein went beyond the aim of responding to the allegations made against the plaintiff . The parties did not inform the ORG whether this letter was published in the Pos - Tel magazine .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON brought a civil action for compensation against the applicant and the editor - in - chief of the magazine before ORG of First Instance . She claimed that the allegedly defamatory remarks made in the magazine , particularly in the applicant \u2019s article , constituted an attack on her reputation . She thus requested that the court award her compensation in the amount of MONEY ( GPE ) for nonpecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . During the proceedings the court examined the following passages :", "\u201c My esteemed former Director , ... as a result of your pointless and inappropriate acts , which were carried out merely to obtain economic and political profit and to appear cute to some people , you caused irreparable harm to our historic PTT ( ORG ) building ...", "... I believe that our late Minister of Communications , ORG , would turn in his grave if he saw the building DATE ...", "My esteemed retired Director , in an interview which was published in ORG magazine , in which you appeared in the guise of a heroine and a symbol for honesty , like an exemplary manager in GPE , you managed to exploit the sentiments of ( the interviewer ) by appearing innocent , clean and pure . The interview was given the title \u2018 They ate the president who did not eat\u2019 . This title moved me tremendously and made me think . I wished that the interview had not been published in a serious magazine . Now , like a lady with a conscience , and without twisting the truth , tell [ us ] . In our country there are many people who take bribes ; there are thieves and crooks . And even though these people are convicted by our independent courts , they never admit that ... they stole or that they were bribed . As you may very well remember , an eminent statesman once said , \u2018 No one can know what happens between QUANTITY people and bribery can not be documented.\u2019 ...", "While it was decided by ORG , ORG and ORG to pay CARDINAL GPE for our building , I can not understand how you managed to spend CARDINAL GPE , by consulting with Mr GPE , who has nothing to do with our administration . Do you also know that , in a telephone conversation , CARDINAL of your employees told me that he could not make any payment which had not been approved by Mr GPE ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first - instance court decided that the article went beyond mere criticism of an unsuccessful restoration project . In its detailed decision , the court noted that there was a criminal case pending against the plaintiff on charges of breach of duty for having made an overpayment to the contractor who carried out the restoration project . The dispute between the contractor and the PTT had not yet been resolved and the plaintiff had not been convicted . Nevertheless , the proceedings in question had been suspended under PERSON no . DATE . However , the court held that , even assuming that the proceedings had not been suspended and that the plaintiff had been convicted of the charges , this did not mean that she had been accepting bribes or that she had not acted like a lady . The court observed that criticising an unsuccessful restoration project was not the same as insulting an individual , and that the applicant had exceeded the limits of permissible criticism by using demeaning statements in the article . It had been implied that the plaintiff had taken bribes . Taking into account the responsibility of the plaintiff in the restoration project and the socio - economic situation of the parties , the court decided to award the plaintiff the sum of FAC ( MONEY ( ORG ) at the relevant time ) in compensation for non - pecuniary damage , to be paid by the applicant and the editor - in - chief . The applicant paid a total sum of GPE CARDINAL ( approximately EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) , which included the principal compensation , enforcement costs and interest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against the decision of the first - instance court , complaining that it interfered with his freedom of expression . He noted that the impugned article had not targeted the personality of the plaintiff , but had been aimed at raising awareness on the subject of the protection of a historic monument by the ORG authorities . As a former manager of ORG post office , he had merely expressed his concern at the state of the building and had criticised the plaintiff for her omissions , contributing to the collapse of the building . He argued that the first - instance court judges had erred in their decision by refusing his request that they visit the building , which might have allowed them to better understand his criticism in the article . Thus , the applicant requested ORG to quash the above judgment which , in his opinion , risked preventing scrutiny of public values and would deter the public from raising their voices against the plunder of public monuments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the judgment , holding that the first - instance court had duly examined the circumstances in which the insulting statements had been made .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a request by the applicant for rectification of its decision .", "CARDINAL . According to Law no . DATE on conditional release , suspension of proceedings and execution of sentences in respect of crimes committed before DATE , proceedings could be suspended and subsequently dropped if no crime of the same or a more serious nature was committed by the offender within a DATE period .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Obligations provides as follows :", "\u201c Any person who alleges that his personality rights have been illegally violated can claim compensation for non - pecuniary damage .", "The judge shall take into account the parties\u2019 socio - economic situation , their occupation and their social status when determining the amount of compensation ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
