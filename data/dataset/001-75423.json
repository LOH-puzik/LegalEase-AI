He was subsequently summoned by the court to submit certain documents in order to have a guardian appointed who would bring a paternity action on the child \u2019s behalf as under the domestic law the alleged biological father , not married to the mother , lacked standing in paternity proceedings . The applicant failed to do so .", "CARDINAL . In a note of CARDINAL DATE the ORG informed the family court about the situation of NORP and requested it to take steps to supervise PERSON in her exercise of parental rights .

On DATE the applicant again requested the prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings , alleging that the birth certificate of NORP had been forged . On DATE the ORG refused to do so , finding that the child \u2019s birth certificate had been amended following the recognition of the paternity of NORP by his mother \u2019s new partner PERSON The prosecutor observed that under the applicable laws recognition of a child was only possible if the mother gave her consent thereto . No criminal offence had been committed in that NORP \u2019s certificate had been rectified to reflect the recognition of paternity , effected with his mother \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL .

He emphasised that the court relied only on the submissions of the mother , disregarding entirely his interests as a biological father of the child , and failed to take the child \u2019s best interests properly into consideration .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE of the President of ORG , the applicant was informed that a copy of the decision of DATE by which ORG had dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to have a guardian for the child appointed for the institution of paternity proceedings , had been sent to a wrong address .

Where a judgment has financial consequences not provided for in the ORG , the Constitutional Court shall specify a date for the end of the binding force of the normative act concerned , after seeking the opinion of ORG .", "CARDINAL .

A declaration recognising paternity of a child can be made before a registrar of a local births , marriages and deaths register office .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL reads :", "\u201c The recognition of paternity in respect of a minor child should be subject to the approval of its mother . On the death of the mother , or if her parental rights have been withdrawn , or if a contact with her is impossible , a court appointed guardian shall give consent to the recognition of paternity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Articles CARDINAL to CARDINAL , an action to have the recognition of a child declared null and void can be brought by the mother , by the child and by the man who recognised his paternity .

Under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code , an action to establish paternity may be brought by the mother or by the child , or by the prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code provides that a guardian can be appointed by the family court to represent the child , if neither of the parents can represent it in judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE ( K CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) ORG ruled on the ORG \u2019s request to have LAW and LAW declared incompatible with LAW . The ORG argued that the fact that a biological father did not have standing to lodge himself with a court an action to have his paternity recognised in respect of an out - of - wedlock child and that such action on behalf of a father could be only brought by the public prosecutor , breached the father \u2019s right to have access to a court , guaranteed by LAW . It was further argued that this restriction on access to a court was in violation of these provisions of the LAW which guaranteed respect for private and family life .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court observed that the LAW does not regulate the issue of methods to be applied in order to establish filiation of children to whom a presumption of paternity of the mother \u2019s husband did not apply . This matter is left to be regulated by statute . Nevertheless , the constitutional principle of protecting the child \u2019s best interest , enshrined in LAW , indicated preference as to the manner in which legal procedures to establish filiation should be shaped , namely so as to allow legal filiation to be determined in accordance with child \u2019s biological parentage .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that under LAW the recognition of paternity by way of unilateral declaration of a putative biological father was subject to the mother \u2019s consent .", "CARDINAL . ORG observed that the decision of the legislature to make the effectiveness of recognition of paternity by a declaration made under this provision conditional on the mother \u2019s consent was justified by the need to protect mother \u2019s personal rights . Had the requirement of consent been removed , it would create a situation in which a man would be the sole person capable of establishing the child \u2019s filiation . This could result in creation of legal bonds inconsistent with biological reality and , also , expose the mother to the risk of harassment by a man claiming to be a biological father of her child . However , ORG considered that it would not be justified to introduce a judicial control over the mother \u2019s consent . This would ultimately lead to replacing the mother \u2019s consent by consent given by a court , which would undermine the very reason for the existence of unilateral declaration of paternity as a special method of establishing legal ties between the father and child .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further considered that the lack of standing before a court for a man claiming to be the biological father of a child and trying to have his paternity recognised in law in procedure provided for by LAW had to be seen in the light of the fact that the recognition of paternity by way of declaration was conditional on the mother \u2019s consent , referred to above .", "CARDINAL . The necessity of the mother \u2019s consent , on the one hand , and the lack of standing before the court to have one \u2019s paternity recognised in law on the other resulted in a situation in which , in the absence of such a consent , a biological father would be deprived of any possibility of creating legal ties between himself and his child , either by way of declaration or by instituting paternity proceedings . ORG emphasised that a decision of the prosecuting authorities to institute proceedings with a view to creating such ties was left entirely to their discretion . All these factors taken together led the ORG to the conclusion that the lack of standing before a court of the biological father in proceedings to have his biological paternity recognised in law were in breach of LAW , providing for protection of the children \u2019s rights as a constitutional principle . It was further stated that this was also in breach of the father \u2019s right to respect for his private and family life , guaranteed by LAW . Moreover , these provisions breached LAW , guaranteeing the right of access to a court ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
