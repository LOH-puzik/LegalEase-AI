The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He is married and has CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . He was ordained as a priest in DATE . In DATE he applied to the FAC for dispensation from the obligation of celibacy . The following year he was married in a civil ceremony . With his wife , to whom he is still married , he has CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . From DATE onwards , the applicant was employed as a teacher of NORP religion and ethics in a ORG - run secondary school of GPE under a renewable DATE contract . In accordance with the provisions of an Agreement of DATE between GPE and ORG , it was the responsibility of the Bishop of the diocese to confirm , DATE , the renewal of the applicant \u2019s employment , and ORG was bound by the ORG \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the NORP newspaper ORG contained an article about the \u201c Movement for Optional Celibacy \u201d for priests . It reported that the applicant had previously been rector of a seminary and included a photograph showing him , together with his wife and their CARDINAL children , attending a gathering of the movement , of which he was a member . The article quoted the comments of a number of participants , naming CARDINAL of them including the applicant . The members in question were urging the ecclesiastical authorities to introduce optional celibacy and calling for the ORG to be democratic rather than theocratic , with the possibility for the laity to elect priests and bishops . They further indicated their disagreement with the ORG \u2019s position on abortion , divorce , sexuality and contraception . The article explained that the publicity given to the event in the press had dissuaded a significant number of the ORG \u2019s members from attending the gathering . Others had approached the agreed venue but , on seeing the media present , had simply waved to their colleagues without getting out of their cars and had driven away immediately . CARDINAL secularised priests , including the applicant , had remained with their families .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the FAC authorities granted the applicant \u2019s request for dispensation from celibacy . The document stipulated that anyone granted such a dispensation was barred from teaching the NORP religion in public institutions , unless the local bishop decided otherwise \u201c according to his own criteria and provided that there [ was ] no scandal \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Diocese of Cartagena informed ORG of its intention not to approve the renewal of the applicant \u2019s contract for the DATE . ORG notified the applicant of the decision , which was effective from DATE .", "CARDINAL . In an official memorandum of CARDINAL DATE the LOC reiterated that , in accordance with the applicable provisions , the applicant was required to give his lessons \u201c without any risk of scandal \u201d . The Diocese explained in that connection that the publicity given by the applicant to his personal situation had entailed a breach of that duty , thus preventing the church authorities from proposing him again for the following school year , in order to protect the sensitivity of the parents of children who attended the centre where the applicant was teaching .", "CARDINAL . Having been unsuccessful in his administrative complaint against that decision , the applicant appealed to ORG no . CARDINAL , which gave its judgment on DATE . The judge began by referring to the arguments used by the Diocese to justify the non - renewal of the applicant \u2019s contract , namely the fact that he had made public his situation as \u201c married priest \u201d ( he had not received dispensation from the FAC until DATE ) and father , together with the need to avoid scandals and to protect the sensitivity of the parents of the school \u2019s pupils , as they might be offended if the applicant continued to teach NORP religion and ethics . In this connection the judge took the following view :", "\u201c ... in the light of the facts thus presented , Mr PERSON was discriminated against because of his marital status and his membership of ORG , his appearance in the press having been the ground that led to his dismissal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge further pointed out that :", "\u201c The principle of non - discrimination at work ORG ] the prohibition of discrimination on account of belonging to a trade union , as [ was ] the case for membership of any other association . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the judge noted that the applicant \u2019s situation as \u201c married priest \u201d and \u201c father \u201d had been known to the pupils and to their parents and to the directors of the school centres where he had worked . Consequently , the judge upheld the applicant \u2019s appeal , declared his dismissal null and void and ordered his reinstatement in his former post .", "CARDINAL . ORG , ORG for GPE and the Diocese of Cartagena lodged an appeal ( suplicaci\u00f3n ) . In a judgment of DATE , ORG upheld the appeal , finding as follows :", "\u201c ... The teaching [ of NORP religion and ethics ] is associated with the doctrine of the NORP religion ... Accordingly , the bond created [ between the teacher and the ORG ] is based on trust . [ As a result , ] it is not a neutral legal relationship , such as that which exists between citizens in general and public authorities . It can be placed on the borderline between the pure ecclesiastical dimension and a skeleton employment relationship . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the court referred to the Bishop \u2019s prerogatives in such matters and took the view that in the present case there had not been a violation of Articles CARDINAL ( prohibition of discrimination ) , CARDINAL ( right to respect for private life ) or CARDINAL ( freedom of expression ) of the Spanish Constitution , since the applicant had taught religion since DATE , the ORG having extended his employment from DATE even though his personal situation had been identical . The court concluded that , when the applicant had decided to reveal that situation publicly , the ORG had merely used his prerogative in accordance with LAW Canon PERSON , that is to say , ensuring that the applicant , like any other person in that situation , carried out his duties with discretion and without his personal circumstances causing any scandal . In the court \u2019s view , if such a situation became public knowledge , it was the PERSON \u2019s duty to stop proposing the person concerned for a post of that nature , in accordance with the requirements of the official document granting dispensation from celibacy .", "CARDINAL . In addition , as regards LAW in particular , the court noted that for the purposes of LAW of LAW , the restrictions imposed on the applicant \u2019s rights had to be considered legitimate and proportionate to the aim pursued , namely the avoidance of scandal .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , the court analysed the question of the bond of trust and concluded as follows :", "\u201c ... Where such a bond of trust is broken ( and in the present case there are circumstances that reasonably allow such a conclusion to be reached ) , the ORG is no longer obliged to propose [ the applicant ] for the post of teacher of NORP religion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lastly , as to the nature of the contract , the court took the view that , since its renewal was subject to DATE approval by the Bishop for the following school year , it was a temporary contract , which in the present case had simply expired . It was thus not possible to consider that the applicant had been dismissed .", "CARDINAL . Relying on Articles CARDINAL ( prohibition of discrimination ) , CARDINAL ( right to respect for private and family life ) and CARDINAL ( freedom of expression ) of the LAW , the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with ORG . In a decision of DATE , the ORG to which the case had been allocated declared the appeal admissible and , in accordance with sections CARDINAL of the Institutional Law on ORG , notified the decision to the parties and requested a copy of the case file from the courts below .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of DATE , served on DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . In its decision , ORG took the view that the arguments raised in fact fell within the scope of Articles CARDINAL ( freedom of thought and religion ) and QUANTITY . In this connection it began by noting that the applicant \u2019s situation as \u201c married priest \u201d had been known to the LOC , which had discontinued its renewal of the contract only when the article was published in the press , a fact for which the applicant himself had been responsible . The court further highlighted the special status of teachers of religious education in GPE , being different from that of other teachers and justifying the fact that teachers of religion were selected purely on the basis of religious criteria rather than the ordinary criteria provided for in domestic law .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court further took the view that the main question in the amparo appeal was whether the facts at issue could be justified by the religious freedom of ORG , in relation to the ORG \u2019s duty of religious neutrality ( LAW of LAW ) , or whether , by contrast , they constituted a breach of the applicant \u2019s right to freedom of thought and religion in relation to his right to freedom of expression ( LAW ( a ) of LAW ) . In answering this question the court began by noting that the reason for the non - renewal had been the article in a regional newspaper , regarded as causing a scandal according to the arguments of GPE in its official memorandum of DATE . On this point , the court took the view that the duty of neutrality precluded it from ruling on the notion of \u201c scandal \u201d invoked by the LOC or on the merits of the \u201c optional celibacy of priests \u201d advocated by the applicant . It further observed that the judgment of ORG provided for judicial review of the ORG \u2019s decision , in particular concerning his inability to propose candidates who did not have the requisite professional qualifications for the post and the obligation to ensure respect for fundamental rights and civil liberties .", "CARDINAL . Noting that the ORG \u2019s decision did not fall completely outside the supervision of the domestic courts , ORG found as follows :", "\u201c ... the interferences with the applicant \u2019s rights are neither disproportionate nor unconstitutional ... They are justified by respect for the lawful exercise of the NORP church \u2019s fundamental right to religious freedom in its collective or community dimension ( LAW ) , in relation to the right of parents to choose their children \u2019s religious education ( LAW ) . [ Indeed ] , the reasons for the non - renewal of the applicant \u2019s contract ... are of an exclusively religious nature , related to the rules of the faith to which the applicant freely adheres and whose beliefs he sought to teach in a public education centre . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the court referred to its judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , observing as follows :", "\u201c ... it would be quite simply unreasonable , as regards the teaching of religion in secondary education centres , if the religious beliefs of those who decide of their own free will to apply for such teaching posts were not taken into account in the selection process , on the basis of guaranteeing the right to religious freedom in its collective and community dimension . \u201d", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL judges appended a dissenting opinion to the majority judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently requested that ORG judgment be declared null and void , on the ground that CARDINAL of the judges in the ORG which had given the judgment were known for their affinities with ORG , CARDINAL of them being a member of ORG .", "CARDINAL .
