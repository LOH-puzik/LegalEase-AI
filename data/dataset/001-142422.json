GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression);Non-pecuniary damage - award", "JUDGES": "Ale\u0161 Pejchal;Angelika Nu\u00dfberger;Ann Power-Forde;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , the applicant published an article in a local newspaper concerning the political orientation of the Berger-CARDINAL-e . V. association ( \u201c the association \u201d ) . Subsequently , the newspaper published the association \u2019s response to that article describing the applicant \u2019s statements as \u201c intellectually weak and crude \u201d ( \u201c geistig schwach und primitiv \u201d ) and as \u201c pamphlets constituting a public danger \u201d ( \u201c gemeingef\u00e4hrliche NORP \u201d ) . The newspaper also published CARDINAL letters to the editor . CARDINAL of them was written by ORG , an elected town councillor , who contended that the association had no extreme right - wing tendencies ( \u201c keine rechtsradikale Vereinigung \u201d ) . He expressed that it was \u201c unfortunate that [ the applicant ] again and again manages to publicize his false accusations and to show himself as a pitiful victim \u201d ( \u201c [ ... ] bedauerlich , dass es ORG Dr. PERSON immer wieder gelingt , seine falschen Anschuldigungen \u00f6ffentlich zu machen und sich als bedauernswertes \u2018 Opfer\u2019 darzustellen [ ... ] \u201d ) . He contended that \u201c he [ the applicant ] had evoked the current situation in particular by his constant spying and false accusations \u201d ( \u201c Die derzeitige Situation hat er insbesondere durch seine st\u00e4ndigen ORG und Falschbehauptungen heraufbeschworen [ ... ] . \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . F.G. was also running for the office of town mayor . In the run - up to the elections the applicant then distributed a leaflet with the headline : \u201c Do n\u2019t vote for an agitator \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) . The text on the leaflet maintained : \u201c GPE is the seat of several neo - NORP organisations . Particularly dangerous is the Berger-CARDINAL-e . V. , for which ORG [ last name written out ] is providing a cover . \u201d ( \u201e Am\u00f6neburg ist Sitz mehrerer NORP - Organisationen . PERSON die Berger-CARDINAL-e . ORG , die ORG . \u201c ) . The leaflet also showed photos of ORG son , the association \u2019s chairman at the time , taken by a security camera on the applicant \u2019s property TIME . The applicant explained that he had previously been attacked and that his door had been smashed repeatedly at TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at ORG request , issued a civil injunction prohibiting the applicant from distributing the leaflet and making other assertions of fact ( ORG ) which might depict PERSON as a supporter of neo - NORP organisations . Any contravention was punishable by a fine of up to CARDINAL,CARDINAL euros ( ORG ) or by imprisonment of DATE . The court reasoned that the assertion that ORG had covered for a particularly dangerous neo - NORP organisation had infringed his personality rights . Because of the upcoming elections , the court found that there was a risk that the applicant might continue to distribute the leaflet or disseminate the allegations in another form .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an objection with ORG . He submitted , inter alia , that the designation \u201c CARDINAL \u201d , standing for the eighth letter of the alphabet [ H ] as a reference to \u201c PERSON \u201d , was displayed by members of the association in runes and thus in a form attributed to neoNazism by the NORP federal domestic intelligence service ( GPE f\u00fcr GPE ) . In addition , the association had held a ceremony on DATE after PERSON \u2019s birthday using the colours black , white and red \u2013 the national colours of the NORP empire DATE for the invitation . In support of his allegations , the applicant referred to the association \u2019s statutes and an incident in which members of the association had shouted \u201c PERSON \u201d on the occasion of an GPE bonfire organised by the association . Lastly , he contended that there was no longer any reason for upholding the injunction , as the mayoral elections had taken place in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the injunction . It found that to claim that someone was supporting a neo - NORP organisation amounted to an infringement of that individual \u2019s honour and social reputation and thus his or her personality rights ( allgemeines PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The court held that the applicant had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his allegation that ORG had covered for a neo - NORP organisation . His submissions were mere conjectures and subjective interpretations . As a consequence , the court held , the applicant could not rely on the notion of freedom of expression enshrined in LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court reasoned , inter alia , that in accordance with its rules , the association had been founded in DATE , even though it had not been registered until DATE . Hence , the reference to the number CARDINAL in the name of the association could not be interpreted as support for neo - Nazism . As regards the PERSON salute on the occasion of the LOC bonfire , the applicant had failed to show that the individuals concerned were \u201c without doubt \u201d members of the association . The court acknowledged that the use of runes might indeed refer to neo - Nazism , but held that that did not suffice to prove that the association was of such a character . Lastly , the court emphasized that the applicant had \u201c confirmed his determination not to let himself be silenced as a critic of the plaintiff \u201d . Hence , the court found that the injunction needed to be maintained despite the fact that the mayoral elections had taken place in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment . The court noted , however , that there was no longer a need to adjudicate on the prohibition of further dissemination of the leaflet , as the elections had taken place in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . ORG explained that the leaflet contained CARDINAL different allegations of fact : firstly , that the association was a particularly dangerous neo - NORP organisation ; and secondly , that ORG had been aware of that fact but had nevertheless publicly supported the organisation . The applicant had failed to prove that those allegations were true . The court acknowledged that there were several indicators of the association \u2019s neo - NORP character \u201c which , all in all , may lead to the assumption that this is not a mere coincidence \u201d . The association therefore had to put up with critical questions . The aforementioned indicators were , however , not \u201c compelling proof \u201d ( zwingender PERSON ) of the association \u2019s political orientation .", "CARDINAL . In any case , the court reasoned , the applicant had failed to provide any evidence for the allegation that ORG had covered for the association . The court interpreted the applicant \u2019s statement as an allegation that ORG had knowledge of the association \u2019s neo - NORP orientation and endorsed it . Referring to the case - law of ORG , ORG acknowledged that allegations of fact may fall , as a matter of principle , under the notion of freedom of expression of LAW to the extent that they were aimed at forming public opinion ( meinungsbezogene ORG ) . The protection provided by LAW required , however , that the allegations required substantial justification . The letter to the editor written by ORG did not suffice in that regard .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained that his right to be heard before ORG had been breached . He complained , inter alia , that the court had failed to examine the criminal files against members of the association in order to establish whether they had committed crimes of an extremist political nature .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It held , inter alia , that the applicant had not sufficiently substantiated which files should have been examined and in which regard . Where the applicant had offered evidence by specifying a particular file , ORG had not denied that members of the association , wearing pullovers with the association \u2019s insignia , had been present at an election campaign event organised by him . Nor had ORG denied that certain members of the association had committed crimes , although they were not necessarily of an extremist political nature . Lastly , the court emphasized that according to an assessment by the ORG domestic intelligence service ( PERSON f\u00fcr GPE ) , the association was a \u201c fraternity \u201d ( \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , which the service would nonetheless \u201c keep an eye on \u201d . ORG thus concluded that the applicant might have raised a suspicion at the most , but had failed to prove the association \u2019s neoNazi orientation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . He complained that his freedom of conscience , his freedom of expression and his right to a fair trial had been violated . He claimed in particular that the courts had put the onus of proof on him , whereas in the context of the expression of one \u2019s opinion it was impossible to provide evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , without giving reasons , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication ( file no . DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
