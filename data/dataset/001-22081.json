He is represented before the ORG by Mr U. PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE respectively , ORG declared CARDINAL companies , allegedly directly or indirectly administered by the applicant , insolvent .", "In connection with these facts , the applicant was charged on an unspecified date with fraudulent trading and was committed for trial in ORG . At a hearing on DATE , the presiding judge of ORG questioned a witness , PERSON , who had been the official receiver in the insolvencies of the above - mentioned companies . The presiding judge asked him whether he had been previously involved , as a victim , in criminal proceedings . PERSON answered that he recently had , because someone had fired shots at the door of his house , probably as an act of intimidation . The witness added that the outcome of those proceedings was that the applicant 's son had been found guilty and had been sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "In fact , the presiding judge of ORG had also presided over the criminal proceedings against the applicant 's son , which had ended on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant filed a request with ORG for the presiding judge of ORG to be removed from hearing his case ( ricusazione ) . The grounds for the request were that the presiding judge had stated his opinion on the facts of the case when not exercising his judicial functions ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL ( c ) of LAW ) or , in the alternative , that he had stated his opinion on the facts of the case before the end of the proceedings ( LAW para . CARDINAL ( b ) of the same Code ) .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's request as manifestly ill - founded . The applicant appealed against that decision to ORG . On DATE the latter court rejected the applicant 's appeal .", "On DATE ORG found the applicant guilty of fraudulent insolvency and sentenced him to DATE imprisonment and DATE disqualification from civic office .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision with ORG .", "When lodging the appeal with ORG , the applicant did not explicitly refer to the alleged lack of impartiality of the first - instance judge . Before the ORG , he maintains that he did not explicitly raise such a complaint because his request for the judge to be removed had ended with a final decision of ORG rejecting it and that , in any event , in NORP law the issue of the alleged partiality of a first - instance judge was not a ground on which ORG could set aside a first - instance judgment .", "According to the latest information provided by the Government , on DATE the proceedings in ORG were still pending because priority had been accorded to other proceedings . According to the Government , the first hearing should take place at DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
