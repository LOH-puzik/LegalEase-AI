I note that he was also given diagnoses of personality disorder and substance abuse at various times . There is evidence to support the diagnosis of personality disorder . However , none of the psychiatrists who saw him appear to have doubted the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia and all continued his treatment with anti - psychotic medication . The significance of the diagnosis of personality disorder is that he would have been a more difficult patient to look after , than the average patient with schizophrenia .", "CARDINAL . Schizophrenia is a serious and long lasting mental illness that may be controlled to a greater or lesser extent by medication but is not cured by that medication . Self - harm , suicide and violence are recognised complications of schizophrenia . Many of the symptoms which Mr PERSON showed in the time leading up to his death are recognised symptoms of schizophrenia , including paranoia , hearing voices , disturbed sleep , aggression , ambivalence and thoughts of self - harm . These symptoms can have other causes but , in the case of a patient known to suffer from schizophrenia , it would be usual to assume that the symptoms were due to the schizophrenic illness . It is impossible to make any reliable distinction between symptoms which are due to schizophrenia and those which are due to an individual \u2019s personality .", "CARDINAL . The diagnosis of schizophrenia has important implications . The management of the condition is primarily the responsibility of doctors , as the normal prison rules can not be expected to cope with persons whose mental state is grossly abnormal , without guidance from doctors . The following comments are therefore made with reference to what would constitute an acceptable standard of care for a person with schizophrenia .", "CARDINAL . From the evidence I have seen , the standard of medical record keeping was inadequate on CARDINAL occasions . CARDINAL CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL , the management plans changed from continuous observation in the prison ORG , and a decision to seek the opinion of a visiting psychiatrist ( PERSON ) , to a decision to transfer Mr PERSON to ordinary location . There is no information in the medical notes to explain this decision . On CARDINAL , Mr PERSON was stating to staff that he intended to hang himself and a noose had been found in his cell . Given this evidence of serious suicidal intent , it would be good practice to record in the medical notes the reason for discontinuing the higher level of observation and returning to normal location .", "There is no entry in the medical notes for DATE leading up to PERSON death . Given that the entries up to this point record disturbed and unpredictable behaviour and threats to his life and threats of violence to others , there were good reasons for monitoring his mental state regularly and there is no record to show that this was done .", "CARDINAL . Following the visit and assessment by ORG on DATE the evidence I have seen suggests that the standard of care received by PERSON fell below that which he was entitled to expect . PERSON confirmed that Mr PERSON suffered from \u2018 mild chronic PERSON and recommended adding a new form of anti - psychotic medication to his existing regime of anti - psychotic medication . A recommendation was also made on DATE that Mr PERSON not be allowed association until his panic / paranoia had subsided . PERSON ( who had previous knowledge of the patient ) also noted that the patient was not usually violent .", "On DATE ( CARDINAL ) , his mental state was noted to deteriorate with evidence of paranoia and aggression . The change in medication recommended by PERSON was then reversed . On DATE , PERSON concluded that there was no sign of mental illness and pronounced Mr PERSON fit for normal cell location in the punishment block .", "With the benefit of hindsight , it is apparent that Mr PERSON was not fit to be located in the punishment block . CARDINAL things run throughout his medical notes . CARDINAL is his fear of being located anywhere other than the hospital , the second is his tendency towards suicidal behaviour . I believe that the failure to accommodate him in the hospital wing was an important contributory factor to his death .", "In my opinion , it is not possible to justify the reversal of the change in medication recommended by PERSON , without further reference to PERSON ( or another psychiatrist ) . PERSON clear opinion was that the patient was suffering from a psychosis and that the correct treatment was a change in anti - psychotic medication . Dr PERSON \u2019s advice was not followed consistently . For example , PERSON concluded on DATE that there was no sign of mental illness , despite PERSON opinion of DATE and the evidence in the medical notes of paranoia and aggression on CARDINAL . It is most unlikely that the type of mental illness documented by PERSON ( described as chronic ) would have disappeared completely within DATE .", "On the evidence I have seen , I believe that PERSON was incorrect in his judgment ( that there was no mental illness present on DATE ) and that , as a doctor without psychiatric qualification , he should not have taken a different course of action from that recommended by the psychiatrist . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Dr Reveley , a second consultant psychiatrist instructed by the applicant \u2019s solicitors , expressed her opinion on the basis of the inquest proceedings and medical records , including the notes from prison and ORG . She had never met or treated PERSON . Her report included the following :", "\u201c Opinion", "CARDINAL . I am of the view that PERSON suffered from paranoid schizophrenia , paranoid type as defined by the ICD-CARDINAL classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders DATE . CARDINAL of the essential features of this disorder is presence of delusions in the context of a relative preservation of cognitive functioning and affect . The individual suffering from this disorder is therefore generally able to describe the typical examples of hallucinations . Examples of the most common paranoid symptoms included delusions of persecution , grandiose delusions , hallucinatory voices that threaten the patient , hallucinations of taste and smell . There is ample evidence that PERSON suffered from such symptoms during his final prison sentence . Violence and self - harm are often associated with this condition , as indeed they were in the case of PERSON . ORG , CARDINALth edition DATE draws attention to this finding : \u2018 The persecutory themes may predispose the individual to suicidal behaviour , and the combination of persecutory and grandiose delusions with anger may predispose the individual to ORG", "CARDINAL . PERSON was also variously diagnosed as suffering from substance abuse and personality disorder . Neither of these diagnoses is inconsistent with paranoid schizophrenia and they often coexist with that condition . It is also clear PERSON was consistently treated with anti - psychotic medication , and that the prison medical staff impliedly accepted a diagnosis of psychosis by continuing to treat with anti - psychotic medication . Indeed he specifically received a diagnosis of \u2018 mild chronic ORG while in prison . Any diagnosis of psychosis is always of the utmost significance . There are CARDINAL main psychiatric conditions that lead to psychosis : schizophrenia , manic depressive disorder and substance abuse ( e.g. ecstasy , ORG , amphetamines , alcohol , and sometimes cannabis ) . It may be impossible to distinguish between the individual psychotic disorders when someone is first seen by a psychiatrist , and uncertainty about a patient \u2019s diagnosis may remain for DATE . But having said this , there is almost never any disagreement among psychiatrists about whether a patient is psychotic . Indeed psychotic symptoms can be successfully treated with anti - psychotic drugs even where there is some diagnostic confusion about the classification of the psychotic state . The evidence is that the prison medical staff while accepting that there was no formal diagnosis of his mental disorder , continued to treat his psychotic symptoms with anti - psychotic medication . ...", "CARDINAL . PERSON was treated with anti - psychotic medication while in prison . On account of the medication his condition is , apparently , maintained by this medication with the exception of the isolated flare - ups . These isolated incidents are regarded by the prison doctors as discrete episodes of bad behaviour . When there is no observable episode , PERSON appears to have been regarded as mentally well , or at least sufficiently well to be punished by segregation . This is in my view to adopt a dangerously over - simplified view of mental disorder . The analogy would be with someone with a fever who is given fever reducing drugs , and thereafter put outside on a cold DATE \u2019s day on the principle that he is showing no signs of a temperature . In such circumstance no - one would be surprised if there were a recrudescence of the fever . In PERSON case there was a failure by the prison authorities to recognise a fundamental psychiatric truth when they found him fit for the punishment block . They were assessing the mental state of a heavily medicated individual whose underlying problems were being maintained and masked by that medication . ( Despite the finding that he was sufficiently normal for the punishment block I note that there was no indication in the notes that his medication should be discontinued ) .", "CARDINAL . Because PERSON is adjudged to be well , he received no nursing care on the punishment block . Nursing care is not just about the administering of medication . It is vital to the successful management of mental illness , not least because the nurse is a trained observer and can react quickly and effectively where there are indications that an individual \u2019s mental state is a cause for concern . Nursing is primarily the process of looking after physical or emotional needs of patients with the aim or restoring , improving , maintaining , or promoting well - being . The notion of punishment is incompatible with the goals of nursing DATE and indeed with all medical care .", "CARDINAL . An acceptable level of care in the management of PERSON condition during this period would have included a close monitoring of the medication as regards dose and side effects ; a close monitoring of his mental state as regards symptomatology , and as regards any increased risk of self - harm or suicide . There is no evidence that adequate monitoring of this type was performed during DATE of his life .", "CARDINAL . This is particularly surprising in the context of his earlier problems which included self - harm and violent outbursts and given that there had been a number of changes in the medication prescribed during the time he spent in FAC .", "CARDINAL . The nature of schizophrenia is such that there are remissions or periods of less florid symptomatology where the positive symptoms , i.e. those associated with a distortion of normal functioning , are not exhibited . During such periods the so - called negative symptoms may continue to be in evidence . Negative symptoms are symptoms that reflect a diminution or loss of normal functioning . They include affective flattening ( immobility of feature , unresponsiveness , poor eye contact and reduced body language ) , alogia ( poverty of speech which is often manifested by brief , laconic , empty replies , often accompanied by a diminution in the number of thoughts which is reflected in decreased fluency and productivity of speech ) , avolition ( an inability to initiate and persist in goal - directed activities ) and anhedonia ( loss of interest and loss of pleasure in life ) . These negative symptoms account for a substantial degree of morbidity associated with the disorder . They are particularly common in the prodromal ( before episode ) and residual ( after episode ) phases of the disorder , and can often be very severe in their own right . ...", "CARDINAL . It is my view that PERSON was recognisably at a very high risk of deliberate self - harm or suicide . This risk would have been evident even if he had not been placed on the punishment block during DATE of his life . It has been shown that , compared with the general population , people who deliberately harm themselves experience CARDINAL times as many stressful life problems in DATE before the act . The events are various but a recent quarrel with a spouse , girlfriend , or boyfriend is particularly common and other events include separation from or rejection by a sexual partner , and a ORG appearance . CARDINAL of all people who harm themselves are suffering from a Personality disorder . Several studies agree that there are a number of factors that seem to distinguish patients who go on to repeat deliberate self - harm . These include previous psychosis , personality disorder of the anti - social type , criminal record , alcohol or drug abuse , lower social class , and a history of unemployment . It is also significant that among patients who have been involved in an earlier episode of deliberate self - harm , the suicide rate in the subsequent DATE is CARDINAL times greater than in the general population .", "CARDINAL . As regards the risk of completed suicide , studies show that prisoners have a higher suicide risk than the general population , and that CARDINAL in CARDINAL of all those suffering from schizophrenia end their own lives , and that CARDINAL of all those who take their own lives are being treated with psychotropic drugs . ( The above statistics are taken from ORG , ORG , DATE , and are widely accepted . )", "CARDINAL . It is not possible to quantify precisely what the degree of risk as regards self - harm or suicide was for PERSON , It is my opinion that he was recognisably in one of the very highest risk groups and that following his removal to the punishment block it was more likely than not that there would be some episode of self - harm during the period of his seclusion . This being the case , I am of the view that the failure to recognise this risk meant that his treatment during DATE of his life fell substantially below acceptable standards of care . ...", "CARDINAL . Individuals with paranoid delusions can often be helped by psychological support , encouragement and assurance . During treatment best results are achieved if doctor / nurse maintains a good relationship with the individual , and is dependable and avoids letting the patient down . He should show compassionate interest in the individual \u2019s delusions , but without colluding in them , or condemning them , and most importantly without ignoring them . The treatment PERSON received in the punishment block fell far short of this model .", "CARDINAL . In my view the way in which PERSON , an individual suffering from paranoid schizophrenia , was treated , was likely to arouse in him feelings of hopelessness , fear , anguish , and inferiority . The circumstances of his imprisonment on the punishment block were humiliating , debasing and degrading , and had the effect of undermining his will to cope with , and battle against , his psychotic illness . His will to resist the illness was cumulatively undermined and resulted in the taking of his own life . The prison regime to which he was subjected disregarded his basic right as an ill person to be medically treated and properly cared for and thereby broke his will to endure imprisonment . LAW declares that \u2018 Any act or advice which could weaken physical or mental resistance of a human being may be used only in his interest\u2019 . The acts performed and the advice given by medical staff in respect of PERSON treatment were manifestly not in his interest . What he suffered during DATE of his life was likely to have been terrifying , and I use that word advisedly , in its original sense of instilling terror . I have treated many paranoid schizophrenics and I have never doubted their capacity to believe absolutely in the apparent threats created by their delusions . A punishment that requires a psychotic individual to face those threats alone and without proper medical support is wholly unacceptable , and in my view constitutes an inhuman and degrading punishment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

It was prescribed not as an anti - psychotic but as a tranquilliser on the basis of the above . My conversation with PERSON and my prescribing PERSON are in fact separate entries in the IMR and it is important to refer to the original IMR entries rather than my witness statement . I recall I was reluctant to prescribe PERSON because of the paucity of symptoms and signs of psychosis . As far as I can recall , PERSON gave no reason why he did not want to continue his NORP except that he received no benefit from it and he was adamant that he felt better on PERSON and PERSON . It is important to note that I do not recall that he had experienced any side effects due to ORG which might have limited my prescribing PERSON . Both PERSON and PERSON put great weight upon his medication indicating a diagnosis \u2013 this was not the case .

Please see my entry for DATE , \u2018 owes on the wing hence ca n\u2019t cope\u2019 . The reports do not refer to this . If he owed on the wing it is highly likely that he would be threatened with food contamination , this would represent reality rather than paranoia , and there is always the possibility that the noose was made so that he could return to the sanctuary of the hospital . A prepared noose is enough indication in itself for hospitalisation and TIME watch irrespective of mental state rather than implying a disturbed mental state in itself as described by Dr GPE .", "The entry for CARDINAL in the IMR , \u201c to assess DATE \u201d , was cancelled by my hand probably fairly soon after it was written ( most likely on DATE same pen ) . The interpretation of this was that there was no indication that he needed to see PERSON and that he was well and symptom - free . He was noted fit for work and gym . No contemporaneous record was made because there was nothing of import to note .", "It is appropriate here to observe that while there is an agreed paucity of notes at some ( and only some ) stages of the IMR ... nil entries may be taken as indication that no abnormality or overt disorder was present .", "On the segregation wing all prisoners are medically screened before adjudication and the range of punishments known to the doctor . The duty doctor does the round in the segregation unit before the Governor attends there so that any new inmates located there can be medically checked prior to the Governor \u2019s adjudications . All inmates in the segregation unit are seen every day by the duty doctor . If an inmate in the segregation unit becomes ill so that hospital care is indicated he is promptly transferred to the hospital . A diagnosis of a mild chronic psychosis is not a contra - indication per se for transferring to the segregation unit \u2013 indeed the daily visits by the Governor , Doctor and Chaplain provide a greater degree of observation and care than possible on the main wings . I do not think that Mr PERSON would have been continuously an in - patient in a psychiatric hospital were he in the community . I must agree that the segregation unit generally is not conducive to mental well - being but all prison medical staff are trained in and are highly aware of the effects of imprisonment and segregation and review each inmate on the segregation unit DATE with this in mind . The duty doctor \u2019s DATE visits to the segregation unit to assess Mr PERSON \u2019s medical state included judging whether his medication level was appropriate and whether he was a suicidal risk . Dr PERSON \u2019s implication that medical staff connive with the \u2018 authorities\u2019 to punish is totally untrue . We provide medical care and our ethical stance is concerned with this and this alone . We hold ORG meetings regularly at which our ethical stance is clearly outlined . This is something I know we all care about passionately and is the cornerstone of the medicine all of us practise here .", "I am not of the opinion that PERSON suffered from paranoid schizophrenia . This is based on my own observations and Dr Roberts\u2019 doubt about his diagnosis ( and he was the Psychiatrist who had observed him as an in - patient the most recently prior to his reception ) .

PERSON is not a forensic psychiatrist and appears unfamiliar with prison medical care . Her comments are emotive rather than objective .", "PERSON was known to us as an impulsive , self - harming and aggressive man who periodically had episodes when he described paranoid feelings and vague delusional symptoms .

Having made this diagnosis they say his fears and anxieties must have been due to an underlying delusional state . This is an assumption based on the belief that PERSON was schizophrenic . On the basis of their assumption that PERSON was seriously mentally ill it is also asserted that the prison should have anticipated his suicidal tendencies and taken better precautions and not subjected him to the privation of the punishment block .", "CARDINAL . The prison was not staffed by consultant psychiatrists . The doctors there would very properly rely on the opinion of the ORG specialists who had been caring for their inmates before imprisonment .

It is true that Dr PERSON had also treated PERSON in the past and had described him as suffering from \u2018 a mild chronic PERSON . This is not a specific diagnosis but a general description . In any case PERSON did not consider PERSON so ill as to require treatment in psychiatric hospital . He indicated , like PERSON , that PERSON would have short lived periods of psychosis ( and panics ) at which time he would need special care and treatment . He recommended that PERSON not be given association until recovered from his \u2018 panic and paranoia\u2019 . This recommendation seems to have been met .", "CARDINAL . The staff in GPE proceeded along the lines outlined by PERSON giving the medication he recommended in the hope of reducing PERSON \u2019s symptoms e.g. his volatility , his poor response to stress and his tendency to transient psychotic periods . They also admitted PERSON to the ORG when his condition appeared to deteriorate .", "CARDINAL . Much of PERSON \u2019s behaviour can be understood as manipulative to escape the pressures of the ordinary wings into the relative peace of the ORG . There is no evidence that the fears he expressed about being attacked on the wings were not understandable or even reasonable ones . There is no reason , given Dr Roberts\u2019 diagnosis , not to accept PERSON \u2019s account at face value . Where there were episodes which might have been psychotic ones ( e.g. when he claimed to be PERSON and hearing voices ) he was taken into the ORG and appeared to recover quickly as PERSON indicated he would .", "CARDINAL .

PERSON obviously was initially angered by the punishment given out on CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL though he seemed to have overcome his anger . There was no evidence that he had become psychotic . His worries ( CARDINAL ) about his access to the shop being stopped by the governor were perfectly understandable . It is not necessary to postulate mental illness to explain them . I conclude that the medical management of PERSON during his stay in GPE prison was perfectly reasonable particularly given the opinion of PERSON . We do not know what PERSON intended on TIME of CARDINAL . The pattern was very similar to previous life threatening attempts with a warning to others so he might be saved . Perhaps he had decided that he could not or would not face a further period on the punishment block and that he would demonstrate this by the attempt during which he would be saved and returned to the ORG .
