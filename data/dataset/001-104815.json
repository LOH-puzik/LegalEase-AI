He is represented before the Court by Mr A. Yum and Mr PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the Governorship of GPE expropriated a CARDINAL sq . m plot of land belonging to the applicant ( block no . CARDINAL , plot no . DATE ) , located in the Kocasinan So\u011fanl\u0131bah\u00e7e region of GPE , GPE , to be used as a public school yard . It assessed the value of the land at MONEY ( TRL ) , that is , TRL CARDINAL per sq . m.", "On DATE the administration sought to notify the applicant of the expropriation decision through a notary public . However , this notification did not reach the applicant as the service was made at the wrong address .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer obtained the expropriation decision from ORG in person and the expropriation was thus finalised .", "On DATE , within the DATE prescription period stipulated in section QUANTITY of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) , the applicant brought an action before ORG for additional expropriation compensation . He requested GPE CARDINAL in additional compensation , valuing the land at FAC per sq . m , and reserved the right to increase this claim . He did not request payment of interest .", "On DATE the ownership of the plot of land was transferred to the administration in the title deed register .", "On DATE the administration paid the applicant the previously assessed amount of TRL CARDINAL as compensation for expropriation .", "On DATE the committee of experts appointed by ORG assessed the value of the land at FAC per sq . m. This evaluation was made on the basis of the value of the land on DATE , the date on which the applicant \u2019s lawyer was notified of the expropriation decision . The experts , however , noted that the compensation to be paid to the applicant at the end of the proceedings should be limited to his original claim in accordance with the relevant procedural rules .", "On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s lawyer submitted a petition to ORG , requesting that court , firstly , to apply interest on the amount of compensation to be awarded , and secondly to grant them additional time to bring an additional action ( \u201c ek dava \u201d ) to be able to claim an increased amount in compensation for the land .", "At the hearing held on DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer repeated his claim regarding the interest but did not bring up the request for an additional action . At the end of the hearing , ORG declared that the request regarding the interest would be entertained . It did not , however , take any decision on the request regarding an additional action , which had been made out of time .", "Given the considerable discrepancy between the experts\u2019 evaluation and that of the administration , the court appointed another committee of experts to report on the value of the land . This new committee conducted an examination on DATE and valued the land at TRL CARDINAL per sq . m as on DATE . However , it was again noted that the additional compensation was to be limited to the applicant \u2019s original claim .", "On DATE the ORG accepted the applicant \u2019s claim in full and awarded him GPE CARDINAL in additional compensation , plus interest at the statutory rate running from DATE . That court stated that although the value of the land at the relevant time had been assessed to be higher in the expert reports , it was bound by the applicant \u2019s claim of GPE CARDINAL , and therefore could not award him a higher amount .", "On an unspecified date , the applicant appealed against the judgment of the firstinstance court . He complained in particular that the value of his land had increased dramatically DATE , the date when he had brought the case before ORG , and DATE , the date when the second expert report had been obtained . In these circumstances , the insistence of the first - instance court on being bound by his initial claim had caused him significant financial loss . Having been obliged to bring his claim within the DATE prescription period , he could not possibly have foreseen such a radical increase in the value of his land .", "On DATE ORG upheld the judgment of ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for rectification of its previous decision . That decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the administration paid the applicant TRL CARDINAL in additional compensation , including interest .", "According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , the owner of an expropriated property may , within DATE of notification of the expropriation decision , bring an action to challenge the amount of compensation assessed by the authorities .", "According to LAW , the civil courts are bound by the claims of the parties and may not award a higher amount than requested ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
