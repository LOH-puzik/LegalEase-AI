The President explained that the case could be reopened due to the discovery of new facts only if such new facts had existed at the time of examination of the case by the first - instance court , but were unknown to the court at that time . However , since the new plot of land was transferred to the Company in DATE , after the judgment of DATE had entered into force , it could not be considered as a basis for reopening of the proceedings .

On DATE BCEA notified the applicant that the issue of the compensation was referred to ORG .
