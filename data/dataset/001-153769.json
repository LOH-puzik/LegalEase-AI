The undercover agents were necessary in the operation because the individuals in question \u201c belonged to a drug - dealing network which acted very cautiously , taking a lot of precautions in their activities and relying exclusively on highly trustworthy persons \u201d .", "On DATE , the prosecutor authorised the undercover agents ORG and GPE to be provided with MONEY ( ORG ) , to be taken from the special funds of the police , with the purpose of using it to purchase the drugs .", "CARDINAL . On TIME the applicants entered GPE and met GPE in a petrol station in GPE . Subsequently , they requested to be directed to a mechanical workshop , where they asked to be left alone .

In his statement given before the prosecutor on DATE , the first applicant declared that he and the second applicant had come to GPE for personal reasons , namely to visit relatives . He claimed that they had intended to spend TIME at the home of GPE , a friend of theirs , and that they had no knowledge of the content of the plastic bags found in the garage .", "The second applicant refused to give any statements , claiming that he was overwhelmed by the situation .", "On DATE the first applicant specified before the prosecutor that when they had been in the garage , the CARDINAL individuals who had entered with S.R.B. had taken some plastic bags out of another car that was parked in the garage , and had placed them on a table . A third person who had come in later had taken out some money and asked him and the second applicant to count it , without indicating why .", "CARDINAL .

During the proceedings before the first - instance court , namely until the hearing of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the applicants pleaded not guilty , claiming that they had had no knowledge of the plastic bags , which they believed had been placed in the garage by the CARDINAL persons who had accompanied GPE , in order to set them up .", "Up until the same hearing , GPE , legally assisted by PERSON PERSON PERSON PERSON and his substitute lawyer , Mr GPE , maintained the statements he had given before the investigating authorities .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of DATE the court watched the video recordings made on TIME to CARDINAL DATE , in the presence of the applicants , S.R.B. and their respective lawyers . The recordings were not contested and their authenticity was not questioned .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE , the applicants , then represented by lawyer GPE , changed their plea and claimed that they had been pushed to commit the offence by the investigators , who had acted as agents provocateurs . They invoked in their defence the ORG \u2019s case - law in relation to police entrapment , namely PERSON v. GPE ( DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-IV ) and PERSON GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "The applicants contended that they had first declined GPE \u2019s proposal , but had finally agreed to deliver the drugs to GPE in order to help GPE , who had claimed that he had been facing financial difficulties .

Each time he had refused ORG \u2019s proposal , and each time the latter had increased his offer , namely from QUANTITY per pill initially to the final price of QUANTITY per pill .", "At the same hearing , S.R.B. also changed his statement and alleged that he had been coerced by the police to act as he had . He stated that during the telephone negotiations , the investigating authorities had asked him to increase both the quantity of pills requested and their price so that the first applicant would accept the transaction . He claimed that he had known the applicants as drug consumers , but not as drug dealers . He mentioned that some of the conversations he had had with the first applicant on a mobile phone had been recorded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG sentenced the applicants to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for drug trafficking . In its ruling , the court relied on the video recordings made on DATE on which the applicants had been caught red - handed by Timi\u015f police officers , as well as on the statements given by witnesses , including GPE and the undercover agents .", "The court ruled that the procedure used by the applicants to conceal the drugs showed that they were experienced in international trafficking of narcotic drugs and had sought to make a significant profit , while the operation to catch them red - handed could not be considered as entrapment . The court found that the method used by the applicants to hide the drugs in the cavities of the front passenger seat of the vehicle and the large quantity of drugs that they managed to transport across several borders showed that they were not unfamiliar with drug trafficking .", "The court held that GPE \u2019s change of testimony could not be taken into account , as there was no other evidence to corroborate it and it contradicted his previous testimonies .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed against that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Timi\u015foara Court of Appeal heard the applicants and S.R.B. They all maintained their previous statements according to which GPE , coerced by the police , had incited the applicants to commit the crime .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing , the applicants also submitted a request that the prosecution make available the recordings of the telephone conversations between GPE and the first applicant , or at least a list of those conversations and of the telephones used . The applicants argued that the recordings proved on the one hand that S.R.B. had been coerced to cooperate with the police and on the other hand that there had been a high degree of incitement in the negotiations in order to persuade them to accept the deal .", "The court allowed the request .", "On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office attached to ORG and ORG submitted that such recordings did not exist because the court had not been requested to authorise the recording of the phone conversations . Furthermore , according to the indictment , it was S.R.B. who had asked to be allowed to contact the applicants , under the supervision of the prosecutor , in order to take advantage of the lenient conditions prescribed in LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . By its judgment of DATE , the appellate court upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment .", "The court stated that the authorities had been legally entitled to bring to the attention of GPE the benefits of cooperating with the police by virtue of LAW of PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL , a reduction of his sentence .", "The ORG allegation that they had been entrapped was refuted by the court , which noted that the international case - law they had invoked was not applicable . In the case of PERSON , the undercover agent and the collaborator had dealt with the applicant in person , while in PERSON the applicant had been contacted by the agent claiming to be an acquaintance of the collaborator , whereas in the present case the applicants had never been contacted by the undercover agents , since GPE had taken the initiative to ask to be allowed to make contact with the applicants in order to benefit from LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL .", "Furthermore , in the present case the applicants had freely chosen to travel to GPE with the drugs . Nothing had prevented them from refusing PERSON \u2019s proposal .", "CARDINAL . The applicants further appealed against that judgment . They maintained before ORG and ORG that they had been entrapped , having been incited to sell drugs by S.R.B. He in turn had been forced to incite them to do so by the investigators , who had promised him a reduction in his sentence .", "The applicants also denounced the use of the undercover officer ORG , who had sought , through GPE , to purchase the drugs .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE , ORG and Justice , taking into account as a mitigating factor the applicants\u2019 lack of a previous criminal record , partly allowed the appeal and reduced their sentences to DATE imprisonment . ORG upheld the lower courts\u2019 reasoning in dismissing the entrapment pleas . It held that GPE , interested in the reduction of his sentence , had collaborated with the police and contacted the applicants in order to buy drugs ; however , the applicants had had the opportunity to refuse the transaction proposed by him . Therefore , the court considered that the applicants\u2019 pleas of entrapment were unfounded .", "B. Conditions of detention", "CARDINAL .
