According to E.M.L. , on TIME in question , the applicant asked for a meeting with ORG , so he and E.M.L. drove to the villa in V\u0161enory .

NORP In addition to taking statements from the witnesses , the NORP authorities examined and recorded the scene of the crime , and performed a forensic examination of ORG \u2019s body and a ballistic examination of the bullets and cases found at the scene of the shooting . After the investigation was concluded , the competent prosecutor charged the applicant with the murder of ORG The indictment was served on his court - appointed lawyer on DATE . However , since the applicant was eventually found to have gone back to GPE and voluntarily begun serving a prison sentence for an unrelated offence , the NORP authorities contacted the NORP authorities , seeking to take over the proceedings against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In DATE jurisdiction over the case was transferred to the ORG . When questioned by the investigating judge on DATE , the applicant stated that ORG and E.M.L. had come to the villa threatening them . E.M.L. was carrying a gun and forced the applicant to lie down on the floor , while ORG ran into the bedroom . The applicant heard some commotion and then a few shots were fired . TIME left the villa . The applicant followed him out and saw another , unknown man standing outside by the car .

The applicant went back inside and saw ORG \u2019s dead body in the bedroom . The applicant , GPE and GPE later drove away in their car , but were afraid to go to the police for fear of being killed .", "CARDINAL . In a statement made on DATE the applicant \u2019s brother PERSON confessed to the murder of CARDINAL He was subsequently questioned by the investigating judge on DATE and stated that he had been woken up by the arrival of CARDINAL and E.M.L. The DATE before , he had bought a gun for protection from the applicant \u2019s business competitors , which he had put under the pillow . Hearing the visitors , LOC tucked the gun into his belt and got out of bed . The door to the bedroom suddenly opened and H.C.Z. came into the room , while another , dark - skinned man ( E.M.L. ) stood at the door , holding something in his hand . GPE heard someone say \u201c He \u2019s got a gun \u201d , and understood that it was E.M.L. who was holding a gun . LOC pulled out his own gun and pointed it at H.C.Z. to show that he would defend himself if attacked . However , ORG laughed and approached him , so ORG fired a warning shot at the floor . H.C.Z. nevertheless came close to him and hit him in the face . PERSON then fired a shot at him in self - defence ; nevertheless CARDINAL attacked him and tried to push him to the ground . When ORG managed to break free from ORG \u2019s grip , he fired again , this time hitting ORG who staggered away and fell to the bed . ORG stated that he was holding the gun at waist level , trying at the same time to get free from ORG \u2019s grip , and that the shots were fired from that position .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , he and CARDINAL were the only CARDINAL people in the bedroom , the applicant and GPE having been forced to lie down on the floor by E.M.L. When LOC looked in to the other room they were getting up from the floor . The applicant and GPE told FAC that another person was standing in front of the villa . They were all scared , so they packed their things and drove away . ORG added that he had thrown the gun away at their first stop on the motorway , still in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE A.S. was questioned by the investigating judge and stated that he had opened the door when the bell rang . The applicant also came out of the bedroom . H.C.Z. and E.M.L. entered the villa , E.M.L. ordering GPE and the applicant to lie on the floor in the corridor . E.M.L. was holding a gun . H.C.Z. moved forward into the living room . GPE then heard CARDINAL or QUANTITY shots being fired inside the villa . He waited TIME and when he lifted his head , E.M.L. was gone . PERSON came out into the corridor , holding a gun in his hand . The applicant , GPE and FAC then went into the bedroom to check on ORG , whom they found dead .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the district state prosecutor \u2019s office lodged an indictment charging the applicant with murder . At the trial hearing conducted by the ORG the applicant changed his statement , claiming that when the doorbell had rung he had been in the bedroom collecting some business - related documents , while his brother PERSON had been lying on the bed . He had heard hissing sounds from the other room , so he went out to check what was happening , but was stopped at the bedroom door by ORG , who grabbed him by the chest with one hand and signalled to E.M.L. with the other . ORG dragged the applicant out of the bedroom and across the living room and then he went back into the bedroom . The applicant saw his brother get up from the bed and point his gun at ORG Meanwhile , E.M.L. , who had a gun in his hand , ordered the applicant to lie down on the floor . Kneeling down , the applicant saw H.C.Z. hit M.\u0160. in the bedroom , and he also saw that FAC was holding a gun . Then he heard four shots . After the shooting stopped , E.M.L. ran away , shouting that they were all finished . The applicant , who followed him out , saw a silhouette of another man standing beside a car parked outside . The applicant , FAC and GPE were afraid of retaliation for ORG \u2019s death , so they quickly escaped .", "CARDINAL . When faced with inconsistencies between his previous statement made during the investigation and the account he gave at the trial , the applicant explained that he had not wished to implicate his brother in ORG \u2019s death and that he had been in poor health when he had given his previous statement .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s brother PERSON again asserted that he had thrown the gun with which he had shot H.C.Z. away once they had reached the motorway and started to feel safer . Moreover , PERSON stated that he did not think that he could be mistaken for his brother , as the applicant was more strongly built and dressed in a higher - class way .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the forensic analysis of the crime scene and the case file submitted to the NORP authorities by the NORP authorities , a forensic ballistic report was prepared by a ballistic expert , GPE He found that ORG had suffered CARDINAL gunshot wounds , one to the front of his chest , another to the right side of his stomach and the third to his left arm . The expert found that ORG had been shot in the stomach at a range of QUANTITY ; however , the gun barrel did not touch his body at the moment of impact . However , the bullets which had hit ORG \u2019s left arm and chest were fired from QUANTITY away . Considering that CARDINAL bullets and CARDINAL cartridge cases were found at the crime scene , GPE presumed that CARDINAL shot hit the wall either directly or after causing a wound to ORG \u2019s left arm , and that the force of the impact caused the bullet to shatter . Another bullet was found in ORG \u2019s chest , while the bullet that had entered his stomach had exited his body under the shoulder blade . According to the expert , at the moment of the shooting ORG was entering the room , while the shooter was inside the room , firing all CARDINAL shots while standing . Having regard to these considerations , PERSON was of the view that the account of the events given by E.M.L. was both possible and likelier than the account given by ORG , which was not possible at all . No shot had been fired at the floor , and no shot had been fired while the shooter and H.C.Z. were in direct contact as described by GPE", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , a medical report establishing the cause of ORG \u2019s death was prepared , also on the basis of the NORP case file . Medical expert GPE found that ORG had died as a result of internal bleeding which was due to trauma caused by gunshot wounds to his body . He was hit by CARDINAL or CARDINAL bullets , twice from a distance of QUANTITY and once from a distance of QUANTITY . Given the direction of the bullets and the angle at which they entered ORG \u2019s body , ORG concluded that the shooter and the victim were standing facing each other and that the victim was QUANTITY taller than the shooter . Also , GPE confirmed that the injuries to H.C.Z. \u2019s body were consistent with the account given by E.M.L. , while ORG account did not correspond to the forensic conclusions .", "CARDINAL . E.M.L. was summoned to the trial hearing but did not appear . The applicant nevertheless requested the opportunity to cross - examine him in order to clarify the circumstances of the shooting and the exact positions of everyone who was in the bedroom at the material time . GPE and CARDINAL other witnesses did not appear at the trial hearing either . The trial court decided to read out the statements they had given during the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG found the applicant guilty of murdering ORG and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . Both the district prosecutor and the applicant appealed against the judgment , and on DATE ORG granted the prosecutor \u2019s appeal , increasing the applicant \u2019s prison sentence to DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a request for the protection of legality ( appeal on points of law , an extraordinary legal remedy ) before ORG , which was granted on DATE . The applicant \u2019s complaint that he should have been given the opportunity to cross - examine E.M.L. and other foreign witnesses was found to be well grounded , and the case was remitted to ORG for re - examination with the instruction that the applicant be given the opportunity to cross - examine E.M.L. , who was considered the key witness in the case against him .", "CARDINAL . During the re - trial , the ORG obtained a ballistic report prepared by the NORP experts , which corresponded to the conclusions of the NORP expert GPE about the number of shots fired and the trajectories of the bullets . The applicant , however , who by then had regained his liberty , obtained a report prepared by another ballistic expert , PERSON , who criticised on certain points of the report prepared by the expert ORG In particular , PERSON took the view that the shots could have been fired from a closer range than that established by ORG , and that the latter \u2019s conclusion that ORG had been standing at the moment of impact was not supported by the available material evidence . In this light , the applicant requested ORG to appoint a new ballistic expert and to perform a special CARDINALD reconstruction of the crime scene .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also summoned E.M.L. , GPE and a certain PERSON , who had also been involved in the internet services featuring interactive sexual content , to testify at the hearing scheduled for DATE . However , on that date none of the witnesses appeared before the court , so ORG requested legal assistance from the NORP and NORP judicial authorities , asking its foreign counterparts to hear the CARDINAL witnesses in the applicant \u2019s presence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was questioned by ORG in PERSON , GPE , in the presence of the applicant and his counsel . PERSON again testified that on TIME of the events at issue , ORG and E.M.L. had come into the living room asking for the applicant . Then ORG went into the bedroom , while E.M.L. stopped at the door . PERSON did not remember hearing any voices , but immediately after H.C.Z. stepped inside GPE heard CARDINAL shots being fired in the bedroom . PERSON , frightened , went into the corner of the room and saw E.M.L. running through the room , followed by the applicant , GPE and GPE , who was holding a gun . However , PERSON pointed out that she could not see into the bedroom and could not say who had fired the shots .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge of ORG of The Hague , examined E.M.L. , who gave essentially the same account of events as during the investigation , reiterating that he was entirely convinced that the person who had shot H.C.Z. was the applicant , while another man very similar to the applicant had also been present in the bedroom where the shooting had taken place . E.M.L. declared that he would not be willing to appear at the trial in GPE or in GPE because he was afraid for his life , adding that he was ready to cooperate , but only in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . The investigating judge also heard A.B. , who had testified that the applicant had worked for him in GPE but had then tried to take over his business and had threatened him several times , also with a gun . Moreover , PERSON stated that he had warned ORG about the applicant , but the latter would not be intimidated and left for GPE anyway .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE the ORG established that the applicant and his counsel had not been notified about the questioning of E.M.L. and PERSON due to the urgency of the matter . The court decided to request the NORP authorities to give the applicant the opportunity to cross - examine those witnesses ; however , the investigating judge of ORG of The GPE refused to allow the applicant to attend the examination in person , finding that the ORG safety could be at risk and that they might not be willing to give a statement . Having been informed about the decision of the NORP investigating judge , the applicant insisted , at the hearing on DATE , that he should be given the opportunity to personally confront E.M.L. , or else the latter \u2019s statement should be excluded from evidence .", "CARDINAL . The second examination of E.M.L. and PERSON on DATE was conducted in the presence of the applicant \u2019s counsel , who asked them a number of questions , some of which had been previously prepared by the applicant . PERSON \u2019s testimony mostly concerned his and the applicant \u2019s role in the business they had been involved in in GPE . As regards E.M.L. \u2019s testimony regarding the shooting of ORG , it was to a large extent consistent with his previous statements ; however , when asked to identify on the floor plan of the bedroom where the shooting had taken place the location of the applicant and that of his brother PERSON , E.M.L. showed opposite positions to the ones he had shown when questioned by the NORP police in DATE and by the NORP investigating judge for the first time . Alerted to the similarity between the applicant and his brother , E.M.L. responded that he had definitely recognised the applicant at the material time . When asked if he could still recognise the applicant and GPE and distinguish between them , E.M.L. responded that he had only seen the applicant twice , but thought that he could recognise him , although he could not say so with certainty . However , he acknowledged that as he had only seen the applicant \u2019s brother PERSON once , and that very briefly , he was not certain he could still tell the difference between them . Lastly , E.M.L. emphasised again that he was not willing to attend the trial in GPE , adding that neither would he consent to being questioned by video link if that meant that the applicant could see him .", "CARDINAL . E.M.L. \u2019s and PERSON \u2019s statements were later read out at the hearing before the ORG in accordance with the rules of domestic criminal procedure ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ) which provide that a witness \u2019s statement may be read out if he or she lives abroad and fails to appear at a hearing despite being duly summoned . Hearing E.M.L. \u2019s testimony , the applicant commented that E.M.L. had switched the positions of himself and his brother during the shooting , which meant that he had confused the CARDINAL brothers for one another .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE PERSON ORG stopped the applicant and found a gun in his car . The applicant told the officers that the gun had been used in the DATE murder in GPE . He further alleged at the trial that his brother PERSON had told him where he had discarded the gun back in DATE . Returning from GPE , where he had been at the hearing of GPE , the applicant had gone to find the gun . LOC supported the applicant \u2019s account of events by specifying that he had not thrown the gun away , as previously stated . He had in fact hidden it under a concrete plate and had later drawn a map showing the approximate location of the gun , so that the applicant would be able to find it . Ballistic expert GPE established that the gun corresponded with the model and the calibre used in the murder of NORP Moreover , the gun was clean and oiled , with no traces of corrosion or any other imperfections . ORG thus concluded that the gun could not have been left out in the open for DATE . The NORP ballistic experts confirmed that the bullets and cartridge cases submitted to them by the NORP authorities matched the bullets and cartridge cases found at the crime scene and in ORG \u2019s body , and had undoubtedly been fired from the same weapon .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , ballistic expert GPE and medical expert GPE were heard by the ORG and explained the conclusions of their reports . The applicant , not persuaded by their statements , reiterated his request for further ballistic analysis and a CARDINALD reconstruction of the crime scene ; however , ORG dismissed his request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG delivered a judgment finding the applicant guilty of ORG \u2019s murder and sentenced him to DATE in prison . Noting that the applicant could not be present at the examination of E.M.L. and PERSON in the GPE because of the decision of the NORP investigating judge , which fell beyond the jurisdiction of the NORP courts , ORG nonetheless concluded that since the applicant \u2019s counsel was present and moreover had submitted questions written by the applicant to both witnesses , the applicant \u2019s defence rights were not violated .", "CARDINAL . Moreover , ORG explained that it had refused the applicant \u2019s request for a CARDINALD forensic reconstruction because ballistic expert ORG \u2019s request for another ballistic expert to be appointed , ORG pointed out that any doubts raised by the ballistic report prepared by the defence \u2019s expert PERSON had been removed by the questioning of experts GPE and GPE at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . In its conclusion that it was the applicant who had shot H.C.Z. , ORG relied on the testimony given by E.M.L. The court noted that , when cross - examined by the applicant \u2019s counsel , E.M.L. had confused the position of the applicant and FAC on the floor plan of the bedroom , but nonetheless found that his statement regarding the identity of the shooter was persuasive , since he had known the applicant and had maintained throughout the proceedings that he had seen him pulling a gun and firing a shot at H.C.Z. The account given by E.M.L. was further corroborated by forensic evidence and the testimony of PERSON regarding the sequence of events . Moreover , it was noted that PERSON had not seen E.M.L. carry a gun , as had been alleged by the applicant , GPE and GPE", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicant \u2019s motive for shooting ORG , ORG examined in great detail his role in the business in which he had been involved , and referred to his apparent dispute with the NORP partners . Finally , the court pointed out numerous discrepancies between the applicant \u2019s statements given during the investigation and at the trial , and the fact that the gun with which ORG had been killed had been found in the applicant \u2019s possession . ORG did not believe the applicant \u2019s and ORG statement that the gun had been hidden under a concrete plate alongside a NORP motorway and then found DATE , intact and oiled , by the applicant . As regards ORG testimony , the court found it unreliable . In particular , it found that ORG account of the shooting was not supported by the forensic evidence taken at the scene of the crime or by the entry and exit wounds found on ORG \u2019s body .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment , raising , inter alia , the argument that he should have had the opportunity to cross - examine E.M.L. in person , either in the courtroom or by video link .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that ORG had properly assessed the evidence , and that the applicant \u2019s defence rights had not been violated on account of his inability to cross - examine E.M.L. in person . It noted that the grounds relied on by the investigating judge in GPE , who refused to allow the applicant \u2019s presence at the examination , were identical to those provided in section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG . It concluded that the applicant \u2019s defence rights had been safeguarded by the attendance of his lawyer at E.M.L. \u2019s examination . It further noted that E.M.L. had provided credible and consistent testimony , which had not been refuted by any of the expert reports ; in addition , his account of the events leading to the shooting and his escape from the villa was confirmed by GPE", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided on the applicant \u2019s request for the protection of legality . It rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint of a violation of his defence rights due because he did not have the opportunity to cross - examine the main witness for the prosecution , finding that the applicant had been familiar with E.M.L. \u2019s testimony and had had an adequate and sufficient opportunity to effectively challenge it through the assistance of his counsel . Moreover , in response to the applicant \u2019s assertion that E.M.L. had confused him for his brother , ORG observed that E.M.L. had been viewed by the lower courts as a reliable and credible witness because his testimony had been consistent throughout the proceedings , including his identification of the applicant as the shooter . Moreover , E.M.L. \u2019s statement had been corroborated by other evidence , in particular by PERSON \u2019s testimony . ORG emphasised that the defence had been acquainted with E.M.L. \u2019s initial statement given to the NORP authorities and thus in the position to effectively challenge the reliability and veracity of his testimony . In ORG opinion , the applicant \u2019s counsel had used this opportunity at the hearing of E.M.L. in GPE , where she had asked , inter alia , a number of questions relating to the reliability of E.M.L. \u2019s identification of the shooter . Therefore , although the applicant had not been present during E.M.L. \u2019s cross - examination , ORG was convinced that his rights of defence had not been violated .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently appealed to ORG , which on DATE declared his constitutional complaint inadmissible ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "6-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["6-3-d"]}
