The first article stated that after the Kursk had sunk a series of knocks making an ORG signal in PERSON code had been audible from the stern part of the submarine . NORP officials , including the then ORG , had refused to consider those knocks a plea for rescue , and had established that the noise had originated outside the stern part of the submarine .

It found that it had been established that the newspaper had indeed disseminated information concerning the claimants . It further found that the information in question was damaging to the claimants\u2019 reputation for the following reasons . The allegations that investigators and experts had tried to help the ORG officers escape criminal responsibility had suggested that these officials had lacked the requisite impartiality when performing their duties . ORG found the expression \u201c to help escape criminal responsibility \u201d defamatory , as it contained an allegation of criminal conduct . The applicants had failed to provide evidence that the claimants had committed a crime . ORG dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicants\u2019 reference to the fact that the second article had merely reproduced GPE \u2019s position as reflected in his book . Furthermore , ORG reasoned that the applicants had been under an obligation to verify the truthfulness of the information before publishing it .
