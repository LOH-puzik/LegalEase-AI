On DATE an article entitled \" Mix - Xena tax - Xandir \" ( From ORG ) appeared in the applicant \u2019s periodical commenting on a particular parliamentary debate in ORG , which had been broadcast live on television . The article included the following passages :", "\" SEND IN THE CLOWN", "Some felt offended that I had lately written that , during the budget debates , I went berserk and started throwing tomatoes at the television set . And this happened when certain Members of ORG had not as yet spoken in the debates . I will let your fertile imagination take its course to imagine what I did when CARDINAL of them in particular were speaking .", "THE PARLIAMENTARY CLOWN", "I do not know if I shall be in breach of LAW if I describe a minister as a clown . But I can not fail to comment on PERSON behaviour in ORG . It seems that PERSON deliberately tried to make us laugh . If this is so , PERSON is ridiculing what is supposed to be the highest institution of the land .", "Let us see what PERSON was up to . His first sentence was meant to raise some laughs as he maintained that PERSON , a NORP Member of ORG , badly needed a pair of spectacles . This was rather a flat joke . Then he started calling names PERSON [ a NORP Member of ORG ] and described the latter as a man who lacked principles . Then he tried to make us laugh once again when he referred to the killing of pigs . Anyway , he tried to play the clown once , twice and even CARDINAL times . And some of his jokes were rather vulgar .", "I felt extremely angry that the man who is representing the people , and that includes yours truly , on agricultural matters , was using this serious and important debate to play the clown . Well , I thought , if PERSON has the right to speak the way he likes on the television screen , in my home , then I am also entitled to speak my mind . And I started booing him with all my might , and had I had enough tomatoes , I would have used them for other purposes .", "You may ask me what I did when \u2018 il - Profs\u2019 PERSON of Cospicua took the microphone . First and foremost , this man is not as yet aware that PERSON has resigned and PERSON still echoes him to DATE . Secondly , you stand no chance of finding anything worthwhile after analysing PERSON \u2019s speech . At least , you may find something worthwhile in PERSON speech , but you discover absolutely nothing in PERSON \u2019s . Let me tell you what I did when this professor stood up to speak .", "I booed this last one so heartily that the neighbours thought that I had had an epileptic fit . To crown it all , PERSON , that nosy PERSON , entered my home unannounced and without permission and she found me on the floor in an ecstasy of booing . She thought I had become a lunatic . Really , the scene in front of the television was scary . PERSON was gesticulating and talking rubbish on ORG set while I lay sprawled on the floor gesticulating like a madman . And I did all this so that I may have enough material for \u2018 MHUX\u2019 . To persuade PERSON that nothing was really wrong with me I had to allow her to take my pulse rate , examine my tongue and take my temperature . \"", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON and PERSON , CARDINAL of the Members of ORG referred to , brought the article to the attention of ORG as an alleged breach of privilege . On DATE , before the applicant had been heard , the Speaker announced that he had examined the matter and found a prima facie case of breach of privilege .

For his part , PERSON expressed the opinion that the proposed motion did not state that the applicant was guilty :", "\" Here we are not saying that he is guilty . We are saying : Come here so that on DATE you will say why you are not guilty . And if ever you were to convince us that you are not guilty we will say that you are not guilty ; if you will not convince us we will say you are guilty . \"", "After the debate the motion was adopted as proposed by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE brought an application before ORG of GPE in exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction challenging the proceedings instituted against him by ORG on the ground that these proceedings , which were penal in nature , violated his right under section CARDINAL of the LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) to be given a fair hearing by an independent and impartial court .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , before the delivery of the judgment of ORG , the applicant appeared before ORG with his lawyer .", "It was submitted as a point of order that further proceedings on the case in the ORG should be suspended until the court had determined the constitutional issue , but the Speaker ruled that the ORG should proceed with the case before it . The question was then put to the applicant , \" Does the editor consider himself to be guilty or not please ? Mr GPE , do you consider yourself guilty ? \" When the applicant refused to answer whether he was guilty or not , he was threatened with further proceedings for contempt . CARDINAL of the members of the ORG , Dr PERSON , stated on a point of order that the breach of privilege proceedings were to be considered as being of a criminal nature and accordingly - an argument accepted by the Speaker - the rule of criminal procedure that he who stands mute is presumed to have answered \u2018 not guilty\u2019 should be applied .", "PERSON proceeded to adduce the evidence against the applicant , reading out the impugned article and concluding that it insulted Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON in connection with their conduct in the ORG .

And if they attack me personally I will neither seek redress here nor go to court . Okay ?

On CARDINAL DATE ORG delivered judgment in favour of the applicant . It began by finding that the proceedings were not criminal in nature :", "\" ORG is not an ordinary court , although , because of the system of checks and balances already referred to , it also has quasi - judicial functions , apart from its principal function of legislator . And the law that provides for the privileges and contempt of the ORG ( chapter CARDINAL ) is not part of the criminal law of the country . It is true , as argued by the applicant , that there is a great resemblance between the penalties provided for by LAW and those provided for by this particular law . However , the decision of the ORG is not the criminal conviction that emerges from a decision of ORG , and the declaration of guilt for contempt and the consequential sanctions from such a declaration , despite having the same form as criminal penalties - admonitions , payment of money , imprisonment - are nonetheless not criminal convictions . \"", "However , the ORG continued :", "\" The ORG may take proceedings for contempt where , among other things , there results :", "\u2018 ( k ) the publication of any defamatory libel on the Speaker or any Member touching anything done or said by him as Speaker or as a Member in the ORG or in LOC ( Vide sect . CARDINAL LAW ) .", "For the ORG to have jurisdiction to take proceedings for contempt there must be a defamatory libel ( a mixed question of fact and law ) and the law did not state that this is a question that must be established by the ORG , but something that must exist objectively ; this being so , the declaration of the existence of the defamatory libel must first be made objectively by the ORG , and then there will be proceedings in the ORG for contempt . \"", "ORG concluded that the Ordinance in question did not authorise ORG of its own initiative to define what is a defamatory libel , and that , if and when it acts upon a contempt , it must act according to the principles of natural justice . It ordered that the applicant be placed in the position in which he was before proceedings were instituted against him on the basis of breach of privilege and that no further proceedings be taken against him on the basis of the resolution and motion in question .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , on appeal by both parties , disagreed with the conclusions of ORG . It held that the LAW authorised ORG to enact laws establishing its privileges , immunities and powers , that accordingly the powers given to the ORG by virtue of LAW of LAW did not violate the person \u2019s right to a fair hearing by an independent court as guaranteed under section CARDINAL of the LAW and that in those circumstances the lower court had not been entitled to look further into the matter or to afford the remedies indicated in its judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG summoned the applicant before it in order to decide the penalty to be imposed upon him . On being asked if he wished to comment , the applicant stated through his lawyer that he had nothing to say regarding the punishment but would comply with the ORG \u2019s decision .
