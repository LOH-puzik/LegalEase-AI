She was represented before the Court by Mr F.X. Berndorfer , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is the owner of CARDINAL plots of land of QUANTITY in the GPE municipality . The property , plot nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL on the GPE land register , had been designated as building land since DATE . By contract of CARDINAL DATE the applicant \u2019s parents transferred the property to her . At the same time they transferred other plots of building land to her sister . The applicant and her sister considered that the plots of land each of them had received were of approximately equal value and therefore made written statements waiving their right to a compulsory portion of their GPE estate .", "Meanwhile , on DATE the new NORP Land Planning Act ( Raumordnungsgestz \u2013 hereinafter , \u201c LAW \u201d ) had entered into force . Its section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) had obliged all municipalities to review existing area zoning plans ( Fl\u00e4chenwidmungspl\u00e4ne ) within DATE .", "On DATE GPE , pending the review of the area zoning plan , issued a temporary building prohibition ( Bausperre ) for parts of the municipal area . Pursuant to GPE the temporary building prohibition is a decree ( Verordnung ) which has to be made public . Based on the recommendations of land planning expert PERSON , the review of the area zoning plan concerned CARDINAL plots of land , including the CARDINAL plots of land at issue , which were at that time still owned by the applicant \u2019s parents . The temporary building prohibition was extended twice .", "On DATE the mayor of the NORP municipality informed the applicant that a change in the area zoning plan was envisaged which would lead to the designation of her CARDINAL plots of land as green land ( Gr\u00fcnland ) . He gave her the opportunity to submit written comments , which she did on DATE . She opposed the change , giving arguments for maintaining the designation of her plots of land as building land .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the GPE municipal council ( PERSON ) amended the area zoning plan . As a result the applicant \u2019s property was designated as green land . In its considerations the municipal council set out on a general level that the reserve of building land by far exceeded the projected need . In respect of the applicant \u2019s plots of land , it noted in particular :", "\u201c The objection of PERSON , owner of plot nos . CARDINAL and DATE [ ... ] should be rejected , since in accordance with LAW of GPE only areas that are suitable for construction based on their natural and infrastructural conditions may be classified as building land . Such land is required in order to meet the demand of the municipality for building land which has been projected by the municipality for a planning period of DATE . Areas that are unsuitable for appropriate construction on account of their natural conditions may not be designated as building land . This applies also to areas whose development would entail unreasonable costs .", "In the opinion of the local planning expert and author of the plan , the plots of land at issue lack suitability as building land ( just like the rest of the areas re - designated as green land in accordance with the area zoning plan amendment ) for the following reasons : building development would entail unreasonable costs owing to the steep gradient of the slope ; the suitability of the property as a housing area is limited on account of the emission load of the Eferdinger Federal Road ; because of its position on a northern slope with adjacent woodland , only reduced insulation is possible ; in general , construction on the steep PERSON hills descending to the river GPE would violate section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ( protection of the environment ) and paragraph CARDINAL ( preservation of the typical settlement structure and landscape ) of GPE . \u201d", "Of the CARDINAL plots of land concerned by the review of the area zoning plan , a total of CARDINAL were re - designated as green land .", "The area zoning plan amendment was approved on DATE by ORG ( PERSON ) , acting as the supervisory authority for the municipality , and entered into force on DATE .", "Under NORP law a land owner can not challenge an area zoning plan directly before ORG , but has to raise the question of its lawfulness in the context of administrative proceedings , for instance in proceedings on a request for a building permit ( GPE ) or a building - site permit ( ORG ) ( see relevant domestic law below ) .", "On DATE the applicant applied to the NORP municipality for a permit for a building site for the CARDINAL plots of land at issue . She claimed in essence that the change of designation of her property had been unlawful . In support of this argument she submitted an opinion by a land planning expert , ORG , dated DATE . The conclusion of the latter was that the CARDINAL plots of land were suitable for construction .", "The mayor refused the application by a decision of CARDINAL DATE noting that the granting of a building - site permit would be contrary to the property \u2019s designation as green land .", "The applicant appealed on DATE . She referred to the written comments she had made in the proceedings concerning the amendment of the area zoning plan and complained that the authority had failed to examine her arguments . Furthermore , she alleged that the change of designation was unlawful for the following reasons : Firstly , the re - designation of her property as green land was not an appropriate means of achieving the declared aim of reducing the despoliation of the landscape , given the position of her property close to the centre of the municipality . Secondly , changes in the area zoning plan were subject to restrictions . Only very significant public - interest reasons could prevail over the individual interest of preserving acquired rights . The main aim pursued by the change to the area zoning plan , namely to reduce the excess of building land , did not have such preponderant weight . Thirdly , there were no new facts which would justify the change of designation , since the excess of building land had existed for DATE and had been aggravated by the municipality itself newly designating numerous plots of land in the past . Fourthly , the authority had failed to take the applicant \u2019s interests into account . Her property had suffered a very considerable loss of value for which she had not been compensated under LAW of the NORP Land Planning Act . Finally , no uniform criteria had been applied as regards the re - designation of building land as green land , since other plots of land in a comparable position and with comparable topography , including CARDINAL plots of land adjacent to hers , had not been re - designated .", "By a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It noted that the applicant \u2019s arguments concerned the underlying decision to amend the area zoning plan and could not be taken into account in the proceedings at issue .", "The applicant filed an objection ( PERSON ) against this decision in which she repeated the arguments she had submitted in her appeal .", "On DATE the ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s objection . It noted that the area zoning plan was a decree , that is , a binding act of subordinate legislation . While the applicant was entitled to submit arguments as regards its lawfulness , it was not for the administrative authorities but for ORG ) to examine those arguments .", "The applicant lodged a complaint with ORG against the refusal of the building - site permit , challenging the lawfulness of the underlying area zoning plan . She claimed that the building authorities\u2019 decisions violated her right to property and the principle of non - discrimination in that the refusal of a building - site permit had been based on an unlawful area zoning plan . In that regard , she repeated all the arguments she had already submitted in the course of the proceedings .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . It noted that the municipality had based the re - designation of the applicant \u2019s property on the undisputed excess of building land and on its lack of suitability for construction . It had adduced specific reasons for finding that the applicant \u2019s plots of land were unsuitable for construction , such as their position on a steep slope , the unreasonable costs of development because of that position , the interests of environmental protection in preserving the woods on the slope , the emission load of the nearby FAC and the limited possibilities for insulation . The expert opinion of ORG submitted by the applicant had supported her position only in part . In particular , it had not contested the unreasonable costs of developing the property because of its position on a steep slope . Nor had it contradicted the municipality \u2019s argument in respect of emissions from the nearby FAC .", "In sum , the municipality had rightly come to the conclusion that the previous designation of the applicant \u2019s property as building land was contrary to the principles laid down in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW . In such a case LAW ) of LAW obliged the municipality to change the designation of the plots of land at issue without a further weighing of interests as this task had already been carried out by the legislator . The question whether or not it was lawful to maintain the designation of CARDINAL neighbouring plots of land as building land did not fall to be examined in the present proceedings .", "ORG decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "In GPE land planning is governed by the DATE NORP Land Planning Act . Area zoning plans are issued by the municipalities . Under NORP law area zoning plans and any amendments thereto are regarded as decrees , that is , binding acts of subordinate legislation . The lawfulness of decrees can only be reviewed by ORG ( Article CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "Proceedings in which area zoning plans are issued or amended are not ordinary administrative proceedings and the land owners affected by them , while having the right to submit comments , are not parties to the proceedings . They are not entitled to challenge the area zoning plan directly before ORG if it is possible to institute administrative proceedings , for instance building proceedings .", "If an area zoning plan is the basis for refusing a building permit or a building - site permit , which is a preliminary decision on the suitability of land for construction purposes , the persons concerned are expected to assert their rights in the building proceedings , in which they can ultimately challenge the lawfulness of the area zoning plan before ORG .", "The relevant provisions of the DATE NORP Land Planning Act ( Raumordnungsgesetz ) state as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The objectives of LAW are , in particular :", "CARDINAL . protecting the environment against adverse impact as well as safeguarding or restoring a natural balance ;", "...", "CARDINAL . preserving and shaping settlement structures , including the development of settlements , and preserving typical settlement structures and landscapes ... \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In implementing its tasks of local land planning , each municipality shall issue the area zoning plan and the local development concept by a decree , and manage and review them at regular intervals .

They have to meet the demand for building land of the municipality projected by the municipality for a planning period of DATE . Areas lacking suitability for adequate construction owing to natural conditions ( e.g. ground - water level , flood hazard , rock fall , soil characteristics , risk of avalanche ) may not be designated as building land . This applies also to areas whose development would entail unreasonable costs ... \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) All areas not designated as building land or transport areas shall be designated as green land . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) After the entry into force of LAW , each municipality shall review the area zoning plan and adopt an area zoning plan together with the local development concept DATE after the entry into force of LAW . Furthermore , the area zoning plan shall be reviewed to ascertain whether the building land areas designated in the area zoning plan but not yet used for the designated purpose still conform to the principles of LAW . Building land areas whose designation contravenes the aforementioned principles shall be designated as building land or as green land , as appropriate , by changing the area zoning plan . \u201d", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , compensation for a change of designation is only available in specific circumstances , essentially when the owner of land relying on the designation of the property as building land has already incurred costs in view of intended construction which is then made impossible by the amendment of the area zoning plan , or when a plot of land which is suited for construction within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and is entirely or mostly surrounded by building land is not designated as building land and suffers a loss of value as a result ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
