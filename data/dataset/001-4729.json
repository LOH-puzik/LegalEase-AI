THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are GPE citizens , born in DATE , DATE and DATE respectively . The first and third applicants live in GPE , the second applicant lives in GPE . They were each directors of ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) , a company which traded as a members ' agent in the ORG insurance market .", "They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , PERSON , solicitors , GPE .", "A.", "s , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG ( \u201c the Secretary of ORG \u201d ) issued an originating summons seeking orders under LAW DATE ( \u201c CDDA \u201d ) . The affidavit which was filed in support of the summons made a number of allegations : that all CARDINAL applicants had breached LAW of LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , which prohibits a company from giving financial assistance in relation to the purchase of its own shares ; that they had acted to the detriment of ORG creditors by permitting an unsecured , interest - free loan which conferred no benefit on ORG ; that they had knowingly caused and permitted the production of accounts of ORG which did not give a true and fair position of the company 's financial position , and that they gave security to a bank over payments of ORG in preference to other creditors .", "The applicants filed affidavits in reply , as they were required to do if they wished to challenge the affidavit in support of the Secretary of ORG 's position . They also filed a number of affidavits from third parties who were well - known and respected in the insurance industry , and who deposed to the applicants ' fitness to be company directors , their standing in ORG and their good character . The Secretary of ORG applied to strike out the character evidence under LAW rule CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG , which empowers the court to strike out of any affidavit \u201c any matter which is scandalous , irrelevant or otherwise oppressive \u201d .", "The Secretary of ORG 's application for the character evidence to be struck out was granted on DATE by PERSON The judge recalled that character evidence was not ordinarily admissible in civil proceedings because it was not probative of any issue . He rejected the applicants ' submissions that the evidence was relevant even though there were allegations of dishonesty , and he did not accept that the PERSON proceedings were akin to criminal proceedings by reference to the case of ORG [ DATE ] BCC CARDINAL . The judge also struck out certain parts of the applicants ' own affidavits as conflicting with the rule against hearsay evidence .", "A Statement of Undisputed Facts was agreed between the applicants and the Secretary of ORG so that the PERSON proceedings could be decided under the so - called PERSON procedure ( after the case of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR CARDINAL , in which the procedure was described ) . The parties agreed that , if the ORG did not approve summary disposal of the proceedings , no further reference would be made to the Statement . The applicants accepted , by reference to the undisputed facts set out in the Statement , that a disqualification order against each of them was appropriate for the period contended for by the Secretary of ORG , namely DATE for the first applicant , DATE for the second applicant , and DATE for the third applicant .", "The Statement set out the CARDINAL remaining matters , with the charge in each case . The first charge was that the applicants did not know that the loans to CARDINAL company were unlawful as in breach of LAW of LAW DATE , but that they ought to have known . The applicants did not dispute the allegation . The second charge was that a series of unsecured , interest - free loans to that company were potentially to the detriment of ORG and its creditors . Again , the applicants did not dispute the allegation . The third charge was that the second applicant had caused ORG to prefer a bank over other creditors on CARDINAL specific occasion . The allegation was not disputed .", "There followed a statement of mitigation on behalf of each applicant .", "The substantive hearing was held before the Vice - Chancellor on DATE . In his judgment , the Vice - Chancellor held as follows :", "\u201c My function , [ ... ] , is to consider the contents of the agreed statement of facts and decide , first , whether a disqualification order ought to be made and , second , what the length of the disqualification period should be . It is of course relevant that the [ applicants ] do not contest that disqualification orders can properly be made . [ ... ] I am not bound by the agreement between the parties that the facts warrant a disqualification order nor am I bound by their agreement as to the length of the disqualification periods . It is open to me if so advised , having regard to the contents of the agreed statement of facts , to form a different view . It would I think be unlikely for a judge to do so but the judicial function requires me to direct my mind to the facts in the agreed statement and to consider what the right order to be made should be .", "( ... )", "[ The ] Section CARDINAL matter is in my view the most important of the CARDINAL . The facts which constitute the breach of LAW were facts known to each of the CARDINAL [ applicants ] . I accept that none was aware at the time that what was being done in advancing moneys to ORG [ the related company ] did constitute a breach of LAW , but I would conclude without difficulty , and it is indeed accepted by each of the [ applicants ] , that each ought to have known that that was so . It is important however that I should record that the making of the loans was not done for any personal gain which it was thought might thereby be obtained by any of the directors . It was not accompanied by any want of probity or dishonesty .", "", "( ... )", "Section CARDINAL is part of the statutory scheme imposed in order to protect the public from the conduct of limited companies carrying on business with the protection of limited liability . It is a provision which is sometimes overlooked and treated as of little account . It never should be so but where that does happen and where , as is often the case , no point resulting from it ever emerges into the public view , no adverse consequences will follow . In the present case it may be a misfortune for the CARDINAL directors that the ORG litigation drew them into its clutches , brought about the need for the companies to go into insolvent liquidation , brought an independent mind to bear upon the manner in which the company 's affairs had been conducted in the past and led to the LAW breaches becoming known to the Secretary of ORG . That is a misfortune for the directors but it does not in itself reduce the seriousness of the LAW breaches . I am of the opinion that those breaches justify disqualification orders . This is , of course , an easier conclusion for me to reach than it would have been had that been disputed by the [ applicants ] , which it is not .", "The question , therefore , is what length of disqualification period would be appropriate . I repeat that in approaching this question I regard the breaches of LAW as serious . I regard the conclusion that disqualification orders are appropriate as a result of these breaches as being a conclusion impelled by a serious misfeasance on the part of the directors in managing the affairs of the company that the LAW breaches represent .", "( ... )", "For my part , first because I think that the agreed periods were on the stiff side so far as the [ applicants ] were concerned , second because I do not regard the post-CARDINALst DATE loans as constituting a matter which should have any real weight in the balance and , third , because of the invidious comparison that there might appear to be with the treatment of Mr Lines [ in a recent case ] , I think it right that the periods of disqualification should be DATE for [ the second applicant ] , DATE for [ the first applicant ] and DATE for [ the third applicant ] . That is DATE less than the Secretary of ORG was contending for but I do not imagine that that will be a reason why the Secretary of ORG would wish a full trial . \u201d", "Costs were ordered against the applicants , and the Vice - Chancellor refused an application by the first and second applicants for an extension of the statutory period of DATE allowed to the applicants to divest themselves of their directorships . He did , however , indicate that it would be open to them towards the end of that period to return to him with more specific reasons which called for an extension . The first applicant 's request to be permitted to continue as director of the trading company of the group for DATE was granted on DATE , subject to conditions .", "B.
