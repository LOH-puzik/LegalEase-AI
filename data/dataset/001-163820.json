ORG The applicant had a NORP tourist visa , which had been issued in DATE and had been valid for DATE . Having overstayed this visa , he remained in GPE illegally .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , when the applicant was DATE and still living in GPE illegally , he met MP , a NORP citizen , who at the time was DATE . DATE , on DATE , they married in a civil ceremony . On DATE they also married in accordance with the NORP rite .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant enquired about his \u201c exempt person status \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and on DATE started the process to obtain NORP citizenship on the basis of his marriage to a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s exempt person status was confirmed on DATE . On DATE , following the processing of his application and consequent to the marriage , he was registered as a NORP citizen . On DATE , he therefore lodged an application to renounce his NORP nationality ( a copy of the relevant application form has not been submitted to ORG ) . It transpires from a letter issued by LOC in GPE that on DATE the applicant \u2019s request was approved and his NORP passport withdrawn . At the relevant time , dual nationality was not possible under either NORP or NORP law .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , in DATE the applicant and MP had various marital problems , which led the applicant to leave the matrimonial home on CARDINAL occasions . The applicant had behaved aggressively , and specifically on DATE he had physically assaulted his pregnant wife , causing her a permanent disability . MP left the matrimonial home thereafter .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was charged , remanded in custody , and eventually tried and found guilty in respect of the act of assault . He was given a suspended sentence .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE a child , ORG , was born of the marriage . ORG is a NORP citizen . The various family disputes continued between the couple .", "CARDINAL . On DATE MP instituted court proceedings to annul the marriage . Following adversarial proceedings where both parties were represented by a lawyer , the applicant \u2019s marriage was annulled by a judgment of DATE . The court delivering the judgment was satisfied ( to the degree necessary in civil proceedings , namely on a balance of probabilities ) that the applicant \u2019s only reason for marrying had been to remain in GPE and acquire citizenship ; thus he was positively excluding marriage itself , and there had been a simulation of marriage . Since no appeal was lodged against the judgment , it became final .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not inform the authorities of the judgment concerning the annulment of his marriage and he remained resident in GPE and retained his NORP citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married GPE , a NORP citizen , DATE after their first encounter . The applicant enquired about the exempt person status of his NORP wife and was asked to produce a copy of the judgment of annulment . On DATE the applicant produced a copy of the judgment and it was only at that time that the authorities became aware of the reason for the annulment of his first marriage .", "CARDINAL . Following an application to that effect , on DATE , GPE was granted exempt person status and thus had full freedom of movement ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . According to the Government , although this was contested by the applicant , attention was drawn to the fact that the benefit of such status would cease if the applicant lost his citizenship . CARDINAL sons were born of this marriage , ORG , in DATE and DATE respectively . They are both NORP citizens .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was informed that an order was to be made to deprive him of his NORP citizenship ( under Article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( \u201c LAW \u201d ) DATE see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) , which , according to the judgment of DATE , appeared to have been obtained by fraud . He was informed of his right to an inquiry .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged that decision , claiming that it was not true that he had obtained his marriage by fraud and stressing that he had CARDINAL NORP children .", "CARDINAL . In consequence , proceedings were instituted to investigate the applicant \u2019s situation and if necessary divest him of his NORP citizenship . A committee was set up for this purpose in accordance with LAW . A number of hearings were held before the committee where the applicant was assisted by a lawyer . He was allowed to make oral and written submissions and submit evidence , including witness testimony . It appears from the documents available that the applicant contested the basis of the annulment decision and claimed that he had not been aware that he could have appealed against it . He also contested the findings of a court of criminal jurisdiction that had found him guilty of injuring his wife and causing her a permanent disability .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s ex - wife , a citizenship department official and a priest also gave testimony .", "CARDINAL . The committee \u2019s final recommendation to the Minister of ORG and ORG was not made available to the applicant . Requests by the applicant \u2019s lawyer for a copy of the acts of those proceedings remained unsatisfied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister ordered that the applicant be deprived of his citizenship with immediate effect , in accordance with Article CARDINAL ) of the Act .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated DATE from the Director of ORG , the applicant was informed that the Minister of Justice and ORG had concluded that the applicant had obtained citizenship by fraudulent means and that therefore on DATE , in accordance with LAW , the Minister had ordered that he be immediately divested of his citizenship . He was required to return his certificate of registration as a NORP citizen and his passport .", "CARDINAL . The applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings , complaining under Articles CARDINAL , DATE and DATE of the Convention . He claimed that he had not had a fair trial and appropriate access to court for the determination on his right to citizenship . Moreover , the revocation of his citizenship had not been in accordance with the law . The prerequisites for such action had not existed as his first marriage had not been one of convenience .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ( FAC ) in its constitutional jurisdiction rejected the applicant \u2019s complaint under LAW , finding that the committee set up for that purpose had not been a tribunal , but solely an investigative body capable of giving recommendations but not making final decisions . The court , however , found that the applicant \u2019s LAW rights would be breached if , as a result of his being divested of his citizenship , he became an alien . His de jure family ( in respect of the second marriage ) would suffer irremediable upset if , as a father ( of the CARDINAL NORP children of that marriage ) , he were required to move to another country . Thus , the revocation of citizenship in the present case was in breach of LAW . Consequently , the court annulled the order of CARDINAL DATE and considered that it was not necessary to rule on any further complaints .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , by a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG overturned the first - instance judgment in part . It rejected LAW CARDINAL complaint on the basis that the provision was not applicable in the absence of a civil right . In that connection , it rejected the applicant \u2019s contention that the revocation of citizenship affected his right to a family life and therefore was civil in nature , as citizenship was a matter of public law and fell under the prerogatives of the ORG . It also reversed the part of the judgment in respect of DATE , commenting that it had not been established that the applicant had a family life in GPE , and , even if this were so , the revocation of his citizenship would not necessarily result in his having to leave GPE . Indeed , it had not transpired that the applicant would be denied NORP residence or that he had applied for it and had been refused , nor had a removal order been issued .", "CARDINAL . Following the lodging of the application with the ORG , on DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer wrote to the relevant authorities informing them that the case was pending before the ORG and that therefore no action should be taken on the basis of the order of CARDINAL DATE . No feedback , apart from an acknowledgment of receipt , was received concerning that letter . However , although the order to deprive the applicant of his citizenship with immediate effect remains in force , no action has been taken to date in pursuit of the order and no removal order has been issued .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant considers that the implementation of the order is only a matter of time , he is currently still residing and carrying out his business in GPE . He has a trading licence , which is periodically renewed . He continued using a NORP passport to travel until DATE , when it expired , as he had failed to return it to the authorities despite their request .", "CARDINAL . The applicant does not appear to have any contact with his first son , but claims to be in a family environment with his second wife and their children . Following the revocation of his citizenship , the applicant \u2019s second wife lost her exempt person status and the attached freedom - of - movement rights ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
