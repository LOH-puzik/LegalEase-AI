SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant , born in DATE , is a citizen of GPE . Before the Court he is represented by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant arrived in GPE on CARDINAL or DATE , holding a tourist visa valid until DATE .", "On DATE he applied for asylum with ORG ( ORG invandrarverk ) , claiming that he had left his country to escape slavery . ORG held a hearing with the applicant and his lawyer in DATE .", "In written submissions and at the hearing , the applicant supplied the following information . His father , who is a slave belonging to a certain clan , and his mother , who is not a slave , are divorced . He grew up with his mother in the capital PERSON , went to school and later sold clothes in his own shop . His father has a privileged position with his master in the city of LOC and has achieved that his children , though being slaves , do not have to work as such . The applicant has to visit his father \u2019s master - who also owns the applicant - once a year . On these occasions , the applicant has to perform some minor tasks , inter alia serving tea and going to fetch people . He has never been personally threatened by the authorities , the clan or his owner and has not been politically active against the system of slavery , as there are too many Government spies and he would be at great risk if he engaged in such activities . He obtained his passport by bribing a police officer . After his arrival in GPE , he tore up the passport and other travel documents , as he was afraid of having to return to GPE . The visa to GPE was obtained through the assistance of his uncle who is the SecretaryGeneral for ORG . He did not apply for asylum immediately , believing that it did not matter when he applied .", "The applicant further stated that , if expelled to GPE , he would be returned to his father \u2019s master who might be angry with him as he has run away and who may punish him according to the master \u2019s own laws . The NORP authorities would not be able to DATE or would not want to \u2013 afford him protection . He also fears reprisals from his clan and the ORG , which supports the system of slavery in the country . Thus , he would be exposed to the risk of being tortured or killed upon return .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request and ordered his deportation . ORG did not contest that slavery still existed in parts of GPE . However , it called into question the applicant \u2019s credibility , noting that he had disposed of his passport after his arrival in GPE and that he had waited a long time before applying for asylum . It also took into account that he had never before expressed his opinions on slavery and that he had never been threatened . Furthermore , the ORG found that it had not been shown that the applicant risked being punished for not visiting his father \u2019s master . Finally , ORG considered that the general conditions prevailing in GPE did not constitute a reason for granting the applicant a residence permit on humanitarian grounds .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal was rejected by ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) on DATE . ORG shared the opinion of ORG and stated , in particular , that the applicant himself had not been held in slavery prior to his leaving PERSON but had been able to study for DATE and later had supported himself by selling clothes in his own shop .", "After the Commission had indicated to the respondent Government that it was desirable that the applicant would not be deported to ORG had had an opportunity to examine the present application , ORG , by decision of DATE , stayed the execution of the deportation order against the applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
