No term or grounds for that detention were specified .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a request to vary the remand , alleging that he had been seriously ill . On DATE the judge of GPE dismissed the request . The reasons for the dismissal were that the applicant had been accused of having committed serious offences , that he had already tried to avoid trial , and that he could therefore abscond and obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case .

The applicant \u2019s defence counsel was present at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied to the ORG , complaining that his detention had been unlawful . The prison administration stated in reply that , pursuant to LAW at that time , the applicant could be lawfully detained on remand for DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having examined the applicant \u2019s complaint and the observations of the prison administration , on CARDINAL DATE the ORG held that LAW , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure and LAW provided that a person could only be remanded in custody pursuant to an appropriate order , specifying the term of detention . He observed that a detainee ought to be released from prison if the term of detention was not extended by a court . On the basis of the above observations , the ORG concluded that certain periods of the applicant \u2019s detention had been unlawful under the domestic criminal procedure . The ORG rejected the prison administration \u2019s arguments that there had been valid court decisions during the overall period of the applicant \u2019s detention and that LAW authorised the applicant \u2019s continued remand in custody for DATE , given that the maximum sentence for the most serious offence with which the applicant was charged was DATE imprisonment . The ORG emphasised that this legal provision was incompatible with the right to be brought to trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by LAW . The ORG also drew the attention of ORG and ORG to the fact that the length of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody had been excessive . Finally he addressed ORG , stating that the provisions of LAW \u201c regulating the terms of detention on remand are not clear or logical [ because ] calculating the terms depends on various circumstances , including access to the case - file and dates when a particular decision becomes effective \u201d . As such circumstances were not foreseeable and could be interpreted in different ways , the ORG suggested amendments to LAW .", "CARDINAL . At a trial hearing before the judge of GPE on DATE , the applicant stated that he had been unlawfully detained . He requested the judge to order his release . The applicant also claimed access to additional material held in the case - file . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE , the judge stated that a court would establish whether or not the applicant \u2019s detention on remand had been unlawful when delivering the judgment on the merits of the case . The applicant \u2019s request to vary the remand was rejected on the ground that he might abscond . The judge allowed the applicant to have access to additional material held in the case - file at a time when there are no trial hearings .", "At a trial hearing on DATE , the applicant repeated his request for bail , complaining about the lawfulness and conditions of his detention . The judge of GPE noted that the medical experts had not yet submitted their conclusions as to the applicant \u2019s state of health . The judge refused to vary the remand , as there was no guarantee that the applicant would not abscond .", "CARDINAL . The applicant repeatedly applied to the ORG , alleging in particular that the court decision of DATE had not been included in the case - file , and that the prison administration could not know that his detention on remand had been prolonged from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG amended his conclusions of DATE insofar as they concerned CARDINAL period of the unlawful detention of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained to ORG that he had requested GPE to discontinue the unlawful detention , not that the court vary the remand . The applicant referred to the amended provision of LAW , which had come into force on DATE . The applicant requested ORG to quash the decisions of GPE of DATE and CARDINAL DATE . He stated that he could not remain in custody because of his health , and that the length of the detention had been excessive , in breach of LAW . He also requested ORG to hear him in person when examining the appeal . On DATE the applicant announced a hunger strike in connection with his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of ORG informed the applicant that his challenge to the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE was not subject to appeal , pursuant to the then LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted a request to the judge of GPE to be released . On DATE the judge dismissed the request on the ground that the applicant might abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the judge of GPE found the applicant guilty of the CARDINAL charges against him , the applicant and his defence counsel being present . The judge established that the applicant had unlawfully appropriated various assets of a total worth of CARDINAL litai . He was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and his property was confiscated . No allegations of the unlawfulness of the remand were mentioned by the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against his conviction , alleging various procedural irregularities , including breaches of his rights to legal representation , to examine witnesses , and to have unconditional access to the case - file . He stated inter alia that the latest extension of the term of his detention on remand was that made by ORG on DATE , and that his remand in custody from DATE had been unlawful . He claimed that his detention had been excessively long . On DATE the applicant supplemented the appeal , submitting inter alia that ORG , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the LAW had been breached , and that he had been unable to challenge judges and prosecutors who had allegedly fabricated the case against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG amended the applicant \u2019s conviction as regards the count concerning irregular operations with currency and securities . In this respect the court reclassified the charge under LAW with that under former LAW which had been applicable at the time when the crime was committed . The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the appellate hearing . ORG considered that no procedural irregularities had occurred during the pre - trial investigation and trial , noting inter alia that the applicant had had several defence counsel throughout the proceedings , he had had full access to the case - file , experts had been consulted and witnesses had been questioned . ORG did not change the applicant \u2019s sentence . On DATE the applicant lodged a cassation appeal , pleading inter alia that his detention had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the conviction and the appellate decision because of numerous breaches of domestic criminal procedure , including violations of the applicant \u2019s defence rights . The court ruled inter alia that the applicant could only have been prosecuted on CARDINAL count of irregular operations with currency and securities under former LAW , by reference to which he had been extradited from GPE . It held that the other CARDINAL counts could not stand unless the appropriate permission from GPE had been obtained . The court also stated that it had no competence to examine the applicant \u2019s allegations of unlawful detention during the pre - trial investigation . It did not decide on the applicant \u2019s remand , but it ordered the release on bail of his co - accused . The case was returned to GPE for a new examination to be carried out . The applicant remained in prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant wrote letters to ORG , the Minister of the Interior , the Minister of Justice and the President of GPE , stating that his detention from DATE had been unlawful in that , inter alia , ORG had not decided the question of his remand .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE a ORG judge informed GPE and ORG that the detention order of DATE had constituted a valid basis for the applicant \u2019s continued detention on remand because the order of CARDINAL DATE had been quashed by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant requested ORG to release him on the ground that his detention had been unlawful . The applicant pleaded inter alia that the question of the lawfulness of his detention remained unclear , as was shown by the necessity of the aforementioned letter of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of GPE returned the case to the prosecution for further investigations to be carried out . The court also extended the term of the applicant \u2019s detention on remand for DATE , given the gravity of the CARDINAL offences for which he could be convicted if the appropriate permission from GPE were obtained .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed , which appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE . The court referred to the danger of the applicant absconding as warranting his remand in custody on suspicion of his having committed the CARDINAL possible offences . ORG noted that although GPE \u2019s permission to press these charges had not yet been granted , the prosecuting authorities had enough time to apply to GPE for that authorisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to GPE for release . He stated , inter alia , that he could only be prosecuted for the one offence of irregular operations with currency and securities . He noted that no permission had been obtained from GPE to prosecute him on other charges , and that the courts\u2019 reference to those charges as warranting his remand in custody had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a judge of GPE rejected the prosecution \u2019s application to extend the term of the applicant \u2019s remand in custody . By reference to LAW , the judge held that the order of CARDINAL DATE had become effective on the date when the appeal had been decided , and that the CARDINAL months\u2019 time - limit for the applicant \u2019s remand in custody had therefore started on DATE . The applicant remained in prison .", "CARDINAL . Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed against the decision of DATE , rejected respectively by ORG on DATE . ORG referred the question of the applicant \u2019s detention to ORG .", "DATE . On DATE ORG refused the prosecution \u2019s application to extend the applicant \u2019s remand in custody . The court held that the term of the applicant \u2019s detention designated on DATE had expired on DATE , and that his remand in custody after that date had been unlawful . ORG also held that the applicant could only be prosecuted on CARDINAL charge of irregular operations with currency and securities , for which he risked a maximum sentence of CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . However , the applicant had completed those DATE on DATE . ORG further noted that on DATE GPE had given permission to prosecute the applicant on the other charges , but that at the material time the applicant was not charged with any other offence , and could not be deprived of his liberty on that basis . The court concluded that the applicant \u2019s release was warranted . The applicant was released in the courtroom .", "CARDINAL . The applicant has not been remanded in custody since .
