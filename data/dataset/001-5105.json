In DATE , ORG members came to the applicant 's house to search for his cousin who had escaped from the organisation . When they could not find him , they turned their attention to the applicant . They interrogated him but he was unable to tell them of his cousin 's whereabouts . He was taken to an NORP settlement in GPE , where he was held prisoner for DATE . He was made to repair radio equipment , dig bunkers , cook food and on CARDINAL occasion was beaten when he asked to return home .", "In DATE , the applicant escaped from the ORG settlement . He left GPE with his father , arriving by train in GPE on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE , the applicant was arrested by the NORP army which raided the rented house where they were staying . They suspected him of being an ORG member . When his father tried to intervene , he was forcibly restrained by the soldiers . Following this incident , his father died of a heart attack on DATE .", "After being beaten by the soldiers at the house , he was held in detention until DATE . He was photographed and his measurements taken . He was questioned regularly about his links with the ORG and referred to as being a \u201c Tiger \u201d . During that time , he was tortured and ill - treated by the soldiers . He was hit about the head by the soldiers , who also banged his head on the wall . He was whipped with an electric cable and , on CARDINAL occasion , he was strung up by his feet with chains from a bar in the ceiling . While he was hanging , the soles of his feet and lower back were beaten with an S - LON pipe ( a plastic pipe filled with cement ) . While in detention , the applicant developed a skin disease which was diagnosed as psoriasis resulting from the overcrowding and poor hygiene in the prison . The applicant was finally released from detention when his uncle paid a bribe .", "On release , the applicant went to a skin clinic for treatment . This was in an area controlled by the ORG , a pro - ORG group . He was picked up twice by the ORG and taken to their camp for questioning about his involvement with the ORG , being held for DATE and DATE respectively . He was beaten on both occasions .", "Following the explosion of an oil tanker near his home , the applicant was arrested on DATE . He was taken to the police station where he was questioned . He was pulled by the hair , chained to the wall by the arms and beaten with truncheons . A heated iron rod was pressed against his arm which caused him to lose consciousness . He was taken to a different room and questioned by officers of ORG who took turns in questioning him while CARDINAL officers kicked and beat him . He was released on DATE when his uncle bribed a police officer .", "CARDINAL . Asylum proceedings", "Shortly after his release , the applicant left GPE . He arrived in GPE on DATE . He claimed asylum on DATE .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG for ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) did not make any findings as to whether the applicant had been tortured as alleged , but considered that this was \u201c not relevant regarding the right of asylum . These are excesses of isolated executive organs and can not be imputed to ORG . \u201d In that regard , new Government orders had made clear that such practices were not to be tolerated . It was also found that there was no ground for the applicant to fear persecution as a consequence of his having claimed asylum in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s appeal was heard on DATE by ORG , PERSON , and rejected after an oral hearing . ORG noted that the actions of the ORG could not be attributed to the ORG and that the applicant would be sufficiently safe from political persecution if he returned to the south of GPE . It referred to various measures adopted by ORG including the ratification of LAW , which was made domestic law in DATE . While it noted that there was a risk of long term detention for persons suspected before their emigration of membership of the ORG , an actual terrorist should not be granted asylum . Also , though a risk of detention and ill - treatment by the security forces and army existed in respect of persons suspected of supporting the NORP , it concluded that the NORP security forces and army had no reason to suspect the applicant of supporting terrorist activities or NORP military activities . Any arrests made for the purpose of extorting money did not disclose political persecution but were cases of excesses by individual officials . Furthermore it was of the opinion that the entire presentation of the applicant was a completely fabricated tissue of lies . He was not credible having regard , inter alia , to his lack of detail as to his activities as a student in GPE , the way in which he left all his personal papers behind when he emigrated , and the fact that the letter which he presented in court from his mother was contained in an envelope on which the address was written by another person . It further concluded that there was no obstacle to deportation under LAW , in conjunction with LAW , as the pre - condition for this was that there was a threat of individually - specific and serious danger of treatment unconnected with political persecution , which was contrary to human rights or degrading , deriving from ORG organisations , or that such treatment was attributed to ORG organisations .", "The applicant did not apply for leave to appeal against this decision . He states that his lawyer advised him not to appeal as there were clearly no prospects of success .", "On DATE , the applicant left GPE and travelled to GPE . After DATE in GPE , he travelled to GPE hidden on board a trailer where he arrived on DATE and was discovered by immigration officers . On DATE , he claimed asylum .", "On DATE , ORG requested that GPE accept responsibility for the applicant \u2019s asylum request pursuant to LAW . On DATE , GPE agreed . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG issued a certificate under LAW and directed the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE . He refused to examine the substance of the applicant \u2019s asylum claim .", "On DATE , the applicant applied for judicial review . On DATE , Mr Justice PERSON refused leave . On DATE the applicant was released from detention .", "On DATE , the applicant applied to ORG , complaining of the approach of the NORP authorities to the standard of proof and application of LAW . His renewed application was granted by ORG which decided to determine the substantive application . In its judgment given on DATE , ORG held that the Secretary of ORG was entitled to conclude that the NORP authorities do not adopt an approach which was outside the range of responses of a ORG acting in good faith to implement its obligations under LAW . It noted that care had to be taken not to subject the approach adopted in other GPE to an over technical comparison . The higher recognition rate in GPE for GPE asylum - seekers undoubtedly supported the Secretary of ORG 's opinion . Since he had taken reasonable steps to inform himself of the position in GPE by obtaining the opinion of Professor Dr PERSON , a distinguished NORP lawyer who had been legal counsel for ORG in asylum and immigration law and a judge of an administrative appeal court and Director of ORG law on immigration and asylum , no more was required of him .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s application for leave to petition ORG was refused . On DATE , the Secretary of ORG refused to exercise his discretion to grant leave to remain in the applicant \u2019s favour on compassionate grounds . On DATE , the applicant was again placed in detention .", "On DATE , the Secretary of ORG informed the applicant that he was satisfied that GPE was a safe third country . He noted that it was well - established that the NORP authorities were under a legal obligation to look at any new material placed before them . On DATE , removal directions to GPE were issued .", "On DATE , Dr PERSON of ORG for ORG , GPE , issued a medical report in which he concluded that :", "CARDINAL .

An irregular scar , QUANTITY long , behind the right heel was consistent with his account of a chain cutting into his ankles when he was suspended .", "Dr Peel concluded that the details given by the applicant of his detention were completely consistent with the descriptions of NORP detention centres given to him by other asylum seekers , that the scars on his body were fully consistent with his story and that he described some psychological symptoms found in persons who have been detained and beaten .", "The applicant made a second application for judicial review , submitting the above medical evidence and challenging the certification of GPE as a safe third country as , inter alia , GPE failed to recognise persons as refugees where the persecution emanated from non - State agents . Leave was refused by Mr Justice PERSON on DATE . Counsel advised that there were no grounds on which to appeal to ORG . Removal directions were set for DATE and then deferred .", "A further medical report was prepared by Dr PERSON of ORG Caring for victims of Torture ) after CARDINAL examinations of the applicant on DATE and DATE .

On DATE , the Secretary of ORG stated that he was not willing at this stage to consider the merits of the applicant \u2019s claim as he was pursuing an appeal to ORG in respect of PERSON and PERSON . He also expressed the view that it would be premature to do so as the applicant \u2019s application to ORG issues not considered by ORG in the PERSON , PERSON and PERSON case .", "The applicant has submitted material from members of his family supporting his account of events , e.g. a statement from his mother dated DATE , an affidavit from his mother dated DATE , a letter from his uncle dated CARDINAL DATE and a letter from his sister dated DATE .
