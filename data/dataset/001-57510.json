QUANTITY of LAW ) and a statute enacted in pursuance of that provision , namely LAW DATE on Restrictions on the Secrecy of the Mail , Post and Telecommunications ( Gesetz PERSON Brief- , Post- under PERSON , hereinafter referred to as \" the G CARDINAL \" ) , are contrary to the Convention . They do not dispute that the ORG has the right to have recourse to the surveillance measures contemplated by the legislation ; they challenge this legislation in that it permits those measures without obliging the authorities in every case to notify the persons concerned after the event , and in that it excludes any remedy before the courts against the ordering and execution of such measures . Their application is directed against the legislation as modified and interpreted by ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) .", "CARDINAL . Before lodging their application with the ORG , the applicants had in fact appealed to ORG . By judgment of DATE , that ORG held that LAW . CARDINAL , sub - paragraph CARDINAL of the G CARDINAL was void , being incompatible with the second sentence of Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW , in so far as it excluded notification of the person concerned about the measures of surveillance even when such notification could be given without jeopardising the purpose of the restriction . ORG dismissed the remaining claims ( Collected Decisions of ORG , PERSON . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL et seq . ) .", "Since the operative provisions of the aforementioned judgment have the force of law , the competent authorities are bound to apply the G CARDINAL in the form and subject to the interpretation decided by ORG . Furthermore , the Government of GPE were prompted by this judgment to propose amendments to the G CARDINAL , but the parliamentary proceedings have not yet been completed .", "CARDINAL . As regards the applicants\u2019 right to apply to ORG , that ORG held , inter alia :", "\" In order to be able to enter a constitutional application against an LAW , the applicant must claim that the LAW itself , and not merely an implementary measure , constitutes a direct and immediate violation of CARDINAL of his fundamental rights ... These conditions are not fulfilled since , according to the ORG own submissions , it is only by an act on the part of the executive that their fundamental rights would be violated . However , because they are not apprised of the interference with their rights , the persons concerned can not challenge any implementary measure . In such cases , they must be entitled to make a constitutional application against the LAW itself , as in cases where a constitutional application against an implementary measure is impossible for other reasons ... \" ( ibid , pp . DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Although , as a precautionary measure , the applicants claimed before both ORG and the Commission that they were being subjected to surveillance measures , they did not know whether the G CARDINAL had actually been applied to them .", "On this point , the Agent of the Government made the following declaration before the ORG :", "\" To remove all uncertainty as to the facts of the case and to give the ORG a clear basis for its decision , the Federal Minister of the ORG , who has competence in the matter , has , with ORG approval , authorised me to make the following statement :", "At no time have surveillance measures provided for by the LAW enacted in pursuance of LAW been ordered or implemented against the applicants . Neither as persons suspected of CARDINAL or more of the offences specified in the LAW nor as third parties within the meaning of DATE , paragraph CARDINAL , sub - paragraph CARDINAL , of the G CARDINAL have the applicants been subjected to such measures . There is also no question of the applicants\u2019 having been indirectly involved in a surveillance measure directed against another person - at least , not in any fashion which would have permitted their identification . Finally , there is no question of the applicants\u2019 having been subjected to surveillance by mistake - for example through confusion over a telephone number - , since in such cases the person concerned is notified of the surveillance measure . \"", "The contested legislation", "CARDINAL . After the end of the Second World War , the surveillance of mail , post and telecommunications in GPE was dealt with by the occupying powers . As regards GPE , neither the entry into force on DATE of LAW nor the foundation of ORG altered this situation which continued even after the termination of the occupation r\u00e9gime in DATE . Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Convention of CARDINAL DATE on Relations between the CARDINAL Powers ( GPE , GPE and GPE ) and GPE - as amended by LAW of DATE - specified in fact that the CARDINAL Powers temporarily retained \" the rights ... heretofore held or exercised by them , which relate to the protection of the security of armed forces stationed in GPE \" . Under the same provision , these rights were to lapse \" when the appropriate NORP authorities ( had ) obtained similar powers under NORP legislation enabling them to take effective action to protect the security of those forces , including the ability to deal with a serious disturbance of public security and order \" .", "CARDINAL . The Government wished to substitute the domestic law for the rights exercised by ORG and to place under legal control interferences with the right , guaranteed by LAW , to respect for correspondence . Furthermore , the restrictions to which this right could be subject appeared to the Government to be inadequate for the effective protection of the constitutional order of the ORG . Thus , on DATE , the ORG introduced CARDINAL Bills as part of ORG . The first sought primarily to amend LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ; the second - based on LAW para . CARDINAL so amended - was designed to limit the right to secrecy of the mail , post and telecommunications . The CARDINAL Acts , having been adopted by the federal legislative assemblies , were enacted on DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "ORG had come to the view on DATE that these CARDINAL texts met the requirements of Article CARDINAL para .

Where such restrictions are intended to protect the free democratic constitutional order or the existence or security of the Federation or of a Land , the statute may provide that the person concerned shall not be notified of the restriction and that legal remedy through the courts shall be replaced by a system of scrutiny by agencies and auxiliary agencies appointed by the people \u2019s elected representatives . \"", "CARDINAL .

For this reason , notification to this person is out of the question . For the same reason , it must be avoided that a person who intends to commit , or who has committed , the offences enumerated in the LAW can , by using a legal remedy , inform himself whether he is under surveillance . Consequently , a legal remedy to impugn the ordering of restrictive measures had to be denied ...", "The PERSON presented during the CARDINALth legislative session ... provided for the ordering ( of such measures ) by an independent judge . ORG abandoned this solution in LAW , introduced as part of ORG , mainly because the Executive , which is responsible before the GPE , should retain the responsibility for such decisions in order to observe a clear separation of powers . The present PERSON therefore grants the power of decision to a Federal Minister or the supreme authority of the Land . For the ( above-)mentioned reasons ... , the person concerned is deprived of the opportunity of having the restrictive measures ordered examined by a court ; on the other hand , the constitutional principle of government under the rule of law demands an independent control of interference by the Executive with the rights of citizens .
