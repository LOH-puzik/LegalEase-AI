NORP In DATE Mr ORG , a research worker in the field of literature , published an autobiography entitled Paragraph : Polar Circle . He described in it , inter alia , his conviction by a NORP military tribunal in DATE on the ground that he had been ordered to spy on the NORP army after having been enrolled , in DATE when he was DATE , in a military training course organised by NORP . In the book , PERSON also wrote about his detention in NORP gulags and his rehabilitation by ORG in DATE . In DATE Mr PERSON became Minister for Culture and Education of GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newspaper ORG published a poem by the applicant . It was dated DATE ( DATE when the sovereignty of GPE was solemnly proclaimed ) and entitled \u201c Good night , my beloved \u201d ( \u201c ORG noc , m\u00e1 mil\u00e1 \u201d ) . CARDINAL of its verses read as follows :", "\u201c In GPE prisoner PERSON is giving up his presidential office . In GPE the prosecutor rules again . And rule by CARDINAL party is above the law . A member of the ORG and a member of the \u0160TB [ The \u0160TB ( ORG bezpe\u010dnos\u0165 ) was the secret police during the communist regime in GPE ] embraced each other . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The poem was later published in another newspaper . In separate articles , CARDINAL journalists alleged that the expression \u201c member of the ORG \u201d stood for Mr ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE several newspapers published a statement which the applicant had distributed to ORG ( PERSON informa\u010dn\u00e1 slu\u017eba ) DATE . It was entitled \u201c For a better picture of GPE \u2013 without a minister with a fascist past \u201d ( \u201c Za lep\u0161\u00ed obraz GPE ministra s fa\u0161istickou minulos\u0165ou \u201d ) . It read as follows :", "\u201c There has been a problem about how to keep a democratic character in [ the NORP ] national emancipation process , which we have tried to resolve many times . Until now , GPE has lost most when matters related to the NORP nation were in the hands of the wrong people who led us away from democratic evolution . The cost was high : for example , the combatants\u2019 lives lost in ORG [ in DATE and DATE ] .", "Now , we are scared that this mistake could be made again . To say that our way to LOC is by working together and cooperating in its democratic evolution is not enough . This is a direct condition arising from international law without the fulfilment of which no one in LOC will take notice of us .", "I expressed this concern in my polemics with Mr PERSON DATE ; life has finished the writing of our polemics , and my views were proved correct .", "DATE Mr PERSON became GPE Minister for ORG and the next thing was that his fascist past came out in public . Mr Slobodn\u00edk managed this situation in a way that allowed the writer PERSON to prove he was a liar . But he still has not given up his ministerial post , although in any other democratic country he would have had to do so a long time ago .", "Does Mr Slobodn\u00edk think that GPE is some special exception and that it is the only country having the right to revise the philosophy of the GPE trials , which is binding on the post - war development of all other NORP countries ? Or is the message of ORG not correct ? ... Does Mr Me\u010diar think that having this minister in the government will help him to persuade people in LOC that his talk about the democratic intentions of his government is serious ? Is it good to have PERSON in the government when this fact will lead to the political , economic and cultural isolation of GPE ?", "Mr PERSON likes to use every chance to talk about improving the image of GPE around the world . I fully agree with him on this . He has a personal opportunity to do something in order to improve the image of GPE : to resign . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Slobodn\u00edk publicly declared that he would sue the applicant for the above statement .", "CARDINAL . In an interview published in the NORP DATE PERSON noviny on CARDINAL DATE the applicant stated , inter alia :", "\u201c ... when I speak of the fascist past [ of ORG ] , I do not characterise him , I only think that the fact that he attended a terrorist training course organised by the ORG falls within the term \u2018 fascist past\u2019 . I consider that such a person has nothing to do in the government of a democratic ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the context of the nomination of ORG to a post in the government , issues relating to his past were taken up by several NORP and NORP newspapers both before and after the publication of the applicant \u2019s statement . Articles concerning this subject were also published in ORG , on DATE , ORG , on DATE , ORG on DATE , as well as by ORG . ORG , ORG and ORG later published the reaction of ORG to their respective articles .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr Slobodn\u00edk sued the applicant for defamation under LAW seq . of LAW before ORG ( ORG ) . He later extended the action and alleged that the verses \u201c In GPE the prosecutor rules again . And rule by CARDINAL party is above the law . A member of the ORG and a member of the \u0160TB embraced each other \u201d from the applicant \u2019s poem referred to him . He also alleged that the above - mentioned statement published in the newspapers wrongly referred to his fascist past . The plaintiff claimed that the applicant should bear the costs of publication of an apology in CARDINAL newspapers and also pay him CARDINAL NORP korunas ( SKK ) as compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the action . It established that the plaintiff had been a member of ORG PERSON ml\u00e1de\u017e ) and that in DATE he had participated in a terrorist training course in Sekule . It observed that the ORG had been a military corps of the Hlinka Slovakian People \u2019s Party ( ORG slovensk\u00e1 \u013eudov\u00e1 strana ) and that under the law then in force the NORP nation had participated in the exercise of ORG power through the intermediary of that party . The court pointed out that , under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE , legal persons which had deliberately promoted the war waged by GPE and GPE or had served fascist and NORP aims were to be considered unworthy of the ORG \u2019s trust .", "CARDINAL . ORG further established that in DATE a military tribunal of the NORP army had sentenced Mr GPE to DATE imprisonment on the ground that he had attended the training course in Sekule and had been ordered , on DATE , to cross the front line and to spy on NORP troops . The military tribunal \u2019s judgment further stated that ORG had not crossed the front line but had gone home in DATE , when he had been arrested . ORG also noted that the plaintiff had served the sentence in NORP camps until his release in DATE . In DATE ORG of the GPE had quashed the sentence and discontinued the proceedings for the lack of factual elements of an offence .", "CARDINAL . Before ORG , Mr PERSON claimed that he had been a member of the ORG only for a short time and that he had joined the organisation only because it had been a prerequisite for his participation in a table - tennis tournament . He further explained that he had been summoned to the training course in Sekule and that he had complied with the summons out of fear for himself and his family . Mr PERSON alleged that he had been excluded from the course as being unreliable after he had expressed his negative opinion about it . He had then been taken to the ORG headquarters in GPE , from where he had been allowed to return home to PERSON under the condition that he would report on the NORP army . However , ORG did not find these facts established . In particular , it did not consider as relevant evidence the description of the events contained in the plaintiff \u2019s book Paragraph : Polar Circle , which had been published earlier . In its view , the fact that the DATE sentence had been quashed did not prove that the plaintiff had not been a member of the ORG and that he had not attended the training course in Sekule .", "CARDINAL . ORG also noted that the relevant period of Mr Slobodn\u00edk \u2019s life had been covered by the press both in GPE and abroad prior to the applicant \u2019s statement , and that on several occasions Mr PERSON himself had commented and given interviews on those issues , both in GPE and abroad . The court concluded that , in the statement , the applicant had expressed his opinion on the basis of information which had already been published in the press . The statement concerned a public figure who was inevitably exposed to close scrutiny and sometimes also to criticism by other members of society . By making the statement , the applicant had exercised his right to freedom of expression and he had not unjustifiably interfered with the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE appealed to ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) , alleging that the applicant had not proved that he had a \u201c fascist past \u201d , and that ORG had not established the meaning of that term . Mr Slobodn\u00edk argued that he had been summoned to the training course in Sekule by an order and that he had left it at the first opportunity after he had learned about its real purpose . He also explained that martial law had been in force at the material time and that people had been unlawfully executed or detained . Members of the ORG had been incorporated in the armed forces by a presidential order and had fallen under military judicial and disciplinary rules . The plaintiff maintained that he had done nothing against his homeland or the anti - fascist allies and concluded that the applicant \u2019s statement and poem were defamatory .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant contended , in particular , that the courts should abandon their established practice according to which the defendant has to prove the truthfulness of his statements in defamation proceedings . He maintained that the burden of proof should be shifted onto the plaintiff or shared between the parties . The applicant further argued that his statement was a value judgment based on the undisputed facts that the plaintiff had been a member of the ORG and that he had attended a terrorist training course in Sekule . It was irrelevant to what extent the plaintiff had been involved in the activities of the ORG or for how long he had been a member of it . What mattered was that the plaintiff had voluntarily joined the organisation and that , after his alleged exclusion from the training course in Sekule , he had undertaken , as shown by the NORP military tribunal \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE , to provide information on the movements of NORP troops to the headquarters of the ORG . The applicant therefore proposed that the appeal be dismissed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG reversed the first - instance judgment , ruling as follows :", "\u201c ... [ the applicant ] has to accept that ... ORG will distribute , if he thinks fit , to ORG of GPE as well CARDINAL newspapers of his choice , both in GPE and abroad , the following declaration to be published at [ the applicant \u2019s ] expense :", "\u2018 ( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant \u2019s ] statement addressed to [ ORG ] and published in DATE newspapers on DATE which reads : \u201c ... DATE Mr Slobodn\u00edk became GPE Minister for ORG and the next thing was that his fascist past came out in public ... Does Mr Slobodn\u00edk think that GPE is some special exception and that it is the only country having the right to revise the philosophy of the GPE trials , which is binding on the post - war development of all other NORP countries ? ... \u201d", "( CARDINAL ) The occasional poem ... entitled \u201c Good night , my beloved \u201d in its part \u201c ... In GPE the prosecutor rules again . And rule by CARDINAL party is above the law . A member of the ORG and a member of the \u0160TB embraced each other ... \u201d", "... represent a gross slander and disparagement of the civil honour and life , and an unjustified interference with the personality of the plaintiff PERSON", "...", "( CARDINAL ) [ The applicant ] is liable to pay FAC to the plaintiff in respect of non - pecuniary damage . ... \u2019 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was also ordered to pay costs and the other party \u2019s expenses .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the plaintiff had described the relevant events in his book Paragraph : LOC before the dispute concerning his past had arisen , and that no other relevant facts had been established in the course of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In the appellate court \u2019s view , the term \u201c fascist past \u201d was equivalent to the statement that a person was a fascist in the past . The court considered that the applicant himself had given a restrictive interpretation of that term in connection with the plaintiff , namely the interpretation according to the philosophy of the GPE trials . This philosophy was derived from the multilateral agreement of CARDINAL DATE , which included also the statute of ORG , and which had become part of the NORP legal order on DATE . ORG held that it was bound by the principle of individual responsibility set out in that agreement .", "CARDINAL . ORG further studied all available documents and evidence used during the GPE trials relating to GPE . It found no reference in those documents to the ORG in connection with fascist organisations . It established that the propagation or implementation of fascist theories had not been inherent in the statutory rules and regulations governing the ORG . If some persons had abused the NORP principles on which the organisation had been built , this had contravened the rules then in force . Such persons and , as the case might be , those who had let themselves be abused for criminal purposes , were individually responsible . However , such was not the case of the plaintiff . ORG accepted the latter \u2019s argument that he had learned about the character of the training course in Sekule only after he had started attending it .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court found irrelevant the reference , in the first - instance court \u2019s judgment , to Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE as that decree had only concerned property , in that it had placed under national administration the property of persons whom the ORG had considered unreliable .", "CARDINAL . ORG recalled that , at the relevant time , criminal and moral liability had been governed by Order no . DATE on the punishment of fascist criminals , occupants , traitors and collaborators and on the establishment of the people \u2019s judiciary adopted by ORG on DATE and also by Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL of DATE on the punishment of NORP criminals , traitors and their assistants and on extra - ordinary people \u2019s courts . These rules were partly based on the principle of collective liability , but they did not mention the ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards the poem by the applicant , ORG noted that it was dated DATE , that is , the day on which the sovereignty of GPE had been proclaimed from the balcony of ORG , where ORG had also been present . Shortly afterwards , the applicant had written his statement concerning ORG past and CARDINAL journalists had interpreted the poem as a description of the scene during the proclamation . They had alleged that by \u201c member of the ORG \u201d the applicant had meant to designate PERSON . The court therefore concluded that the applicant had infringed the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights by his poem as well as by his statement of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s request that the burden of proof in the case should be shifted onto the plaintiff or at least shared between the parties was not accepted as it had no basis in domestic law and practice . ORG concluded that the applicant had not proved that Mr Slobodn\u00edk had been a fascist in the past , holding that the latter had joined the ORG because he had wanted to participate in sports activities and had not been motivated by fascist sympathies . As to the training course in Sekule , it found that ORG had not completed it , and it was irrelevant whether he had been excluded or had left it on his own initiative . The only relevant fact was that the plaintiff \u2019s past could not be considered fascist from that point of view .", "CARDINAL . The applicant filed an appeal on points of law alleging , inter alia , a violation of his rights under LAW . He claimed that ORG should have concluded from the relevant provisions of Presidential Decree no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL that the ORG was a fascist organisation and that , in accordance with the relevant provisions of ORG Orders nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL , participation in any activity within the ORG was to be considered as participation in an unlawful fascist organisation . He further complained that ORG had not established with sufficient certainty whether the plaintiff had actually been excluded from the training course in Sekule , and whether he had undertaken to carry out terrorist activities or not .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE a different ORG sitting as a court of cassation upheld the part of the appeal judgment of DATE according to which the plaintiff was entitled to arrange for publication of the text set out in it and concerning the applicant \u2019s statement of CARDINAL DATE . As for the remainder , the court of cassation quashed both the first and second - instance judgments and sent the case back to ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court of cassation did not share the applicant \u2019s view that the plaintiff should be required to prove that the applicant \u2019s allegations were untrue . It further held that a person could be considered as having a fascist past only if he or she had propagated or practised fascism in an active manner . Mere membership of an organisation and participation in a terrorist training course which had not been followed by any practical actions could not be characterised as a fascist past .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had failed to prove that the plaintiff had a fascist past within the above meaning , the court found that his statement had infringed without justification the plaintiff \u2019s personality rights . In the judgment , the court admitted that NORP law characterised the ORG as a fascist organisation . It recalled , however , that the relevant legal rules , including those relied on by the applicant , applied to natural persons only where justified by their specific actions . Applying those rules to all members of such organisations without considering their actual deeds would entail the recognition of their collective guilt . It recalled that children over DATE had been admitted to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The court considered that the applicant \u2019s argument according to which his statement was a value judgment could only have been accepted if the applicant had expressly referred , in that statement , to the particular facts on which such a value judgment was based . The court stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Indicating that the plaintiff has had a fascist past is not a value judgment based on an analysis of facts , but an allegation ( statement ) made without any concurrent justification of factual circumstances from which a conclusion can be inferred by the person making the judgment . It could have been a value judgment if the statement [ of the applicant ] had been accompanied by reference to the [ plaintiff \u2019s ] membership of the ORG and his participation in the training course , namely , to the activities which the person making the judgment considers to constitute a fascist past . Only such a statement , based on circumstantial facts used by the person making the judgment , would be a value judgment the truthfulness of which would not require any proof . Only such an interpretation will guarantee a balance between the freedom of expression and the right to the protection of [ a person \u2019s ] reputation within the meaning of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court then found the restriction on the applicant \u2019s freedom of expression compatible with the requirements of LAW as it was necessary for the protection of the plaintiff \u2019s reputation in accordance with LAW seq . of LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the poem , the court of cassation quashed both the first and second - instance judgments for lack of evidence and held that in further proceedings the plaintiff would have to prove that the applicant had referred to him in the poem . It also quashed the part of the appeal concerning compensation for non - pecuniary damage and costs since their award depended on an assessment of both the interferences complained of by the plaintiff .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG reached a new decision on the remainder of the case . It stayed the proceedings as far as the poem was concerned on the ground that the plaintiff had withdrawn that part of the action .", "CARDINAL . ORG further dismissed the claim in respect of non - pecuniary damage as it did not find it established that the applicant \u2019s statement had considerably diminished the plaintiff \u2019s dignity and position in society within the meaning of LAW of LAW . In its view , the plaintiff had failed to show that the considerable publicity concerning his person had arisen as a result of the applicant \u2019s statement and not , as the case might be , as a consequence of newspaper articles and the plaintiff \u2019s book published prior to the applicant \u2019s statement .", "CARDINAL . Having considered to what extent the parties had been successful in the proceedings , ORG ordered the plaintiff to pay SKK CARDINAL,CARDINAL to the applicant in reimbursement of the relevant part of the latter \u2019s costs . The applicant and the plaintiff were further ordered to pay respectively SKK CARDINAL and CARDINAL in reimbursement of the costs paid in advance by the court .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG to discontinue the proceedings in respect of the poem and to dismiss the plaintiff \u2019s claim for non - pecuniary damage . ORG held that neither party was entitled to have the costs reimbursed . It further ordered each party to pay CARDINAL of the costs paid in advance by the ORG , namely SKK CARDINAL . Mr PERSON filed an appeal on points of law . The proceedings are pending .", "CARDINAL . The above decree was issued by President PERSON on DATE and concerned , inter alia , the placing under national administration of the property of \u201c NORP , NORP , traitors and collaborators and of certain organisations and institutions \u201d .", "CARDINAL . DATE ( b ) qualifies as unworthy of the ORG \u2019s trust", "\u201c persons who carried out activities directed against ORG sovereignty , the independence , integrity , democratic and republican form of the ORG , or the security and defence of GPE , who incited other persons to take part in such activities and deliberately supported the NORP and NORP occupants in any way whatsoever . Persons falling under this category shall include , for example , ... leading representatives of ... the Hlinka Youth ... and other fascist organisations of a similar nature . \u201d", "CARDINAL . DATE qualifies as being unworthy of the ORG \u2019s trust those legal persons whose administrations had deliberately promoted the conduct of war by GPE and GPE or served fascist and NORP aims .", "CARDINAL .
