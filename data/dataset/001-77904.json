SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant is a joint stock company which was established in DATE and has its registered office in GPE . Since DATE the name of the applicant company has been PERSON , a.s . It operates a mobile phone network in GPE . It is represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , their Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Under a contract of DATE between the applicant company and ORG ( PERSON informa\u010dn\u00e1 slu\u017eba \u2013 \u201c the SIS \u201d ) , which was supplemented by an annex of DATE , the applicant company cooperated with the ORG in its monitoring of telecommunication traffic ( \u201c interception \u201d ) in the applicant company \u2019s network . The cooperation included adjustments to the applicant company \u2019s switchboards .", "At that time the ORG \u2019s role and powers of interception were laid down in LAW ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE ( Law no . PERSON . , as amended ) . This provision contained no express rules as to who was to finance the interception and the equipment necessary for it ( \u201c interception equipment \u201d ) . According to the Government , however , the provision was in practice understood as imposing the duty to finance the interception equipment on the operators of telephone networks .", "On DATE LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) entered into force . It replaced LAW of DATE . Under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) the applicant company had a duty towards lawenforcement and ORG defence and security authorities to provide , at its own cost , the means for interceptions in its network . The scope and technical specifications of the interception equipment were to be approved by ORG ( PERSON \u00farad PERSON republiky ) .", "In a letter of DATE the ORG requested that ORG authorise an extension of the interception equipment used in the applicant company \u2019s network . The request concerned the existing equipment , which had been procured in DATE and now had to be extended on account of the expansion and modernisation of the applicant company \u2019s network . The police and ORG , who were also involved with interception , supported the request .", "The request was granted on DATE , but the decision was quashed on DATE on appeal ( rozklad ) on account of formal shortcomings .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing . It was attended by representatives of the applicant company , the ORG and the ministries of the interior , defence , justice , finance , and transportation , post and telecommunications .", "On DATE a representative of the applicant company was allowed to consult the case file . Following the consultation , on DATE , ORG again authorised the extension sought . It was understood that , by virtue of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE , it was the applicant company alone that was to bear the costs of the extension .", "At the same time ORG ruled that the authorisation would become effective immediately even if the decision as such were to be appealed against . This ruling was based on the pressing general interest which ORG found in the need to ensure the proper functioning of the ORG organs and agencies whose task was to monitor telecommunications .", "On DATE the Director of the ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicant company as unfounded .", "The applicant company challenged the decisions of DATE and DATE by an administrativelaw action in ORG ( Najvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed s\u00fad ) . As in the proceedings before ORG , the applicant company did not object to the duty to contribute to the financing of the interception equipment as such , but merely to the scope of that duty as established by ORG . The applicant company further argued that the procedure and the decisions had been arbitrarily classified as \u201c secret \u201d ; that the extension took no account of the applicant company \u2019s technical , staffing and financial capacity ; and that no cost - benefit analysis had been carried out . The extension was therefore at variance with the applicant company \u2019s property rights guaranteed under LAW and LAW .", "On DATE the applicant company lodged an application requesting ORG to stay the proceedings under LAW ( b ) of LAW and initiate proceedings in ORG ( \u00dastavn\u00fd s\u00fad ) with a view to reviewing the compliance of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE with the relevant provisions of the LAW and with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the action . It observed that ORG had held a hearing and that its decision had been delivered publicly . Classifying the proceedings as \u201c secret \u201d was not excluded by law and had not curtailed the applicant company \u2019s procedural rights . ORG also held that section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE unequivocally imposed on the applicant company the financial burden of the equipment in question . It was for ORG to specify the scope and technical features of the equipment , which it had rightly done . As to the applicant company \u2019s constitutional and LAW objections , ORG \u201c discerned no violation of the applicant company \u2019s constitutional rights \u201d . No decision was taken and no opinion was expressed in respect of the applicant company \u2019s application of DATE to stay the action and challenge the constitutionality of the relevant provisions of LAW of DATE . No appeal lay against that judgment and , upon service on the parties , it became final on DATE .", "The applicant company complied with the above decisions and accordingly incurred financial expense .", "In DATE the applicant company requested ORG to exercise his discretionary power to challenge section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE in ORG as being contrary to LAW and the Convention . The Prosecutor General acceded to the request .", "On DATE LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . ) entered into force . LAW ) ( j ) of that LAW provided for a similar duty in respect of financing interception equipment as section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW of DATE .", "The Prosecutor General subsequently withdrew his constitutional challenge in respect of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW and the proceedings in respect of it were discontinued without any decision being given on the merits .", "In DATE the applicant company again requested ORG to exercise his discretionary power and challenge section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( j ) of LAW of DATE in ORG as being contrary to LAW and the Convention . From the official internet page of ORG ) it appears that ORG lodged the challenge on DATE and that it is still pending .", "LAW ( a ) provides :", "\u201c The Constitutional Court shall have jurisdiction to determine the compliance of statutes with the LAW , constitutional statutes and international treaties which have been assented to by ORG and ratified and promulgated in the manner required by statute . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL , as in force from DATE , reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
