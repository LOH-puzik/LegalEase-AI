He is represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a NORP national . His parents , PERSON and PERSON , bought CARDINAL properties in GPE in DATE and DATE . In DATE they left PERSON for GPE , later went to GPE and finally settled in GPE where they lived during DATE of the Second World War . In DATE the applicant joined the Polish ORG under NORP command in GPE and was honourably discharged in DATE . Later he lived in GPE . In DATE his parents moved to GPE , where they died in DATE . The applicant underlines that he and his parents never relinquished NORP citizenship and used documents issued by ORG , although they were entitled to obtain GPE citizenship , and the applicant NORP citizenship , as he was married to a NORP . He claims that they all wished to return to GPE but were held back by the social and political situation in the country .", "After the war the properties were taken over by ORG in GPE as having been abandoned . The owners took legal steps to repossess the property , and on DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG ( S\u0105d Grodzki ) delivered decisions ordering the return of the possession of the properties to the applicant \u2019s parents .", "ORG thereupon issued relevant decisions on DATE and DATE to turn the properties over to the owners . The possession of the properties was taken over on their behalf by their authorised representative ORG and later by the applicant \u2019s father , who came to GPE for this purpose in DATE . Subsequently the applicant \u2019s father left the properties under the management of ORG ) .", "In DATE and DATE ORG requested ORG to declare that it had acquired ownership of the property by way of prescription in accordance with LAW on abandoned properties . The court accepted the plaintiff \u2019s submission that the properties had been abandoned within the meaning of this Decree and that the owners were at that time of unknown abode . It appointed a representative for them . Accordingly , ORG became the owner of the property .", "In DATE the land owned by ORG was , in the framework of a countrywide legal reform of local government , transferred to local municipalities .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer asked ORG for access to the files of the above proceedings and access was granted on DATE . On DATE the applicant requested that the proceedings concerning the acquisition by prescription terminated by the decisions of DATE and DATE be reopened . The applicant argued that these proceedings were invalid in law as they were flawed by serious procedural shortcomings , in particular the fact that the owners had not been properly represented and the court had not taken any steps to establish their address or to verify whether the properties had actually been abandoned within the meaning of the DATE Decree . The applicant submitted that his GPE address was indicated in the land and mortgage register of the properties and that they had lived there until DATE after returning to GPE in DATE . Later , until DATE , a relative of theirs had resided at the same address .", "The GPE filed an alternative motion for a declaration that they had acquired ownership of the property by way of prescription .", "On DATE ORG reopened the impugned proceedings and quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE . The court considered that it had been impossible for the owners to have their rights properly represented in the proceedings . ORG established that in those proceedings that court had failed to publish an announcement about the appointment of a representative for the applicant \u2019s parents in their absence , as required by the provisions in force at that time . Further , in both sets of proceedings the lawyer representing the owners of the properties had been appointed at the same hearing at which the final decision had been delivered . Therefore , he had not been able to prepare the case and his representation of the ORG interests had been illusory . This constituted sufficient grounds for finding the proceedings invalid in law . Moreover , the court considered that in the light of the decisions of ORG and ORG of DATE and DATE the assertion that both properties had been abandoned was ill - founded , as the applicant \u2019s parents were the officially certified owners and possession of the properties had been officially transferred to them in DATE . Therefore , ORG requests of DATE and DATE were to be dismissed , the decisions quashed and the proceedings invalidated . Lastly , the court found that the municipality \u2019s claim for a declaration that it had acquired ownership of the properties by way of acquisitive prescription in accordance with existing provisions could not be considered simultaneously and had to be examined in separate proceedings .", "Subsequently the GPE lodged a request with ORG for a declaration that on DATE it had acquired ownership of the property by way of prescription . The municipality argued that when the DATE and DATE decisions were given , its management of the properties became an autonomous possession cum animo res sibi habendi , which led to an acquisition by prescription after DATE provided for by law .", "The ORG heirs , among them the applicant , submitted that the social and political situation in GPE had prevented the applicant from coming to GPE DATE . In DATE his father had asked the NORP Consul to extend the validity of his NORP passport but had only been offered a CARDINAL - way passport , without the possibility of leaving GPE . Their lawyer in GPE had died in DATE and they had not known anyone else who could take care of the matter .", "On DATE ORG held that the municipality had acquired ownership of the property by prescription on DATE . The court established that the applicant had come to GPE in DATE to file a motion to verify the contents of the land and mortgage register . The court refused to accept the applicant \u2019s argument that the social and political situation in GPE had prevented him from coming to GPE DATE and that this circumstance should have been construed as force majeure , preventing the running of the period of adverse possession by the ORG . The court refuted the municipality \u2019s assertion that the period of adverse possession had begun to run from the decisions of DATE and DATE . It considered that the period had begun to run only from DATE as provided for by the transitional provisions of the DATE LAW . Therefore , even assuming bad faith on the part of the municipality , they had acquired ownership of the property on DATE .", "The applicant appealed .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court pointed out that ORG , when establishing the facts , had overlooked the decisions of DATE under which possession of the properties had been returned to the applicant \u2019s parents . The properties should therefore not have been regarded as having been abandoned within the meaning of the DATE Decree on abandoned properties . However , the court fully shared the conclusions and reasoning of the first - instance court in that from the moment the decisions of DATE and DATE were delivered , the ORG \u2019s management of the properties turned into an autonomous possession , and the period of prescription began to run from DATE and came to an end on DATE at the latest , before the applicant requested to have the proceedings reopened . ORG emphasised that declaring those proceedings invalid could not result in the invalidation of their legal consequences .", "On DATE ORG refused to entertain the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal , finding that no serious legal issue arose in the case which would justify the examination of the appeal .", "The Polish Civil Code , Book CARDINAL entitled Ownership and Other Property Rights , provides for various property - like rights for a possessor in Title IV : Possession . The relevant Article reads :", "Article CARDINAL :", "The possessor of property is both the person who actually controls [ holds ] the property as an owner ( an autonomous possessor ) and the person who actually controls the property as a usufructuary , the holder of a lien , a lessee , or a tenant or who has other rights associated with a certain control over another person \u2019s property ( a dependent possessor ) .", "Acquisition by prescription is regulated by LAW . At the relevant time it provided that a person could acquire ownership of land after CARDINAL years\u2019 continuous possession as long as this had been in good faith throughout the entire period . Otherwise , a longer period of DATE applied .", "Once these conditions were met , the person in possession could apply to ORG for a declaration that , as of a specific date , he had acquired ownership of the property .", "If the prescription period had begun to run before the entry into force of the LAW , according to the transitional measures , the new provisions were to be applied and the term began to run from the date of entry into force of the LAW , which was DATE . Previously applicable provisions had provided for DATE period of continuous possession in bad faith .", "Under NORP law judgments of ORG are not directly binding on the courts . However , ORG may deliver a resolution , which aims to interpret the provisions of law and serves as a kind of instruction for lower courts . When such a resolution is delivered by a chamber of CARDINAL judges , the resolution is considered a general rule of law and should be followed by domestic courts when applying the law .", "On DATE ORG delivered a resolution ( III CZP DATE , OSP CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) providing as follows :", "\u201c The period of holding a property on the strength of an administrative decision which was later declared null and void because it was delivered in flagrant breach of the law can not be counted by ORG towards the period of acquisition by prescription . \u201d", "The court found that acquisition of property on the basis of an unlawful action would constitute an abuse of right . It further considered that :", "\u201c ... a contrary conclusion would be at variance with common sense . The ORG quashes as null and void a decision upon which the ORG had unlawfully become the owner of the property , and at the same time the ORG , nevertheless , claims to be the owner of this property under the provisions on adverse possession ; whereas that very null and void decision was the basis for acquiring the property through prescription , since it was as a result of that decision that the ORG became a possessor . \u201d", "On DATE a chamber of CARDINAL judges of ORG delivered a resolution ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL , OSNC CARDINAL/CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) providing that the period during which the ORG held a property on the basis of a property title subsequently declared non - existent could not be counted towards the period of adverse possession . The court understood the term \u201c a property title \u201d as every event of legal significance or document which , under the provisions of civil law , might result in the acquisition of a property . Furthermore , ORG noted that management of property was not equivalent to autonomous possession within the meaning of the provisions on adverse possession . If the ORG held a property as a consequence of its public functions , it managed the property in the public law sense of the term and did not \u201c possess \u201d it within the meaning of LAW . Therefore , the period of management could not be counted towards the period of adverse possession , which had to be based on autonomous possession and not on any other way of holding the property ( for example dependent possession ) .", "The case - law of ORG which developed after this resolution is on the whole in line with the above resolution . For example , on DATE ORG issued a decision ( SN III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) finding that de facto control of an abandoned property by the ORG could not be regarded as possession cum animo rem sibi habendi , as until the time the ORG acquired ownership of the property it acted as a manager and not as an owner . Most importantly , the resolution of DATE has not been overturned by another resolution of CARDINAL judges and has been cited by most authors of legal commentaries as the conclusive authority on adverse possession by the ORG of properties owned by individuals .", "While there is general agreement that a defective administrative decision can not lead to an acquisition by prescription of property by the ORG , CARDINAL judgment reached the same conclusion with regard to the consequences of adverse possession acquired on the strength of a flawed judicial decision .", "According to another resolution of ORG of DATE ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG could acquire ownership of a property by adverse possession , if it possessed it on the strength of a judicial decision later quashed in an extraordinary appeal procedure . ORG was of the view that , contrary to administrative proceedings , normally the judicial activity of civil courts did not constitute an exercise of the ORG \u2019s public powers . However , the historical circumstances in which property had been expropriated by the ORG after the Second World War had to be taken into consideration . In this context , it could not be excluded that judicial decisions resulting in the ORG acquiring ownership of private properties involved special circumstances brought about by the ORG , abusing its public powers and the law to achieve the desired results in the sphere of civil law .", "Hence , each case had to be examined individually to establish whether the legally unjustified interference of the ORG was such that it made it practically impossible for a party to challenge the ORG \u2019s will using the normal protection measures provided for by civil law .", "This opinion was further interpreted by ORG in a decision of CARDINAL DATE ( V ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , which stated that it had to be examined in each case whether in the given circumstances a party had the possibility to put right the relevant court decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
