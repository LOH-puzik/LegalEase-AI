Following this introductory paragraph , the article went into detail on the applicant \u2019s conduct which had led to his conviction , including the ORG last names and details of their statements , an interview with the presiding judge , who explained that the applicant \u2019s personal circumstances , including his status as a GPE victim with no prior criminal record , were taken into consideration in choosing a mild sanction , and the journalist \u2019s allegation that if the applicant were unable to pay his civil debt under the judgment , his car or his apartment might have to be sold . The article finished with the following phrase : \u201c Easy gain turned into heavy consequences \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE quashed in part the judgment of the first - instance court in so far as it concerned the bribe - taking charge and remitted this part of the case to the prosecution authorities for additional investigation .

The applicant noted in this connection that the respective part of the judgment had eventually been quashed and that the case had been remitted for additional investigation . The applicant further submitted that the publication had caused him non - pecuniary damage , as it had resulted in his stigmatisation by the villagers as corrupt , that it had brought about complications in his family relationships and had made it more difficult for him to find employment and reintegrate into society . Accordingly , the applicant sought a declaration of the impugned statement as untrue and thus defamatory , publication of its refutation by the defendants , and compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . Although the applicant missed the DATE limitation period established for this kind of claims , the court considered that he had had valid reasons for that and accepted his claim for consideration .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found against the applicant . It noted that the information contained in the disputed article had been accurate at the time of its publication and could therefore not be considered defamatory or subject to refutation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He insisted that neither at the time of the publication nor later had his guilt in respect of acceptance of a bribe been established by a final judicial decision . He further alleged that publishing a full and detailed account of his conviction before it became final was in violation of the constitutional principle of the presumption of innocence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance court \u2019s judgment and its major point of reasoning that , when the article at issue had been published , the information about the conviction was accurate . The court further stated :", "\u201c As regards the appellant \u2019s arguments that by their publication the defendants violated the principle of presumption of innocence ... they are ill - founded .", "It has been established that the author of the article did not accuse [ the applicant ] of crimes before the pronouncement of the judgment in his case , but that he [ the journalist ] merely reported on the contents of the judgment , which had been publicly pronounced .", "Current legislation of GPE , including the PERSON of GPE \u201c On ORG \u201d , ... does not prohibit journalists from providing their readers with information concerning convictions by first - instance courts which have not yet become final .

Consequently ... the journalist had the right to analyse this thoroughly and report the proceedings to the public ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law , alleging in particular that the publication went beyond mere reporting on the outcome of the proceedings in the first - instance court . He submitted that it was couched in such terms as to leave no room for doubt in the reader \u2019s mind that the court \u2019s findings were correct . It featured details , unnecessary for reporting on a non - final conviction , such as the court \u2019s reasoning with respect to particular witness statements , a reference to the applicant as an apartment owner and other information not warranted by the context .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , acting as the cassation instance , rejected the applicant \u2019s request for leave to appeal in cassation .", "CARDINAL .
