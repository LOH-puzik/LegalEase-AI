GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Mark Villiger", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "The applicant \u2019s daughter PERSON was born on CARDINAL DATE . In DATE the applicant and PERSON , his then wife , separated . Since then PERSON has been living with her mother , who was awarded custody of her . On DATE the applicant had his last contact with F.", "On DATE the Berlin Tempelhof - ORG suspended the applicant \u2019s access to F. This judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint lodged against the latter judgment .", "In his first application ( no . MONEY ) to this ORG , the applicant complained , in particular , that the said court decisions suspending his access to PERSON amounted to a breach of his right to respect for his family life . He further claimed that the court proceedings concerned had not been fair . On DATE , the ORG declared admissible these complaints .", "The applicant \u2019s second application ( no . MONEY ) lodged with the Court concerns the refusal of the NORP courts to order the disclosure of PERSON \u2019s whereabouts to him .", "On DATE , when the amended LAW entered into force , the applicant lodged a fresh application to be granted access to his daughter PERSON with ORG . He relied on sections DATE and DATE of LAW ( see \u2018 Relevant domestic law\u2019 below ) . Subsequently , he submitted further observations dated DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE and DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE . In these submissions the applicant brought several motions for evidence to be taken and urged the court to speed up the proceedings .", "On DATE the ORG heard the applicant , PERSON and a representative of ORG . It decided that contacts between the applicant and his daughter PERSON should cautiously be resumed by an exchange of letters between them via ORG . Furthermore , a curator ad litem ( Verfahrenspfleger ) should be appointed in order to assist in the resumption of contacts and to represent PERSON \u2019s interests in the proceedings . The initiation of contacts should last for DATE , during which the proceedings were suspended .", "On DATE the ORG appointed PERSON curator ad litem .", "On DATE ORG , on the applicant \u2019s motions , resumed the proceedings . It heard the applicant , PERSON , PERSON and the curator ad litem PERSON", "On DATE ORG , having regard to the submissions of the parties and F. at the court hearings and to the reports of ORG and the curator ad litem , dismissed the applicant \u2019s request to be granted access to F. It found that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that there were new circumstances due to which the suspension of his access to F. as ordered by ORG in its final judgment on DATE should be ended . The court found that in the present proceedings , just as in the proceedings leading to the said judgment , the applicant \u2019s daughter had unequivocally expressed her wish not to have contacts with her father .", "ORG noted that there had been an exchange of letters between the applicant and PERSON via ORG . The curator ad litem had organised CARDINAL meeting between them in DATE , which both PERSON and the applicant had appreciated . Nevertheless , PERSON had subsequently stated that she did not wish to have further contacts with her father .", "ORG found that , contrary to the applicant \u2019s view , F. could not be considered as suffering from parental alienation syndrome . She was not unable to express her own view , and was not merely repeating her mother \u2019s views . This was proved by the fact that she had agreed to have contacts with her father in writing and once in person . In her hearing in court , she had not denied having appreciated the meeting with her father . However , she had disapproved her father \u2019s persistent struggle to enforce his right of access to her against her will .", "ORG found that in principle , contacts between a father and his child are in the child \u2019s best interests . However , the firmly expressed will of ORG , who had almost attained DATE , not to have further contacts with her father had to be taken seriously . Ordering contacts against her will was not in her best interests . According to the submissions of the curator ad litem , PERSON was torn apart by her GPE conflicts . Having to maintain court - ordered contacts with her father would affect her because of her loyalty to her mother , whose deep - rooted negative opinion of her father was known to F. Furthermore , due to the applicant \u2019s readiness to enforce a right of access granted to him by coercive measures , contacts between him and F. could not be expected to take place without problems .", "ORG found that it had not been necessary to order a further expert report . Even if an expert found that F. suffered from parental alienation syndrome , ordering access would be contrary to her well - being , given the conflict of loyalties in which she found herself .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against ORG decision , which he reasoned on DATE . A hearing of the parties scheduled for CARDINAL April CARDINAL had to be adjourned due to PERSON \u2019s illness .", "On DATE ORG heard the applicant , PERSON , PERSON and the curator ad litem .", "On DATE ORG ordered a psychological expert report on the question of access . Expert PERSON was notably to address the question whether PERSON \u2019s persistent refusal to have contacts with her father had to be considered as an expression of her own free will . The applicant subsequently appealed against the court \u2019s decision to order a further expert report and challenged PERSON for bias . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as inadmissible , as no appeal lay against the said decision . On DATE ORG refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint against these CARDINAL decisions .", "On DATE the applicant challenged the judges dealing with his case at ORG for bias , notably arguing that they prolonged the proceedings by ordering a superfluous expert report . He submitted further mostly handwritten observations dated CARDINAL , DATE and DATE and DATE , DATE and DATE reasoning his motion . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion for bias . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as inadmissible , as no appeal lay against ORG decision in this respect .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s motion objecting to the expert H. on grounds of bias and his motion to rectify TIME of the hearing on DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal as inadmissible , as no appeal lay against the said decision of ORG .", "On DATE ORG granted the applicant legal aid .", "On DATE expert ORG received the court \u2019s case - files . She heard F. on CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s renewed motion challenging H. for bias . The applicant refused to keep appointments with the expert on DATE and DATE . By a letter dated DATE ORG again invited the applicant to fix an appointment with the expert , but the applicant failed to do so .", "On DATE expert PERSON submitted her report , in which she proposed not to grant the applicant access to F. against F. \u2019s firmly expressed will .", "On DATE ORG , having heard the applicant , PERSON , PERSON , the curator ad litem and the psychological expert in person , dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It further relied on the reports submitted by a representative of ORG . The court found that the applicant could not be granted access to PERSON , because contacts with him , including those in the presence of a third party , were against F. \u2019s will and therefore contrary to her best interests . Ordering contacts with a parent against the firmly expressed will of a child who has almost attained the age of majority would violate the child \u2019s right to privacy ( ORG ) . PERSON was then DATE . She had expressed her wish not to meet the applicant persistently and in an unequivocal manner already at the hearing by ORG and when questioned by the curator ad litem , the court - appointed expert and the representative of ORG . In her hearing in court , PERSON had again stated that she wanted a rest from the applicant and did not want further court proceedings .", "The decision was served on the applicant on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG , which he further reasoned in his submissions dated DATE and DATE .", "Invoking the relevant articles of the German Basic Law as well as Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , the applicant claimed that the decisions of the family courts ordering that his access to F. remain suspended violated his right to respect for his family life . He further complained that he had not had a fair trial because the curator ad litem had been prohibited by the president of ORG to comment on the parental alienation syndrome from which his daughter suffered . According to the applicant , it had been superfluous to order a further report by a psychological expert . This had caused the length of the proceedings in ORG to become excessive .", "On DATE ORG , without giving further reasons , refused to admit the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint , as it was inadmissible .", "On DATE F. attained the age of majority .", "At the relevant time , i.e. after the entry into force of the amended Law on Family Matters ( Reform zum Kindschaftsrecht ) on DATE , the applicable provision of the Civil Code concerning access to a child born in wedlock was worded as follows :", "Section DATE", "\u201c CARDINAL . The child is entitled to have access to both parents ; each parent is obliged to have contact with , and entitled to have access to , the child .", "CARDINAL . NORP The parents must not do anything that would harm the child \u2019s relationship with the other parent or seriously interfere with the child \u2019s upbringing . ...", "CARDINAL . The family courts can determine the scope of the right of access and prescribe more specific rules for its exercise , also with regard to third parties . They may order the parties to fulfil their obligations towards the child .", "CARDINAL . The family courts may restrict or suspend the right of access or the enforcement of previous decisions on access if this is necessary for the child \u2019s welfare . A decision restricting or suspending the right of access or its enforcement for a longer period of time or permanently may only be taken if the child \u2019s well - being were endangered otherwise . The family courts may order in particular that contacts may only take place in the presence of a cooperating third party . \u201d", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , as in force since DATE , the courts sitting in family matters must modify their decisions if this is necessary for cogent reasons which have a lasting effect on the child \u2019s well - being ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
