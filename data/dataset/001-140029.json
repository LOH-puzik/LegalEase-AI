On DATE ORG of Kyiv ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) found the vice - president of ORG guilty of professional negligence and acquitted him of the other charges ( including the forgery of the lease contracts of CARDINAL and DATE ) .

The airbase manager also indicated that the tax inspectorate owed the ORG company CARDINAL NORP hryvnias ( ORG ) for the storage .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax inspectorate replied that meanwhile , on DATE , the aircraft had been declared ownerless ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that there were no lawful grounds for discontinuing their sale for ORG revenue ( see also paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . As to the supposed indebtedness , the tax inspectorate submitted that the planes , which were now State property , had been stored in a ORG - owned airbase and guarded by the tax police ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , it considered the claim for storage costs to be without basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG specified that , in accordance with the judgment of DATE , the CARDINAL An-CARDINALs were to be returned to the applicant company , which was their owner .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court issued a writ of execution on the basis of its ruling of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG in GPE lodged a claim with ORG against the applicant company and ORG , seeking to invalidate the lease contracts of CARDINAL and DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The claimant submitted that the applicant company had in fact supplied the planes to ORG free of charge , while the impugned lease contracts had subsequently been forged to conceal that fact , with a view to absolving ORG from any income tax payable . In addition to invalidation of the lease contracts , the tax administration sought confiscation of the CARDINAL aircraft , with the proceeds of their sale going to the ORG budget . It also requested that the planes be impounded as an interim measure to secure the claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court started the proceedings . It secured the claim by impounding the CARDINAL aircraft ( including that sold to company ORG and the one relocated to GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE company C. asked the court to lift the impoundment of the plane it had purchased . That request was apparently granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the claim of the tax administration as unsubstantiated . It noted that it had been common ground that ORG had not complied with the lease contracts and therefore the applicant company remained the owner of the aircraft . The court also quashed the impoundment order of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment . It stated that the applicant company \u2019s ownership of the aircraft had been confirmed by documents , while the allegation that some of the documents had been forged had been found to be unsubstantiated in the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigator of ORG issued a report about \u201c the temporary seizure of the taxpayer \u2019s assets \u201d in respect of the CARDINAL An-CARDINAL planes parked at the ORG airbase , with a view to \u201c settlement of the taxpayer \u2019s obligations vis - \u00e0 - vis ORG budgets and target funds \u201d . The report listed the ORG registration numbers and referred to subsection CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of the Law of GPE \u201c On the procedure for the settlement of LOC obligations to ORG budgets and special - purpose funds \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It was signed by a tax police official , the GPE airbase manager and CARDINAL attesting witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the deputy head of ORG issued a decision about \u201c the administrative seizure of the taxpayer \u2019s assets \u201d in respect of the aircraft in question . The decision reiterated that the measure had been undertaken with a view to \u201c settlement of the taxpayer \u2019s obligations vis - \u00e0 - vis budgets and ORG target funds \u201d . It was noted in the line \u201c the taxpayer whose assets have been seized \u201d that the owner of the aircraft had not been established .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Bila Tserkva City State Administration ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) issued an order by which it declared the CARDINAL aircraft ownerless and empowered the tax police to sell them . As a result , DATE the planes were sold to third parties ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant company lodged a claim with ORG against ORG , challenging the order of DATE . It submitted that it was the legitimate owner of the aircraft , that the defendant had duly been informed of that fact , and that the impugned order had amounted to unlawful expropriation of the applicant company \u2019s property .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in order to secure the claim of the applicant company , the court banned any transactions involving the aircraft .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on DATE a bailiff sealed the CARDINAL aircraft . ORG for ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which in the meantime had been set up under the chairmanship of PERSON , MP ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and to which the applicant company had complained , also sealed the aircraft .", "CARDINAL . The Bila Tserkva Administration appealed against the impoundment of the aircraft ordered on DATE submitting , in particular , that the applicant company \u2019s claim was of a non - pecuniary nature , being limited to the invalidation of a document .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected that appeal . It found the appellant \u2019s arguments groundless because the subject matter of the dispute was twofold : firstly , the impugned decision had declared the planes ownerless , and , secondly , it had authorised the tax authorities to sell the planes . Accordingly , a failure to secure the claim could jeopardise enforcement of any future judgment on the dispute .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Higher Commercial Court quashed the rulings of DATE and DATE on a cassation appeal lodged by ORG . It noted that as of DATE the planes had remained impounded in order to secure a claim in another set of proceedings under a ruling of DATE , which had not been quashed until DATE ( see paragraphs DATE and DATE above ) . As the legal procedure did not provide for \u201c double \u201d measures for securing claims , the ruling of ORG of DATE had no legal basis .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found in favour of the applicant company and quashed the order of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It stated that the property rights of the applicant company were confirmed by the aircraft registration certificates dated DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "DATE . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment . It also issued a separate ruling in which it referred , inter alia , to the documentary evidence in the case file proving that ORG had proceeded with the sale of the planes on the grounds that they were ownerless ( see CARDINAL and CARDINAL below ) after having received documents from the applicant company confirming the latter \u2019s ownership of those planes . The court thus concluded that , by declaring the planes ownerless , the defendant had infringed the applicant company \u2019s property rights . It further instructed ORG , ORG , and ORG \u201c to take appropriate measures in respect of the officials guilty of the violations of the procedure for identifying and declaring ownerless the property belonging to the [ applicant company ] . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the lower courts\u2019 decisions of DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) instituted criminal proceedings on the suspected abuse of power by officials of the tax and other state authorities , which had \u201c had grave consequences \u201d . The prosecutor noted that , by declaring the applicant company \u2019s aircraft ownerless and selling them , as well as by unlawfully seizing its ORG ( see also paragraphs ORG and CARDINAL below ) , the authorities had caused the applicant company \u201c direct pecuniary damage of CARDINAL GPE hryvnias \u201d . On DATE the supervision department of the ORG quashed the ruling of DATE as premature . However , this later decision was subsequently also set aside ( by the Deputy ORG decision of DATE ) . There is no information on any further developments in the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG of DATE and the related rulings of the higher - level courts ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) and remitted the case for fresh examination to the first - instance court . It considered that the courts had made a premature finding that the applicant company was the owner of the aircraft . The fresh examination of the case was supposed to clarify , including with the help of a forensic graphological examination , whether the contracts of sale of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were authentic and in compliance with the NORP legislation as indicated therein .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kyiv Regional Commercial Court , having examined the case afresh , allowed the applicant company \u2019s claim once again and quashed as unlawful the order of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Pursuant to the instructions of ORG , it had undertaken a forensic graphological examination of the contract of sale of DATE and the additional agreement of CARDINAL DATE , and had found the signatures on them to be authentic . The court further established that the transaction had taken place in compliance with NORP legislation as indicated in the contracts . It underlined that the aircraft had been declared ownerless despite the fact that the case file had contained copies of the certificates of their registration with ORG of GPE of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Furthermore , the NORP company S. had confirmed to the court in writing that it had sold the planes at issue to the applicant company . Accordingly , the court concluded that there were no reasons not to consider the contract of sale of DATE as appropriate proof of the applicant company \u2019s title to the planes . The court also found that ORG had breached the procedure for identifying and declaring the property ownerless .", "CARDINAL . ORG , ORG and ORG appealed .", "CARDINAL . ORG also enquired with ORG whether the applicant company was registered and pursued its activities lawfully .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG stayed the examination of the case pending receipt of information from ORG concerning that enquiry .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant company of the reply of their NORP counterparts confirming that it ( the applicant company ) had no criminal record , nor any problems with the police in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG and ORG , respectively , upheld the judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ; apparently at some point the jurisdiction over the case had been changed from commercial to administrative ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company asked ORG to return the CARDINAL aircraft to it , with reference to those judicial decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the tax inspectorate replied that it was impossible to return the planes to the applicant company , because they had been sold off at a public auction in the meantime ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following the seizure of the aircraft ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) , ORG commissioned the Ukrimpeks-CARDINAL company to store and sell them .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company unsuccessfully sought to prevent the sale before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ukrimpeks-CARDINAL sold CARDINAL plane to a private company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE CARDINAL other planes were sold to another private company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the sixth plane was sold to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Kyiv ORG started proceedings following a claim by the applicant company challenging all those sale contracts , and impounded the aircraft in order to secure the claim .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , ORG , from its side , also challenged the contract of DATE before ORG ( \u201c PERSON \u0430\u0440\u0431\u0456\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436 ( \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0445 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0443 ) \u201d ) .

On DATE ORG , in allowing the buyer \u2019s claim , declared the sale of DATE ( carried out in the form of a commodity market transaction ) null and void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the NORP ORG discontinued the proceedings in which the applicant company was seeking annulment of the sale contract of DATE , with reference to that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court also quashed the impoundment order of CARDINAL DATE on the ground that it was impeding technical maintenance of the aircraft ( the ruling did not refer to any requests to have the order quashed ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , in allowing the applicant company \u2019s claim , declared the sale contracts of CARDINAL March and CARDINAL DATE null and void .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG and ORG , respectively , upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG instructed its ORG to ensure security guard of the CARDINAL An-CARDINAL aircraft .", "CARDINAL . The planes were apparently still parked at the PERSON airbase after their sale to third parties ( see paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant company , on DATE it concluded a contract with a ORG security agency on the guarding of the planes . That contract remained in force until DATE and the applicant company paid a total of ORG CARDINAL ( which , according to its calculations , was equivalent at the time to USD CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) for the services provided . According to the Government , that contract was of no effect in practice , given that the planes remained in the authorities\u2019 custody ( see also paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "DATE . In DATE the applicant company found out that some of the planes had been damaged or had had some equipment removed , so it complained to the police .", "CARDINAL . As a result , on DATE the PERSON police investigator , in the presence of a representative of the applicant company , inspected the CARDINAL planes . The inspection revealed that some of them had been damaged and/or had had certain equipment removed . A door handle had been broken and the door damaged on CARDINAL plane , and the wheel housing , navigation equipment , engines , emergency radio installations , ORG seats and flashlight were missing on some of the planes . At the same time , some of the bailiffs\u2019 seals and those of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were broken or missing , whereas there were fresh and intact ORG seals on the planes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company complained to the ORG about the theft and damage of the aircraft , emphasising that it had happened while they were being guarded by ORG . The applicant company sought to institute criminal proceedings against the latter . It further argued that the planes had arrived at the airbase in good condition , referring to the fact that they had all been independently flown there , rather than taken inside the hold of another aircraft .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor \u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the officials of ORG on account of the theft , having found no corpus delicti in their actions .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the applicant company brought another administrative claim against ORG seeking the return of its CARDINAL AN-CARDINALs . It submitted that those authorities had committed an unlawful omission by their failure to return the planes to the applicant company as their legitimate owner . It further noted that the decision of DATE had been quashed by ORG on DATE , whose decision had been upheld by the higher - level courts . Nonetheless , the property had never been returned to the applicant company .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG terminated the proceedings on the grounds that they fell under criminal rather than administrative jurisdiction . The court noted that it had been discovered that the applicant company \u2019s claim concerned the alleged non - enforcement of a final criminal verdict ( apparently meaning the verdict of ORG DATE , further clarified on DATE see CARDINAL and DATE above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant company wrote to the tax authorities that it was the only legitimate owner of the CARDINAL aircraft , as the decision to declare them ownerless had been quashed by the courts .
