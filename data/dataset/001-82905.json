According to the applicant , he and the mother agreed in writing on DATE that they would participate equally in the care of their daughter and that she would spend an equal amount of time , DATE at a time , with each parent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the mother agreed that neither of them would pay the other maintenance in respect of their daughter . On DATE the agreement was confirmed by ORG ( sosiaalilautakunta , socialn\u00e4mnden ) of ORG , GPE .", "CARDINAL .

NORP The court received ORG of ORG and ORG ( Sotsiaal- ja GPE ) of GPE written opinions on the assessment of the parents and their living conditions . The NORP authority had interviewed the mother , the child and her brother , the mother 's partner and the child 's day care teacher .

On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , having held a hearing , rejected the applicant 's appeal . It held that the NORP courts had jurisdiction because the child resided in GPE and had a close connection with the country . It also agreed with the lower court that NORP law was applicable . As the parents ' agreement of DATE had not been confirmed by ORG , the custody had not been settled prior to the proceedings in question . Further , the court found that the child 's living conditions with the mother were balanced and solid . As the parents were unable to make decisions together relating to their daughter 's custody , the court saw no reason to amend the lower court 's decision .", "CARDINAL .

The mother was to assume responsibility for transporting their daughter to these meetings and for bearing the transportation costs . The court considered that the visits should be supervised owing to the fact that the applicant and the child had not met regularly for DATE . CARDINAL of the factors that contributed to this conclusion was that the applicant had allegedly tried to abduct the child . Further , as to the view of ORG that access should be granted twice a month for TIME at a time , the court found that TIME was too short a period in order to develop a trusting relationship between the applicant and his daughter and accordingly , it ordered that the visits should TIME at a time .
