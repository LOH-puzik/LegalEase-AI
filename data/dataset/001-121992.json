During the municipal elections of DATE the election results in CARDINAL of the municipalities were annulled because the election procedure had been breached . Shortly before new elections took place in DATE , the authorities carried out an investigative operation involving phone tapping . P. , a candidate in the elections , was among those whose telephone conversations were recorded . He was head of a company which , at about the same time , had been unexpectedly inspected by the tax authorities ( ORG PERSON policija ) . The police discovered various shortcomings in the company \u2019s accounting records as well as alleged tax evasion , and criminal proceedings were instituted .", "CARDINAL . Criminal proceedings leading to the order to disclose journalist \u2019s source ( first set of proceedings )", "CARDINAL . On DATE the newspaper \u201c PERSON \u201d published an article entitled \u201c Scandal . [ Political ] party \u2019s black money cash - box discovered ? \u201d ( \u201c Skand\u0101ls . PERSON atkl\u0101ta partijas meln\u0101 kase ? \u201d ) . It contained , inter alia , transcripts of PERSON \u2019s telephone conversations recorded in DATE . The conversations reflected PERSON \u2019s attempts to use his political contacts to settle a problem with the tax authorities . The conversations also raised questions as to the unofficial financing of the political party of which P. was a member .", "CARDINAL . The published telephone conversations had been obtained in the course of an investigative operation carried out by ORG ( Dro\u0161\u012bbas policija ) and were therefore considered as classified operational information . On DATE the Security Police instituted criminal proceedings under section CARDINAL of the Criminal Law for breach of confidentiality . No charges were brought .", "CARDINAL . It appears from the case - file that the investigating authorities searched the office of the newspaper concerned and seized an audiotape of the impugned conversations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who was a journalist at the aforementioned newspaper and the author of the article , was asked by ORG to give a statement in the criminal proceedings . Invoking his journalist \u2019s privileges , the applicant refused to disclose the source of the recorded telephone conversations .", "CARDINAL . Following a request by ORG , on DATE the investigative judge of ORG , after having heard the prosecutor and the applicant , upheld the part of the request concerning the disclosure of the source of the published telephone conversations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the R\u012bga City ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant . The judge noted , inter alia , that the investigation into the breach of confidentiality had not identified any suspects and therefore had not established at what level those responsible for disclosing the classified information had accessed it . The decision stated that even if other means of investigating could have been deployed , in a period when GPE was preparing to host a NATO summit the persistence of the aforementioned criminal activities could have put public safety and national security at risk . It concluded that it had been an exceptional situation and that the restrictions of the rights of an individual were proportional to the protection of the public interests .", "CARDINAL . The court also noted that the investigating judge had only partly upheld the request of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed a request submitted by the applicant to terminate the criminal proceedings in which the applicant had to give statements ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It explained inter alia , that the criminal proceedings had been instituted not as a result of the publication of the tapped telephone conversations but because of a breach of confidentiality committed by an individual who had been entrusted with the information in the course of his or her official duties . The letter further noted that the sole aim of the request to divulge the journalist \u2019s source was to identify the official responsible for the breach of confidentiality . The response could be appealed against to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Security Police asked the applicant to execute the court order of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant was also informed about possible criminal liability under LAW of LAW in the event of non - compliance with the order . The applicant again refused to disclose the information , invoking his rights as a journalist as well as the right against self - incrimination .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE the Security Police again asked the applicant to submit the information . They also explained that he had the status of a witness in the respective criminal proceedings , so his testimonies could not be used against him and his argument in that respect was unfounded .

On DATE the R\u012bga City Centre District Court found the applicant guilty and fined him CARDINAL lati ( ORG ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . The court noted that the intentional nature of the offence had been proven by the fact that the applicant had refused to give witness statements in the first set of criminal proceedings . The court concluded that the obligation imposed on the applicant by the court order was not contrary to the second paragraph of LAW in that by complying with the order the applicant would have prevented a criminal offence from being committed .", "CARDINAL . The appellate court upheld the lower court \u2019s judgment . It noted that in the first set of criminal proceedings the applicant \u2019s journalistic immunity had been overridden by the court order of DATE . The applicant had been aware of the procedural obligation imposed on him by the court order and therefore his refusal to obey had constituted the mens rea required for the offence provided for under LAW of LAW . The appellate court noted that the proportionality of the measure had already been measured at the time of issuing the order . In addition , judging from the responses of ORG found in the case file and the investigation in the first set of criminal proceedings , the appellate court concluded that ORG had had no other means of disclosing the source of the information .", "CARDINAL . In his appeal on points of law the applicant argued that his activities could not be qualified under LAW of LAW as there was a lack of intention on his part . He also relied on a recommendation of ORG and contended that the court order had not been proportional .", "CARDINAL . By virtue of sections CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW , the ORG of ORG of its own motion extended the limits of the appeal on points of law and found that ORG and the lower courts had wrongfully interpreted and applied section CARDINAL of LAW . In particular , the aforementioned provision provided for criminal liability for the non - execution of judgments or decisions if the execution fell within an individual \u2019s official duties . As that qualification did not apply to the applicant , there was no legal basis for applying the above provision to his non - compliance with the court order . The ORG revoked the lower court \u2019s decision and terminated the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant asked ORG whether , based on the outcome of the aforementioned criminal proceedings , it would publicly apologise to him , and whether measures had been taken in order to avoid similar situations in the future .
