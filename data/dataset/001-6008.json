In assessing the penalty ( PERSON ) the court considered as mitigating circumstances the applicant \u2019s \u201c neglected education \u201d ( vernachl\u00e4ssigte PERSON ) and his partial confession . As aggravating circumstances , the court took account of his criminal record and the fact that he was a recidivist .", "On DATE the applicant , represented by counsel , filed a plea of nullity ( Nichtigkeitsbeschwerde ) and an appeal ( Berufung ) . In his appeal he complained that the penalty was too high . As to the mitigating circumstances , he maintained that his neglected education was not given sufficient weight . Moreover , ORG should have taken into account his intoxication and his particular mental state at the time of the criminal act due to the fact that he had suspected the victim of having tried to prostitute his wife . The applicant did not make a request to attend the hearing before ORG .", "On DATE ORG fixed the hearing date for the applicant \u2019s plea of nullity and his appeal for DATE .

As regards the appeal , the court found that the concurrent nature of the offences ( PERSON strafbarer Handlungen verschiedener Art ) had to be taken into account as an additional aggravating circumstance . ORG ruled that a neglected education could not be considered as a mitigating circumstance in the applicant \u2019s case , given that he was an adult and had already been imprisoned several times before . Nor could the applicant \u2019s intoxication be considered a mitigating circumstance because , in view of his previous offences , he should have appreciated the effects alcohol had on him . As to his mental state at the time of commission of the offence , the court relied on an expert \u2019s psychiatric opinion to the effect that the applicant \u2019s personality was characterised by an aggressive attitude as well as coldness and hostility towards other people . Under these circumstances the applicant \u2019s special mental state could not be considered to be a mitigating factor . Furthermore , ORG noted that the applicant had not put forward any new mitigating circumstances ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
