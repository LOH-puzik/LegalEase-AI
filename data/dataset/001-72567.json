ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 5-4;No violation of Art. 5-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . Mr. PERSON , who is an NORP national born in DATE , currently resides in a religious home . On DATE , in GPE , he killed his mistress by firing several shots at her . He then left the apartment , leaving the body behind .", "On DATE , the police , acting on information in a letter from the applicant confessing to the killing , discovered the body . According to the police report , the circumstances of the act suggested that the perpetrator was not fully in possession of his mental faculties .", "Criminal proceedings were instituted against Mr. PERSON ; he was not arrested until DATE , by which date the preliminary investigation of the case had been completed and he had been committed for trial on a charge of murder .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG sentenced Mr. PERSON - who had pleaded not guilty - to DATE imprisonment for murder and to DATE imprisonment and a fine of CARDINAL GPE for possession of military weapons .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed , pleading for the first time , amongst other grounds , that he was insane at the time of the commission of the act of which he was accused .", "On DATE , ORG ordered an expert psychiatric opinion . The CARDINAL experts appointed for this purpose filed their report on DATE ; their conclusion was that at the date of the killing Mr. PERSON was suffering from a paranoiac syndrome ( sindrome paranoica ) depriving him of the capacity to form an intention ( capacit\u00e0 di volere ) and that at the time when the opinion was drawn up he was , in psychiatric terms , a dangerous person .", "As this conclusion was challenged by the expert called by the party seeking damages ( consulente tecnico ) , ORG directed on DATE that a further expert opinion be obtained . ORG wished to be advised whether the applicant was , at the time of the killing , partly or completely insane and whether he was still a danger to society . CARDINAL new experts examined Mr. PERSON on several occasions ; they saw him for the last time on DATE . Although their report agreed with the previous report in other respects , it differed as regards the precise diagnosis of his illness ; it also found that at the moment of the crime Mr. PERSON lacked the capacity to understand and not just the capacity to form an intention ( capacit\u00e0 d\u2019intendere e di volere ) . In addition , the report contained observations on the applicant \u2019s behaviour during his meetings with the experts . It mentioned certain symptoms of the illness that was diagnosed : evidence of megalomania was to be found in Mr. PERSON \u2019s overestimation of himself , in his superiority complex in regard to the experts , in his conviction that he was immortal and in his antagonistic attitude to the world around him . Furthermore , statements by the applicant alleging that he was the victim of widespread international conspiracies showed clearly that he was suffering from persecution mania . Finally , the report affirmed that the psychosis observed had certainly also existed at the time of the events giving rise to the criminal proceedings .", "ORG accepted these findings . On DATE , it acquitted Mr. PERSON on the ground of mental incapacity ( infermit\u00e0 psichica - LAW ) and directed that he be confined for DATE in a psychiatric hospital . This security measure was ordered on the basis of LAW as then in force ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Amongst other things , that Article provided that in a case like Mr. PERSON \u2019s the court always had to order confinement for DATE , there being a legal presumption that the accused was a danger to society .", "However , although it was under no legal obligation to do so , ORG also made a finding as to the applicant \u2019s mental health at the time of its judgment . It agreed in particular with the conclusions of the CARDINAL expert opinions regarding Mr. PERSON \u2019s lack of responsibility and the assessment of his dangerous character . It added that his dangerous character was not simply presumed but real , as the experts had unanimously found , and that attention should be drawn to this as a factor that could , in due course , assist in making a re - assessment of Mr. PERSON \u2019s state of mind when the question of the termination of his confinement came to be considered . Finally , ORG noted that the case concerned a \" paranoiac \" and that the confinement necessitated by his state of mental health should follow his detention without a break .", "Pursuant to LAW , taken in conjunction with LAW , ORG ordered the provisional implementation of its decision .", "CARDINAL . Appeals on points of law , based on different grounds , were lodged with ORG by the applicant and by the public prosecutor attached to ORG . Mr. PERSON complained of the failure of ORG to take account of a medico - legal and ballistic report which had been drawn up pursuant to a direction it had given at the hearings and which should have determined whether there had been homicide or , on the contrary , suicide . The CARDINAL appeals were dismissed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the judgment of ORG , Mr. PERSON , who had been continuously detained in prison since DATE , was admitted to the psychiatric hospital of GPE ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After that judgment , Mr. PERSON made several applications to the judicial authorities for release from confinement . He adopted basically CARDINAL different approaches .", "On the one hand , he applied on DATE to the supervising judge ( magistrato di sorveglianza - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) at the Santa PERSON court ( within whose jurisdiction the hospital was situated ) to have the periods during which he was undergoing psychiatric examinations whilst in detention on remand set off against the period of the security measure . This application was rejected .", "On the other hand , Mr. PERSON applied to CARDINAL different courts for early release from confinement , on the ground that it was not justified by his state of health .", "CARDINAL . He turned DATE as DATE , that is DATE after the judgment of ORG - to ORG ( sezione di sorveglianza - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) ; he relied on LAW and LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE , concerning the administration of prisons and the implementation of measures involving deprivation or restriction of liberty .", "ORG first undertook a series of inquiries . It obtained , inter alia , a medical report from the hospital , a copy of Mr. PERSON \u2019s \" clinical diary \" and several documents submitted by him .", "On DATE , a psychologist consulted by the applicant on a private basis issued him with a certificate to the effect that he had recovered and that it was necessary to release him if the clinical progress achieved was not to be completely reversed .", "On DATE , ORG held a hearing at which the public prosecutor \u2019s office submitted , on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , that that ORG lacked jurisdiction since the appeals on points of law against the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) were still pending . By order of the same date , deposited in the court registry on DATE , ORG ruled that it did not have jurisdiction . This order was based , inter alia , on a judgment of ORG , in which it was held that an application for suspension of the implementation of a security measure imposed following an acquittal that has not yet become final must , since it constitutes an issue forming part of the proceedings ( procedimento incidentale ) , be made to the trial court and not to the judge supervising the execution of sentences ( CARDINALst Chamber , DATE , in \" PERSON \" DATE , III , p. CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE , Mr. PERSON appealed on a point of law to ORG . That Court held on DATE that , under LAW , ORG had jurisdiction to determine the appeal . The judgment ( decreto ) was deposited in the court registry on DATE and the file was sent to ORG on DATE . By judgment ( decreto ) of CARDINAL DATE , deposited in the court registry on DATE , ORG confirmed the order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the date of his appeal to ORG against the aforesaid order , Mr. PERSON had also made CARDINAL other applications : CARDINAL was addressed to ORG and the other to ORG , within whose district the hospital where he was confined was situated .", "CARDINAL . At first , on DATE , the proceedings before ORG were suspended indefinitely because on DATE the applicant had failed to report back to the hospital after an TIME period of leave granted to him by the supervising judge at the Santa PERSON court . Subsequently , on a date which the Government were unable to indicate , ORG discontinued the proceedings before it . The applicant was again arrested on DATE and re - admitted to the hospital DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG in the first place suspended its decision pending the final outcome of the proceedings instituted before ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It resumed consideration of the application pending before it as soon as ORG had dismissed , on CARDINAL DATE , the appeal against the order of CARDINAL DATE ( ibid . ) . The hearings were held on DATE , that is even before ORG judgment had been deposited in its registry ( DATE ) . The material before ORG included a medical report dated DATE - that is , DATE after Mr. PERSON \u2019s return to the psychiatric hospital - , which had been drawn up for the purposes of the inquiry into the case ; the Chief Medical Officer ( Direttore capo sanitario ) of the hospital stated therein that \" from the clinical point of view there [ was ] no reason why the security measure should not be terminated \" .", "On DATE , ORG directed that the confinement should be terminated , having found , particularly in the light of the aforesaid report , that psychiatrically and criminologically Mr. PERSON was no longer dangerous . Before giving its decision on the merits of the case , ORG stated that it had jurisdiction to rule on the application although the public prosecutor \u2019s appeal on points of law against the judgment of ORG was still pending ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ; it disagreed with ORG interpretation of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "The order was deposited on DATE and Mr. PERSON was released on DATE that is DATE before the dismissal of the CARDINAL appeals on points of law ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW in force at the time of Mr. PERSON \u2019s trial , an accused acquitted on account of insanity was to be subjected to a security measure in the form of confinement in a psychiatric hospital ( ospedale psichiatrico giudiziario ) . The minimum period of detention was prescribed by law by reference to the seriousness of the offence ; in the present case , that period was DATE .", "Article CARDINAL , first sub - paragraph , provided that security measures could be imposed only on persons who were a danger to society and had committed an act constituting an offence under the law . Under the first sub - paragraph of Article CARDINAL , such measures were to be ordered where it was established that the individual concerned was a danger to society . However , the second sub - paragraph added :", "\" In the cases expressly provided for \" - including that covered by LAW , \" there shall be a legal presumption that the person concerned is a danger to society . Nevertheless , even in such cases the application of security measures shall be conditional on proof of a danger of this nature , if the conviction or acquittal was pronounced :", "( CARDINAL ) DATE after the facts occurred , when persons of unsound mind are involved , in the cases set out in the second sub - paragraphs of ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL ; .... \"", "The presumption created by the first sentence of this text was applicable in the present case .", "CARDINAL . On some points , there was a change in the law following a judgment handed down by ORG on DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) . It was held in that judgment that LAW , first sub - paragraph , and LAW , second sub - paragraph , of LAW were unconstitutional", "\" ... in so far as they fail[ed ] to make a decision that an individual acquitted on account of insanity be confined in a psychiatric hospital conditional on a prior finding , either by the trial court or by the judge supervising the execution of sentences , there was a continuing danger to society on account of the ... illness at the time of the application of the measure .... \"", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , as qualified by another Constitutional Court judgment ( no . CARDINAL of DATE ) , termination of a security measure such as Mr. PERSON \u2019s confinement can be ordered even before expiry of the minimum period , for example on application by the individual concerned , if he no longer presents a danger to society . LAW that the court shall in any event re - examine the position at the end of that period in order to determine whether the person confined still presents such a danger and shall , if appropriate , fix the date for a further examination .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , the implementation of a security measure may in certain cases , including that of a person of unsound mind , begin during the investigation or the trial ; this is no more than a discretionary power enjoyed by the court . At this stage , the measure is deemed provisional and only the trial court has jurisdiction over any questions to which it may give rise , including the question of termination of the measure .", "For security measures ordered subsequently to the investigation or the trial , LAW confers the power of review and decision on the judge supervising the execution of sentences ( giudice di sorveglianza ) .

Their respective jurisdictions , which are mutually exclusive , are laid down by sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Act no .
