THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is a NORP national , born in DATE and living in GPE , GPE .", "The second applicant , also a NORP national , is his wife , born in DATE . The third and fourth applicants are their children , born respectively in DATE and DATE .", "The applicants were initially represented before the ORG by PERSON and ORG , GPE , GPE . They are currently represented by LAW , GPE , GPE .", "The first applicant is the owner of a NORP restaurant situated in a designated conservation area in the centre of GPE . The applicant and his family live on the LOC .", "At the material time CARDINAL warehouses and a storage building were located in the immediate vicinity of the restaurant . These units were leased in DATE by a company manufacturing wooden artefacts . The company obtained planning permission in DATE to use the storage building as a craft workshop , it being understood that any industrial processes carried out were to be restricted to those falling within Class CARDINAL of ORG ) Order DATE .", "The company subsequently used one of the warehouses for paint spraying with the result that toxic cellulose paint spray fumes were emitted into the first applicant \u2019s restaurant via an illegal vent inserted into the wall of the warehouse . The applicants became ill , suffering from a variety of symptoms including headaches , chest problems and rashes . Complaints were lodged with ORG ( \u201c the local authority \u201d ) by the first applicant as well as by other residents affected by the fumes . The local authority was requested by the complainants to enquire into planning - related matters as well as environmental aspects of the company \u2019s operations .", "On DATE the local authority granted the company permission to construct a special chimney to channel the fumes away from the neighbouring LOC . However , the chimney which was built resulted in the fumes being directed downwards and worsened the situation for the applicants . They were eventually forced to abandon their home and business .", "Although the local authority served a prohibition notice and an abatement notice on the company DATE and DATE , no steps were taken to enforce these notices .", "In DATE the applicants issued proceedings against the company claiming an injunction and damages . However , the applicants were unable to continue with their claim since the defendant company was not covered by insurance in respect of public liability for the emission of fumes . In DATE the company abandoned its activities and the applicants returned to their premises .", "The applicants turned to the local authority to secure redress and on DATE issued a writ claiming damages for personal injury and damage to property as a result of the local authority \u2019s negligence in granting the company the planning permission which led to the chemical processes being carried out on the company \u2019s LOC and in failing to take enforcement proceedings under ORG .", "On DATE the local authority issued a ORG summons to have the writ struck out as showing no cause of action .", "foreseeability of harm and proximity of relationship between the applicants and the local authority , Mr Justice PERSON ruled that it would not be just and reasonable to impose a duty of care on the local authority . In Mr Justice PERSON view :", "\u201c ... It seems to me that it would be wholly detrimental to the proper process of considering planning applications if the local authority in addition had to have regard to the private law interests of any persons who might be affected by the grant of permission , and to ask itself in each case whether it had properly had regard to the individual rights concerned . If it were potentially liable to actions in negligence in those circumstances , it seems to me that the carrying out of its important functions in the public interest would be likely to be affected . ... It seems to me that the fact that the grant of planning permission does not give permission to create a nuisance or to do damage to a particular adjoining occupier carries with it that it is not and can not be implicit in the grant of the permission that there is any overriding of third party rights . Once one accepts that , it seems to me that it is impossible to say there is a duty of care owed to such a third person , because ex hypothesi there can be in the grant of permission no breach of that person \u2019s rights . .... \u201d", "Mr Justice PERSON considered that the applicant \u2019s primary remedy was the private law remedy for damages and/or an injunction against the company to stop the nuisance .", "As to the applicants\u2019 claim that they had suffered damage on account of the local authority \u2019s failure to take enforcement action , Mr Justice PERSON held that the decision to take such action is one which is taken in the public interest and should not be influenced by considerations as to whether there might be a claim for negligence if action was or was not taken in a particular case . Mr Justice PERSON pointed to a range of remedies which allowed an individual to protect himself in the event of a local authority not taking action to bring an end to a nuisance , including a private law claim against the person creating the nuisance and the laying of a complaint before a ORG .", "ORG granted the applicants leave to appeal .", "Before ORG the ORG counsel abandoned reliance on the arguments submitted in the ORG proceedings that the breach of statutory duty on the part of the local authority gave rise to a cause of action and that a breach of a common law duty of care could be demonstrated in relation to the original grant of planning permission . The applicant \u2019s counsel maintained that a cause of action lay in respect of the manner in which the local authority failed to exercise its enforcement functions to put an end to a statutory nuisance .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the ORG appeal against Mr Justice PERSON ruling . As regards the applicants\u2019 reliance on the failure of the local authority to take enforcement action under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG DATE , Lord Justice PERSON considered that :", "\u201c ... these are plainly provisions for the benefit of the public at large living within the area of the local authority and , albeit , under LAW , service of an abatement notice is obligatory if the local authority is satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists , it is not mandatory for the local authority to take proceedings for an offence under section CARDINAL ) . Indeed , should it see fit to do so , section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) anticipates the right of any person \u2018 aggrieved by the existence of a statutory ORG to make complaint to a ORG himself . Quite apart from that , the procedures in s. CARDINAL and s. CARDINAL exist in parallel with , and without any derogation from , the right of such person to take private proceedings against an adjoining landowner , whether for an injunction or damages . In those circumstances it seems to us plain that there is neither reason nor necessity in relation to such a landowner aggrieved by the failure of local authority to take action in respect of a nuisance , to create a right of action in damages based on such failure . \u201d", "On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "In separate proceedings the applicants sought to challenge by way of judicial review a decision reached by ORG of the local authority at a meeting held on DATE . The background to the meeting concerned a complaint lodged by the first applicant about smells and noises coming from the warehouses being used by a pottery business which had taken over occupancy from the company manufacturing wooden artefacts . The applicants maintained that the activity being conducted did not benefit from planning permission .", "At the meeting , the committee decided that the warehouses at the rear of the applicants\u2019 LOC were being used legitimately and no enforcement action had to be taken against the owner of the pottery business .", "The first applicant was present at part of the meeting and made representations to the committee . According to the first applicant , he only received official notification of the committee \u2019s decision on DATE through a council official who had agreed to reconsider the local authority \u2019s decision . The council official confirmed in the letter that the LOC were being used legitimately and added that any smells or fumes emanating from the LOC were intermittent and did not constitute a statutory nuisance .", "On DATE , DATE after being notified of the committee \u2019s decision , the first applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review . He maintained , inter alia , that the local authority had failed to take enforcement proceedings against the owner of the pottery business who was operating without the necessary planning permission .", "On DATE Mr Justice PERSON refused the applicant \u2019s request for an adjournment to enable him to put forward evidence as to why he had delayed the initiation of the leave proceedings in respect of the decision of DATE . The judge considered that the applicant had ample time to produce such evidence between the date when the local authority notified him that it would oppose the application on grounds of delay and the start of the proceedings . The judge dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for leave to apply for judicial review .", "On appeal , Lord Justice PERSON conceded that the scope of the planning permission in relation to the warehouses was not entirely clear . However , with reference to LAW , rule PERSON ) of the Rules of ORG and by analogy with time - limits laid down in planning legislation , Lord Justice PERSON found himself :", "\u201c ... driven to the conclusion that here the application was not made promptly , as required by LAW , rule CARDINAL of the Rules of ORG . There seems to be no reason why the applicant should have waited to receive the letter of DATE before seeking to challenge the decision of CARDINALth DATE . I can find no good reason to extend the period laid down by the LAW . \u201d", "Lord Justice PERSON further observed that , even if DATE the use made of the warehouses was unauthorised , it was now too late for the local authority to institute enforcement action .", "Lord Justices PERSON and PERSON agreed with Lord Justice PERSON \u2019s reasoning and in a judgment dated DATE ORG dismissed the applicants\u2019 renewed application ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
