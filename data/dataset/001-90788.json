In DATE the authorities in GPE enacted legislation regulating the organisational structure and functioning of religious denominations ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with the LAW , each religious denomination had to apply for registration and approval of its statute by ORG and to register its leadership with ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) attached to ORG . The local leaderships were registered by the municipal authorities .", "CARDINAL . In reality , the leadership of religious denominations was pre - approved or even directly nominated by ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG was no exception . A document dating from DATE , submitted by the applicants , attests that in DATE ORG of ORG discussed the need for \u201c cleansing \u201d in the leadership of the ORG and took measures to promote persons loyal to the authorities to leading positions in the ORG . In DATE , following the death of PERSON , ORG of ORG , in a decision dated DATE , nominated PERSON for ORG and instructed a PERSON , a government employee , to \u201c undertake the necessary preparation so as to secure the election of PERSON as ORG \u201d . Contrary to the Statute of the ORG , which provided that each eparchy had to hold elections for CARDINAL electors to a special ORG empowered to elect a new ORG , PERSON was elected by the electors nominated in DATE , when PERSON had become ORG .", "CARDINAL . It is unclear whether Patriarch PERSON \u2019s leadership was validly registered by ORG under LAW . At all events , in administrative practice and for all legal purposes , until DATE his leadership was recognised as being lawfully registered .", "CARDINAL . Soon after the beginning of the democratisation process in GPE in DATE , a number of NORP believers sought to replace the leadership of ORG . They considered that PERSON had been proclaimed NORP Patriarch in violation of traditional canons and the statute of the ORG and that he had been responsible for acts incompatible with the duties of the ORG . PERSON also had supporters . This situation caused divisions and internal conflict within the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Each of the conflicting groups in the ORG naturally associated with CARDINAL of the main political forces at the time \u2013 those who sought changes with the newly created ORG ( anti - communist ) and those who represented the status quo with ORG ( the reformed ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , following parliamentary elections , a new government was formed by ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG attached to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) issued a decision stating that the nomination of ORG and head of ORG in DATE had been in violation of its statute and ordered his replacement by an interim council pending the election of a new leadership by a ORG . ORG was appointed chair of the interim council .", "CARDINAL . The leadership presided over by PERSON appealed to ORG . In judgments of DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal , holding that the ORG had merely certified that another person represented the ORG and that , for that reason , PERSON rights had not been affected . Although it dismissed the appeal in its entirety , ORG stated that in so far as the ORG had appointed an interim leadership , its decision was null and void as being ultra vires , since the ORG lacked the power to make appointments in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the leadership dispute within the ORG continued , each of the CARDINAL leaderships having its supporters among the clergy and the believers . A number of churches and monasteries became known as \u201c belonging \u201d to the applicant organisation , popularly referred to as \u201c the alternative ORG \u201d , since the religious ministers in those places recognised the leadership of the applicant organisation .", "CARDINAL . There were also a number of cases where the applicant organisation took possession of existing buildings by force and , in some instances , with the assistance of the prosecuting authorities and the police , on an unclear legal basis .", "CARDINAL . NORP The relations between ORG and religious denominations continued to be regulated by LAW , which was interpreted in the administrative practice of the ORG and ORG as requiring each religious denomination to have a single leadership . Parallel organisations of the same religious denomination were not allowed . Thus , despite the divisions in the CARDINAL main religious communities in the country , ORG and NORP communities ( within which separate leaderships exercised de facto control over local structures and places of worship ) , the law continued to treat each religious denomination as a unified legal person represented and governed by the leadership registered with ORG under LAW .", "CARDINAL . At DATE , parliamentary elections took place in GPE . ORG obtained a majority in ORG and formed a new government , which took office in DATE . The position of the new government was that PERSON was the sole legitimate leader of ORG . On DATE the Deputy Prime Minister issued a decision ( no . R-CARDINAL ) , noting that \u201c the majority of the NORP clergy \u201d supported PERSON as ORG , \u201c in full conformity with the canon ... \u201d , and that it was essential to put an end to the acts of those who \u201c had profited from the DATE [ ORG ] intervention \u201d . The order further stated that it was not necessary to proceed with a fresh registration of the leadership presided over by PERSON since the courts had decided that the DATE decision purporting to remove him had not been valid .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a ORG , organised by several religious leaders of the \u201c alternative Synod \u201d ( the applicant organisation ) and attended by CARDINAL clergy members and believers , elected ORG as ORG and head of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE Patriarch Pimen applied to the ORG , seeking registration as the official leadership of ORG . The ORG did not reply . PERSON appealed to ORG against the tacit refusal .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , noting that the ORG was a registered religious denomination and that the ORG was under a duty to examine requests for changes in the leadership of religious denominations , found that the ORG \u2019s tacit refusal to examine the applicant organisation \u2019s request was unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE of ORG judgment , the ORG examined and granted a request submitted by PERSON for the registration of amendments in the structure of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . That decision was appealed against by the applicant organisation to ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE null and void . The court noted , inter alia , that it was unclear whether ORG presided over by PERSON had been validly registered in accordance with LAW of DATE . Furthermore , the ORG \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE had been issued at a time when another request for registration of ORG leadership , the request by PERSON , had been pending before the ORG . In these circumstances , the ORG was not entitled to proceed with the registration of the amendments requested by PERSON without informing all interested parties , such as the applicant organisation , and without considering those parties\u2019 arguments .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the judgment of DATE , the DATE registration of the ORG as presided over by PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was null and void .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the government of ORG stepped down and an interim cabinet was appointed . Following parliamentary elections , a new government of ORG was formed . A number of politicians from that political party , including the President of GPE , elected at DATE by universal suffrage , supported the applicant organisation .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the newly elected President of GPE took oath in the presence of Patriarch Pimen , thus recognising the applicant organisation as the legitimate leadership of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the mayor of GPE granted the request for registration of the applicant organisation \u2019s local leadership . In the ensuing judicial proceedings instituted by the other leadership , in a judgment of DATE ORG noted the developments in the ORG in DATE and concluded that CARDINAL religious organisations bearing the name ORG existed in GPE . Therefore , the church presided over by PERSON had no standing to appeal against decisions concerning the ORG presided over by PERSON . ORG thus dismissed the appeal as inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . In DATE and DATE the ORG authorities urged the CARDINAL opposing leaderships to unite and adopted the view that pending such unification none of them could claim to unite all clergy and believers and represent the ORG . On several official festive occasions , breaking with tradition , the President of GPE refused to invite any representative of the ORG , as that would have required choosing between the CARDINAL opposing groups .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant organisation decided to convene in DATE or DATE a national congregation of clergy and believers with the ambition to unite the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG presided over by PERSON held a national convention with the same ambition . The convention , which was proclaimed as a Holy Expanded and ORG - jurisdictional ORG , was attended by patriarchs and other senior clergy from ORG from GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . According to the minutes , submitted by the third party , a number of adherents of the applicant organisation , including ORG and FAC , made statements of repentance and were accepted under the leadership of Maxim but were demoted to lower ranks in the clergy . The minutes contained language strongly condemning the applicant organisation for having caused a schism .", "CARDINAL . LAW DATE and DATE did not bring about reconciliation . The applicant organisation continued its efforts to unite the believers under a new leadership and refused to accept the leadership of PERSON . It appears that ORG and FAC either did not make statements of repentance at FAC or retracted them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant organisation held a national congregation organised by it . It was attended by CARDINAL participants , including CARDINAL members of the clergy . The participants voted for the removal of PERSON and adopted a new statute of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Patriarch Pimen passed away in DATE . The applicant organisation appointed PERSON to act as Chair of ORG and its representative , pending the nomination of a new ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant organisation asked the ORG to register the new leadership . As no reply was received , the applicant organisation submitted an appeal to ORG . On DATE the court dismissed the appeal , finding that the issue had already been decided by the judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The Directorate and ORG never registered the applicant organisation .", "CARDINAL . At all relevant times , Patriarch PERSON \u2019s leadership enjoyed international support from ORG and other religious organisations worldwide . It appears that the applicant organisation has never had significant international support from ORG outside GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following parliamentary elections , the government of ORG was replaced by a government formed by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Representatives of the new ruling political party , including its leader , publicly expressed their opinion that Patriarch PERSON was the legitimate leader of the ORG and stated their intention to introduce legislation with the aim of putting an end to the divisions in the ORG .", "CARDINAL . That was done with effect from DATE , when the new Religious Denominations Act DATE came into force .", "CARDINAL . The official record of the parliamentary debates during the passage of the LAW reveal an almost unanimous opinion that the unity of ORG was of crucial national importance because of its historical role in shaping and preserving the NORP national identity over DATE .", "CARDINAL . The records also reveal that a number of deputies from the political groups which introduced the bill and voted for it were of the view that the correct reading of the ORG canons demonstrated that PERSON was the canonical head of the ORG and that for that reason it was justified to adopt provisions enshrining in law the legitimacy of the canonical leadership of the ORG and excluding the other leadership . Some deputies emphasised , in addition , the need to remedy the DATE unlawful ORG interference in the organisation of the ORG . The opposition deputies considered that the bill was unconstitutional as it interfered in the internal affairs of the religious community . Some of them also relied on the fact that PERSON had been nominated by ORG and had ruled the ORG according to its policy and contrary to canon .", "CARDINAL . The new Act provided , inter alia , for the ex lege recognition of ORG . It also introduced a provision which stated that the ORG \u201c is headed by ORG and is represented by ORG ... \u201d The LAW prohibited CARDINAL denomination carrying the same name and stated , in its transitional provisions , that persons who had seceded from a registered religious institution were not entitled to use its name or assets ( see for more details paragraphs CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . It is unclear whether the representation of the ORG has been recorded ( \u0432\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043do ) in the public register at ORG . The Government \u2019s position , supported by a statement issued by ORG of ORG on DATE , appears to be that no such recording was necessary and that it has not been done . No reference was made in this statement to section DATE CARDINAL Act and the fact that ORG had stated that the recording requirement contained in that provision applied to ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Contradictory information as regards the recording of the ORG is contained in a publication submitted by the applicants . According to CARDINAL statement contained in that publication , such recording has been made , apparently indicating PERSON as the ORG \u2019s representative , on the basis of an \u201c expert opinion by ORG attached to ORG \u201d . According to a report by the President of ORG of ORG contained in the same publication , ORG has not been entered in the register .", "DATE . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant organisation applied to ORG for the registration of its local organisation in GPE . The request was made by FAC , who stated that he headed and represented ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request . The court noted that registration could only be granted if requested by the person representing ORG . In accordance with section DATE Act , the ORG was presided over by its ORG . The court further stated that the fact that the NORP Patriarch was PERSON was \u201c publicly known and internationally recognised \u201d . The opinion of CARDINAL judges of ORG in a judgment of DATE allegedly supported that view ( see paragraphs QUANTITY below ) . On that basis the court declared the request inadmissible as it had not been submitted by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On appeal , ORG judgment was upheld by ORG on DATE . In these proceedings , ORG sought the opinion of ORG attached to ORG on the situation in the ORG but noted in its judgment that it was not bound to follow the opinion of the executive branch . In its judgment , ORG noted that the applicant organisation had not submitted a copy of the statute of ORG and had not proved that FAC represented it . In particular , the judgments of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , relied upon by the applicant organisation , did not prove the relevant facts .", "CARDINAL . The final decision was that of ORG . ORG upheld the lower courts\u2019 reasoning and stated that the request was inadmissible in the absence of proof about the leadership of the ORG and its representatives .", "CARDINAL . The attempts of the applicant organisation to achieve recognition of its local church councils under LAW were refused in most cases for the same reason . In its judgment of DATE judgment ( in case no . CARDINAL ) refusing such a request , ORG stated that FAC had not submitted proof about the identity of the head of the ORG , as recorded at ORG under section CARDINAL of the LAW , and could not , therefore , act on behalf of the ORG . Also , \u201c it was publicly known that ORG had a ORG \u201d and the court could not deal with the question whether the ORG \u2019s nomination in DATE had been lawful .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL regional courts , however , the applicant organisation obtained decisions registering its local church councils \u2013 in ORG by CARDINAL decisions of CARDINAL DATE and in ORG by several decisions of DATE . The courts apparently accepted that the applicant organisation represented the ORG .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period some religious ministers who associated with the applicant organisation decided to return under the leadership of Patriarch ORG . In respect of those who did not do so , in DATE and on subsequent occasions the leadership of ORG presided over by Patriarch Maxim issued decisions terminating their functions as religious ministers . Some of the ousted ministers unsuccessfully challenged their dismissal before the civil courts .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the ORG , as represented by PERSON , invited the applicant organisation to vacate all churches and religious buildings it controlled . On DATE a complaint to the prosecution authorities was filed , in which Patriarch PERSON requested them to carry out an inquiry and , where appropriate , institute criminal proceedings against FAC and his supporters . He also requested , accordingly , the search and seizure of seals and other belongings , as well as the institution of civil proceedings on behalf of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE ORG instructed local prosecutors to assist ORG in recovering its property . On DATE local prosecutors throughout the country issued orders for the eviction of persons \u201c unlawfully occupying \u201d churches and religious institutions .", "CARDINAL . The text of all those decisions was almost identical as , apparently , it had been copied from the instructions given by ORG . The prosecutors noted that LAW did not allow the existence of CARDINAL religious denomination bearing the same name and prohibited the use of the name and property of a religious denomination by persons who had seceded from it . The prosecutors further observed that the courts had rejected the applicant organisation \u2019s request for registration in GPE and that its representatives in local parishes had been invited to leave voluntarily the premises they occupied . The prosecutors concluded that the persons associated with the applicant organisation unlawfully prevented the legitimate religious ministers appointed by the ORG from performing their duties . For these reasons police evictions were ordered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in the morning the police blocked CARDINAL churches and monasteries in the country , evicted the religious ministers and staff who identified themselves with the applicant organisation and transferred the possession of the buildings to representatives of the other leadership . The applicant organisation submits that among those buildings there were several new churches , built entirely under its leadership .", "CARDINAL . Some of the ousted religious ministers sought the assistance of the prosecuting authorities against the forceful evictions . Their requests were refused in decisions stating that the persons who had entered into possession of the disputed buildings were legitimate representatives of ORG , to which the buildings belonged .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL individual applicants were evicted on DATE from the church of PERSON in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE criminal proceedings were opened against FAC and ORG , who belonged to the applicant organisation , for usurping the functions of religious ministers , contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE ORG acquitted Metropolitan Inokentiy . The prosecutor appealed . In a final judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG upheld the acquittal . ORG was also acquitted , by a judgment of DATE of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The reasoning of the courts in the above CARDINAL cases was essentially identical . They noted that since DATE ORG had been divided and that after DATE neither PERSON nor PERSON or his successor had been lawfully registered as the head of ORG . Furthermore , Metropolitan Inokentiy and ORG had been registered , prior to the entry into force of LAW , as leaders of the respective local divisions of the ORG , the PERSON and the PERSON . In these circumstances the accused persons had been entitled to act as religious ministers and had done so in the belief that they were lawfully exercising their function . It followed that they had not committed the offence under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The relevant constitutional provisions read as follows .", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG shall be free .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP institutions shall be separate from the State ...", "( CARDINAL ) Religious institutions and communities and religious beliefs shall not be used for political ends . \u201d", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) NORP The freedom of conscience , the freedom of thought and the choice of religion or of religious or atheistic views shall be inviolable . The ORG shall assist in the maintenance of tolerance and respect between the adherents of different denominations , and between believers and non - believers .", "( CARDINAL ) The freedom of conscience and religion shall not be exercised to the detriment of national security , public order , public health and morals , or of the rights and freedoms of others . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , interpreting LAW , stated , inter alia , that the ORG should not interfere with the internal organisation of religious communities and institutions except in accordance with LAW and LAW .", "CARDINAL . The LAW governed the organisational structure and functioning of religious denominations DATE and DATE . It provided that each religious denomination had to apply for registration and approval of its statute by ORG and to register its leadership with the ORG . The local leaderships were registered by the municipal authorities .", "DATE . The CARDINAL Act was interpreted in administrative practice as prohibiting parallel organisations of the same religious denomination and requiring that each religious denomination must have a single leadership .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period , the judicial practice in appeals against the ORG of ORG decisions on the registration of religious denominations and their leaderships was contradictory . In some cases the courts took the view that ORG and the ORG enjoyed unfettered discretion in such registrations . In other cases the courts reviewed the change - of - leadership decisions for compliance with the statute of the religious denomination , as registered by the ORG . In CARDINAL case ORG recognised the existence of CARDINAL parallel organisations of CARDINAL and the same religious denomination ( see the following judgments of ORG : judgment no . DATE in case no . CARDINAL , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The LAW provides for judicial registration of all religious denominations except ORG , which is recognised as a legal person ex lege . In accordance with paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions , ORG need not be re - registered under LAW , unlike all other religious denominations .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the new LAW provides , inter alia , that ORG is a legal person whose structure is determined by its internal statute . In accordance with the same provision , the ORG \u201c is headed by ORG and is represented by ORG ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides that there can be CARDINAL religious denomination with the same name . Under section CARDINAL , persons acting on behalf of a religious denomination without authorisation are to be fined by ORG .", "CARDINAL . Paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the LAW provides that persons who had seceded from a registered religious institution before the LAW \u2019s entry into force in breach of the institution \u2019s internal rules are not entitled to use the name of the religious institution or its assets .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL provides that information about religious denominations , including the names of the persons representing them for all legal purposes , is recorded ( \u0432\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 ) in a public register at ORG . ORG has stated that this requirement applies to ORG ( judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL ; see also the same interpretation in other judgments : ORG , judgment of DATE in case no . CARDINAL , and ORG , judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE in case no . CARDINAL ) ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE CARDINAL members of ORG asked ORG to repeal certain provisions of the new Religious Denominations Act DATE as being unconstitutional and contrary to the Convention .", "DATE . Paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions of the new Act was among the provisions challenged . Some of the other provisions that are relevant to the ORG complaints , such as sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW , were not challenged .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court gave judgment on DATE . It could not reach a majority verdict , an equal number of justices having voted in favour of and against the request to declare paragraph CARDINAL of the transitional provisions unconstitutional . According to ORG practice , in such circumstances the request for a legal provision to be struck down is considered to be dismissed by default .", "CARDINAL . The justices who voted against the request considered , inter alia , that the principle of legal certainty required that persons who had seceded from a religious denomination should not be allowed to use its name . Further , it was obvious that they could not claim part of its assets , as the assets belonged to the religious denomination as a legal person .", "CARDINAL . The justices who considered that the provision was unconstitutional stated that it purported to regulate issues that concerned the internal organisation of religious communities and thus violated their autonomy . Those justices further stated that the provision , applied in the context of existing disputes , favoured CARDINAL of the groups in a divided religious community and therefore did not contribute to maintaining tolerance but rather frustrated that aim . It thus violated LAW .", "CARDINAL . This provision makes it punishable to usurp the functions of a public figure or to wear attire or symbols to which one is not entitled . The punishment is imprisonment of DATE or community labour ( \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f ) .", "CARDINAL . In Resolution CARDINAL ( DATE ) , adopted on DATE , ORG of ORG criticised the new Religious Denominations Act DATE and stated , among other things :", "\u201c The strongest doubts concern the state interference allowed for , or even operated directly by the [ Religious Denominations Act DATE ] , in the internal affairs of religious communities . This concerns in particular the leadership quarrel between the CARDINAL NORP synods led , respectively , by PERSON and by FAC , who disputes the legitimacy of PERSON as ORG . The ex lege recognition of ORG , as defined meticulously in [ section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ] , exempting this institution from the usual registration procedure , which also includes a check on the legitimacy of the leadership , is generally seen as intended to settle the dispute between PERSON and Inokentiy in favour of the former . The alternative synod is effectively barred from registering as a new religious institution by the prohibition against the registration of another institution using the same name and headquarters and the punitive provisions empowering ORG to sanction \u2018 unauthorised representatives\u2019 ...", "The ORG therefore recommends to the NORP authorities : ... as regards [ section ORG ) of the Act ] ( ex lege recognition of ORG ) : either to delete this provision outright , thereby subjecting ORG to the same registration requirements as other religious communities ; or to ensure in other ways without interference by the executive that the leadership of ORG is legitimate according to NORP canonical law ; ... as regards [ section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) ] ( no registration of an identical religious community ) : either to delete this provision , or to ensure its interpretation in such a way that only the strict and literal identity of names and headquarters precludes the registration of a breakaway group ; ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["11", "9"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
