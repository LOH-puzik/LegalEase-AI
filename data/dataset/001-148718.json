The argument raised in the application for judicial review that the disputed administrative act did not contain any reasoning and was not based on the law is ill - founded .

Contrary to the applicant \u2019s arguments , the excerpts presented in the case \u2012 prepared in accordance with the [ law on classified information ] \u2012 are official attestation documents , which have binding force for the court as regards the contents of the proposal and the information document , on the basis of which \u2012 in accordance with the applicable substantive rules \u2012 the disputed order has been made . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
