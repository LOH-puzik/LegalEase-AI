The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant married NORP , a NORP national who was born in DATE . They decided to live in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE their son , C. , was born there . He is a national of GPE and of GPE . Parental responsibility was exercised jointly by both parents .", "CARDINAL . DATE NORP made several trips to GPE , sometimes accompanied by C. She decided to settle there with the child , in the municipality of LOC ( GPE of GPE ) , from CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , NORP and PERSON moved to PERSON ( GPE of GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NORP petitioned for divorce before GPE ( GPE of GPE ) and at the same time requested interim measures for the duration of the divorce proceedings , particularly with a view to obtaining custody of the child .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant petitioned for separation before a GPE court .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , the President of the appropriate division of ORG provisionally granted NORP custody of C.", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant started proceedings in ORG . Relying on LAW of DATE on ORG ( \u201c LAW \u201d , see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , he sought an order that his son be returned promptly to GPE . In support of his request he stated that his wife had gone to GPE in DATE , accompanied by the child , for DATE and also for health reasons . The applicant had joined her for a DATE holiday in DATE and had agreed with his wife that he would return alone to the GPE on DATE . Just before his departure NORP had , however , presented him with a divorce agreement . He had found it unacceptable and had thus refused to sign it . He then returned to the GPE without his child .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE the President of the appropriate division of ORG ordered NORP to surrender PERSON 's passport and prohibited her from leaving GPE . At the same time , he decided to join the proceedings concerning the child 's return to the divorce proceedings , including the determination of rights of custody and access .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NORP deposited the child 's NORP passport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE NORP submitted her observations on the request for the child 's return to the GPE , arguing that the parties had decided to move to GPE at DATE . Thus , she alleged , the provisions of LAW were not applicable to the present case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the President of ORG dismissed the applicant 's request for the child 's return to the GPE . He found that the situation admittedly appeared to be one of wrongful removal or retention within the meaning of DATE , sub - paragraph ( a ) , of LAW , given that parental responsibility for C. had been exercised jointly by both parents under the applicable laws of GPE where the child had habitually resided before his removal . The President further acknowledged that the decision of DATE to join the proceedings concerning the child 's return and the divorce proceedings had not complied with LAW , which precluded any decision on the merits of rights of custody before the ruling on the child 's return .", "CARDINAL . The court nevertheless refused to grant the request for the child 's return to the GPE , finding that the applicant had consented to the removal and retention of the child , thus removing any wrongfulness from NORP 's conduct for the purposes of LAW , sub - paragraph ( a ) , of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the absence of witnesses , the President of the appropriate division of the court examined whether the applicant 's allegations could be regarded as sufficiently credible ( hinreichend glaubhaft ) . He found that the applicant had been unable to submit evidence in support of his allegation that , whilst he had agreed to the mother 's temporary stay in GPE , this had only been on the condition that she return the child to GPE once her visit to GPE for medical treatment had ended . Moreover , the judge took the view that the applicant had failed to show that the mother 's health problems had been resolved in DATE and that NORP 's residence in GPE was thus no longer justified from that time . On the contrary , the applicant could not reasonably have believed that his wife and child were only going to remain in GPE for a short time , as the mother had had herself registered in CARDINAL NORP municipalities in succession and had taken steps to find work there . The applicant had been kept informed of all these developments by his wife , whom he had in fact visited on several occasions .", "CARDINAL . In view of the above , the judge of ORG found , first , that the child 's removal to GPE had not been unlawful under LAW , sub - paragraph ( a ) , of LAW , since the applicant had given his express consent , and , secondly , that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegation of the child 's wrongful retention .", "CARDINAL . In parallel the applicant brought an action for unjustified delay before ORG ( Obergericht ) of the GPE of LOC . He requested , firstly , an immediate decision on his application of DATE for the child 's return to GPE , and , secondly , the opening of a disciplinary procedure and the taking of appropriate measures against the President of ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG supervisory panel ( Inspektionskommission des Obergerichts ) observed that the impugned decision , concerning the child 's return to the GPE , had been given in the meantime , on DATE . It noted that ORG had exceeded the DATE time - limit provided for in LAW for a decision on the child 's return . It further found that there had been an unjustified delay in the proceedings brought by the applicant . As regards the requested disciplinary measures against the President of ORG , the panel found that such measures were not appropriate having regard to the circumstances that had led to the delay . It pointed out that the President of ORG was required to adhere to a calendar that the panel itself had imposed , requiring disposal of older cases and the holding of hearings that could not be adjourned . Other factors came into play , such as the absence of a greffi\u00e8re and the busy DATE period . The panel also found that there were no indications to suggest that the delay could be attributed to other grounds , of a political nature , as the applicant had claimed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a second appeal before the GPE of ORG against ORG decision of CARDINAL DATE , arguing among other things that the latter had reversed the burden of proof , in patent disregard of LAW .", "CARDINAL Par une d\u00e9cision du DATE , la cour d\u2019appel rejeta ce recours.<}CARDINAL{>. NORP In a decision of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal.<CARDINAL } Whilst it acknowledged that the President of ORG had wrongly reversed the burden of proof against the applicantapplicant had , in a sufficiently unequivocal manner , consented to the child 's retention for an indefinite period .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant lodged a public - law appeal with ORG , seeking the prompt return of his child to GPE . He alleged that there had been numerous violations of the right to be heard , in particular because ORG had not duly taken into account or had misconstrued his offers to adduce proof to show that he had not consented to his child 's retention . Moreover , he criticised the fact that ORG had merged the proceedings concerning the child 's return with the divorce proceedings and that its decision on the child 's return had by far exceeded the time - limit provided for LAW . Lastly , he argued that the reversal of the burden of proof clearly constituted a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . { CARDINAL PERSON du DATE , le Tribunal f\u00e9d\u00e9ral rejeta le recours de droit public du requ\u00e9rant.<}CARDINAL{>InIn a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed the public - law appeal.<CARDINAL } It did not call into question the fact that ORG had wrongly merged the CARDINAL sets of proceedings . However , it failed to address the question of the time taken by the court below to reach its decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG shared ORG view that the child 's removal and retention had a priori been capable of breaching the applicant 's right of custody within the meaning of LAW .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG rejected the allegations concerning the right to be heard , indicating in detail the reasons why it considered unfounded the arguments put forward by the applicant to prove that he had not consented to his child 's retention in GPE . By contrast , ORG regarded it as established that the parties had decided , in DATE , that the mother and her child would settle in GPE on a long - term basis . It was proven , according to ORG , that the applicant had agreed that the mother would find employment and buy a car there . Moreover , it could not be argued that ORG had reached its conclusions only by reversing the burden of proof against the applicant . Thus , ORG found that ORG had properly applied LAW , sub - paragraph ( a ) , of LAW . Accordingly , it refused to order the child 's return to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG for the revision of the judgment of DATE . He alleged in particular that he had suffered discrimination as the child 's father .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the request for revision inadmissible , because the allegation about discriminatory treatment did not constitute a valid ground for revision under the applicable law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the supervisory panel of ORG found that there had been no unjustified delay in the revision proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared inadmissible a request for the revision of the DATE judgment of ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to a letter from ORG in GPE , dated DATE , its staff had attempted in vain to make contact with the child 's mother .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request for a right of access .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be granted a right of access .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared inadmissible another request for the revision of the judgment that it had given on DATE . That decision was served on the applicant , according to him , on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

In a recent case that is largely comparable to the present one , ORG upheld the appeal of a mother , a NORP national , who opposed a request for the return of her child made by the child 's father , a NORP national living in GPE . The court took the view that the father had \u201c subsequently acquiesced \u201d , within the meaning of LAW , sub - paragraph ( a ) , of LAW , in the child 's retention , especially because he had taken to GPE items belonging to the mother that were to be used by her in her professional activities in GPE ( see ORG judgment of DATE , CARDINAL ) . Generally speaking , ORG finds it easier to accept the existence of a tacit agreement as to the removal or retention of a child where the party requesting the child 's return has actively contributed to the settlement of the child and the accompanying parent in the destination country ( ibid . , see also the ORG judgment of DATE , ORG ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
