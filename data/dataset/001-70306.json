The applicant lived in this apartment since he his birth .", "In DATE his brother and father , who apparently had been in conflict with the applicant , instituted proceedings to have the applicant \u2019s name deleted from the local register of inhabitants on the ground that he did not live in the apartment . On an unspecified date the housing administration refused their request .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s mother died . The applicant requested that the housing administration conclude a tenancy agreement with him as her mother \u2019s legal successor in respect of the tenancy contract , as provided for by law . This was refused by a letter of DATE on the ground that the applicant did not comply with the requirement for such a succession set out by LAW , since he did not live in the apartment . At the same time the housing administration instituted proceedings to delete the applicant \u2019s registration from the list of inhabitants of the building . On DATE the administration reiterated their refusal to conclude a tenancy agreement with him .", "On DATE the Mayor of PERSON gave a decision striking the applicant \u2019s name from the register of inhabitants of the building concerned , considering that it transpired from the evidence that he had not been living there . On DATE this decision was upheld .", "On DATE the applicant brought a civil action against the municipality under LAW , regulating conditions of succession to the right of lease of apartments , including protected tenancies , claiming a declaration that he was a legal successor of the former tenant of the apartment , his mother .", "On DATE the ORG , by way of a judgment in default , allowed his claim . The housing administration lodged an objection against this judgment .", "On DATE ORG , having reconsidered the case , upheld the judgment and confirmed that the applicant was a successor in respect of the tenancy contract .", "On DATE the applicant requested ORG to take steps to make the judgment operational by concluding a tenancy agreement with him .", "In a letter of DATE the municipality stated the following :", "\u201c In reply to your letter and with reference to the attached judgment of DATE , I should inform you that under that judgment you became your mother \u2019s successor in respect of the tenancy contract , but that it is impossible to conclude such a contract with you .", "This is so because an internal enquiry showed that you had not been living in that apartment on a permanent basis . This has already resulted in the decision of the Mayor striking your name out of the list of inhabitants of the building .", "Consequently , pursuant to LAW . of LAW of DATE on the protection of the rights of tenants , housing resources of municipalities and amendments to LAW , the municipal office hereby gives DATE notice in respect of the contract which you obtained under the judgment referred to above , the contract expiring on DATE . The factual basis for the termination of contract is the fact that you have not been living in this apartment for a period longer then DATE . \u201c", "The applicant appealed against this letter , the legal status of which was uncertain , in that it was not clear whether it was an administrative decision ; he complained that the municipality had refused to comply with the final judgment of the civil court .", "On DATE ORG of the Wroc\u0142aw Region informed the applicant that it was not competent in housing matters , and that the letter complained of was not an administrative decision in any event , against which an appeal to a higher authority would lie .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an action with ORG in which he sought a declaration under LAW that a contractual tenancy relationship existed between him and the municipal office . These proceedings are pending .", "DATE on , housing matters were subject to a high degree of state control under successive provisions of housing legislation . The most important characteristic of this system , a so called \u201c special lease scheme \u201d , was that a tenancy was created by means of an administrative decision and not by a civil law contract between the landlord and the tenant . Under these protected tenancies , the tenants paid controlled rent and the owners could not terminate lease by giving notice to the tenant . The special lease scheme was also applicable to houses owned , until DATE , by ORG , and after the reform of the local administration , by the municipalities .", "Although \u201c the special lease scheme \u201d was abolished under LAW , the system of protected tenancy is still applicable to tenants who were allocated their apartments on the basis of previous administrative decisions .", "Under transitional provisions of the DATE Law , protected tenancies which had originated in administrative decisions given in the past under the special lease scheme were to be regarded as contractual leases concluded for an indefinite period and governed by the provisions of the DATE Law . LAW maintained , albeit with slight modifications of wording , the rules concerning the protection of tenants against termination of leases continued on the basis of previous administrative decisions and the right of succession to a lease .", "Until the entry into force of the DATE Act the right to succession of a protected tenancy was regulated by LAW , which provided that in case of the death of a tenant , his descendants had a right of succession in respect of the tenancy , if they lived in the same apartment at the time of the original tenant \u2019s death .", "The DATE Act repealed this provision and replaced it by LAW , which read :", "\u201c CARDINAL . In case of the death of a tenant and on condition that they lived in the household of a tenant until his death , his descendants , ascendants , adult siblings , adoptive parents or adopted children and a person who has lived with a tenant in de facto marital cohabitation , shall succeed to the tenancy agreement and acquire the tenant \u2019s rights and obligations connected with [ the lease of ] the flat , unless they relinquish that right to the landlord . This provision does not apply to persons who , when the [ original ] tenant died , had title to another residential dwelling .", "CARDINAL . NORP In cases where there is no successor to the tenancy agreement , or where the successors have relinquished their right , the lease shall expire . \u201d", "In DATE parliament adopted a new law governing housing matters and relations between landlords and tenants . LAW of DATE on the protection of the rights of tenants , housing resources of municipalities and amendments to LAW ( LOC o ochronie praw lokator\u00f3w , mieszkaniowym zasobie gminy i o zmianie LOC cywilnego ) ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) entered into force on DATE . It repealed LAW and reinserted LAW into LAW .", "Under LAW ( CARDINAL ) CARDINAL of that Act , the owner of apartment can give DATE notice on the tenancy contract if the tenant has not been living in that apartment for DATE .", "The obligation for NORP citizens residing in GPE to register their permanent address in a municipality \u2019s register of inhabitants is stipulated in LAW ( LOC o ewidencji ludno\u015bci i dowodach osobistych z CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL ) .", "Under LAW , the notion of \u201c living permanently \u201d implies residing at a given address with the intention of making it the principal centre of one \u2019s vital interests . LAW provided that : \u201c a person applying to have their permanent or temporary residence registered shall submit a certificate to the effect that they are entitled to stay in the apartment ( or other dwelling LOC ) concerned . \u201d On DATE the NORP Constitutional Court declared Article CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW unconstitutional and , subsequently , this provision was repealed with effect from DATE .
