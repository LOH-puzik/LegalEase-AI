After he had been charged , the investigator questioned him again on DATE while a remand judge examined him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the questionings of CARDINAL and DATE C was assisted by a lawyer . He confessed in all CARDINAL of the questionings that he himself had attempted to rob B while the applicant had allegedly assaulted A.", "CARDINAL . C stated on the record each time he was questioned that he had not been subjected to any form of physical or psychological pressure by the authorities . The records of the questionings contain no mention of the influence of any drugs or any discussion on that matter . However , neither the applicant nor anybody on his behalf was present .", "CARDINAL . Following C \u2019s allegations the police searched for the applicant on QUANTITY occasions DATE but were unable to find him .", "CARDINAL . In a further questioning on DATE , C changed his account of events and denied any involvement in the incident by him or the applicant . He submitted that during his arrest on DATE police officers had presented him with an account of the incident of CARDINAL DATE that had stated that he and the applicant had been involved and that they had made his release dependant on his acceptance of that version of events . As he had wished to go home , he had simply responded by agreeing to it . The questioning of CARDINAL DATE took place in the presence of ORG lawyer and a lawyer for the applicant , who had been charged in connection with the assault in the meantime .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to these allegations , on DATE another investigator questioned CARDINAL arresting officers and the investigator who had had contact with C on DATE . C \u2019s lawyer was present , although the applicant \u2019s was not , despite having been duly summoned . The arresting officers and the investigator denied putting any physical or psychological pressure on C , leading him in any other way to present any particular version of the events , or witnessing the use of any such pressure or influence .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE , the applicant himself had been charged with robbery in connection with the incident of CARDINAL DATE and with another , unrelated offence . However , the charge sheet was served on him only on DATE when he was arrested during a road traffic control .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a face - to - face confrontation was carried out between C and a certain D , who stated that C had previously confessed to him that he had committed the attempted robbery of CARDINAL DATE together with the applicant . C \u2019s defence counsel was present at the confrontation while neither the applicant nor his counsel were , although the latter had been properly requested to attend .", "CARDINAL .

On CARDINAL DATE ORG found the applicant and C guilty and imposed prison sentences on them . The applicant was sentenced to DATE and CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment .", "The court observed that the applicant had at all times denied any involvement in the robbery , while C had denied his involvement from DATE .", "As for C , in particular , the court noted that he had maintained his allegation of police coercion into making his initial confession . In addition , he had stated that he had been intoxicated while making the confession and that he had confirmed the confession later as he had been concerned about changing his original statement . However , having heard the officers involved in ORG arrest , the court found that the allegation of coercion had not been confirmed . It did not find ORG changed version credible as his participation in the robbery had been proven by his statements of CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE and by B and NORP", "As regards the applicant , ORG noted that neither A nor B had identified him . However , he had been incriminated by the early statements of C and by D , as mentioned above .", "CARDINAL . The applicant challenged the judgment of CARDINAL DATE by way of an appeal to ORG . He argued that his conviction had been based on ORG initial statements , that those statements had been unlawful as evidence and that his conviction had accordingly been arbitrary . However , ORG had completely ignored his arguments on that point .", "In particular , the applicant referred to a position taken by the criminal law bench of ORG ( no . PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL of DATE ) that if witness evidence was the only or decisive incriminating evidence , the witness had to be heard or , as the case may be , re - heard after the accused had been charged in order to safeguard the accused \u2019s rights of defence and to adversarial proceedings . He argued that , although formally speaking C was his co - accused and not a witness , mutatis mutandis , the precedent fully applied to his case . Accordingly , ORG initial statements had not been admissible as evidence and the only admissible submissions he had made about the applicant had been those of DATE and afterwards .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution also appealed , alleging that the first - instance court had erred in the determination of the applicant \u2019s sentence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided on the appeals by increasing the applicant \u2019s sentence to DATE . It held that C \u2019s early statements were not excluded as evidence because CARDINAL of them had been made in the presence of his lawyer and that CARDINAL of those CARDINAL had actually been made before a judge , which meant any coercion was excluded . ORG also found that the statements had not been the only evidence against the applicant , that he had also been incriminated by D and by the fact that the general description of the incident by A and B had corresponded to that in C \u2019s early testimony .", "CARDINAL . In a subsequent appeal on points of law and constitutional complaint the applicant raised similar arguments to those above . He added specifically that he was not relying on any coercion of C when the latter made his initial statements since any such coercion or lack of it was of relevance for the admissibility of those statements as evidence in relation to C , but was irrelevant in relation to the fact that he himself had been unable to exercise his rights of defence during those statements .", "CARDINAL . The appeal and constitutional complaint were dismissed on CARDINAL June and CARDINAL DATE . In their respective decisions , ORG and ORG referred to the reasoning behind the lower courts\u2019 decisions , considered that the applicant had merely disagreed with their assessment of the evidence , and found no unlawfulness or arbitrariness in the decisions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to have his trial reopened , relying on a ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE which had declared unconstitutional some statutory provisions that had played a role in his sentencing .", "CARDINAL . A reopening of the trial was allowed and on DATE ORG reduced the applicant \u2019s prison term to DATE . The ruling became final and the applicant finished serving his sentence on DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
