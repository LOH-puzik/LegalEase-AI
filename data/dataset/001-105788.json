The first applicant , who was born in DATE and is a citizen of GPE , left GPE on an unspecified date and entered GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the first applicant unsuccessfully sought asylum in GPE . The terms of his application , the reasons for the refusal and the relevant dates have not been substantiated by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . Since DATE the first applicant has attended ORG of God , a ORG in GPE . In DATE he was baptised .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant has CARDINAL children born in GPE in DATE and DATE ( the third and fourth applicants ) . Their mother ( the second applicant ) , born in DATE , whom the first applicant married in DATE , is an NORP national who has had a permanent residence permit in GPE since an unspecified date . According to the first and second applicants , their first child , born in DATE , has no citizenship and their second child , born in DATE , is a national of GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the first applicant submitted a second application for asylum . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE he was granted refugee status in GPE on the ground that he risked persecution in GPE on account of his conversion from ORG to NORP . The short decision stated in its relevant part that according to information from the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees , conversion to NORP was \u201c punishable by death in all GPE \u201d . No further details were stated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG , at that time a department of ORG , issued an order withdrawing PERSON residence permit , ordering his expulsion and imposing a DATE ban on his re - entering GPE on the ground that he was a \u201c serious threat to national security \u201d . Factual grounds were not indicated . The Director relied on an internal document of DATE which stated that the first applicant was involved in trafficking of migrants , mainly citizens of GPE , through GPE and GPE to GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE . The Director considered that this activity was as such a threat to national security . Also , it could be used for the transit of terrorists and thus discredit GPE internationally .", "CARDINAL . NORP The deportation order of DATE did not specify the country to which the first applicant should be deported . It appears that there was no legal requirement to do so and that in practice deportation orders did not indicate the country of destination .", "CARDINAL . The order of DATE also stated that the first applicant should be detained pending expulsion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE another government agency , ORG of the national police , issued an order for the first applicant \u2019s detention pending expulsion . The relationship between that order and the order of DATE , which also required PERSON detention , has not been clarified .", "CARDINAL . According to the order of CARDINAL DATE , PERSON detention was necessary since he posed a serious threat to national security , and also in view of the fact that there was no ( direct ) transport connection between GPE and the first applicant \u2019s country of origin , which prevented the immediate execution of the measure against him .", "CARDINAL . The orders of DATE and DATE were both immediately enforceable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was arrested and detained at FAC . He remained there until his release on DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant has not been deported .", "CARDINAL . According to a statement by ORG , prepared for the present proceedings and submitted in DATE , Mr M. \u2019s deportation was impeded by the fact that he did not have a document valid for international travel , the \u201c lack of transport connections \u201d and his refusal to cooperate . The Director further explained , without providing details , that several possible destinations for his expulsion had been considered and that unsuccessful attempts had been made to remove the obstacles to the execution of the deportation order .", "CARDINAL . At least until DATE , the first applicant did in fact have a document valid for international travel . He possessed a special refugee passport , issued by the NORP authorities on DATE , which was valid for international travel until DATE . The existence of this document , including its number and date of issue , was mentioned in the deportation and detention order of DATE . It is unclear whether the first applicant presented his refugee passport to the authorities or concealed it , as suggested by the Government .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the Migration Directorate of the police wrote to ORG in GPE requesting that an identity document be issued to PERSON It reiterated the request in DATE and DATE . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the ORG of GPE informed ORG that it was unable to issue the first applicant with a passport since he had expressly stated at a meeting with ORG representatives that he did not want to have a passport issued and did not want to return to GPE . In those circumstances , the ORG would not participate in the first applicant \u2019s forced expulsion .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to the first applicant \u2019s representative , in reply to his request for release , the Director of ORG stated that PERSON detention continued to be necessary despite the ORG \u2019s interim measures decision ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . That was so because :", "\u201c [ I]n accordance with the document from the [ ORG ] , the [ first applicant ] should not be deported to GPE . In execution of the expulsion order , he may be deported either to his country of origin or to a third country , where there is no danger for his life and health . The fact that the [ deportation ] order has not been enforced is the result of the obstinate conduct of [ Mr M. ] manifested by his frustrating and hampering his deportation from GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed to ORG against the order of DATE of ORG and requested a stay of enforcement pending the determination of his appeal . In these proceedings he was legally represented .", "CARDINAL . He argued , inter alia , that mere suppositions , not facts , had served as the basis for the impugned measures , there being no evidence of unlawful activities and no criminal proceedings having been brought against him . He also submitted that the expulsion order was in breach of the prohibition to deport a person to a country where his life was under threat . The first applicant further argued that his expulsion interfered with his right to respect for his family life . He also challenged the order for his detention .", "CARDINAL . The defendant , ORG , submitted a copy of the internal document of CARDINAL DATE which had served as the basis for the expulsion order ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It also filed submissions , maintaining , inter alia , that the impugned order did not contravene section CARDINALa of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date Mr PERSON \u2019s representative wrote to ORG insisting that the deportation order should be revoked in view of PERSON refugee status in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG replied that the order was lawful . He stated , inter alia :", "\u201c In accordance with section ORG ) of LAW , execution of the [ deportation order ] should not be suspended where there are grounds to believe that the alien seeking or having obtained protection imperils national security .", "In accordance with LAW relating to LAW , \u2018 no Contracting State shall expel or return ( refouler ) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political GPE .", "The benefit of this provision can not , however , be claimed by a refugee about whom there are grounds to believe that he imperils the national security of the country where he is ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE , as a result of legislative amendments , the examination of the first applicant \u2019s appeal against the order of DATE fell within the competence of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a CARDINAL - member panel of ORG refused the first applicant \u2019s request for a stay of enforcement . The court devoted no attention to his allegations about the risk of ill - treatment in GPE and his request to stay the execution of the deportation order but stated merely that the alleged interference with family life did not warrant a stay of enforcement of the order for his detention . That decision was amenable to appeal before a CARDINAL - member panel of ORG . It is unclear whether the first applicant appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the first applicant \u2019s appeal against his expulsion and detention .", "CARDINAL . The court noted that an internal ORG document dated DATE and submitted by the defendant stated that PERSON had acted in a way that presented a threat to national security . The court did not accept the first applicant \u2019s arguments that it should engage in detailed examination of the evidence allegedly supporting the view of the Ministry that he posed a threat to GPE \u2019s national security . It stated :", "\u201c [ The document of DATE ] must be regarded as an official certification which contains data collected by ORG in the exercise of its functions . It has been issued in accordance with section CARDINAL of ORG . It contains evidence and data which have been assessed by the relevant administrative authority as sufficient grounds for ordering [ Mr M. \u2019s deportation ] for having engaged in unlawful activities threatening national security ... It follows that the impugned order is lawful . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court rejected the first applicant \u2019s argument that the deportation order should be revoked since he lived in GPE by virtue of his refugee status . The court stated that the domestic provisions regulating deportation did not provide for discretion and their interpretation could not vary on the basis of such factors as residence status .", "CARDINAL . The court further noted that Mr PERSON had been granted refugee status on the basis of his allegation that he had converted from NORP to NORP and was afraid of persecution in GPE . The court observed that there existed evidence of a danger to the first applicant \u2019s health and life in relation to his conversion . It found , however , that this danger did not stem from ORG and that the applicant had not provided evidence that the authorities would be unable to protect him . Therefore , section CARDINALa of LAW , which reflected the guarantees of ORG , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention , did not apply .", "CARDINAL . As regards the order for the first applicant \u2019s detention , ORG found that it was not amenable to judicial review as it concerned a measure undertaken in the execution of the expulsion order and not a separate administrative decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant appealed to ORG against the detention order of DATE issued by ORG .", "CARDINAL . In these proceedings , on DATE the ORG refused the first applicant \u2019s request for a stay of enforcement of the detention order . It found , inter alia , that there was no evidence that its immediate enforcement would cause irreparable harm . The refusal was upheld by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings on the merits , the first applicant argued that his lengthy detention was unlawful and in breach of LAW and that it disproportionately affected his family life .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment of DATE the ORG found that the order of DATE for the first applicant \u2019s detention had been signed by an unauthorised official and declared it null and void . The court held , however , that it did not have the power to order the first applicant \u2019s release . No appeal was lodged against that judgment . It became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE LAW was amended with the aim of incorporating into NORP law Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of ORG and of ORG on common standards and procedures in Member GPE for returning illegally staying third - country nationals .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under the new section CARDINALa of LAW , the director of the detention centre for aliens is required to submit to the relevant court a list of persons who have been detained for DATE and the court must decide of its own motion on their continued detention or release .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with this new procedure , the situation of a number of aliens , including the first applicant , was reviewed by ORG in a decision of DATE . The decision was presented to the first applicant to read but he was not given a copy of it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Director of ORG of the national police , referring to the decision of ORG of DATE , issued an order which revoked the order of CARDINAL DATE for the first applicant \u2019s detention and imposed on him the obligation to report DATE to the local police station . The judgment of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) was not mentioned .", "CARDINAL . The order of DATE was served on the applicant on DATE and he was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE the third and fourth applicants were granted refugee status in GPE . The grounds for that decision have not been communicated to the Court .", "CARDINAL . The relevant domestic law and practice are set out in detail in the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . The following additional provisions of domestic law are relevant .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , deportation orders issued on national security grounds do not indicate the factual grounds for imposing the measure .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINALa of LAW , deportation orders may not be executed by way of deportation to a country where there exists a risk to the person \u2019s life or a risk of ill - treatment .", "CARDINAL . A similar prohibition is spelled out in section CARDINAL ) of LAW , in respect of persons who have obtained protection under LAW or have entered GPE to seek such protection . Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) provides , however , that the right not to be returned to a country where the person concerned risks ill - treatment or death can not be invoked by aliens , including refugees , about whom there are grounds to believe that they imperil national security . There is no reported case - law under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW , where the person to be deported has been granted refugee status , the deportation decision is to be annulled . In accordance with section ORG ) of the LAW , however , the above does not apply where there are grounds to believe that the person concerned imperils national security or that , having been convicted of a serious criminal offence , he or she may pose a threat to public order . There is no reported case - law under section ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . It follows from sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW that deportation orders issued on national security grounds are immediately enforceable and that the lodging of a judicial appeal does not suspend their enforcement . Enforcement may be postponed only by a decision of the relevant administrative body in the event of legal or technical obstacles hindering immediate execution ( section CARDINALb(CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . In accordance with LAW , in pending appeal proceedings the interested party may request a stay of execution of an administrative decision on grounds of , inter alia , risk of significant or irreparable harm . In some of its decisions ORG has held that this does not apply with regard to deportation orders issued on national security grounds . That was so because immediate enforcement was provided for ex lege , in LAW , and the courts did not have the power to impose a stay of enforcement ( see \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u2116 GPE CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL\u0433. \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0410\u0421 \u043f\u043e ORG , where a request for a stay of deportation on the ground that the person concerned was seriously ill was refused ) .", "CARDINAL . In an interpretative decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG revised its approach and stated that LAW applied even where the immediate enforceability of administrative decisions was provided for ex lege , with the exception of instances where the law did not provide for any judicial review . There is no reported case - law confirming that the interpretative decision also concerned the stay of enforcement of deportation orders on national security grounds .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the Regulations for the implementation of LAW , in cases where deportation orders are enforced through removal by air , the person concerned shall be escorted by officers of the GPE control services to his country of citizenship or another country of his choice to which he may be admitted ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "5", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
