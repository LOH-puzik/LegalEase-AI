On DATE a deputy Prosecutor General of GPE lodged a request with a deputy Prosecutor General of GPE , seeking the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE for prosecution on charges of embezzlement .

On an unspecified date ORG of the Russian Federation made enquiries of ORG on the issue of extradition to GPE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG replied as follows :", "\u201c ... ORG has no information which prevents the extradition of the national of GPE M.M. GPE to the law - enforcement authorities of GPE .", "At the same time , when taking the ultimate decision on extradition of nationals of GPE , it is necessary to take into account the difficult internal political situation which has emerged in GPE at the present time , as well as the aggravation of inter - ethnic tension , which predetermines a possibility of biased examination of cases against citizens of this country not belonging to the titular ethnic group .", "In particular , ORG has information concerning serious breaches in a number of court proceedings against NORP nationals of NORP origin ; cases of intimidation of witnesses and assaults on lawyers are not infrequent . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the deputy Prosecutor General of GPE approved the request of ORG of GPE for the applicant \u2019s extradition . The decision noted that the acts of which the applicant was accused were punishable under LAW of GPE with a penalty exceeding DATE imprisonment , that the prosecution was not time - barred , that the applicant was a national of GPE , that he had not acquired NORP nationality , and that his extradition was not in breach of international agreements or domestic law .", "CARDINAL . The deputy Prosecutor General of GPE requested the Special Representative of the President of GPE on international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and transnational organised crime to provide assistance , via ORG , in ensuring the observance of the applicant \u2019s rights after his transfer to GPE ( letter CARDINAL/CARDINAL - CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG ( ORG ) for refugee status . He stated that if returned to GPE he , as an ethnic NORP , would be in real danger of his life because of the inter - ethnic conflict in the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE his application was rejected by the ORG for GPE and GPE region . The ORG noted , in particular , that according to its records , after his entry to GPE on DATE the applicant had gone abroad only once from CARDINAL May to DATE , to GPE . There were cancelled stamps in his passport certifying his exits from and entries to GPE , and also stamps which were not authentic , according to an expert opinion of CARDINAL DATE . CARDINAL pages of his passport were missing . According to the ORG , the applicant \u2019s lengthy fouryear stay in GPE without returning to GPE , where his family had been living , had apparently shown that he had been avoiding entering his country because he was wanted by the law - enforcement bodies , and the fact that he had applied for asylum DATE after the DATE events meant that he had not felt himself to be in any danger . The ORG found that the applicant had come to and stayed in GPE not because he wished to receive asylum but in order to find employment and improve his financial situation . He was not therefore eligible for refugee status .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reviewed the situation in GPE after the DATE events , including the constitutional referendum and the parliamentary elections . It noted reports by ORG and ORG , as well as the ORG \u2019s development programmes carried out in cooperation with the NORP authorities which were aimed , first of all , at building peace and democratic governance , fighting poverty and working with local communities , and were financed by grants which had doubled during DATE and totalled MONEY in DATE . It further noted that DATE had been declared the Year of Inter - Ethnic Concord and Friendship , with various programmes organised by local authorities , and national and international trade fairs . The ORG considered that the situation in GPE had significantly changed , there had been no interethnic incidents and the Government had been undertaking enhanced measures to ensure the security of its citizens and to improve the social , economic and political situation in the country .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of the ORG of GPE and GPE region to the FMS of GPE , which upheld the decision on DATE , noting that the applicant \u2019s fears of persecution on the ground of his ethnic origin had not been justified .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant lodged a court appeal against ORG extradition order . He submitted that , in view of the unstable political situation in GPE and ethnic unrest between the NORP majority and the NORP minority , the decision in question entailed for him a serious risk that he would be subjected to torture . He referred to statements by ORG of DATE , ORG into the events in southern GPE , ORG and other sources .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE examined the applicant \u2019s appeal at an open hearing in the presence of the applicant , his lawyer and the prosecutor . The applicant argued , in particular , that NORP were oppressed and discriminated against in GPE and that he might therefore be subjected to torture or other ill - treatment . ORG noted that the decision for the applicant \u2019s extradition complied with the requirements of LAW and LAW . The decision had been taken by the appropriate authority . The applicant was a national of GPE and had not obtained NORP nationality . There were no criminal proceedings against him in GPE in connection with the acts imputed to him . There was no court decision about the existence or otherwise of impediments to his extradition . Therefore ORG did not find any grounds for refusal of his extradition . It examined the assurances of ORG of GPE and stated that it had no reasons to doubt that they would be observed . It took into account that , according to the information the ORG for GPE and the GPE region had when it made its decision in the applicant \u2019s case , which was upheld by the FMS of GPE , the social , economic and political situation in GPE had normalised since the interethnic clashes in DATE . It also took into account that the applicant was accused of an ordinary crime which had no political or ethnic character , and that it had been committed in DATE , long before the inter - ethnic clashes . The applicant had not claimed that he was being persecuted for political reasons , stating that he had moved to GPE to find employment . Therefore , the fears that he might be subjected to ill - treatment or discrimination on the ground of his ethnic origin or other grounds had not been objectively justified .", "CARDINAL . ORG further stated that a court appeal against the ORG \u2019s decisions in the applicant \u2019s case to refuse him refugee status could not suspend or block the applicant \u2019s extradition . It noted that while the applicant had arrived in GPE DATE previously for material gain he had applied for refugee status only after his detention , thereby pursuing the aim of delaying his extradition . It further noted that the applicant \u2019s guilt was beyond its scope of examination . It held that the extradition decision was lawful and dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE examined the applicant \u2019s appeal against ORG judgment in which he argued , in particular , that if extradited he would run a real risk of torture because he belonged to the NORP minority , as confirmed by , inter alia , ORG into the events in southern GPE , and that GPE official assurances would not prevent that risk . Having heard the applicant \u2019s counsel and the prosecutor , ORG endorsed the lower court \u2019s findings , noting also that the applicant had left GPE for GPE in order to find employment and not because of persecutions on the ground of his ethnic origin , and that the decision to extradite him had been taken in accordance with LAW between GPE and ORG of DATE , and that the request for extradition had complied with ORG and CARDINAL of LAW on extradition of DATE and LAW . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the lower court \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the St Petersburg ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal against the ORG \u2019s decisions . It stated in its judgment that the applicant had submitted at the hearing that he did not fear for the life and health of his children and parents who had stayed in PERSON , that he had not been persecuted on account of his ethnic origin , political or religious grounds , though there had always been tensions between NORP and NORP in everyday life , and he had known about the harassment of NORP in GPE from his friends and brother who had been beaten up during the events in DATE . ORG found that it did not follow from the materials before it that the applicant had left his country and did not wish to return there because of some real events menacing him personally . The absence of a real threat was confirmed , in particular , by the fact that his family , which included minor children , living in PERSON had never been discriminated against . He had failed to submit any evidence that he or his family had been persecuted on the ground of their ethnic origin , or any evidence for such fears . He had referred in general to the situation in the country , without giving any details .", "CARDINAL . An appeal against ORG judgment lodged by the applicant \u2019s counsel did not comply with the relevant procedural requirements and on DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for an extension of the time - limit for lodging a proper appeal . Proceedings in which the applicant challenged that finding are pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE President PERSON was overthrown after popular demonstrations and a Provisional Government headed by PERSON assumed power .", "CARDINAL . On DATE which followed inter - ethnic clashes erupted in the south of the country in PERSON and PERSON , in which ethnic NORP and ethnic NORP committed violence against each other .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE GPE held parliamentary elections . The OSCE / ODIHR provided a cautiously optimistic assessment of the elections , despite some shortcomings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE GPE held presidential elections . According to the OSCE / ODIHR Election Observation Mission Final Report , \u201c the election was conducted in a peaceful manner , but shortcomings underscored that the integrity of the electoral process should be improved to consolidate democratic practice in line with international commitments . Candidate registration was inclusive , giving voters a wide choice , and the electoral campaign was open and respected fundamental freedoms . These elements , however , were overshadowed by significant irregularities on DATE , especially during the counting and tabulation of votes . \u201d The inauguration of the newly - elected President PERSON PERSON took place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG into the events in southern GPE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) was established with a support by the NORP authorities . After broad consultation with numerous international bodies , including the ORG , the LOC , the ORG , the ORG and the office of the ORG High Commissioner for Human Rights , the terms of reference were established and endorsed .

The ORG acknowledged the excellent cooperation of the authorities of GPE . It published its report in DATE . The executive summary of the report states , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... The events must be viewed in the context of the historical and political background of the region , particularly the relationship between the communities of ethnic NORP and ethnic NORP . In this regard the ORG notes the underrepresentation of ethnic NORP in public life and the rising force of ethnonationalism in the politics of GPE . The ORG notes further the power vacuum and consequent political rivalries , fragile state institutions and the weak rule of law in southern GPE in the wake of DATE overthrow of the PERSON government .", "CARDINAL . NORP The events resulted in significant loss of life and injury , of which the majority of victims were ethnic NORP . In total CARDINAL people died . It is expected that this figure will grow but not substantially . CARDINAL people received medical assistance at hospitals . Many CARDINAL of people were displaced . CARDINAL people were displaced to GPE and a further CARDINAL were internally displaced . There was also significant property damage , again to a disproportionately high number of ethnic NORP owned properties . In total CARDINAL properties were damaged . The ORG notes that ethnic NORP also suffered very significant losses , in terms of life , health and property . The ORG has found that both communities suffered loss .", "CARDINAL . In addition to the documented international and domestic criminal acts , the ORG has found that there have been and still are serious violations of international human rights law committed by the ORG in the aftermath of the events . There is a consistent and reliable body of material which tends to show that acts of torture were committed in detention centres by the authorities of GPE in the aftermath of the DATE events . Of particular concern to the ORG is that such acts of torture are ongoing and that the response of the authorities to allegations of torture has been grossly inadequate .", "CARDINAL . Criminal investigations and trials which have resulted from the DATE events have been marked by breaches of the ORG fair trial rights . Large scale sweep operations conducted in NORP mahallas on DATE and the smaller scale search operations which then followed have involved ill - treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention . There has been selective prosecution targeting the ethnic NORP minority . Defence lawyers representing ethnic NORP defendants have been subject to improper interference and intimidation .", "CARDINAL . ... The Provisional Government , which had assumed power DATE before the events , either failed to recognize or underestimated the deterioration in interethnic relations in southern GPE . ...", "CARDINAL .

There are serious concerns that while investigating crimes police officers have continued to target NORP and NORP neighbourhoods , threatening to charge them with serious crimes , such as murder , in relation to the DATE violence in order to extort money from them . Those who have returned from DATE work in GPE or GPE or families who have relatives working outside the country are particularly vulnerable to arbitrary detention , intimidation and extortion since they are assumed to have ready access to money and foreign currency . ...", "Impunity for law enforcement officers who have perpetrated torture and other illtreatment has long been a serious problem in GPE , especially at the local and regional levels . Since the DATE violence this has become ever more apparent but despite a number of positive initiatives and concrete measures in DATE by the former President and the current Prosecutor General on the prohibition of torture , regrettably only a handful of prosecutions for torture or other ill - treatment in police custody appear to have taken place . ... Given the admissions by ORG and the current and former Presidents that torture and other ill - treatment is widespread the extremely low number of prosecutions of security officers for torture and the absence of any convictions for torture casts doubt on the commitment of the authorities to seriously and effectively redress these crimes and human rights violations . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

In an interview about the use of torture in GPE in DATE , a human rights defender who has researched police torture in GPE for DATE noted :", "The DATE events [ exacerbated ] the situation regarding torture and completely untied the hands of the police officers and the security service .

Most judges in such cases dismiss , ignore , or fail to order investigations into torture allegations . In CARDINAL cases police also arbitrarily detained and tortured ethnic NORP men and threatened to charge them in relation to the DATE violence if they did not pay large sums .", "ORG research found CARDINAL ethnic NORP died in DATE due to injuries sustained when detained in police extortion schemes .

While a superficial quiet has settled on the city , neither the NORP nor NORP community feels it can hold . NORP are subject to illegal detentions and abuse by security forces and have been forced out of public life ...", "The nationalist discourse that emerged after the PERSON violence unnerved the interim government that had replaced President PERSON in DATE . Until the end of its term in DATE , it was largely ignored , and sometimes openly defied , by NORP Mayor PERSON , the standard - bearer of an ethnic NORP - first policy and the most successful radical nationalist leader to emerge after the killings . This did not change when President PERSON , a northerner , took office in DATE . Senior members of his administration express dismay at tensions in the south but say they have no way of influencing the situation there .", "NORP are increasingly withdrawing into themselves . They say they are marginalised by the NORP majority , forced out of public life and the professions ; most LANGUAGE - language media have been closed ; and prominent nationalists often refer to them as a diaspora , emphasising their separate and subordinate status . International organisations report continuing persecution of NORP by a rapaciously corrupt police and prosecutorial system , almost certainly with the southern authorities\u2019 tacit approval .", "The flight of many NORP business people and the seizure of GPE businesses have sharply diminished the minority \u2019s once important role in the economy .

Many feel that NORP brought disaster on themselves with an ill - advised power grab in DATE . This version of history has not been proven ; it is privately doubted even by some senior NORP politicians , but hardly ever challenged by them .

GPE is a party to the main ORG human rights treaties prohibiting torture and ill - treatment , including LAW , LAW and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women .

The Special Rapporteur received numerous accounts and eyewitness testimonies suggesting that torture and ill - treatment had been historically pervasive in the law enforcement sector .

During the violence in DATE and its aftermath , reports consistently highlighted the frequency and gravity of arbitrary detention , torture and ill - treatment by law enforcement bodies .", "CARDINAL . Throughout the mission , testimonies of victims and their lawyers pointed to general patterns of torture and ill - treatment committed by police officers after arrest and during TIME of informal interrogation . During interviews with victims , the Special Rapporteur heard multiple allegations of torture that shared the same pattern : asphyxiation with plastic bags and gas masks with no flow of oxygen ; punches and beatings with truncheons ; the application of electric shock and the introduction of foreign objects into the anus , or the threat of rape . ... The Special Rapporteur was told that the use of torture by the criminal investigation police was exacerbated by the heavy reliance on confessions in the judicial system .", "CARDINAL . The Special Rapporteur has concluded that , in the immediate aftermath of the violence of DATE , there was a significant increase of continued arbitrary arrests and detentions , incidents of forced confession under the use of torture and illtreatment during arrest and while in detention , denial of access to a lawyer of one \u2019s choosing , denial of independent medical aid , threats and extortion of money in exchange for dropping or mitigating charges . These incidents , usually committed by the operative - investigating officers of ORG during TIME of apprehension and interrogation , continued to be widespread throughout DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Special Rapporteur received reports according to which , in practice , confessions obtained under torture are not expressly excluded as evidence in court . Moreover , the majority of verdicts in criminal cases are mostly based on voluntary confessional statements made during the investigation or at the time of surrender . In addition , the courts encourage this practice by giving undue weight to confessions when evaluating evidence . If a defendant claims during trial that the confession was obtained through torture , the courts either ignore such statements altogether or conduct a superficial inquiry by simply questioning the police officers in court . After the officers deny the use of torture , the judge concludes that the defendant \u2019s allegations are not substantiated and should be treated as an effort to avoid justice .", "CARDINAL .
