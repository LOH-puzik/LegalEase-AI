The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he began working as a biology teacher at a private tutoring centre ( dershane ) in ORG . DATE he worked there on a contractual basis . The renewal of his contracts was subject to the approval of the Director of ORG attached to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to renew the applicant \u2019s contract , on the strength of a security investigation conducted into him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was informed by the head of the tutoring centre that his contract was being terminated .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a claim with ORG , challenging the termination of his contract . In his application , he stated , inter alia , that he had not been informed of the reasons for his dismissal and that the administrative authorities had failed to respect the established case - law of ORG , according to which security investigations could not be used as the sole basis of an administrative decision , as their content was confidential . The applicant submitted that he had been working at the private tutoring centre since its establishment in DATE and that his right to work was breached on account of this unlawful administrative decision . The applicant claimed that he was deprived of his livelihood as he did not have any other work and that the administrative authorities\u2019 decisions had irreversible consequences for his life .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG annulled ORG \u2019s decision . In its judgment , the court noted that ORG had decided to terminate the applicant \u2019s contract on the basis of a security investigation conducted by the office of LOC of the state - of - emergency ( PERSON ) . The court further noted that the administrative authorities had been requested to provide information on the reasons for the termination of his contract . In a document sent to the court by ORG , it was stated that the applicant had been involved in a number of ideological activities before DATE ; that the PERSON police had instituted proceedings against him for having committed an offence against the \u201c national legal personality of the State \u201d ; that he had been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment ; and that he had been the representative of the ORG branch of PERSON ( a trade union ) in DATE . The court considered that the applicant had worked in ORG schools for DATE and had been known to the administrative authorities when he began working at the private tutoring centre . It therefore concluded that the decision to terminate his contract , which had been taken on the basis of intelligence information known to the authorities from the outset , had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG appealed against the judgment of DATE . In the appeal , it was noted that the applicant had been involved in illegal activities and therefore did not possess the right qualities to be a teacher . It was also stated that the administrative authorities , taking into consideration the particularities of the country and the region concerned , as well as the nature and the sensitivity of the post , had found that there was no public interest in keeping him employed in his post .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the first - instance court \u2019s judgment . It noted that the Regional Governor of the state - of - emergency had conducted a security investigation into the applicant . That investigation had revealed that he had been involved in several ideological activities before DATE ; that a criminal investigation had been initiated against him for having committed an offence against the \u201c national legal personality of the State \u201d ; and that he had been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . These were the reasons for which he had been dismissed from his post . ORG held that the decision dismissing the applicant following the security investigation had been lawful , since he had been sentenced to imprisonment for having committed a crime against the ORG and there was information to suggest that he had been involved in ideological activities for illegal organisations . ORG also had regard to the particularities of the region where he had worked .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant \u2019s representative applied to ORG , requesting rectification of its decision of DATE . In his request , he maintained that the applicant had been charged with being a member of an organisation whose aim was to establish the domination of a particular social class and for disseminating propaganda , under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) respectively , and had been sentenced to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment for his activities before DATE . He further contended that the ORG in question had been repealed in DATE , and that on CARDINAL DATE of DATE the trial court had decided to overturn the applicant \u2019s criminal conviction and erase his criminal record . He argued that dismissing the applicant on the basis of his erased criminal record and the findings of a security investigation which were not publicly accessible had been unlawful and in breach of his right to a fair trial under the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed his request holding that his submissions could not be the basis of a rectification of decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s case , taking into account ORG decision and referring to the reasoning in the latter \u2019s judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . In his appeal , his representative repeated the submissions put forward in his request for rectification of ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the judgment of DATE , holding that the latter was in accordance with the law ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1", "8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
