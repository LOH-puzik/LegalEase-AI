SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , was a NORP national who was born in DATE and lived in GPE . In DATE the applicant died . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE the late applicant \u2019s wife PERSON and his children Mr PERSON and PERSON informed the Court that they wished to pursue the application in his stead . The applicant is represented before the Court by PERSON E. \u013dal\u00edkov\u00e1 , a lawyer practising in GPE . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , their Agent .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant \u2019s family owned real estate located in GPE which comprised a house and the land around it .", "In DATE CARDINAL contracts were made relating to the transfer of the property to the ORG . The first of these contracts was concluded on DATE and the second at some unspecified point in DATE . The existence and validity of these contracts were later in dispute ( see below ) .", "The ORG subsequently took over the property and , since then , it has been used by a college of agriculture in GPE . The title to the property was formally vested in a special legal entity ( \u0161kolsk\u00fd majetok or , later , \u0161kolsk\u00e9 hospod\u00e1rstvo ) which was attached to the college .", "On DATE the applicant and CARDINAL of his relatives , who were all jointly represented by a lawyer , brought a civil action against the above entity which possessed the property and against ORG ( \u0161kolsk\u00e1 spr\u00e1va ) in LOC s\u00fad ) . They originally sought an order for possession of the house , but later extended the action by also seeking a ruling declaring that the defendants were not bona fides possessors of the property .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the action but , on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal , ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) quashed the judgment on DATE .", "On DATE ORG found in favour of the plaintiffs but , on the GPE appeal , ORG overturned the judgment and dismissed the action on DATE .", "The plaintiffs appealed on points of law to ORG .", "On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of DATE and remitted the case to ORG for reexamination of the GPE appeal against the judgment of DATE .", "On DATE ORG examined the GPE appeal against the judgment of DATE afresh . It again reversed the latter judgment and dismissed the action . ORG examined complex documentary and other evidence , including the pleadings of the parties . It found that the contract of DATE had been validly concluded and approved by the competent authorities . It had lawfully conveyed the house in question to the ORG . As a consequence , under the laws which applied at the time , the title of the applicant \u2019s family to the land underneath the house had been automatically extinguished . The applicant and the other plaintiffs had therefore no legal title to the property and , consequently , no right of action in the case .", "The plaintiffs again appealed on points of law . They contested ORG factual conclusion as to the existence of the contract of DATE . They maintained that the judgment was not properly reasoned , that the facts had not been established adequately and that the court \u2019s legal assessment of the case was flawed .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . Following the applicant \u2019s death , it dealt in his stead with his surviving wife and children , being his heirs . ORG found that the facts of the case had been established adequately , the reasons given by ORG were comprehensive and convincing and its conclusion was correct .", "On DATE ORG issued an order for costs against the plaintiffs .", "The wife and children of the applicant , who were represented by a lawyer , challenged ORG judgment by a complaint to ORG under LAW . They complained that the judgment was onesided , unfair and wrong , contrary to LAW .", "On DATE ORG declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill - founded . It found that ORG had adequately examined the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments , its findings were not manifestly arbitrary or wrong and its conclusions had been adequately reasoned ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
