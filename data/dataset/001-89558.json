The applicants , Mr PERSON and PERSON , were born in DATE and DATE and live in LOC and GPE respectively . The first applicant was a member of the trade union PERSON and the second applicant was its President .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trade union PERSON was founded in DATE by civil servants from various municipalities whose employment was governed by LAW ( Law no . CARDINAL ) . Under LAW of its constitution , the trade union \u2019s objective is to promote democratic trade unionism and thereby assist its members in their aspirations and claims . Its head office is located in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE T\u00fcm Bel Sen entered into a collective agreement with ORG for DATE , effective from DATE . The agreement concerned all aspects of the working conditions of ORG employees , such as salaries , allowances and welfare services .", "CARDINAL . As ORG had failed to fulfil certain of its obligations under the agreement , in particular its financial obligations , the second applicant , as President of the trade union , brought civil proceedings against it in ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG found in favour of PERSON ORG appealed on points of law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ) quashed ORG judgment . It found that , even though there was no legal bar preventing civil servants from forming a trade union , any union so formed had no authority to enter into collective agreements as the law stood .", "CARDINAL . In arriving at this conclusion , ORG took into account the special relationship between civil servants and the public administration as regards recruitment , the nature and scope of the work concerned , and the privileges and guarantees afforded to officials by virtue of their status . It considered that this relationship was different from that which existed between employers and ordinary contractual staff ( that is to say , employees in the private sector together with manual workers employed by a public administration ) . As a result , PERSON no . CARDINAL , governing collective agreements and the right to take strike or lock - out action , could not apply to relations between civil servants and a public administration . Any agreement of a \u201c collective \u201d nature between civil ORG unions and a public administration had to be grounded in specific legislation .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG stood by its original judgment on the ground that , despite the lack of express statutory provisions recognising a right for trade unions formed by civil servants to enter into collective agreements , this lacuna had to be filled by reference to international treaties such as the conventions of ORG ( ORG ) which had already been ratified by GPE and which , by virtue of LAW , were directly applicable in domestic law .", "CARDINAL . Among other things , ORG indicated , firstly , that the trade union PERSON was a legally established entity which had filed its constitution with the provincial governor \u2019s office a long time ago and which , since then , had carried on its activities without the slightest intervention by the competent authorities . The court added that , on this matter , there was no discrepancy between its judgment and that of ORG of ORG .", "CARDINAL . As regards the right of civil servants to enter into collective agreements , the court considered that , even if there was an omission in NORP law on this point , the court to which a dispute was referred had an obligation , under LAW , to make good the omission itself and to adjudicate the case . In the court \u2019s view , the same obligation also arose from LAW , under which everyone was afforded the right of access to a court . In this context the relevant provisions of LAW ratified by GPE had to be applied in the case , even though the specific national laws had not yet been enacted by the legislature . Directly applying the relevant provisions of these international instruments ratified by GPE , the court considered that the applicant trade union did have the right to enter into collective agreements .", "CARDINAL . As to the question whether the validity of the collective agreement in question was affected by the fact that it had not been provided for by any legislation at the time it was entered into , the court considered that , since it concerned employer - employee relations , the agreement was of a private - law nature . In the context of the limits imposed by Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the Code of Obligations , namely compliance with statutory provisions , customary law , morals and public order , the parties had been freely entitled to determine the content of this collective agreement . An examination of the text of the collective agreement in question did not reveal any contradiction with those requirements . Consequently , the court found that the collective agreement between the applicant trade union and ORG had been a valid legal instrument with binding effect for the parties .", "CARDINAL . The court awarded Mr PERSON a sum equivalent to the increases in pay and allowances provided for by the collective agreement in question .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG ( combined civil divisions ) quashed ORG judgment of DATE . It found that certain rights and freedoms mentioned in LAW were directly applicable to litigants , whereas others were not . In fact , LAW , by the indication \u201c the exercise of this right shall be governed by legislation \u201d clearly earmarked the rights and freedoms which , to be used and applied , required the enactment of specific legislation . Absent such legislation , these rights and freedoms , which included the freedom to join a trade union and to bargain collectively , could not be exercised .", "CARDINAL . ORG further considered that the principle of the individual \u2019s free will was not absolute in respect of the establishment of legal entities . They could acquire legal personality , distinct from their constituent persons , only by complying with the formal conditions and procedures laid down by law for that purpose . The creation of a legal entity was no more than a legal consequence conferred by the law on an expression of free will by the founders .", "CARDINAL . ORG pointed out that the freedom to form associations , trade unions and political parties , even if provided for in LAW , could not be exercised simply by a declaration of the free will of individuals . As there was no specific law on the subject , the existence of such a legal entity could not be recognised . According to ORG , this finding was not at odds with the principles of \u201c the rule of law \u201d and \u201c democracy \u201d mentioned in the LAW , since supervision of legal entities by the ORG , in order to ensure public usefulness , was necessary in any democratic legal system .", "CARDINAL . ORG further pointed out that the legislation in force at the time when the trade union was founded did not permit civil servants to form trade unions . It added that the amendments subsequently made to LAW , recognising the right of civil servants to form trade unions and bargain collectively , were not such as to invalidate the finding that PERSON had not acquired legal personality and , as a result , did not have the capacity to take or defend court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . An application by representatives of the trade union for rectification of that decision was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following an audit of ORG accounts by ORG , the members of the trade union ORG had to reimburse the additional income they had received as a result of the defunct collective agreement . ORG , in a number of decisions that it gave as the court of last resort in respect of the collective agreements entered into by the trade union , pointed out that the rules applicable to civil servants , including the salaries and allowances to which they were entitled , were laid down by law . It further considered that , since the amendment on DATE of LAW and the enactment on DATE of Law no . CARDINAL on civil ORG trade unions , such unions were admittedly entitled to engage in collective bargaining under certain conditions of representation , but were not entitled to enter into valid collective agreements directly with the authorities concerned , unlike trade unions of ordinary contractual employees who could enter into such agreements with their employers . If an agreement was entered into between the employing authority and the trade union concerned , it could only become binding following its approval by ORG . ORG , after finding that the collective agreement entered into by the applicant trade union had not fulfilled these conditions , decided that the accountants who had authorised higher payments than those provided for by law should reimburse the surplus amounts to the ORG \u2019s budget .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused to apply section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL , which required the discontinuance of any administrative , financial or judicial proceedings brought against accountants who were responsible for such payments . It considered that this provision did not render the collective agreements valid and did not release the accountants in question from the obligation to reimburse the ORG for any losses sustained by it as a result of payments made in accordance with those agreements .", "CARDINAL . The accountants concerned in turn brought proceedings against the civil servants who were members of the trade unions and had benefited from the additional payments granted under the defunct collective agreements .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW read as follows :", "\u201c Ordinary contractual employees ( i\u015f\u00e7i ) and employers shall have the right to form trade unions and federations of unions , without prior permission , in order to safeguard and develop their economic and social rights and interests in the context of their labour relations .", "In order to form a union or a federation of unions , it shall suffice to submit the information and documents prescribed by law to the competent authority designated by law . If it finds that this information and documentation are not in conformity with the law , the competent authority shall apply to the appropriate court for the suspension of activities or the dissolution of the union or federation of unions .", "Everyone shall be entitled to join or resign from a trade union .", "No one shall be compelled to become a member , remain a member , or resign from a trade union .", "Ordinary contractual employees and employers shall not be entitled to join CARDINAL trade union at a time .", "Employment in a particular workplace shall not be made conditional on membership or lack of membership of a trade union of ordinary contractual employees .", "In order to hold an executive post in a trade union or federation of trade unions of ordinary contractual employees , it is necessary to have effectively been employed as such an employee for DATE .", "The constitution , administration , and functioning of trade unions and federations of trade unions shall not be inconsistent with the characteristics of the LOC or with democratic principles as defined in the LAW . \u201d", "\u201c Employees and employers shall have the right to form trade unions and federations of unions , without prior permission , in order to safeguard and develop the economic and social rights and interests of their members in the context of their labour relations , and to join or withdraw from such entities of their own free will .
