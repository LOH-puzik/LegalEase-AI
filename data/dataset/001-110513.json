ORG acknowledged that the names of the applicants\u2019 relatives had been included in the FAC lists for the PERSON , ORG and ORG camps ; however , \u201c the \u2018 PERSON investigation ... did not establish the fate of the said individuals . \u201d As their bodies had not been identified , there was no proof that the applicants\u2019 relatives had lost their lives as a result of the crime of abuse of power ( Article CARDINAL of the DATE NORP Criminal Code ) referred to in the decision of DATE . Accordingly , there was no basis for granting victim status to the applicants under LAW . Moreover , classified materials could not be made accessible to \u201c representatives of foreign States \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Counsel submitted a statement of appeal in which they pointed out that the lack of information about the fate of the applicants\u2019 relatives had been the result of an ineffective investigation . The CARDINAL persons had been identified only on the basis of the military identity tags found at the burial places and the investigators had not undertaken any measures or commissioned any forensic examination to identify the exhumed remains . Furthermore , it was a publicly known fact that the DATE excavation had uncovered the remains of CARDINAL people , of whom CARDINAL individuals had been identified . Among those identified were CARDINAL persons whose relatives had been claimants in the proceedings . The granting of victim status to the claimants would have allowed the identification of the remains with the use of genetic methods . Finally , counsel stressed that the PERSON criminal case file did not contain any information supporting the conclusion that any of the NORP officers taken from the FAC camps had survived or died of natural causes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG of GPE upheld the judgment of DATE in its entirety .

By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the ORG replied to PERSON that their application had been examined and rejected , without providing further details .", "CARDINAL . Memorial challenged the ORG \u2019s refusal before ORG . At the hearing on DATE the court read out the ORG \u2019s letter of DATE addressed to the presiding judge .

On DATE the NORP Embassy in GPE asked the prosecutor \u2019s office for an explanation concerning the rehabilitation of Mr GPE . In a letter of DATE , the prosecutor \u2019s office expressed the view that there was no legal basis for the rehabilitation of Mr PERSON or the other NORP citizens because the investigation had not determined which provision of the DATE LAW had been the basis for their repression . A similarly worded letter of CARDINAL DATE refused a further request to the same effect by PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chief Military Prosecutor \u2019s Office rejected a request for rehabilitation submitted by counsel on behalf of all the applicants . The prosecutor stated that it was not possible to determine the legal basis for the repression against NORP citizens in DATE .

In the absence of any challenge to this claim by ORG , and any other pertinent information from ORG on the practice of execution of capital sentences , due weight must be given to the author \u2019s allegation . ORG understands the continued anguish and mental stress caused to the author , as the mother of a condemned prisoner , by the persisting uncertainty of the circumstances that led to his execution , as well as the location of his gravesite . The complete secrecy surrounding the date of execution , and the place of burial and the refusal to hand over the body for burial have the effect of intimidating or punishing families by intentionally leaving them in a state of uncertainty and mental distress . The ORG considers that the authorities\u2019 initial failure to notify the author of the scheduled date for the execution of her son , and their subsequent persistent failure to notify her of the location of her son \u2019s grave amounts to inhuman treatment of the author , in violation of article CARDINAL of the LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

PERSON family have the right to know the circumstances of his death , and the ORG points out that any complaint relating to acts prohibited under article CARDINAL of the LAW must be investigated rapidly and impartially by the competent authorities . In addition , the ORG notes , as it did during its deliberations on admissibility , the failure to correct PERSON death certificate of CARDINAL DATE , which records a natural death contrary to the publicly known facts , which have been confirmed by ORG . ORG considers that the refusal to conduct an investigation into the death of PERSON , the lack of official recognition of his place of burial and the failure to correct the death certificate constitute inhuman treatment of Ms. PERSON and her sons , in breach of LAW ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
