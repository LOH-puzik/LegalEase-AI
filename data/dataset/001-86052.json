The applicants and the first applicant \u2019s lawyer appealed against the judgment . The applicants in their appeals challenged , inter alia , the impartiality of ORG judge PERSON , as her husband , PERSON , had headed the team of investigators which had been set up for the investigation of the criminal case concerned .

On DATE the first applicant \u2019s wife also lodged a complaint to ORG , arguing , inter alia , that judge PERSON should have withdrawn because her husband had been involved in the pre - trial investigation .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing before ORG on DATE the first applicant raised the issue of impartiality of ORG judge PERSON According to the record of the hearing , he stated as follows :", "\u201c The presiding judge was PERSON . Her husband was the person who carried out the preliminary investigation . I only learned about it after the court hearing . This fact affected the impartiality of the judge . It could also be seen from the record [ of the court hearing ] because it is imprecise . ... It affected the judicial investigation . The judge did not grant my requests , everything happened very quickly . She [ ] wanted to have me imprisoned . I did not request the removal of the judge . I did not know at that time that her husband had been the head of the preliminary investigation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the prosecutor the applicants had not been aware that PERSON and PERSON were married to each other when ORG began to hear the case .

At the end of ORG hearing the second applicant said that PERSON had interrogated him . He added : \u201c [ PERSON ] threatened me [ and said ] that if I confessed , I would not go to prison . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ringkonnakohus ) acquitted the applicants in respect of the second count of temporary unauthorised use of other ORG movable property . It upheld ORG judgment in the remaining part .", "CARDINAL . Referring to LAW ( ORG koodeks ) , which concerned grounds for disqualification of a judge , ORG found that the ORG allegations did not warrant quashing ORG judgment and referring the case to the first - instance court for a new trial . Moreover , it was noted that none of the parties to the proceedings had requested judge PERSON disqualification during the proceedings in ORG ; neither had the impartiality of the judge nor that of the court been put into doubt in the appeals . The first applicant had submitted at ORG hearing that he had become aware of the fact that PERSON was the judge \u2019s husband during the court proceedings . ORG found , however , that the judge \u2019s possible relationship with an official participating in the preliminary investigation did not prove the judge \u2019s partiality . It noted that although PERSON had been the head of the team of police officers investigating the case , the investigation had in fact been carried out by another police investigator . None of the reports concerning various investigative activities ( uurimistoimingu protokoll ) in the case file had been drawn up by PERSON Moreover , besides judge PERSON , CARDINAL lay judges had taken part in deciding the case . ORG considered that the allegation concerned was artificial and had been submitted with a view to delaying the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . NORP In his appeal to ORG ( NORP ) , the first applicant argued that judge PERSON could not have been unaware of the fact that her husband had led the team of investigators and that the applicant had made several complaints during the preliminary investigation to ORG against the police investigators , including PERSON asserted that judge PERSON should have withdrawn from hearing the case . In his view the judicial investigation in ORG had not been impartial ; the lack of impartiality had particularly been reflected in the severity of the sentence . The applicant had not requested PERSON removal because he had found out too late and through informal sources that she was married to PERSON Nevertheless , he was of the opinion that his failure to request the judge \u2019s removal should not deprive him of the right to impartial adjudication of the charges against him .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant argued in his appeal to ORG that judge PERSON had had no right to administer justice in respect of him because she was the wife of the head of the team of police investigators .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . According to LAW ( ORG koodeks ) , as in force at the material time , a judge could not participate in criminal proceedings and had to be disqualified if he or she had a direct or indirect personal interest in the case or if other circumstances gave reasons to doubt his or her impartiality . Article CARDINAL provided that a person who was related to an official conducting a preliminary investigation or court proceedings in a criminal case could not participate in the proceedings as an expert , specialist , defence counsel or representative of a victim , plaintiff or defendant , or as an interpreter or translator .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the LAW stipulated that a person whose spouse had participated in the proceedings of a criminal case ( menetlusosaline kriminaalasjas ) could not act as a judge in that case . The same applied in respect of a person with regard to whom facts were presented which gave reason to doubt his or her impartiality ( LAW ( CARDINAL ) ) .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code provided that participants in the criminal proceedings ( kriminaalmenetluse osaline ; menetlusosaline ) were : suspect , accused , accused at trial and his or her defence counsel , prosecutor in court proceedings , and victim , plaintiff , defendant and their representative .", "CARDINAL .

Under LAW a head of the investigation could form a team of investigators by his or her order . The head of the team of investigators ( uurimisgrupi vanem ) had to be named in the order . The latter had to coordinate the activities of the team of investigators .", "CARDINAL .
