THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by ORG , ORG , GPE . The Government are represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant along with another youth ( C. ) were arrested by the police for suspected involvement in offences relating to the theft of a ring and causing severe injuries to its owner , a boy aged CARDINAL . The victim was rendered unconscious as a result of the attack and had to be detained in hospital for DATE . He was treated for multiple and extensive bruising to his face and head as well as to the rest of his body .", "At the time of the commission of these offences , the applicant was aged DATE and DATE .", "On DATE the applicant , who had earlier been released on bail , was formally charged with the offence of robbery contrary to section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE . He was again released on bail and attended ORG for the first time on DATE . C. failed to attend and a warrant was issued for his arrest .", "At the first hearing before ORG on DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer obtained a DATE adjournment to allow him to consider the case outline served by ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . At the hearing , although the matter was discussed , no decision was taken as to the court \u2019s jurisdiction to sentence the applicant , if convicted , under LAW ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG \u201c the DATE LAW ) . The applicant was released on bail .", "At the resumed hearing on DATE , ORG stated its intention to commit the applicant to ORG for trial , given that ORG had greater sentencing powers . The proceedings were adjourned until DATE to enable the case to be prepared for committal .", "At the hearing on DATE , the ORG withdrew the robbery charge and replaced it with charges of theft contrary to LAW DATE and assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section CARDINAL of the Offences Against LAW DATE ( \u201c the CARDINAL Act \u201d ) . ORG accepted jurisdiction over these charges since they were within its sentencing remit . The applicant pleaded not guilty . The case was adjourned for DATE to allow the ORG to obtain and review further medical evidence with a view to a possible preferment of a more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent , contrary to LAW .", "According to the applicant , the ORG created unnecessary delay by not reviewing the charges earlier . There was no reason why the trial date could not have been fixed at DATE hearing and the medical evidence submitted in due course . Instead , ORG allowed a DATE adjournment to enable the ORG to review the medical evidence . In the applicant \u2019s view , the ORG should in any event have known the extent of the victim \u2019s injuries by DATE , without having to be given a DATE adjournment to review the medical evidence .", "At the next hearing on DATE , ORG fixed a pre - trial review hearing for DATE and the trial for DATE . The medical evidence sought by the ORG was still not available . However , the ORG did not request a further adjournment .", "On DATE ORG had to adjourn the pre - trial review since the co - accused C. had failed to attend . The pre - trial review was adjourned until DATE . On that occasion , the date of the trial was fixed for DATE . According to the Government , the applicant \u2019s representative did not object to these dates . The applicant denies this and states that objection was made regarding further delay .", "On DATE the applicant failed to attend ORG . An application by the ORG to proceed in his absence was refused . A warrant was issued for his arrest .", "The applicant turned up at ORG on DATE . He stated that he had forgotten that he was due to attend court DATE . The court adjourned the proceedings to CARDINAL DATE so that arrangements could be made for another trial date to be set .", "At the directions hearing on DATE ORG fixed the date of the pre - trial review hearing for DATE . The trial was set down for CARDINAL DATE .", "The pre - trial review had to be adjourned twice and was eventually held on DATE and again on DATE . On the latter occasions the defence made submissions on disclosure of materials in the possession of the ORG . The applicant points out that the ORG should have disclosed the materials requested at a much earlier stage of the proceedings , for example at the hearing on DATE .", "In the meantime the applicant had turned DATE on DATE .", "On DATE , CARDINAL days after the applicant was first arrested and DATE after his fifteenth birthday , trial commenced . The victim gave evidence and was cross - examined by live video link . The defence made unsuccessful applications for disclosure of evidence and to have other evidence excluded at the trial , especially the victim \u2019s evidence identifying the applicant and his co - accused .", "On DATE the applicant was convicted of theft and assault occasioning actual bodily harm . ORG , pursuant to section CARDINAL of the GPE Court Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) , committed the applicant to ORG for sentence , being of the view that its powers of sentencing were inadequate and that the applicant should be given a heavier sentence than it had power to impose .", "On DATE ORG adjourned the case to CARDINAL DATE so that pre - sentence reports could be prepared . On that date His Honour PERSON , sitting with CARDINAL lay justices , sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 detention in a Young Offender institution .", "The applicant was given leave by a Single Judge to appeal to ORG against his sentence .", "Before ORG counsel for the applicant contended that the sentence handed down was unlawful on the grounds that the fact that the applicant has passed his fifteenth birthday during the proceedings , but before conviction , meant that he should be liable only for the same penalties as a DATE . Accordingly , he maintained , a sentence of detention in a Young Offender institution could not be passed on him .", "On DATE the appeal was refused . In dismissing the appeal , Mr Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c The simple truth is that [ the applicant ] was indeed fortunate not to have been charged with , and then convicted of , the even more serious offence of robbery . ... We consider that for the circumstances of the offence ... any right - thinking member of the public would have been appalled if the result had not been the deprivation of liberty of those who committed these offences against such a young boy and with such obvious violence and persistence which were involved in this case . It is urged upon us that because the co - accused has absconded and there was a delay of DATE between the commission of the offence and sentence , this would have enabled the court to impose a sentence of custody in a young offender institution . That sentence became available because [ the applicant ] had turned DATE between the date of the offence and the date of sentence . As a submission , that is entirely accurate . As a submission that leads this court to doubt the correctness of the sentence passed on [ the applicant ] , we not only doubt , we profoundly disagree . In any event it would have been open , given the seriousness of the offences with which [ the applicant ] was charged and been found guilty , to have considered sentencing under the provisions of section CARDINAL of ORG . \u201d", "The applicant \u2019s request for an extension of the time - limit for an application to ORG to have a question of public importance certified for an appeal to ORG was refused on DATE . Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c It may be some comfort to those who have appeared on behalf of this applicant to be reminded that in any event a case in which a sentence has been passed which was within the discretion of the sentencing court can not properly be regarded as a point of law of general public importance worthy of consideration of ORG . \u201d", "There are CARDINAL kinds of criminal offences in LANGUAGE law :", "summary offences ( triable only in ORG ) ;", "\u201c either way \u201d offences ( triable either in ORG or on indictment in ORG ) ; and", "indictable offences ( triable only in ORG ) .", "The offences of which the applicant was eventually convicted and sentenced ( theft and assault occasioning actual bodily harm ) , were \u201c either way \u201d offences .", "If an offender is aged DATE , neither ORG nor a ORG can pass a sentence of imprisonment , but they can pass a sentence of detention in a Young Offender institution . If the magistrates consider that their power of sentencing is inadequate , as occurred in the applicant \u2019s case , they may commit an offender to ORG for sentence .", "A person DATE a juvenile DATE is normally tried in a ORG . According to section CARDINAL ) of LAW , a juvenile must be tried in a ORG , subject to defined exceptions , including where the magistrates sitting in the ORG consider that a juvenile accused , charged with particularly serious offences , could properly be sentenced under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG if he were convicted on indictment ( see below ) . In that event , the juvenile will be tried in ORG .", "A ORG sentencing powers are less extensive than those of ORG . At the time the applicant came to be sentenced , the only form of custodial sentence available to ORG was detention in a Young Offender institution . Moreover , at the material time detention in a Young Offender institution was only available in respect of offenders whose age on the date of conviction ( according to ORG ) was DATE ( as in the applicant \u2019s case ) , CARDINAL or DATE . In this connection , section CARDINALA of LAW DATE provided at the date of the applicant \u2019s conviction :", "( CARDINAL ) Subject to section CARDINAL below and to section CARDINAL of the Children and Young Persons Act CARDINAL , where -", "\u201c ( a ) an offender DATE but not DATE is convicted of an offence which is punishable with imprisonment in the case of a person aged DATE or over ; and :", "( b ) ( ... )", "the sentence that the court is to pass is a sentence of detention in a young offender institution . \u201d", "ORG was restricted to a maximum sentence of CARDINAL - months\u2019 detention in a Young Offender institution for a single offence or a total maximum of DATE where , like the applicant , the offender was convicted of CARDINAL offences triable either way .", "Pursuant to section CARDINAL of LAW , if a ORG found a CARDINAL , DATE or DATE guilty of an indictable offence or \u201c either way \u201d offence ( as in the applicant \u2019s case ) , and it was of the opinion that the offender should be sentenced to CARDINAL - months\u2019 detention in a Young Offender institution ( or CARDINAL months\u2019 detention in the case of an offender like the applicant convicted of CARDINAL offences ) , then it could commit him to ORG to be sentenced . Following committal , ORG could then pass a sentence of up to CARDINAL months\u2019 detention in a Young Offender institution for the offence ( section CARDINAL of MONEY DATE ) , or deal with the offender in any way in which ORG could have dealt with him . Detention in a Young Offender institution can only be imposed inter alia if the offence was one of violence and the court was of the opinion that only a custodial sentence would be adequate to protect the public from serious harm , or that offence was so serious that only a custodial sentence could be justified .", "In the case of offenders aged DATE or under ( like the applicant at the date of the commission of the offences of which he was eventually charged and convicted ) , ORG may , inter alia , impose a fine , make a compensation order or make a supervision order . It has no power in law to sentence an offender under DATE to a Young Offender institution for summary or \u201c either way \u201d offences . In addition , it has no power to commit such children to ORG for trial or for sentencing . There are exceptional circumstances in which children of CARDINAL may receive a custodial sentence . Thus , according to section CARDINAL of ORG , a young person aged DATE may be given a custodial sentence if he is convicted of an offence , such as robbery , punishable in the case of an adult with imprisonment for DATE or more , not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law . Of relevance to the applicant \u2019s case , under section CARDINAL of the Theft Act DATE the maximum sentence for an adult convicted on indictment of an offence of theft is DATE imprisonment . Of equal relevance to the applicant \u2019s case , under section CARDINAL of the Offences Against the Person Act CARDINAL the maximum sentence for an adult convicted on indictment of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "According to the Government , in LANGUAGE law the basic rule for determining what power the court has in relation to sentencing an offender is his age at the date of conviction . The age at the date of conviction rule , as opposed to the date of sentence , was approved by ORG in PERSON ( [ DATE ] PERSON ) and later in NORP v. Pespane ( CARDINAL Cr . App . R ( S ) CARDINAL ) , PERSON ( CARDINAL Cr . App . GPE ) CARDINAL ) and PERSON ( CARDINAL Cr . App . GPE ) CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant draws attention to his view that LAW of FAC DATE contradicts the age - at - the - date - of - conviction - rule . This section makes provision for defendants who reach their eighteenth birthday after their case has begun in ORG . It reads :", "\u201c Where proceedings in respect of a young person are begun ... for an offence and he attains the age of DATE before the conclusion of the proceedings , the court may deal with the case and make any order which it could have made had he not attained that age . \u201d", "If a juvenile has not attained his or her eighteenth birthday at the time of plea , ORG has the power to hear the case and impose sentence . If the defendant \u2019s eighteenth birthday falls after the plea and before final disposal of the case , ORG may nevertheless sentence the defendant as if he or she was still a juvenile . If , however the juvenile has reached DATE by the time he or she is asked to enter a plea to the offence , the court must treat him or her as an adult ( NORP v. ORG , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) . In NORP v. West London Justices ex parte Siley PERSON ( reported in Criminal Law Review CARDINAL , p.p . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the relevant age for determining a juvenile accused \u2019s right to elect for jury trial was his age on the date he entered a plea of guilty .", "The applicant further points out that the domestic case - law relied on by the Government is of limited value to the applicant \u2019s case since there are no decisions dealing with the situation of a DATE who becomes CARDINAL before conviction and thus moves from a non - custodial to a custodial bracket ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
