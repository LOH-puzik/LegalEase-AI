GREECE", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr NORP , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE and in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON GPE , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , on the compulsory production of identity cards , provided that in order to facilitate identity checks identity cards must record the bearer \u2019s religion . LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , on the evidential value of identity cards , required identity cards to record the bearer \u2019s religion , among other information . The situation was changed by PERSON no . DATE , which concerned relations between the ORG and its citizens , the introduction of a new type of identity card and other measures ; section CARDINAL provided that it was not compulsory to record a person \u2019s religion on his or her identity card , this being done only at the bearer \u2019s request . However , PERSON no . DATE was never applied , as the Minister of the ORG extended the application of Legislative Decree no . CARDINAL . Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL once again made it compulsory to record religion on identity cards .", "By its decision no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE the authority responsible for personal data protection ( \u201c the authority \u201d ) ruled that recording certain information , including the bearer \u2019s religion , on identity cards constituted processing of personal data which was incompatible with PERSON no . ORG on the protection of individuals with regard to processing of personal data ( epexergasia dedomenon prosopikou charactira ) . The authority then invited ORG to take the necessary steps to ensure that a note indicating the bearer \u2019s religion would be neither requested nor authorised by the services responsible for issuing new identity cards . It referred to ORG Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data . It expressed the view that , regard being had to the purpose of data processing , namely , in the present instance , checking people \u2019s identities , the following information was not necessary : fingerprints , the name and forename of the spouse , sex , occupation , nationality , home address and religion . With regard to religion , the authority pointed out that this information concerned a matter of individual conscience and was therefore not indispensable for establishing identity . It also took the view that the individual \u2019s consent did not necessarily make the processing of all this information legitimate , since such consent could not have the effect of authorising processing which was illegitimate in itself or contrary to the aim pursued or the principle of necessity .", "On DATE an association , ORG , stated in the press : \u201c Recording religion on identity cards , even on a voluntary basis , is contrary to the fundamental provisions of the LAW , which guarantee freedom of religion \u201d .", "By a joint decision of DATE ORG and Public Order established the type of the new identity card and the information it should contain , which no longer included religion .", "On DATE , CARDINAL DATE and CARDINAL DATE the applicants asked ORG to set aside the joint decision of DATE on the ground that it did not include religion in the information to be recorded in identity cards ; they alleged an infringement of the freedom of religion , guaranteed by LAW .", "The hearing in the case , and in a number of similar cases , took place on DATE before ORG sitting as a full court . At the beginning of the hearing the applicants challenged for bias those judges who , as members of ORG , had publicly spoken out against recording religion on identity cards .", "CARDINAL judges declared that they were members of the association and CARDINAL others pointed out that PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL barred judges from revealing , even of their own accord , whether they belonged to it .", "By its interlocutory decision no . CARDINAL the full court of ORG dismissed the challenge for bias . It noted that the judges in question had not taken any part in publication of the declaration by the association \u2019s executive committee and had accordingly not adopted any position on the matter . Furthermore , the declaration had been published in the press during the judicial vacation and without the knowledge of the judges challenged . On the other hand , by its decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the full court ruled that the president of the association , who was a member of ORG , should be excluded from the hearing .", "In its judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ORG held by a majority that , whether it was voluntary or compulsory , recording religion in identity cards would breach LAW . It ruled in the following terms :", "\u201c Freedom of religious conscience , which protects the individual \u2019s religious beliefs against any state interference , includes , among other things , an individual \u2019s right not to reveal his faith or his religious beliefs and not to be obliged to act or refrain from acting in such a way that it is possible to conclude that he has such beliefs . No state authority or organisation has the right to interfere in the field of an individual \u2019s conscience , which is inviolable , according to LAW , or seek to discover his religious beliefs , or oblige him to reveal his religious beliefs through external signs . An individual \u2019s voluntary disclosure of his beliefs to the authorities with a view to the exercise of certain specific rights conferred by law for the purposes of protecting freedom of religion ( for example , the right to be exempted from military service as a conscientious objector , or from religious education lessons or other obligations imposed on schoolchildren , such as attending mass or prayers , or to establish a place of worship or religious association ) is another matter . Consequently , the obligation to record religion on identity cards ... would breach LAW ... The positive aspect of freedom of religion ( manifestation of beliefs ) consists in the right for everybody to manifest his religion or beliefs without hindrance either alone or in community with others and in public or private in so far as he does not offend against public order or morals and subject to the restrictions laid down in the fourth paragraph of LAW . However , that freedom does not include the right for individuals to manifest their religion or their religious beliefs by recording them , if they wish to do so , in public documents such as identity cards . Not only does LAW not confer such a right on persons entitled to freedom of religion ... , but it prohibits the recording , even on a voluntary basis , of religion or religious beliefs in identity cards as a means of manifesting or proving them . The effect of any other interpretation would be to infringe the freedom of religion ... of those NORP who do not wish to manifest their religious beliefs in that manner and to do away with the ORG \u2019s religious neutrality with regard to exercise of that individual right ... When NORP refuse to record their religion or religious beliefs in their identity cards their refusal is noted by a public authority in a public document which can be shown to any authority or service or to private individuals for the identification of the bearer , and they are obliged to reveal , indirectly and almost publicly , CARDINAL aspect of their thoughts on religious matters . At the same time , they distinguish themselves , against their will and by interference of the public authorities , from those NORP who disclose their religious beliefs by recording them in their identity cards . Moreover , the recording of religion in identity cards opens the way to positive or negative discrimination and thus creates the risk of interference with religious equality , guaranteed by LAW . \u201d", "As regards the complaint of a violation of LAW , ORG held that , because recording religion was contrary to LAW , it should be rejected , since international conventions ratified by law prevailed over legislation but not the LAW .", "LAW provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The dominant religion in GPE is that of ORG . ORG , which recognises as its head Our Lord PERSON , is indissolubly united , doctrinally , with FAC of GPE and with any other ORG in communion with it ( omodoxi ) , immutably observing , like the other Churches , the holy apostolic and synodical canons and the holy traditions .
