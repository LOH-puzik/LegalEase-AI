{"ITEMID": "001-67067", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "SWE", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2004, "DOCNAME": "KROKST\u00c4DE v. SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national born in DATE and living in GPE .", "The applicant had been a member of ORG ( ORG advokatsamfund , hereinafter \u201c the Bar \u201d ) since DATE .", "On DATE ORG of the Bar ( ORG advokatsamfunds disciplinn\u00e4mnd ) , having previously received a number of complaints against the applicant , held a hearing at which the applicant was present .", "On DATE the applicant submitted to ORG that he had had a migraine attack during the hearing and had therefore not been able to answer the questions or argue in a satisfactory manner . He stated his views on a number of issues and also enquired whether he could submit further explanations with regard to those issues . This was however refused by ORG .", "On DATE ORG found that some of the applicant 's actions amounted to misconduct and that others involved serious neglect of his duties as a lawyer ( advokat ) . It decided to exclude him from the Bar with immediate effect .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) which held an oral hearing during which the applicant was heard anew . A chartered accountant was heard as a witness at the applicant 's request . The applicant also invoked new written evidence , inter alia doctors ' certificates stating that his working ability during the period in question had been poor due to migraine and apnoea .", "On DATE ORG rejected the applicant 's appeal . It concluded that there was not much guidance as to the meaning of \u201c misconduct \u201d for the purposes of the provision in the Code of Procedure ( PERSON , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) entailing exclusion from the Bar . The preparatory works stated that the wording primarily aimed at actions pertaining to the relationship between the lawyer and his or her client but that the Bar could also focus on misconduct taking place outside the work as a lawyer . Furthermore , the action did not have to be punishable under criminal law in order to qualify as misconduct .", "ORG had found that the applicant had neglected the creditors of his limited company . In this respect ORG concluded that it was clear that the applicant , without having informed himself of the company 's financial situation , had sold the company 's assets below cost to himself assuming only part of the company 's debts . He had thereafter disposed of the company shares without considering the interests of the creditors . ORG also concluded that these actions entailed misconduct .", "ORG further recalled that a lawyer must not promote wrong and that according to its case - law , a lawyer having participated in the creation of false documents or consciously having drafted false documents had acted in a way amounting to misconduct . It found to be established that the applicant in DATE had issued a receipt dated DATE , in which he had stated that his law firm had received MONEY in cash as payment from a client . On DATE the same amount had been deposited in the account of another limited company . The payment did not concern a consultation and the applicant had furthermore antedated the receipt . ORG concluded that a receipt regarding payment from a client was an important document in a lawyer 's business , and consciously stating incorrect information could be considered as misconduct . Not being able to exclude that the applicant had been misled to sign the receipt , it however concluded that he had merely neglected his duties as a lawyer .", "ORG finally determined that the organisation of the applicant 's office and business , inter alia an incorrect book - keeping , amounted to neglect of his duties as a lawyer .", "ORG concluded that the applicant 's actions constituted misconduct and neglect of his duties as a lawyer . Even considering his state of health there were no mitigating circumstances as to his misconduct . The court found that he should therefore be disbarred .", "The duties of the Bar are set out in LAW and its Regulations are issued by the Government . The Bar is a private association with the duty to maintain ethical and professional standards within the legal profession . Only a member of the Bar can use the title advokat ( as opposed to jurist ) . The Bar has also been entrusted with some public duties , such as its disciplinary powers .", "Under chapter CARDINAL section CARDINAL of LAW , the activities of the members of the Bar are supervised by ORG and ORG .", "Under chapter CARDINAL section CARDINAL of LAW , a lawyer who in his or her work consciously does a wrong or otherwise acts in a manner amounting to misconduct , shall be excluded from the Bar . If there are mitigating circumstances the lawyer might receive a warning . A lawyer who otherwise neglects his or her duties may receive a warning or an admonition . If there are especially aggravating circumstances the lawyer may be excluded from the Bar .", "Under chapter CARDINAL section CARDINAL of LAW , anyone having been denied entry to the Bar or having been excluded from the Bar may appeal against the decision to ORG .", "Under NORP law there is no requirement that a lawyer has to be a member of the Bar in order to practise law . Only when the state appoints a defence counsel in criminal cases should that person according to LAW be an advokat , but even in this case there are certain exceptions .", "Under LAW , in order to be accepted as a member , the person in question must inter alia have worked in the legal field for DATE out of which DATE must have been spent working for another lawyer in a law firm ( advokatbyr\u00e5 ) or in one 's own law firm . Furthermore , the person must be working in either of the CARDINAL in order to be granted membership . Lawyers working in companies , consultancy agencies , organisations or authorities can therefore not use the title advokat ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
