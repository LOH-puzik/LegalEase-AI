The judge found ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) that :", "\u201c What [ X ] has done is deliberately to admix with that confidential information false information ( a lethal concoction ) to create a false market in the shares of the Claimant and ORG , a serious criminal offence . There must be a real risk of repetition , if [ X ] is not identified . Beyond the substantial private interest of the Claimant , there is a substantial public interest in identifying [ X ] and taking all necessary steps to prevent any repetition . As it seems to me , the circumstances of this case are exceptional : vital public as well as individual interests are at stake in securing the integrity of the share market . There is an overriding need for the disclosure sought in the interests of justice and for the prevention of crime \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The judge continued ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c As it seems to me the Claimant has sufficiently explored other avenues before having recourse to this application for relief against the press ... There have been internal investigations conducted at the Advisers ' and the Claimant 's businesses ; the Claimant is conducting inquiries further afield . The Claimant is using investigators of the highest international calibre . The Defendants complain that full details of all the Claimant 's inquiries are not given in the Claimant 's evidence and that this is necessary in order to establish how thorough they have been , but there is no substance in this complaint . The evidence establishes to my satisfaction that full and proper investigations have been made and are continuing . To require disclosure of more details of these investigations is unnecessary even as such a course may prejudice the ongoing inquiries ... The evidence before me ( and most particularly a report by ORG ) establishes that the Claimant needs the information which production of the Documents ought to provide to further and give impetus to these investigations ... I am satisfied that the order is required if progress is to be made whilst the trail is still warm and if an identification is to be made within the time frame necessary to safeguard the interests of the Claimant and the public . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants were granted leave to appeal by ORG on DATE and were required to file their written arguments with the court by DATE . By judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeal ( Interbrew v. Financial Times et al . [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ) . In the leading judgment of ORG , ORG held that in order to justify the exercise of ORG powers to compel production of documents or disclosure of information , Interbrew had to establish that each defendant had facilitated a civil wrong committed by an unknown person against whom they aimed to seek redress . The only civil wrong on which GPE could rely was that of a breach of confidence on the part of the source . While such a breach of confidence had been made out , what had not been made out was a \u201c bigger and better cause of action in respect of the ' lethal cocktail ' of fact and falsehood , since the element of falsehood can neither form part of the protected confidence nor stand on its own as a discrete tort \u201d ( at paragraph CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Sedley LJ went on to consider the approach adopted by ORG as follows ( at CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c Everything proceeded below on the assumption that crimes of forgery and market manipulation were proved . But both , or at least the former , depend upon the falsity of the pages in the document showing bid price and timetable . False they were if one goes on such evidence as was before the court . But by definition their falsity is alleged against an absent and silent accused . We have no way of knowing , any DATE as [ counsel for the applicants ] stressed \u2013 the CARDINAL defendants do , whether the source , if cornered , would demonstrate that he had simply assembled authentic documents from different places within GPE , ORG and Lazards .", "I have to say that I find this aspect of the ORG procedure troubling . A commercial enterprise which may very well have its own reasons for denying the authenticity of a document gets a clear run against a media defendant which can only , save in rare cases , take a neutral stand on the question . The court of first instance needs to be extremely circumspect before accepting evidence , especially when , as here , it is second- or third - hand , that goes to the heart of the case and can not be controverted ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , PERSON concluded :", "\u201c DATE . ... I have come to the conclusion , though not without misgiving , that the order for disclosure was rightly made against all the defendants . Nothing which has been put before us suggests that the court will be significantly better placed at an eventual trial than it is now to decide the key issues ; and there is at least some force in GPE 's complaint that its hands are tied vis - \u00e0 - vis NORP Breweries , and possibly other targets too , unless and until it can prevent a recurrence of this spoiling operation .", "CARDINAL . ... PERSON 's prima facie entitlement to delivery up of the documents is established because DATE and solely because DATE it may enable them to ascertain the identity of the proper defendant to a breach of confidence action relating to the relatively anodyne , though not the explosive , parts of the document . From the sweep of GPE 's original case and the \u201c lethal cocktail \u201d on which PERSON founded his conclusions , the basis of the application now shrinks to this little measure . But though little , it is far from insignificant for Interbrew ...", "CARDINAL . With it , CARDINAL turns to s.CARDINAL of the DATE Act . The section begins by barring any order for disclosure in circumstances such as these , since its very object is to discover the source of information which the defendants have published . Interbrew , however , can invoke CARDINAL of the listed purposes for lifting the bar : that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice . That it may also go to the prevention of crime can not be ruled out as irrelevant , but it is peripheral because it is not a purpose for which Interbrew themselves are entitled to disclosure . Then is the public interest in the doing of justice sufficient in the particular circumstances of this case to make disclosure necessary ? Reading that question through the lens of the LAW and its jurisprudence , as we are now required to do , the following elements separate themselves out .", "CARDINAL . First , what is the nature and weight of the public interest in the confidentiality of sources ? The right of free expression enshrined in article CARDINAL is undifferentiated , but as ORG said in PERSON , ' freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a NORP society ' , and ' [ p]rotection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom ' ( paras . DATE , DATE ) . Much judicial authority in this country says the same . The news media , in consequence , enjoy in s.CARDINAL of the DATE Act a high initial level of protection , not in their own but in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . The entitlement to reverse the balance is prescribed by law , as article ORG ) requires . A required ground for doing so , founded on the no less important public interest in an effective system of justice , is present . Is it then necessary to reverse the balance ? The following elements seem to me to matter here :", "...", "\u2022 Any invasion of the protection must meet a pressing social need DATE not merely an individual one . This meets the need to counterpose CARDINAL public interest to another . Here the need , in terms of s.CARDINAL , is to enable Interbrew to restrain by court action any further breach of confidence by the source and possibly to recover damages for losses already sustained . In terms of article ORG ) it is to protect the rights of Interbrew .", "\u2022 There must be no less invasive alternative . While I would not adopt the judge 's approach of simply refusing to second - guess the view of the aggrieved parties ' solicitors , I would infer from the evidence that as much has been done as can at present be done by the use of reputable private detectives to trace the source . I can see that to demand particulars of the admittedly general assertions about this could jeopardise the exercise .", "...", "DATE . It seems to me that once the legitimacy of GPE 's intended resort to law is accepted , the relatively modest leak of which they are entitled to complain does not diminish the prospective seriousness for them of its repetition . For the media , on the other hand , the public interest in their freedom to publish is constant , and with it the public interest in the confidentiality of their sources . While I do not think that the character of the material is irrelevant as a matter of law , I agree with ORG in GPE at least to this extent , that it can not be for the court to decide how interesting or important it thinks the material is . That is for journalists and their editors . But it may follow that the more the press decide to make of a story , the greater will be the affected party 's legitimate interest in finding and suppressing its source .", "CARDINAL . What in my judgment matters critically , at least in the present situation , is the source 's evident purpose . It was on any view a maleficent one , calculated to do harm whether for profit or for spite , and whether to the investing public or Interbrew or both . It is legitimate in reaching this view to have regard not only to what Interbrew assert is the genuine document but also to the interpolated pages ; for whether they are forged or authentic , integral or added , they were calculated to maximise the mischief . To this factual extent the ' lethal cocktail ' is material , despite its legal irrelevance to the earlier stages of the inquiry . The public interest in protecting the source of such a leak is in my judgment not sufficient to withstand the countervailing public interest in letting Interbrew seek justice in the courts against the source . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicants leave to appeal , following which Interbrew required the applicants to comply with the court order for delivery up of the documents . The applicants have refused to comply . While Interbrew has instituted enforcement proceedings against The ORG , it has not pursued these proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The exercise of the power to require the delivery up of otherwise confidential information derives from the jurisdiction established by the decision of ORG in ORG [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL at page CARDINAL :", "\u201c [ The authorities ] seem to me to point to a very reasonable principle that if through no fault of his own a person gets mixed up in the tortious acts of others so as to facilitate their wrong - doing he may incur no personal liability but he comes under a duty to assist the person who has been wronged by giving him full information and disclosing the identity of the wrongdoers . I do not think that it matters whether he became so mixed up by voluntary action on his part or because it was his duty to do what he did . It may be that if this causes him expense the person seeking the information ought to reimburse him . But justice requires that he should co - operate in righting the wrong if he unwittingly facilitated its perpetration . \u201d", "CARDINAL . That power is subject to section CARDINAL of the Contempt of Court Act DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) which provides that :", "\u201c No court may require a person to disclose , nor is any person guilty of contempt of court for refusing to disclose , the source of information contained in a publication for which he is responsible , unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Prior to the proceedings in the present case , ORG had held in ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL All ER CARDINAL that the phrase \u201c the interests of justice \u201d in section CARDINAL of the DATE Act was wide enough to include the exercise of legal rights and the ability to seek protection from legal wrongs , whether or not by court action . This interpretation was later confirmed by ORG in ORG v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL WLR DATE .", "CARDINAL . In GPE , ORG granted an order compelling the ORG newspaper to reveal a source to ORG . The ORG subsequently disclosed its source as PERSON , an investigative journalist . PERSON brought new proceedings to seek an order for disclosure against Mr PERSON and applied for summary judgment on the grounds that the case was indistinguishable from that of the Mirror in the previous LOC case . PERSON submitted that the facts were materially different . ORG granted the order requested but it was overturned on appeal to ORG which held in ORG v. PERSON [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL at paragraph CARDINAL that :", "\u201c Protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for press freedom in a NORP society . An order for source disclosure can not be compatible with LAW unless it is justified by an overriding requirement in the public interest . Although there is a clear public interest in preserving the confidentiality of medical records , that alone can not , in my view , be automatically regarded as an overriding requirement without examining the facts of a particular case . It would be an exceptional case indeed if a journalist were ordered to disclose the identity of his source without the facts of his case being fully examined . I do not say that literally every journalist against whom an order for source disclosure is sought should be entitled to a trial .
