NORP The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a stateless NORP who was born in DATE . He currently lives in GPE in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Ms S. Blomqvist , a lawyer practising in PERSON . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE the applicant applied for asylum in GPE . He was not in possession of any identity papers . He claimed that he came from GPE on GPE and that his mother and sister still lived there . He invoked the general situation on GPE as his motive for seeking asylum .", "CARDINAL . Following a leading decision by ORG ( Migrationsverket ) in which he considered that stateless NORP should be granted residence permits in GPE on humanitarian grounds due to the serious situation in the region , on DATE ORG granted the applicant a temporary residence permit until DATE to give him an opportunity to prove his identity .", "CARDINAL . Upon expiry of his temporary residence permit , the applicant applied for a permanent residence permit or , in the alternative , a prolongation of his temporary permit . Without submitting any kind of documentation , he maintained that he was from GPE , where he risked persecution by the authorities because , DATE , he had written some critical articles about corruption among high - ranking persons on ORG . On DATE ORG rejected the application . It noted that the applicant had failed to establish his identity and his place of residence before entering GPE . A language analysis had shown that the applicant spoke an LANGUAGE dialect spoken by persons originally from GPE but living in GPE . Thus , although the applicant could originate from GPE , it was quite possible that he had lived in GPE before leaving for GPE . Accordingly , the ORG found that the applicant could be deported to GPE , GPE or the GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) which , on DATE , upheld ORG decision not to grant the applicant a residence permit . It found , however , that the applicant should be deported to GPE , and not alternatively to GPE or the GPE . This decision was final and the applicant was ordered to leave GPE within DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on CARDINAL occasions , the applicant requested ORG to stay his deportation . On DATE and again on DATE , the ORG rejected these requests as it found that there were no impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant was apprehended in GPE and transferred back to GPE in accordance with ORG . Upon his return to GPE , in DATE , he renewed his application for asylum and a residence permit in GPE . He maintained that he was from GPE and invoked the situation there as his motive for seeking asylum . Moreover , he stated that he had a serious relationship with a NORP woman with whom he had been living since DATE and that he had strong ties to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the applicant had still not proved his identity but that it was probable that he was from GPE or GPE . It then observed that he had invoked no grounds on which he could be considered as a refugee and that the general situation in the region was not so serious that he could be granted leave to remain in GPE solely on that basis . Moreover , as concerned his relationship , the ORG noted that the applicant could apply for a residence permit on that basis from his home country as prescribed by LAW . Lastly , it considered that the applicant had not been in GPE legally for such a long time that he could be deemed to have a closer connection to GPE than to his home country . ORG also noted that he had not invoked any health reasons . Thus , in conclusion , he could not be granted leave to remain in GPE and he was to be deported to GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and repeating that he risked persecution by the authorities on GPE because , DATE , he had written some critical articles about corruption among highranking persons on GPE . These articles had been published in various newspapers on GPE and therefore the authorities in his home country were searching for him . He further stressed that he had a very good relationship with his girlfriend and that they were planning to get married . He also submitted that he felt depressed and had been in contact with a doctor for DATE , and that accordingly it would be unreasonable to demand that he apply for a residence permit based on his relationship from his home country . Lastly , he alleged that he had no connections whatsoever to GPE and that , therefore , any plans to deport him to that country should be ruled out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG rejected the appeal . It first noted that the applicant had still not established his identity but that it was probable that he came from GPE . However , it could not be ruled out that he had lived in GPE and the examination should therefore include both countries . ORG then observed that the applicant had not been politically active in any way . Moreover , although he may have had written some critical articles in DATE about corruption among high - ranking persons on GPE , he had been able to remain in the area for DATE after the alleged articles were published without having encountered any problems . Thus , ORG found it highly unlikely that he would risk persecution for having written those articles upon return . With regard to his relationship , the court considered that he could return to GPE to apply for a residence permit on this basis from there . The court further found that the applicant 's health problems were not so serious that he could be granted leave to remain in GPE on this ground . GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) , maintaining his claims and adding that he and his girlfriend had married on DATE . His wife had CARDINAL grownup children from a previous relationship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG transferred the case to ORG for enforcement of the deportation order to GPE , or alternatively to GPE , should the former option not be possible for some reason .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , on DATE , ORG rejected a request from the applicant to re - open the proceedings on the basis of a medical certificate stating that the applicant suffered from depression and that there was a risk of suicide . ORG found that he had invoked no new circumstances of importance as all his claims had , in essence , already been examined .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant lodged yet another request that the proceedings be re - opened . He claimed that he was in very poor mental health and had made several suicide attempts . He was receiving treatment for his mental problems which was beneficial for him . However , if the treatment was interrupted , there was a substantial risk that he would again try to commit suicide . Moreover , his wife , who was a nurse , gave him much care and support and it was unreasonable to demand that he apply for a residence permit on the basis of their relationship from his home country . He submitted a medical certificate confirming his very poor and unstable mental health . He also invoked a judgment , delivered on DATE , by ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) in ORG according to which the applicant had been convicted of illegal driving and aggravated drunken driving and sentenced to probation . It appeared from the judgment that he had tried to commit suicide by getting drunk and driving his wife 's car into a road railing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to stay the enforcement of the applicant 's deportation since it was uncertain whether it was medically possible for him to travel to his home country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the ORG decided not to grant the applicant a residence permit in GPE and lifted the stay of enforcement . It first noted that it had a very limited margin to take into account factors such as an asylum seeker 's failed expectations , anxiety about returning to his or her home country and social and financial problems . Moreover , it was not the degree of severity of an illness that was decisive but whether the medical condition rendered the enforcement of a deportation order practically impossible . The ORG then considered , on the basis of several medical certificates ( see below ) , that the applicant 's state of health was serious but that he remained at home and had declined to be committed to hospital for treatment as he considered that he could cope at home . Moreover , his problems emanated from his insecure situation and wish to remain in GPE and not from a life - threatening illness . Thus , there were no practical impediments to the enforcement of the deportation order . No appeal lay against this decision .", "CARDINAL . According to medical certificates dated DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE and DATE , written by PERSON , psychiatrist in ORG , the applicant had been a patient of hers since DATE due to depression and had been prescribed antidepressants ( ORG ) . During their meetings , the applicant had kept stating that he felt disappointed and badly treated by the various NORP authorities as he had failed to find a job or get a residence permit . He had stated that he had been a successful businessman in the \u201c NORP world \u201d and wanted to get back into business . During his periods of depression , he had lost his appetite , had been unable to sleep and had been apathetic . He had become very depressed and suicidal because he considered his situation hopeless and himself worthless . Following a suicide attempt in DATE ( when he had driven his wife 's car into a road railing ) , the psychiatrist had prescribed stronger antidepressants ( PERSON ) . His wife had been a great support to him , taking care of him and watching over him .", "CARDINAL . In another medical certificate , dated DATE , by Mr PERSON , physician at ORG in GPE , it was stated that the applicant had made an emergency visit DATE to the clinic because of his depression . He had been apathetic and had suicidal thoughts due to his situation and his fear of being deported .", "CARDINAL . NORP In CARDINAL other medical certificates , dated DATE and DATE , by PERSON , chief physician at ORG in ORG , it was stated that the applicant had visited him in DATE and again in DATE . On both occasions , the applicant had been depressed , apathetic , very anxious and with constant suicidal thoughts . On the second occasion , he had also showed signs of paranoia . However , on both occasions , he had rejected an offer to be committed to a clinic for treatment as he had considered that he could cope at home even though , according to the chief physician , he had been close to being psychotic and almost eligible for being committed to compulsory psychiatric care . The chief physician concluded that , at that time , the applicant was not in a fit state to be deported .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG decided to indicate to ORG under Rule CARDINAL of ORG a suspension of his deportation to GPE or GPE .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , on CARDINAL DATE ORG decided to stay until further notice the enforcement of its decision to expel the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . Both the old Aliens Act and the DATE Act define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "CARDINAL . Chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , of the CARDINAL Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien 's health status . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien 's home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not be met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . Hence , upon entry into force on DATE of the DATE Act , ORG ceased to exist .", "CARDINAL . Where a rejected asylum seeker suffers from ill - health the enforcement of the deportation will occur only if the authority responsible for the deportation deems that the medical condition of the individual so permits . In executing the deportation , the authority in question is also able to ensure that the measures taken will be appropriate with regard to the circumstances of the particular case . For instance , if considered necessary , a special aeroplane can be chartered for the journey and arrangements can be made for medical staff and any necessary equipment to be available on board during the flight . On condition that the individual concerned consents to such measures being taken , arrangements can also be made for his or her assistance in the country of origin upon return . For example , medical records and other medical documentation can be sent in advance so that proper care can be prepared and arrangements be made for the individual to be met and taken care of by medical staff upon arrival .", "CARDINAL . Should an enforcement of an expulsion order lead to serious psychological health problems necessitating treatment in compulsory psychiatric care , the expulsion can not , under any circumstances , take place without the approval of the chief physician responsible for the care ( see , LAW of LAW ( lagen om psykiatrisk tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The provisions on family reunification relating to a spouse , registered partner or cohabiting partner etc . of a person who is resident in GPE are set out in LAW , LAW , of LAW and were given their present wording on DATE in connection with the implementation of the E C Directive on the right to family reunification ( Directive CARDINAL of DATE , hereinafter \" LAW \" ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , LAW , first paragraph of the LAW , unless otherwise provided in LAW , a residence permit shall be granted to an alien who is a spouse or cohabiting partner of someone who is resident in GPE or who has been granted a residence permit to settle in GPE . The provisions hence provide for a right to obtain a residence permit unless there are special grounds against granting a residence permit . An alien who wants a residence permit in GPE on account of family ties must have applied for and been granted such a permit before entering the country ( LAW , LAW , of the LAW . This rule was also stipulated in the CARDINAL LAW ) . An application for a residence permit may not , as a general rule , be approved after entry . However , exemptions from this rule can be made for example if the alien has strong ties to a person who is resident in GPE and it can not reasonably be required that he or she travel to another country to submit an application there ( LAW , LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL ) . An exemption may also be made if there are some other exceptional grounds ( LAW , LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL ) . The requirement that , in principle , residence permits for family members have to be granted before entry into GPE was introduced as CARDINAL of a number of measures aimed at reducing the possibilities of obtaining a residence permit by means of marriages or relationships of convenience . Subsequently , ORG and ORG have underlined on several occasions that the requirement that residence permits be obtained before entry into GPE is an important part of measures to maintain regulated immigration . Moreover , the preparatory works to LAW state that it is important that aliens staying in GPE illegally do not enjoy a better position than those who comply with decisions by the authorities to return to their country of origin in order to apply for a permit from there ( Government PERSON ) . The same requirement is found in LAW , LAW , by which most ORG countries are bound . Many NORP countries hence require that a residence permit on account of family ties be granted before entry into the country . The Directive has been incorporated into NORP law ( Government PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the exemptions that can be made according to LAW , LAW , second paragraph , point CARDINAL of LAW , the preparatory works to the provision ( Government PERSON , p. CARDINAL et seq . ) state that the main emphasis should be placed on the question of whether it is reasonable to require that the alien return to another country in order to submit an application there . Relevant elements , which may be favourable for the alien , may be whether he or she can be expected , after returning home , to encounter difficulties in obtaining a passport or exit permit and this is due to some form of harassment on the part of the authorities in the country of origin . It may also be whether the alien will be required to complete a long period of national service or service under unusually severe conditions . It may also be relevant whether the alien has to return to a country where there is no NORP foreign representation and where major practical difficulties and considerable costs are associated with travelling to a neighbouring country to submit the application there . Relevant elements , which may count against the alien , may be that he or she is staying in the country illegally , that their identity is unclear or if there are strong ties to the country of origin .", "CARDINAL . According to information from the NORP Consulate - General in GPE , its average processing time for investigating cases concerning ties to GPE is from DATE to DATE depending on where the applicant is living . In the event that the applicant is not able to come to GPE , staff from ORG can go to GPE and conduct the interview at ORG of GPE in GPE . According to information from ORG , people living in GPE and other towns on GPE are generally able to go to GPE for an interview . If instead the applicant is deported to GPE , he can apply for family reunification at ORG in GPE , where processing time for investigating a case concerning ties to GPE is DATE . Furthermore , ORG has stated that the total average processing time in such cases from the filing of an application at a NORP representation abroad to ORG decision is DATE . A decision from ORG may be appealed against to ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . The GPE ORG , ORG on GPE from DATE stated in so far as relevant :", "CARDINAL The situation in GPE remained tense with continuing strain on the NORP / ORG cease fire ...", "CARDINAL In its ORG : On Israeli Human Rights Violations in LOC dated DATE ; the NORP ORG ( PCHR ) stated that :", "\u201c ... NORP Occupation Forces ( ORG ) have continued to impose severe restrictions on the movement of NORP civilians throughout GPE , including occupied GPE . CARDINAL of NORP civilians from GPE and GPE continue to be denied access to GPE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to a report from ORG , GPE , GPE and GPE , DATE ; hereinafter \" OGN DATE \" ) , ORG reported in DATE that GPE is providing ambulatory , outpatient and inpatient services to NORP patients who access care in ORG ( PA ) hospitals , at the request of ORG . At times these services are provided in conjunction with NORP and international NGOs . GPE also provides public health laboratory services , as well as providing training programmes to NORP physicians , nurses and other health professionals . Furthermore , in DATE CARDINAL permits were granted to NORP patients and their companions to receive treatment in GPE . In addition to the public health services available and those provided by charitable and voluntary organisations , the NORP population is provided with health care by ORG and other NORP non - governmental organisations and by ORG . As regards the availability of mental health care , the following may be noted . There is one psychiatric hospital on GPE with CARDINAL beds as well as CARDINAL general hospitals with psychiatric units in GPE and Tulkarm with CARDINAL inpatient beds .", "CARDINAL . The health care system in GPE is considered to be good . According to ORG , PERCENT of the inhabitants have access to public health care , although principally primary health care ( see for example ORG report on the Situation of Human Rights in GPE , DATE , p , CARDINAL ) . CARDINAL of the inhabitants of GPE are originally NORP , the great majority of whom now have NORP citizenship , which means that they have the same rights and obligations as the \u201c NORP \u201d ( ibid . pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) . ORG ( GPE ) confirms that GPE has one of the best health care systems in the region , However the GPE further notes that GPE 's resources are strained by a massive refugee population ( PERCENT of its CARDINAL citizens are NORP or of NORP descent ) and that the needs of destitute NORP put a large burden on the country 's resources . The GPE further states that NORP and their NORP host population suffer from limited access to medical care , especially secondary and mental health care services . However , to address the needs of the NORP refugees and other vulnerable populations in GPE , the GPE is implementing assistance programmes that aim to improve the quality of primary health care , including mental health services ( see information at the GPE web site ; GPE . As regards the availability of mental health care in GPE , it should be noted that there are CARDINAL to CARDINAL clinical psychologists , CARDINAL psychiatrists ( plus CARDINAL working for the army ) and a few counsellors available in GPE . Psychosocial services offer a total of CARDINAL beds and CARDINAL outpatient clinics ( see ORG , \u201c Assessment on Psychosocial Needs of Iraqis Displaced in GPE and GPE \u201d , DATE , p , CARDINAL ) . PERSON 's public health care system is state - subsidised , but the public health care system is overburdened and provides only basic care . Many NORP citizens are enrolled in a national health insurance programme not open to foreigners , who must rely on private insurance to cover health care costs . Private insurance is expensive and frequently excludes costly treatment and surgical operations . According to the NORP authorities , NORP refugees can benefit from emergency health care regardless of their legal status . However , to receive further treatment in public hospitals they need to be residents . For this reason the majority of NORP rely on private hospitals whenever they can afford to pay . The ORG report primarily concerns the possibilities for NORP refugees in GPE to obtain mental health care . It may be assumed that the information it contains has a bearing also on the availability of mental health care for NORP living in GPE who are not NORP citizens ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
