On DATE the applicant acquired a car \u2013 a ORG CARDINAL GPE - at an auction organised by ORG . Having subsequently had certain technical defects of the car repaired , the applicant applied to ORG for registration . On an unspecified date the Director of the ORG refused to do so on the ground that the car was unfit for use and could therefore be used only as scrap - metal . After numerous entreaties of the applicant , the Director orally agreed to register the car on condition that the applicant replaced the engine and a part of the chassis . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to reimburse the costs involved in the acquisition of the new engine and chassis . On DATE ORG declined the applicant \u2019s request on unspecified grounds . Subsequently , the applicant ordered a new engine and chassis and made an advance payment in the amount of PLN CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was served with a decision of the Director of ORG refusing his request to register the car . The Director referred to the fact that the identification numbers of the engine and chassis had been forged and that that it was therefore impossible to find out who had owned car before its acquisition by the applicant . Therefore , the car could not be considered as a \u201c recovered stolen car \u201d within the meaning of FAC . CARDINAL to the ministerial LAW DATE ( \u00a7 DATE below ) , which was a prerequisite for obtaining new identification numbers . On DATE the Bia\u0142ystok Governor upheld the contested decision on the same grounds .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE the GPE - \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie District Prosecutor expressed regret for the administrative authority \u2019s refusal to register the applicant \u2019s car and remarked on the lack of consistency in the interpretation of the relevant provisions by the authorities handling the applicant \u2019s case . He also suggested that the applicant request the prosecuting authorities , in their capacity as guardians of legal order , to join administrative proceedings on his behalf .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant that pursuant to the relevant regulations a car of unknown origin could not be registered .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG refused to institute proceedings against the public servants who had issued the administrative decisions in the applicant \u2019s case , finding that they had no case to answer .", "CARDINAL . NORP In reply to the applicant \u2019s request , on DATE the ORG refused to act on his behalf , considering that the law only allowed new identification numbers to be engraved and the registration to be obtained on conditions which were not met in the applicant \u2019s case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Warszawa - \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie District Prosecutor informed the applicant that the car in question , being \u201c the subject of a criminal offence \u201d , had been handed over to ORG on the basis of a decision concerning exhibits , with a view to selling it at an auction under \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Regulation of ORG ( \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE . It found that the administrative authorities had failed to provide any reasons for their refusal of registration . In respect of the new chassis and engine identification numbers , the court noted that a conclusion as to whether \u201c the stolen car has been recovered \u201d had to be based on the final decision given either in the investigative or in the judicial proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stayed the proceedings concerning the permit to engrave new car identification numbers until the question whether the car had been \u201c recovered \u201d within the meaning of the applicable law was settled .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE to ORG , FAC expressed the opinion that , in view of the fact that ORG had been the legitimate vendor and the applicant , who had purchased the car in good faith , was its legitimate owner , there was no reason for a further delay in registering the car . In reply , ORG informed the prosecutor on DATE that there was no possibility of registering a vehicle of unknown origin , that is , CARDINAL lacking original factory numbers .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the applicant dated CARDINAL DATE ORG considered that there were no grounds on which disciplinary proceedings could be instituted against the Bia\u0142ystok prosecutors . All the same , he acknowledged that the case was \u201c a complex one . \u201d It could not be denied that the applicant was a legitimate owner of the car which he had purchased from a legitimate vendor . In the prosecutor \u2019s view , the difficulty in registering the car stemmed from deficiencies in the legal provisions in specifying the necessary conditions that had to be fulfilled for a car to be registered . These conditions were defined by the Regulation of the Minister of Transport and Maritime Economy of DATE ( \u00a7 CARDINAL below ) . He further observed that , according to ORG opinion expressed in the judgment of DATE , a final decision given either in the investigative or in the judicial proceedings , stating that the car had been stolen , should provide a sufficient basis for its registration ( \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG informed the applicant that there were no grounds for instituting criminal proceedings against the public servants at ORG , because it had not been shown that when acting in the applicant \u2019s case they had abused their powers . As for the charge of lack of diligence , this could not be proceeded with , given that the applicant had not suffered pecuniary damage which was sufficiently serious , that is in an amount exceeding CARDINAL average salaries .", "On the same date ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s civil claim against ORG for a declaratory judgment . The court considered that the applicant \u2019s ownership was not in dispute . Nonetheless , the claim to establish that the car met the legal requirements for its registration could not be examined by a civil court . This would constitute an unacceptable way of controlling the lawfulness of an administrative decision , and it was only ORG which had jurisdiction to do so .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested ORG to consider the possibility of granting the applicant , by way of exception , a permit for engraving new car identification numbers . It was argued that in all likelihood the car had been stolen by someone in obscure circumstances to the detriment of an unknown person and subsequently handed over to the tax office to be sold . The fact that the applicant could not be granted the permit to have new car identification numbers engraved had adversely affected his property rights in a manner which , give could not be accepted . This request was later refused by a decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE given by ORG ( \u00a7 DATE above ) , considering that since the applicant had not specified his claim , the question whether the civil courts had jurisdiction to entertain his case remained open .", "By a decision of DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s civil claim on the same grounds as those relied on in its first decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s new claim against ORG for a declaratory judgment , considering that a claimant in declaratory civil proceedings could request the court to determine the existence of a right or of a legal relationship , but that it was not open to the claimant to seek findings of fact in such proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings , instituted at the applicant \u2019s request , concerning the theft of the car and the forging of its identification numbers , on the ground that the perpetrator of the offence was unknown .", "By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused ORG request to resume the stayed proceedings concerning the permit for engraving new car identification numbers ( \u00a7 CARDINAL above ) , considering that the original factory car numbers had not been conclusively established . On DATE ORG lodged an appeal against this decision with ORG , submitting that since a preliminary question concerning the theft of the car had already been determined , the administrative authority was obliged to register the car . By a decision of DATE the ORG allowed the appeal and quashed this decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again refused to grant the applicant a permit for engraving new identification numbers , concluding that the car could not be considered \u201c recovered by the owner or by an insurance company \u201d since its factory numbers and the original owner had not been established in the course of the investigation . The applicant and ORG appealed . The Prosecutor , in his appeal of CARDINAL DATE , referring to the failure to establish the original owner of the car and its factory numbers , expressed the opinion that FAC . CARDINAL to the Order of the Minister of Transport and Maritime Economy of DATE did not lay down such a requirement for registration and that therefore the first - instance organ had failed to interpret it correctly .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the impugned decision and referred the case back to the first - instance organ for re - examination , observing that the request should be examined in the light of a new legal situation which had in the meantime changed as a new ORG had been enacted ( see LAW below ) .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of DATE ORG consented to the engraving of new car identification numbers and , as a consequence , registered the applicant \u2019s car .", "CARDINAL .
