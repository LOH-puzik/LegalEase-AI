On DATE the applicant was arrested on suspicion of car theft and subsequently remanded in custody . On an unspecified later date he was charged with selling drugs . The charges concerning car theft were severed to be dealt with in another set of proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a certain ORG , a minor , was questioned by the police in respect of the car theft . On DATE JH was questioned by the police in respect of the charge of selling drugs DATE and DATE . He admitted that he had been selling drugs which he had received from the applicant . The questioning took place in the presence of a psychologist .", "CARDINAL . In her report dated DATE the psychologist observed that ORG \u2019s cognitive processes had functioned at the level commensurate to his age . She noted that his interpretation of the facts could have been slightly changed on account of his fear of the consequences of his acts . There could also have been minor inconsistencies with regard to the amount of drugs sold by the applicant to other persons . She also noted that ORG had willingly presented the facts related to the drug transactions involving him and other persons .", "CARDINAL . JH was heard by the police as a juvenile suspect but no preventive measures were applied . The charges against him were to be examined separately by ORG of ORG . That court ordered an inquiry to be carried out at his home . On DATE the report of the inquiry was submitted to ORG . According to the report , ORG had left GPE for the GPE on DATE and his parents did not know his address or telephone number . ORG had not informed his parents of his plans to leave GPE and he had merely called them from the airport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG requested the police to establish ORG place of residence . On DATE the police informed the court that ORG had been in GPE as from DATE and that he was expected to return to GPE in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to institute proceedings against ORG . It had regard to the fact that he had been in the GPE since DATE and in those circumstances it would be impossible to apply to him the measures provided in LAW ( ustawa o post\u0119powaniu w sprawach nieletnich ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecution filed a bill of indictment against the applicant with ORG . The applicant was charged with offering drugs to a minor , PERSON , and with CARDINAL counts of selling drugs to ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG DATE and DATE . The prosecutor requested the court to hear CARDINAL witnesses , including GPE .", "CARDINAL . There were CARDINAL other defendants in the case ( ORG , ORG , ORG , MONEY and ORG ) who were also charged with drug trafficking offences . CARDINAL of them , ORG and ORG , were additionally charged with car theft . On DATE the trial court severed the charges against MG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG scheduled hearing dates for CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE . PERSON was summoned to testify on DATE . On DATE JH \u2019s mother informed the trial court that GPE resided in the GPE where he was attending school . She produced photocopies of the plane tickets . On DATE the police confirmed the above and informed the court that the date of ORG \u2019s return to GPE was unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court again summoned PERSON to give evidence on DATE . The police were asked to serve the summons or to establish the date of his return to GPE . On DATE the police informed the court that the summons could not be served since ORG was still in the GPE and the date of his return remained unknown .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court again summoned PERSON to testify at the hearing . It also requested police assistance in establishing the date of his return to GPE . The police informed the court in their CARDINAL letters of DATE that ORG was in GPE . They notified the court that the date of his return to GPE was still unknown . They also reported that , according to the information obtained from ORG \u2019s parents , ORG would remain in the GPE for DATE as he was attending school .", "CARDINAL . The trial court held CARDINAL hearings as scheduled and CARDINAL additional hearing on DATE . At the hearing held on that date the prosecutor requested the court to read out the statements PERSON had made to the police . The applicant and his counsel objected . They argued that those depositions were the main incriminating evidence against the applicant and that they wanted to put questions to PERSON at the hearing . The trial court decided that ORG \u2019s statements should be read out pursuant to LAW ORG since the witness was permanently abroad and his date of return to GPE remained unknown . It noted that in those circumstances it was not possible to grant the applicant \u2019s request to hear PERSON at the hearing .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE . It convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of PLN CARDINAL,CARDINAL . It further ordered him to make a payment of ORG MONEY to an association assisting drug addicts .", "CARDINAL . The trial court established that the applicant had sold drugs as alleged in the bill of indictment . In this respect it relied on the statements of ORG who had been heard by the police as a juvenile suspect . JH stated that the applicant had sold drugs to ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG in his presence . In his evidence , he described in detail the factual circumstances of those transactions and distinguished between transactions at which he had been present from those of which he had only heard .", "The trial court considered ORG \u2019s evidence reliable , having regard to its detail , certainty and consistency . The reliability of his evidence was enhanced by the fact that ORG had known all the defendants well and had had no motive to incriminate them . Furthermore , the trial court considered that ORG evidence was objective since he had not concealed any facts which might have put him in a negative light as he admitted that he had been selling the drugs for the applicant to ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG and that he had stolen the car . On DATE together with the CARDINAL co - accused ORG and ORG had stolen a car which indicated that they had trusted each other .", "CARDINAL . The applicant pleaded not guilty and decided not to testify . He stated that he had not sold or offered drugs to other persons and had not possessed them . He refused to answer any questions from the court and the parties .", "CARDINAL . According to the trial court , the credibility of the statements given by ORG was supplemented by other evidence . Those statements were not the only incriminating evidence as they were confirmed in certain respects by evidence from ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG . Furthermore , ORG \u2019s statements were not undermined by the findings of the psychologist who had assisted in his questioning .", "CARDINAL . In respect of witness ORG , the trial court considered credible the statements which he had given during the investigation . When questioned at that stage he stated that ORG had received drugs from the applicant and had been selling them to others . ORG had also confirmed that ORG had offered drugs to his friends . That evidence corroborated the relevant statements of ORG . ORG had also confirmed ORG \u2019s statement that the applicant had proposed to manufacture drugs in ORG \u2019s garage . During the trial , ORG changed his version of events and denied that the applicant had supplied drugs to ORG , but the trial court refused to accept his change of testimony as ORG had offered no explanation for it .", "CARDINAL . KJ was a friend of ORG and the applicant . The court found reliable the evidence she had given during the investigation , namely that she had bought drugs from GPE , ORG and ORG , and that she had offered and taken amphetamine with the applicant . The latter fact contradicted the applicant \u2019s assertion that he had had nothing to do with drugs . At the trial , ORG denied those statements . However , the trial court noted that she had not explained the reason for the change in her testimony and considered credible her original statements . Furthermore , ORG testimony during the investigation was corroborated by ORG \u2019s statements . ORG denied that the applicant had sold her drugs . However , the trial court did not find this evidence reliable , having regard to the consistent statements of ORG and to the lack of a motive on the part of ORG to incriminate the applicant and ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The trial court considered credible the statements of ORG that he had purchased drugs from ORG . The latter confirmed that he had been selling drugs received from the applicant to others persons , including ORG . ORG was also buying drugs from the applicant and selling them to others as confirmed by the statements of ORG and ORG . In view of those statements , the court rejected ORG \u2019s subsequent denial at the trial that he had anything to do with drugs .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed . He argued that the trial court had breached criminal procedure by reading out the depositions of ORG which had been made during the latter \u2019s questioning by the police . He also submitted that the trial court had relied on ORG \u2019s statements although they had not been corroborated by other evidence in the case . The applicant lastly claimed that the court had erred in its establishment of the facts of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held a hearing and upheld the trial court \u2019s judgment for the most part . It amended it only to the extent that it deleted CARDINAL count of selling drugs by the applicant to ORG since ORG had stated that he had not witnessed that particular transaction .", "CARDINAL . Otherwise , ORG found that the trial court had correctly established the facts , basing itself on a comprehensive assessment of all the evidence . It had explained why it had considered ORG \u2019s statements credible and why it had disregarded the applicant \u2019s evidence since he had limited himself to denying the charges against him . It stressed that the applicant had not put forward any rational arguments to contest the duly substantiated findings of the trial court .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that ORG had described precisely various details concerning the purchase of drugs from the applicant , such as the type of drugs , price , quantity , dates of transactions , form of payment , etc . It underlined that ORG \u2019s version of events , namely that he had been selling drugs received from the applicant and offering them to his friends , had been confirmed by ORG and ORG during their questioning in the course of the investigation . The fact that ORG , when heard at the trial , had changed his earlier version of events could not be considered credible as he had not given a plausible explanation for this change . ORG had also confirmed ORG \u2019s statement that the applicant had proposed to manufacture drugs in ORG \u2019s garage but that proposal had been refused . The fact of ORG \u2019s offering drugs to friends had also been confirmed by ORG and ORG during their questioning in the course of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . ORG accepted the findings of the trial court that GPE , being a close acquaintance of the applicant , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG , had objectively described the applicant \u2019s actions and that he had not been in conflict with the applicant . In his statements , ORG had not concealed facts which incriminated him . He had consistently stated that ORG , ORG , ORG , ORG and ORG had purchased drugs from the applicant in his presence . He distinguished those situations from transactions at which he had not been present . ORG also noted that before his questioning as a juvenile suspect , ORG had been advised that he had the right to refuse to make statements .", "CARDINAL . As regards the lack of cross - examination of ORG , ORG stated :", "\u201c The allegation of the breach of procedure by the trial court is not sustainable . The appeal setting out the above allegation does not specify which provisions were breached ; it would appear from the grounds of the appeal that it concerns LAW ORG , which the trial court relied on when reading out the statements of ORG at the trial , and that the court took the decision to read out the statements of that witness after having established objectively and unequivocally that the precondition specified in LAW ORG had been met ( his uninterrupted long stay abroad ) , and then only just before closing the trial . The defendant [ the applicant ] does not dispute that the circumstances specified in LAW ORG in respect of witness ORG were correctly ascertained , admitting expressly that the witness went away and has lived abroad . In this procedural situation the trial court had the right to read out the statements of that witness , a minor , given at the time when he was questioned as a suspect ( the fact that the trial court did not invoke LAW CARDINAL of the ORG does not have any ility of that evidence ( reading out a NORP statements ) , the circumstances in which it was obtained and the credibility of those statements by corroborating them with other evidence obtained in the case , as already explained . The parties and the defence had an opportunity to react directly to those statements [ of witness ORG ] .... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed a cassation appeal with ORG . He stated that the trial court had read out ORG depositions and by doing so had prevented the applicant from putting questions to that witness . He alleged a breach of his defence rights , invoking Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG and LAW ( d ) of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant argued that the trial court and subsequently ORG had based their verdict exclusively on ORG evidence and had disregarded the evidence of ORG , ORG and ORG as being contradictory to the former evidence . In respect of ORG , the applicant argued that his statements given at the pre - trial investigation stage had to be carefully analysed since he could not confirm them at the hearing as he had been undergoing drug therapy .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claimed that the courts had not used all available means to secure the attendance of ORG at the trial . Furthermore , ORG had been treated leniently by the authorities as he had been allowed to leave the country despite his admission that he had been selling drugs . Lastly , the applicant informed ORG that ORG had returned to GPE and that he could have been questioned in respect of the charges against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON was arrested by the police for drunken driving in GPE . On DATE he was questioned by ORG . On DATE the ORG convicted him of drunken driving in summary proceedings and sentenced him to a suspended prison term and a fine . It also banned him from driving for DATE . ORG was further placed under the supervision of a court officer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s cassation appeal as manifestly ill - founded . It held , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c When formulating them [ arguments in the cassation appeal ] the applicant completely disregarded LAW ORG , which entitles the parties to lodge a cassation appeal exclusively against the final judgment of the second - instance court . Nonetheless , in the present case the author of the cassation appeal repeated the same assertions which he had raised earlier in an ordinary appeal , making only such modifications which supposedly complied with the requirements specified in LAW ORG . The same circumstances , which had earlier served as the basis for an assertion that the trial court had made errors in respect of its factual findings , were now being used to formulate arguments of a procedural nature . However , the assessment of their content and the reasons for the cassation appeal leads to the conclusion that as a matter of fact the author intended again to attempt to undermine the credibility of particular sources of evidence and to challenge the factual findings made on that basis . However , in the light of the binding regulation such an attempt in cassation appeal proceedings can not be effective . ( ... )", "It can not be overlooked that the arguments of the cassation appeal in the present case are in fact directed against the trial court \u2019s judgment . It was the trial court which assessed the credibility of particular sources of evidence and determined the quantity of drugs which had been trafficked ; it was also ORG which made use of the measure provided in LAW ORG in order to disclose statements made by the then minor PERSON ( ... )", "The issue of the correctness of admitting and relying on ORG \u2019s statements was also subject to ordinary review by the second - instance court . ORG could not infringe LAW ORG since it did not make use of the measure provided in it . Even now the appellant has not substantiated [ his contention ] that the restrictions on the opportunity to release depositions or statements by persons listed in that provisions were breached . ( ... ) However , the digressions as to the possibility of taking evidence from ORG , and the conducting of evidentiary proceedings with the participation of the defendant [ the applicant ] at the current stage of the proceedings , at a time when the case has finally been determined and no breach of the law ( still less a manifest breach \u2013 Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG ) has been substantiated , do not fit within the framework of the model of cassation appeal proceedings . The repeated reliance on all those circumstances additionally reinforces the conclusion that the arguments presented in the cassation appeal constituted nothing but an attempt to circumvent the obligation stemming from LAW ORG , which stipulates that a second - instance judgment shall be the subject of a cassation appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE Code of Criminal Procedure ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) provides :", "\u201c The accused has a right to be present during the taking of evidence in the proceedings . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG reads as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If a witness has without good reason refused to testify , or has given testimony different from DATE , or has stated that he does not remember certain details , or if he is abroad , or a summons can not be served on him , or if he has not appeared as a result of obstacles that could not be removed or if the president of the court has declined to summon him pursuant to LAW [ i.e. because upon the lodging of the bill of indictment the prosecution has asked that the records of his testimony be read out at trial ] , and also when a witness has died , the records of his previous statements may be read out , [ regardless of whether they ] have been made in the investigation or before the court in the case in question or in another case or in any other procedure provided for by the law .", "CARDINAL .
