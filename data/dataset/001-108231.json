The applicants in the above CARDINAL cases , listed in the appendix , are relatives of the victims of the hostage - taking in the \u201c NORP \u201d theatre in DATE in GPE and/or were themselves among the hostages .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the above CARDINAL cases are disputed between the parties . Their submissions may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On TIME DATE a group of terrorists belonging to the NORP separatist movement ( over QUANTITY people ) , led by Mr B. , armed with machine - guns and explosives , took hostages in the \u201c NORP \u201d theatre in GPE ( also known as the \u201c ORG \u201d theatre , from the name of a musical comedy which was formerly performed there ) . For DATE CARDINAL people were held at gunpoint in the theatre \u2019s auditorium . In addition , the theatre building was booby - trapped and CARDINAL suicide bombers were positioned in the hall among the hostages . Another group of terrorists occupied the theatre \u2019s administrative LOC .", "CARDINAL . NORP Over DATE several journalists and public figures were allowed to enter the building and talk to the terrorists . The terrorists demanded the withdrawal of NORP troops from GPE and direct negotiations involving the political leadership of the federal authorities and the separatist movement . Following those talks the terrorists released several hostages and accepted some food and drinking water for the remainder , while continuing to insist on their demands .", "CARDINAL . It appears that some of the hostages managed to maintain occasional contact with the outside world through their mobile telephones . Some even managed to talk to journalists .", "CARDINAL . The Government claimed that hostages who tried to escape or resist were shot by the terrorists . Thus , in TIME DATE Ms NORP asked the terrorists to release the hostages . She was taken out of the auditorium and executed by an unknown terrorist . Mr ORG , CARDINAL of the hostages , was wearing a military uniform . He was shot by CARDINAL of the terrorists on DATE . On DATE . was first beaten by the terrorists in the theatre auditorium and then taken out and executed . Mr PERSON tried to escape , but the terrorists fired at him , and he was then taken out , beaten and executed . While firing at Mr PERSON , the terrorists wounded another hostage , Mr PERSON , who later died in hospital .", "CARDINAL . The applicants indicated that Mr V. and Ms NORP had not been in the building during the show , but entered it some time later at their own initiative . They referred to the statements by several former hostages , in particular Ms Gubareva and Ms GPE . They also relied on the conclusions of the investigator in the report of DATE , stating that Ms NORP and PERSON ORG had tried to penetrate the building from the outside . As to Mr PERSON , he was among the hostages from the very beginning , but the investigator had failed to establish where , when and in what circumstances he had been shot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG officers apprehended Mr Talkhigov , an alleged accomplice of the terrorists , who had spoken to them by telephone and had given them information about the situation outside the theatre .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the director of the ORG made a public statement on television following a meeting with President PERSON . He promised to keep the terrorists alive if they released the hostages .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the local branch of the All - GPE ORG received information about the hostage - taking .", "CARDINAL . Shorty afterwards the authorities created a \u201c crisis cell \u201d ( operativniy shtab , literally \u201c operative headquarters \u201d ) under the command of Mr P. , the deputy head of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . The crisis cell was located in the premises of ORG no . CARDINAL , situated in the vicinity of the theatre building . It included representatives of various ORG services and organisations .", "CARDINAL . As follows from the materials submitted by the parties , ORG was responsible for the evacuation of the hostages and for clearing away rubble if the building collapsed . From DATE several teams of rescue workers were stationed in the vicinity of the theatre building . ORG placed various heavy machines , such as bulldozers , excavators , cranes , dump trucks , etc . , QUANTITY from the theatre building .", "CARDINAL . The GPE ORG ( MCUMT ) , and FAC ( Zashchita ) at ORG of GPE were in charge of medical assistance to the hostages and their relatives . Mr ORG . , the Head of ORG of GPE and a member of the crisis cell , coordinated the efforts of the MCUMT , ORG , ambulance teams , and city hospitals . The FAC was functioning in crisis mode , so all of its workers were permanently on duty .", "CARDINAL . From DATE CARDINAL ambulances and CARDINAL brigade of FAC medics with a special medical bus were permanently on duty near the theatre . According to the ORG \u2019s submissions , \u201c CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL teams of FAC and CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ambulances were permanently stationed in the vicinity of the theatre building \u201d . Another brigade of ORG medics and psychologists provided aid to the relatives of the hostages in the building of ORG no . CARDINAL . In total , the psychologists examined CARDINAL cases and ordered CARDINAL hospitalisations .", "CARDINAL . The patients of ORG ( the medical facility closest to the theatre ) were relocated to other hospitals which were not earmarked to receive individuals from the rescue operation . The staff of ORG was reinforced with surgeons and emergency physicians from the Sklifosovskiy and Botkin Hospitals . CARDINAL additional reanimation units and CARDINAL theatres for surgery were made available . By DATE the admission capacity of ORG had been increased to CARDINAL beds . According to the Government \u2019s submissions , \u201c CARDINAL persons were relocated from ORG to other city hospitals \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The heads of the city hospitals concerned with the evacuation plan , ambulance stations and other relevant medical services were summoned for a briefing and required to secure reinforcement of staff on duty and an emergency work regime . The authorities designated several hospitals which would admit the hostages . The hospitals were divided into CARDINAL priority groups . The Government did not explain how those CARDINAL priority groups were defined . Besides ORG no . CARDINAL ( the closest ) , those were ORG nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE ( the next closest hospitals ) , ORG nos . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , ORG , the ORG , and Children \u2019s Hospitals nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL , and CARDINAL . Between CARDINAL and DATE Mr PERSON . , the Chief PERSON of GPE , visited some of those hospitals and checked whether they were ready to admit rescued hostages . He had been instructed by the crisis cell to check whether the hospitals were ready to accept patients with missile and explosion wounds . The hospital officials were required to free up wards for the hostages , to ensure that the hospital staff were ready to arrive at short notice and that additional equipment , emergency treatment rooms and medical supplies and bandages were prepared . The admission capacity of most of the hospitals was increased . Thus , Hospital no . CARDINAL reported that it was prepared to admit CARDINAL patients , including CARDINAL in a critical state . Hospital no . CARDINAL reported that it was prepared to admit up to CARDINAL patients . There is no information about the admission capacity of the other hospitals , but it appears that it too was increased . The ORG brigades were informed which hospitals were designated to participate in the rescue operation , and how many places they would have available for the hostages .", "CARDINAL . In TIME of DATE , at CARDINAL TIME , the NORP security forces pumped an unknown narcotic gas into the main auditorium through the building \u2019s ventilation system . The applicants insisted that both the terrorists and the hostages were capable of smelling and seeing the gas . TIME , when the terrorists controlling the explosive devices and the suicide bombers in the auditorium lost consciousness under the influence of the gas , the special squad stormed the building . Most of the suicide bombers were shot while unconscious ; others tried to resist but were killed in the ensuing gunfire .", "CARDINAL . Soon afterwards Mr ORG . , a member of the crisis cell with responsibility for public relations , made a statement to the press . He informed journalists that the terrorists had executed CARDINAL hostages and wounded several more and that , in response , the special squad had stormed the building and killed some terrorists and arrested others . He did not mention the use of the gas .", "CARDINAL . As a result of the operation the majority of the hostages were released ( over CARDINAL people ) . The exact number is unknown since , following their release , not all of the hostages reported to the authorities . However , a large number of hostages were affected by the gas ; according to information gathered by the investigative authorities by DATE , CARDINAL hostages died : CARDINAL died on the spot ( CARDINAL according to the report of DATE ) , including QUANTITY persons who were shot ; CARDINAL died in the course of evacuation and transportation to hospital ; and CARDINAL persons died in the emergency rooms of various hospitals . These figures were later adjusted or revised \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below , see also the conclusions of the official investigation summarised in paragraph CARDINAL . Apparently , the discrepancy in figures is mainly due to the fact that different methods for calculating the number of victims were applied by various ORG authorities and that not all the necessary information ( cause of death , time of death , etc . ) was recorded in the hospitals and/or morgues . Many of those who survived continue to suffer from serious health problems . For instance , CARDINAL of the applicants , PERSON , a former hostage , was taken in an unconscious state to the intensive therapy unit of ORG no . CARDINAL , where she underwent treatment until DATE . DATE she was hospitalised again . The applicant PERSON , who was also amongst the hostages , lost her hearing . The applicants submitted medical records in respect of several former hostages from hospitals where they underwent medical treatment after release .", "CARDINAL . The applicants alleged that the evacuation of hostages from the theatre building had been chaotic : the semi - naked bodies of unconscious hostages were piled up on the ground outside the building , where , according to a report by ORG , the temperature was PERSON Some of them died simply because they were laid on their backs and subsequently suffocated on their own vomit or because their tongues were blocking their airways . According to the applicants , there were not enough ambulances , so the hostages were transported to hospitals in ordinary city buses without the accompaniment of medical staff and without any assistance from traffic police to facilitate their rapid arrival at the hospitals . The medical staff in the hospitals were not equipped to receive so many victims , had not been informed of the properties of the narcotic gas used by the security forces and did not have appropriate equipment . In DATE after the events no information was provided about the number of victims , their names and the places where they had been taken . The ORG relatives had to call the city morgues to find out where the corpses were being held .", "CARDINAL . The authorities disputed that view . According to the Government , at TIME the crisis cell informed the ambulance stations involved in the operation that CARDINAL reserve ambulance teams should be prepared for the evacuation of the hostages . CARDINAL a.m. CARDINAL ambulance teams received an order to go to the scene . In addition , CARDINAL hearses were dispatched . All medics who were on duty in the vicinity of the theatre were ordered to gather at the main entrance to the theatre . At QUANTITY a.m. ambulances started to arrive , so that the medics who were already there received reinforcement . The coordination of the medics on the spot was carried out by the head of the GPE branch of ORG . The victims were divided into several groups , depending on their condition , on the ground near the main entrance to the theatre . Medical assistance to the victims had been adequate : those in a serious condition received \u201c symptomatic therapy \u201d including artificial lung ventilation . The witnesses who showed signs of an emetic reflex were placed face down . Injections of Nalaxone were given by the special squad officers within the building . Information about those who had already received injections was transmitted by the special squad officers to the medics . Those who had not been injected with Nalaxone in the building received it after the evacuation . Nalaxone was on the list of pharmaceuticals recommended for the ambulances and ORG teams . The victims were transported in ambulances and city buses accompanied by ambulances ; those victims who were in a coma or other serious condition were transported in the ambulances . The evacuation was fully completed TIME after the liberation of the hostages . All victims were dispatched to city hospitals nos .

The majority of the victims were transported to ORG no . CARDINAL and city hospital no . CARDINAL , which were the closest medical institutions . In the hospitals\u2019 reception areas all of the victims were divided into CARDINAL groups , depending on the gravity of their condition . The hospitals immediately received reinforcement from the leading medical schools , and the best specialists in toxicology and psychiatry were sent to provide assistance .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s account , the most serious cases were characterised by the following symptoms : \u201c dysfunction of the central nervous system , impairment of consciousness , from torpor to deep coma , inhibition of tendon reflexes , pupillary and corneal reflexes , breathing dysfunction of a central type , with a frequency of CARDINAL times per minute , as well as manifestations of mechanical asphyxia and airway aspiration obstruction , [ and ] glottidospasms . These symptoms were accompanied by cyanosis of the visible parts of the airway mucus and of the skin , which disappeared after the emptying of the airways , reinstatement of their patency and artificial lung ventilation . Low arterial pressure and tachycardia were also noted . In the most serious cases [ the medics observed ] bradycardia , bradypnoea to the extent of apnoea , non - effective blood circulation and cardiac arrest , as well as clinical death . \u201d The medium - gravity patients were suffering from \u201c impairment of consciousness in the form of torpor and the loss of orientation , fever - like hyperkinesias , miotic pupils . As to the cardio - vascular system , [ the doctors ] noted tachycardia , nausea , [ and ] repeated bile vomiting \u201d . The Government also described the symptoms of the victims whose state was characterised as relatively satisfactory .", "CARDINAL . As to the medical procedures administered , the Government mentioned \u201c suppressing dysfunctions of the vital organs , liberation of the upper airways , artificial lung ventilation , oxygenotherapy , correction of metabolic dysfunctions caused by hypoxia \u201d . In the ORG \u2019s words , this therapy had quick positive dynamics . The Government further described the effects which the therapy had on the victims , and the results of the laboratory examination of the ORG blood and tissues , which showed that the victims developed a \u201c post - hypoxia condition with manifestations of multiple organ failure of various degrees of gravity \u201d . According to the Government , that condition was caused by the effects of a \u201c composite chemical compound of a general narcotic action \u201d , which were aggravated by \u201c prolonged psychological stress , hypoxia , dehydration , prolonged immobility , and chronic diseases \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the ORG \u2019s submissions , in toto rescue services evacuated from the theatre CARDINAL hostages , including CARDINAL dead bodies . CARDINAL persons were dispatched to the hospitals , CARDINAL arrived at the hospital in a pre - agonal or agonal state or were in a state of clinical death and could not have been saved . Out of CARDINAL persons who were hospitalised , CARDINAL died , including QUANTITY persons who died from causes unrelated to the use of gas . Consequently , the death rates in the hospitals amounted to PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the MCPO \u201d ) opened a criminal investigation into the events of DATE . The case was attributed no . DATE . The prosecution qualified the facts as \u201c a terrorist act \u201d and \u201c hostage - taking \u201d ( Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the MCPO formed an investigation team which included officials working in ORG , the ORG , and ORG ( police ) . The investigation team was headed by investigator PERSON from the MCPO . On DATE a judge of FAC , at the request of the investigator , ordered the wiretapping of a telephone line which had allegedly been used by an accomplice of the terrorists . Also on DATE a judge of ORG authorised the wiretapping of a number of other telephone lines allegedly used by the terrorists .", "CARDINAL . On various dates in DATE the applicants ( as well as the relatives of other victims ) were given the status of injured parties . In that capacity they obtained access to certain materials of the case file , namely the medical files of the victims to whom they were related . Despite their requests , however , they were not allowed to make copies of those materials from the case file or to disclose their content to third persons , including independent medical experts . Furthermore , the applicants were not allowed to contact the experts who had examined the bodies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE investigator PERSON requested the MCPO to extend the time - limit for the investigation in case no . DATE . The request contained a further action plan for the investigative team ; it included measures to obtain further details of the terrorist attack itself , an examination of the explosives and the bodies of the deceased hostages , identification of the terrorists , and so on . The plan did not include consideration of the rescue operation as such .", "CARDINAL . On DATE investigator PERSON proposed a new action plan for the \u201c concluding stage of the investigation \u201d . The plan provided for further investigative measures aimed at identification of the dead terrorists and their possible accomplices , examination of explosives and firearms used by them , questioning of the victims and examination of objects found on the scene of the crime . According to the action plan , by DATE CARDINAL rescue workers and CARDINAL medical workers had been questioned , CARDINAL medical histories of victims had been obtained , and CARDINAL post - mortem examinations had been carried out . The investigator ordered that an additional expert examination be conducted into the cause of death of CARDINAL victims ( those who had not died of bullet wounds ) . The investigator also ordered that additional witnesses be questioned . However , it appears that the purpose of that questioning had no relation to the rescue operation itself .", "CARDINAL . At the admissibility stage the Government produced some documents from case no . DATE . The documents include witness statements by those who participated in negotiations with the terrorists ; witness statements from several former hostages ; witness statements from officials from the public health service and rescue service who had been involved in the rescue operation ; witness statements from the head doctors of the hospitals which admitted the former hostages ; witness statements from the field personnel directly involved in the evacuation of and medical assistance to the hostages ( rescue workers , medics from the GPE Centre MCUMT , ambulance medics , medics in the city hospitals ) . The questioning was carried out by investigators from ORG , the MCPO and the ORG . The ORG also produced a report on the examination of the explosive devices used by the terrorists , a report by ORG on the organisation of medical aid to the hostages , a summary of the medical records of the deceased hostages , results of forensic medical examinations of the deceased hostages , copies of official correspondence and decisions by the investigative bodies , and some other documentary evidence . Following the ORG \u2019s decision on admissibility of the case the ORG submitted further documents from case no . DATE and several other \u201c parallel \u201d investigations related to the terrorists and their accomplices . The documents produced by the Government , in so far as relevant and readable , are summarised below .", "CARDINAL . Mr ORG . , a PERSON Deputy and an ethnic NORP , testified that he had spoken with the terrorists in the theatre building . According to PERSON Asl . \u2019s testimony , the leader of the terrorists told him that he was prepared to die ; he was very nervous and was not open to dialogue .", "CARDINAL . Mr Yastr . , another ORG official , testified that Mr B. , the leader of the terrorists , had proposed to the authorities that several hostages be released in exchange for a partial withdrawal of NORP troops from GPE . He had also requested that the relatives of the victims organise a public march on FAC in support of withdrawal of the NORP troops . He had further requested that the federal authorities appoint a representative for talks with the separatists , someone who would be entitled to take political decisions . Among such persons he had named PERSON GPE . , the former commander of the federal troops in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Yav . , a Duma Deputy , testified that the terrorists had initially demanded the immediate withdrawal of GPE troops from GPE , but they had then put forward other demands with regard to the federal forces , namely that the latter stop using artillery and air raids and cease \u201c clean - up operations \u201d , and that direct telephone negotiations be organised between President PERSON and PERSON , the president of the separatist government . The terrorists had told PERSON Yav . that they were prepared to die , and that they knew that they would not leave the city alive . Mr Yav . understood that if the requirements of the terrorists were not met , they would have been prepared to start executing the hostages .", "CARDINAL . Ms LOC . , a journalist , testified that \u201c NORP \u201d ( another leader of the terrorists ) put forward the following demands : the withdrawal of federal troops from any district of GPE , and a public statement by President PERSON that he would stop the hostilities . The terrorists had agreed to accept food and water ; some time afterwards food and water had been supplied .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigators questioned CARDINAL former hostages about the situation in the main theatre auditorium where they had been held . The materials of the case file contain a memo prepared by the investigator recapitulating their testimonies . In addition , the parties submitted several full - text written testimonies by the former hostages . These documents , to the extent that they are relevant , can be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . Most of the hostages testified that there had been CARDINAL terrorists in the theatre building . Initially the terrorists allowed those hostages who had mobile phones to call their relatives and ask them to hold a \u201c peace rally \u201d against the war in GPE and require the Government not to storm the building . Later the terrorists confiscated the mobile phones , threatening execution for non - compliance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE one of the hostages , a young man , tried to escape from the auditorium and started to run ; the terrorists fired at him , then took him outside and executed him . While shooting at the escapee , the terrorists seriously wounded another person . At a certain point CARDINAL of the leaders of the terrorists ordered the shooting of another person whom he considered to be an agent of the security forces , and who had penetrated the building from the outside .", "CARDINAL . It is clear from the ORG statements that most of them took the ORG threats seriously . Some of them , however , noted that they feared storming by the security forces more than the terrorists themselves .", "CARDINAL . When the gas penetrated the auditorium Mr B. ( the leader of the terrorists ) ordered that the windows be smashed for better ventilation . Those terrorists who were in the auditorium started to shoot around ; they appeared to be aiming at the windows . The women terrorists sitting among the public did not try to blow up the explosives ; they covered their faces with handkerchiefs and lay on the floor with the hostages . Within TIME most of the people in the auditorium were unconscious .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator commissioned an expert report on various technical aspects of the terrorist attack . In particular , the investigator sought to establish the destructive capacity of the explosives planted by the terrorists in the building . The examination was entrusted to ORG experts . The experts established that the terrorists had had MONEY of various explosives ( in ORG equivalent ) ; and that the latter \u2019s simultaneous detonation would have killed or seriously injured most of the hostages in the auditorium through blasts or shrapnel , but it was unlikely that the detonation would have led to the collapse of the entire building . The position of the stationary explosives and the placement of the \u201c suicide bombers \u201d within the auditorium guaranteed maximum efficiency in the case of detonation and showed the ORG technical expertise .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr ORG . , the Head of ORG of GPE , submitted a report concerning the organisation of the evacuation of and medical assistance to the hostages . The report stated that CARDINAL ambulances and CARDINAL ORG teams had been dispatched to the scene immediately ; in addition , city hospitals took measures to free places in preparation for the eventual arrival of hostages . At CARDINAL a.m. on DATE CARDINAL medical emergency teams were sent to the site of the events . The hostages were evacuated by rescue workers and the special - squad officers in the \u201c face - up \u201d position . Coordination of the evacuation was ensured by the workers of ORG of GPE . The first CARDINAL ambulance teams arrived at the scene at QUANTITY a.m.", "CARDINAL . In view of the GPE symptoms , they were given injections of ORG , an \u201c antagonist of narcotic analgesics \u201d . These injections were administered within the theatre building by the special - squad officers . However , ORG was only slightly effective when administered to those who had been in a state of hypoxia for a long time . The rescue workers had been instructed to turn the victims face down if they showed signs of vomiting . There was sufficient Nalaxone available to the doctors , since it was part of the standard first - aid kit of an emergency team . Mr ORG . further testified that the majority of the hostages received an injection of Nalaxone inside the building . The injections had been administered by the special - squad officers ; the officers informed the medics which hostages had not received an injection ; that group then received an injection from the medical emergency teams . Victims in a coma were transported in the ambulances ; the others were transported in city buses , but always accompanied by medics .", "CARDINAL . Most of the victims had been dispatched to ORG ( no . CARDINAL ) and ORG no . CARDINAL . The evacuation of CARDINAL hostages had taken TIME and TIME . CARDINAL people died in hospital .

City Hospital no . CARDINAL admitted CARDINAL patients DATE ( all were brought in ambulances ) , and CARDINAL between CARDINAL.CARDINAL and TIME ( CARDINAL in ambulances ) .", "CARDINAL . Witness PERSON . , the Chief PERSON of GPE , testified that he had been responsible from DATE for preparing ORG no . CARDINAL to receive hostages . He had checked the staffing situation : the hospital had received support staff from other medical institutions , including surgeons and emergency physicians from ORG . He had also verified the necessary equipment . CARDINAL emergency operating tables had been prepared . On CARDINAL and DATE he had checked the readiness of ORG . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE . The CARDINAL hospitals ( nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) had been prepared to admit up to CARDINAL patients in a critical state . However , there was no decision as to the exact number of hostages to be dispatched to each hospital . He had learned about the storming of the building at TIME from the mass media . At TIME he arrived at FAC , where he started to prepare additional emergency teams to be sent to the site of the events . At TIME he arrived at FAC . By that time the victims had already been divided into several groups and the doctors had identified the most serious cases . He examined the victims personally ; in most cases they were suffering from cardiac and respiratory insufficiency , aggravated by dehydration , \u201c aeleontropic \u201d ( sic ) disorder , high ferments and \u201c myoglobin \u201d levels , and shock . He had learned from the mass media that the security forces had used gas . The victims had received , in the first place , artificial lung ventilation , cardiac support , etc . TIME he had left for Hospital no . CARDINAL , which had admitted a large number of the victims . As to possible treatment , he testified that it had been difficult to prepare any antidote in advance , given the situation of the hostages at the time of the storming of the building . Nalaxone was a specific antidote for opiate drugs and was widely used from the beginning of the operation . The fact that the victims were suffering from opiate poisoning had been evident from their symptoms . However , the use of Nalaxone had not been effective , as it had not produced any tangible positive results .", "CARDINAL . Witness GPE . , director of the LAW , stated that she received information about the storming of the building on DATE at TIME That information was immediately transmitted to several city hospitals . At CARDINAL a.m. she received an order to mobilise CARDINAL ambulances from the nearest medical emergency units . At CARDINAL a.m. the ORG received information about the storming . The third ORG brigade ( no . DATE ) was ordered to move to the area near the theatre . That brigade was supposed to indicate the route for the ambulances . PERSON . herself stayed in the hospital . At CARDINAL a.m. the third brigade received an order to approach the theatre building and to start the evacuation . The mass evacuation of hostages started at CARDINAL a.m. in ambulances and city buses . The evacuation ended at CARDINAL a.m. As a result of their training the emergency teams were well prepared for such situations , and they had all the necessary drugs , including Nalaxone . On the whole , the evacuation and medical assistance to the victims were well organised . Since there was a risk of explosion , it was impossible to treat the hostages near the building . The lack of information about the formula of the gas was irrelevant in the circumstances , and there had been no need to use military medics .", "CARDINAL . Witness N. , another ORG official , testified that he had been on duty from DATE . He had not received any special briefing ; however , he had information about the plan to evacuate the hostages . On DATE at CARDINAL TIME he had participated in the evacuation of CARDINAL wounded people from the theatre building to the nearest hospital . At TIME , after the beginning of the operation , he ordered that CARDINAL ambulances be positioned a few blocks away from the theatre . At TIME he was informed that the building had been cleared of the terrorists and that the ambulances could start the evacuation . They had arrived on site at CARDINAL a.m. Circulation near the building had been hindered by the heavy trucks which had been blocking the road . Witness N. had been responsible for placing the hostages in the city buses and dispatching them to hospitals under the convoy of escort vehicles . The initial examination had shown that the victims were suffering from gas poisoning ; immediate assistance had consisted in removing the hostages from the building , opening their breathing passages , injecting PERSON and restoring normal heart and lung functions .", "CARDINAL . Witness Krt . , the chief doctor of ORG no . CARDINAL ( which was the closest to the theatre ) testified , inter alia , that on DATE of the storming they had received a machine for artificial lung ventilation . However , they expected that the hostages to have \u201c traumatic injuries \u201d . The hospital had had CARDINAL beds available , with a potential of CARDINAL beds . The ground floor of the hospital had been allocated for emergency treatment , operating tables had been arranged and the doctors had prepared \u201c materials for bleeding patients \u201d .

However , it was irrelevant whether or not there was information about the kind of gas to which they had been exposed .", "CARDINAL . Witness Skh , the chief emergency physician of ORG no . CARDINAL , testified that the first patients had been delivered by ambulance to his hospital at TIME At QUANTITY a city bus had arrived with CARDINAL victims . All of them showed signs of acute respiratory insufficiency : they were unconscious , their external respiration was deficient and they had yellowish skin ( cyanosis ) . The victims had been escorted by CARDINAL uniformed men with machineguns , and a man in plain clothes with a video camera . The victims had been sitting or lying on the floor of the bus ; bodies were piled on top of each other . Mr PERSON . had taken CARDINAL persons out of the bus himself ; then other people had arrived and the people were taken into the hospital . CARDINAL out of the CARDINAL were already dead . Mr Skh . described them .", "CARDINAL . Witness Ar . , the chief doctor of Hospital no . CARDINAL , testified that on DATE he had arrived at work at QUANTITY The first ambulance with victims was already there . The main arrival of victims had been at TIME , when CARDINAL ambulances , each carrying CARDINAL or CARDINAL people , and CARDINAL buses arrived at the hospital . It was later established that the hospital had admitted CARDINAL former hostages , including CARDINAL who had been in a state of clinical or biological death when they arrived at the hospital .

Several of these are in medical use as analgesics for severe chronic pain , and as anaesthetics , and it is known that the margin between the effective dose for unconsciousness and the lethal dose is very small . Death is usually by respiratory depression . PERSON is also known as a drug of abuse , and many fatalities have been recorded among recreational users . Since all known phentanyls have similar , and very narrow , safety margins , fatalities from respiratory depression should have been anticipated .", "Second , even if the chemical agent itself was safe , fatalities should have been anticipated as a result of asphyxiation from airway obstruction consequent upon sudden collapse from a seated or standing position . Some lethality or permanent injury should also have been anticipated as a result of aspiration of vomit , as vomiting is a common side effect of opioids .", "I make no judgment on the wisdom of using an anaesthetic compound under the circumstances faced by GPE during this tragic event .

Further , in his view , many of the \u201c multi - factor \u201d findings that the official report cited could not have contributed to the victim \u2019s death , because they are agonal changes seen only after the body had suffered terminal circulatory collapse as a result of a failure to breathe because of the effects of the special substance . In his opinion , pre - existing conditions would not have contributed significantly to the lethal effects of the special substance . Of the findings that existed prior to the introduction of the special substance , none would have significantly affected the victim \u2019s chance of survival . Even the most severe of those findings ( the erosive gastritis and loss of CARDINAL cc of blood ) , would not have been sufficient to compromise his blood pressure or circulation , particularly as he was confined and did not need to exert himself .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON claimed further that some of the alleged pre - existing conditions could not be verified from the available record , and even if present would have been trivial . He compared the forensic histological study of DATE and a repeat study report , and concluded that their findings were contradictory . He noted that the \u201c repeat histological study \u201d contained similar findings to the other CARDINAL autopsy cases which were provided for his examination , namely the finding of chronic encephalitis and chronic meningitis . He said that these were very uncommon diseases , and it was a rare coincidence that QUANTITY persons attending the same theatre on the same date suffered from them . Dr PERSON further challenged the conclusions of the report concerning the fatty changes discovered in the victim \u2019s liver : he concluded that the victim \u2019s liver had not been compromised by fatty change , and , even assuming so , the function of the liver was unimportant to the effect of PERSON and its related compounds on the human body .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON further stated that the effects of the PERSON family of drugs are well known . At moderate doses those drugs suppress pain , and at high doses they cause a sleep - like state , and at higher doses they cause a coma . All opiates also suppress the urge to breathe in a dose - dependent way . When the individual is unconscious breathing may slow below the point that is needed to maintain sufficient oxygen in the blood to sustain normal body functioning . Even if breathing continues at a reduced rate , the relaxation caused by opiates can cause the neck and tongue to become limp and result in an occlusion of the airway . This positional asphyxia is a particular risk if the recipient is sitting upright . In addition , when opiates ( and particularly PERSON - type drugs ) are given rapidly , this causes muscular rigidity , which can stop breathing entirely . The spasm of rigidity can result in violent pitching of the trunk . Such a forward pitching might well have caused a blow to the forehead from the theatre seat ahead .", "CARDINAL . Dr PERSON noted that the clinical picture of no \u201c medical \u201d deaths for DATE , and then scores within TIME of the release of the special substance strongly implicated the special substance in the subsequent deaths and disabilities . The report concluded that \u201c the findings of [ the victim \u2019s ] autopsy are fully consistent with a death caused solely by an overdose of an opiate such as PERSON or a related derivative , received from an aerosol delivery during the special operation \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicants produced copies of press interviews with former hostages , rescue workers , bus drivers , etc . Thus , Ms Pvl . , a former hostage , stated in an interview with PERSON that she had managed to get out of the main auditorium of the theatre by herself . She , together with other hostages who had been in relatively good shape , had first been taken to hospital , but the hospital in question refused to admit them . They had returned to the theatre , where they had been put in a bus and taken to another hospital ( ORG no . CARDINAL ) . The driver of the bus had not known where to go and had had to ask for directions all the time . They had taken TIME to arrive at the hospital .", "CARDINAL . Another participant in the events , PERSON ( who gave only his first name ) , stated in an interview with PERSON that he was an ambulance doctor . At TIME he had received an order to go to the theatre . However , his vehicle had been stopped at the cordon by police because they had not yet received an order to let the ambulances through . This had delayed them for TIME . The traffic near the theatre had also been slow because of the heavy machines parked there . Some of the hostages had already been taken out of the building . An open box with syringes and LOC was lying nearby . Somebody shouted : \u201c Everyone , give injections ! \u201d Those hostages who had received injections were not identified by a mark : as a result , some of them had received CARDINAL or QUANTITY shots of Nalaxone , which was a fatal dose . There had been no time to carry out artificial respiration because of the risk of explosion . His car had transported CARDINAL unconscious people to ORG , but it had been difficult to get close to the entrance because of the vehicles parked on the street . CARDINAL beds were ready in the hospital , but the medical staff had not been prepared to cope with such a flow of patients . As a result , that hospital had admitted CARDINAL patients . In the meantime , the special - squad officers had been piling up bodies in the city buses . The bus drivers , mostly from outside GPE , had not known where to go . When the first ambulance arrived at FAC , there had been nobody to meet the ambulance team and dispatch the patients to the appropriate departments . PERSON . , the head of the ORG group , testified that CARDINAL person had been mistakenly taken for dead .", "CARDINAL . Mr Sng . , in an interview with PERSON , submitted that he had seen that the bodies in the CARDINAL buses which arrived at FAC were piled up on the floor . In another interview published in the same newspaper , witnesses Mr Shb . and Mr PERSON . described the conditions of transportation of the victims . Both were drivers of the buses used to transport the hostages to the hospitals . They stated that , in spite of all the efforts to clear up the area , traffic near the building had been slow , especially because of the ORG cars parked on the streets . Once the bodies were loaded in the bus , policemen had told the drivers to follow the ambulance . When the buses arrived at ORG , the hospital did not have enough staff to take the bodies out of the buses immediately . They had first taken care of the people brought in the ambulances , then of those in the buses .", "CARDINAL . One of the former hostages , Ms ORG , described the conditions in the main auditorium of the theatre . In particular , she submitted that the female suicide bombers had never left the auditorium . CARDINAL of them , who had been sitting nearby , always had a detonation device in her hands . She told PERSON that the biggest explosive device would be sufficient to \u201c blow up CARDINAL auditoriums like this CARDINAL \u201d . Another former hostage , Ms GPE , confirmed that the suicide bombers had not let the detonators out of their hands . Witness Mr PERSON stated that his relatives had been held in the theatre . He testified about the role of PERSON Talkhigov , who had established contact with the leader of the terrorists . Ms ORG , who had also had relatives among the hostages , said that the first official account of the operation had been very optimistic ; there had been no information about any victims . Both she and Mr PERSON , whose daughter died in the theatre , testified how difficult it had been to receive any information about the former hostages . Similar testimony was given by PERSON ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicants produced a report prepared by the All - Russia Centre of Disaster Medicine at ORG ( Zashchita ) . The ORG \u2019s experts noted that the use of phentanyl had been justified in the circumstances . They described the medical effects of phentanyl and its possible side - effects . The experts also noted that phentanyl could be dangerous for people suffering from asthma , hyper - reaction , arterial and brain hypertension , hypoxia , and respiratory distress . The report noted that the majority of the deceased hostages suffered from different pathologies which led to their death . The report further stated that the various services ( rescue workers , medics ) involved in the rescue operation had acted in a coordinated manner . Almost all the victims had received injections of Nalaxone ; all the victims in a critical state had been transported in ambulances and had received artificial respiration and \u201c syndrome therapy \u201d . The report noted , inter alia , that the effectiveness of the medical aid had been lowered by the following negative factors : ( CARDINAL ) no information on the use of a chemical substance ( CARDINAL ) absence of a \u201c specific antidote \u201d for the chemical substance used ; ( CARDINAL ) NORP problems with simultaneous evacuation of the victims outside the building ; ( CARDINAL ) impossibility of using stretchers inside the building ; ( CARDINAL ) NORP problems with the circulation of ambulances near the building . The report also noted the high concentration of the gas , which had led to instantaneous death [ in some cases ] .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date Mr GPE . , a Member of ORG , requested the MCPO to conduct an inquiry into the evacuation process and medical assistance to the hostages . He alleged that the authorities had acted negligently , and that it would have been possible to avoid human losses by providing more adequate first aid to the gas victims on the spot and in the hospitals . Mr GPE . submitted materials in his possession to the investigation team , namely a report by an expert team set up by the ORG political party , and several video recordings made at the scene of the events immediately after the building had been cleared of the terrorists ( copies of the report and video recordings were submitted to the ORG by the applicants ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the MCPO refused to entertain the investigation . Investigator PERSON noted that the documents produced by PERSON GPE . were not properly signed or certified , and that they were tainted with various procedural informalities . As to the video recordings , they had been made from such a distance that it was impossible to reach any decisive conclusions . Nevertheless , based on those videotapes the investigator concluded that \u201c the victims had been transported in different postures , particularly \u201c on their backs \u201d , and they had been placed before the entrance of the building pending further medical assistance . [ The videotape showed ] that the victims received injections or assisted respiration . There was no evidence that there had been any hindrance to the circulation of the transport by which the former hostages had been evacuated \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Investigator PERSON further related the testimony of several witnesses ( see below , the outline of the witness testimony collected by the investigative team ) . The investigator established that neither PERSON , the director of the LAW , nor Mr ORG . , the Head of ORG , had been aware of the time and methods of the rescue operation ; they had not been informed about the intended use of the gas due to secrecy considerations . However , in the circumstances , and given the information available to them , they had acted in the best possible way . Most of the people ( CARDINAL persons ) had died in the theatre building ; only a few had died in hospital . The investigator concluded that the above officials , as well as other ORG officials responsible for medical assistance to the hostages , were not guilty of negligence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE , one of the applicants , complained to ORG ( the ORG ) about the conduct of the investigation proceedings . He sought a more thorough examination of the cause of his brother \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date Mr PERSON asked the MCPO to disclose the post - mortem medical examination report on his brother \u2019s body , in order to conduct an alternative medical examination of the causes of his death . By a letter of DATE the MCPO refused to give permission for disclosure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON asked the MCPO to enlarge the scope of the investigation and examine the lawfulness and expediency of the use of gas by the security forces . On DATE he repeated his request for disclosure of the post - mortem examination report . On DATE the MCPO refused to investigate the conduct of the operation by the security forces and to give permission for disclosure of the medical report .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON again complained to the ORG about the inadequacy of the investigation . He maintained , in particular , that the investigator had refused to examine the course of the rescue operation , specifically the use of a potentially lethal gas , and the failure to provide assistance to the hostages after their release . He also complained that he had no access to the materials of the case and that he was unable to participate effectively in the proceedings . The applicant \u2019s complaint had been referred by the ORG to the MCPO without an examination on the merits . The applicant challenged before the courts the refusal of the ORG to entertain his complaint , but the court ruled that Mr PERSON \u2019s petition was not a proper criminal - law complaint which would require an inquiry . That judgment was upheld on appeal by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON asked the prosecution authorities to allow him to participate in Mr PERSON \u2019s case as an injured party , but this was refused on DATE .

The investigator further noted that PERSON had not caused any harm to the applicant ; furthermore , ORG was considering whether it was possible to allow the relatives of the deceased hostages to participate in Mr PERSON \u2019s trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr GPE asked the MCPO to obtain information from the ORG , which had coordinated the rescue operation , about the nature and content of the gas used by the authorities .
