On DATE the ORG temporarily appointed the applicant \u2019s mother as her guardian so that she could represent her daughter in the above proceedings .

As regards the main disease ( sch[izophrenia ] ) , we have not observed productive psychotic symptoms for DATE , but her behaviour and functioning has lately been compromised with so called deficiency symptoms which impede a more structured therapeutic process to a significant degree .

She is presently receiving therapy . Her latest hospitalisation was in DATE . She is presently receiving ORG and GPE . She sells environmentally - friendly carrier bags . She neither wishes to be placed under guardianship nor does she wish to have her mother as her guardian , for private reasons . She is presently DATE pregnant and ever since she learned of this she has not taken any drugs . Most lately she has been taking pot but no heavy drugs . She is planning to terminate the pregnancy . She does not feel good on GPE , she feels depressed and in particular it bothers her at work . She has finished elementary school but has never been employed . She went to GPE when she was DATE with a group of people . She now lives in a flat owned by her mother . She lives alone since her mother lives with her new husband . However , her mother is paying the bills and the rest she earns herself . It is true that she attempted suicide by [ swallowing ] pills , most recently in DATE . She is aware that she has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia . \u201d", "In view of the opinion given by the medical expert and the fact that the applicant was undergoing psychiatric treatment , the court stayed the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant gave birth to a daughter , A.", "CARDINAL . NORP In his letter to ORG , a psychiatrist of ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c ... we consider it necessary that the proceedings for divesting the patient of her capacity to act be resumed because her behavioural disorder has become exacerbated lately owing to her uncontrolled intake of psychoactive substances by which she has endangered her own safety and in particular the safety of her child . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the court resumed the proceedings and on DATE paid a visit to the applicant \u2019s home , in the presence of the applicant and her mother as her guardian , a judge conducting the proceedings and her secretary , a representative of the ORG and a psychiatrist . The relevant parts of the report of the visit read as follows :", "\u201c The [ applicant ] in the company of her mother and child is met at the LOC . The representative of the LOC states that a decision to place the child in foster care was issued and that the [ applicant ] \u2019s mother was appointed as carer . The [ applicant ] states that she agrees to that as well as to being placed under guardianship in the best interests of her child since she is aware that she is unable to care for the child or for herself . However , she asks whether she can apply to have her capacity to act restored if her condition improves . In the meantime she has twice been admitted to hospital but does not see any results and does not know what to do with herself . From time to time she says that she might go back to GPE to earn some money . It is true that she has been taking drugs , though rarely and only pot and also larger quantities of GPE together with the prescribed therapy . In fact , she is not working , she is mostly at home caring for the child . Only after being asked by her mother and the representative of the ORG does she admit that she is still receiving company at home and that she gave some kitchen cupboards to ORG because she did not like them ( the mother says that she sold them ) . The father of the child , living in the same building , occasionally visits her and the child , but she has no committed relationship although DATE she terminated another pregnancy . Although she expresses a wish to do any job , she admits that so far she has taken no steps to that end . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court also ordered a psychiatric assessment of the applicant \u2019s mental condition . The assessment was carried out by the psychiatrist present at the visit to the applicant \u2019s home . The conclusion of the report drawn up on DATE read as follows :", "\u201c ... The patient suffers from a chronic mental illness with progressive tendency .", "Addiction to opiates has also been fixed and motivation for abstention is weak . Prognosis quoad sanationem is exceptionally unfavourable .", "The patient is unable to protect herself or her rights and interest and might endanger the rights and interests of others .", "I propose that she be entirely divested of the capacity to act . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

Accordingly , she has to be entirely divested of her capacity to act under section CARDINAL of LAW . \u201d", "The applicant did not appeal against that decision , and it became final on DATE . An ex lege consequence was that the applicant was also deprived of her parental rights although the decision to divest the applicant of her capacity to act did not state it expressly . The court appointed her mother as her guardian . Following a request made by the applicant \u2019s mother , on DATE the applicant was placed under the guardianship of GPE , an employee at the LOC .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG in order to have her capacity to act restored . On DATE the court asked ORG to make an assessment of the applicant \u2019s mental condition . The relevant parts of the report drawn up by a different psychiatrist on DATE read as follows :", "\u201c ... Psychiatric expertise in this case commenced in DATE when the patient answered the ORG \u2019s invitation . However , during the first interview she showed transparent psychosis with delusional elements and disjointed breathless speech , and when an attempt was made to carry out a urine test for psychoactive substances the patient did not appear at the interview scheduled for DATE . ...", "The second interview was held on DATE at the time of her hospitalisation in ORG , unrelated to these proceedings , and being the result of the evident exacerbation and bad condition of the main illness . The patient was hospitalised on DATE . During the present interview , despite the therapy administered , just the same as during the interview held in DATE , she manifests florid psychosis with all elements of schizophrenic psychosis . Paranoid manic ideas , relational delusions as well as delusions of persecution and bizarre manic ideas are dominant . Her interpretation of reality , of herself and others is completely distorted . [ The patient ] represents a typical phenomenon of derealisation and depersonalisation . Her emotions are engaged only with regard to her manic perception ; otherwise she is emotionally cold and aloof . Emotional resonance is lacking during the interview . Her overall behaviour has a manic quality . There is no doubt that her everyday functioning is also determined by the above - described psychopathological perception . ...", "In my opinion the problems associated with the intake of addictive substances , those being cannabis , are at the time being of secondary importance . She took other psychoactive substances only experimentally and occasionally and her psychotic picture , clinically manifested for a long time , can not be associated with it . However , it is clear that her previous intake of cannabis had a role in forming her behaviour , possibly even in inducing her psychotic behaviour and her overall clinical picture .", "In comparison to the previous psychiatric assessments , her psychopathology , that is to say her clinical picture of schizophrenic psychosis became more pronounced , delusions are now barely susceptible to any corrections , dislocation of the thought process is noticeable , emotional coldness and aloofness , loss of the reality test , utmost lack of critical insight towards herself . Owing to her psychopathological drives she is aggressive , hostile and paranoid towards others .", "In these circumstances I consider that the conditions for restoring the capacity to act to X do not exist . On the contrary , the psychopathological reasons which led to her being divested of the capacity to act are now even more conspicuous and more numerous . Owing to her mental disturbances ( schizophrenia ) the patient is still not able to look after her personal needs , rights and interests and moreover she is endangering the rights and interests of others . Therefore , I propose that the court maintain [ its decision ] that she be entirely divested of the capacity to act and placed under guardianship .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE , the applicant objected to the above assessment and requested a new one . The second psychiatric assessment carried out by ORG of ORG supported the first one . The relevant parts of the report drawn up by a psychiatrist , PERSON , on DATE read as follows :", "\u201c ...", "Mental status : conscious , uncertain about time , well oriented in space , auto and allopsychic orientation preserved . Contact is easily established , she answers questions without latency . Psychomotorically tense , worried about the outcome of the proceedings . Affected behaviour . Basic disposition slightly uneasy . Emotionally distant . Thought flow regular in its form , in content [ includes ] description of previous manic experiences and sensory delusions , currently without florid psychopathological deviations . [ She ] denies delusions and none are perceived . Her intellectual and mnestic capacities are devoid of strong deviations . Her will - instinct dynamism is preserved . She is neither aggressive nor suicidal .", "CARDINAL . Opinion", "The patient ... has been suffering for DATE from chronic mental illness , schizophrenic psychosis . In addition , as is commonly found with such an illness , she is also an addict , she has been consuming various opiates and even DATE her abstinence can not be established with certainty . She has been hospitalised on CARDINAL occasions . The [ medical ] documentation and the information obtained from the patient both show that there was no single period of systematic clinical monitoring after her release from hospital or a sustained period of social functioning . Therefore , we can fully agree with the above assessment of our colleagues who gave their opinion of the patient \u2019s mental health and agree that it is good for her not to have her capacity to act restored .", "There has been no improvement of her clinical picture or her social functioning in relation to the opinion expressed at the latest assessment , which is understandable given the nature of her disorder , i.e. chronic mental illness .", "CARDINAL . Conclusion", "[ The applicant ] is suffering form schizophrenic psychosis of paranoid disposition and in addition is still consuming opiates , which altogether indicates that the disorder , which is in any case chronic , has also been progressing and renders X incapable of taking care of her interests , rights and responsibilities , so that there is no ground for restoring her capacity to act , of which she has been divested since DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
