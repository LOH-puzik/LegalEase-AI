The applicant was born in DATE and prior to the events in question he had been living in GPE . He is currently serving a prison sentence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant was arrested and detained in GPE following a request for his extradition ( quoting ORG ) by the NORP authorities , pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by ORG as a ORG .", "CARDINAL . The arrest warrant had been issued on the basis of an allegation that the applicant had in GPE conspired with another person or persons in GPE to transport drugs to GPE .", "CARDINAL . While detained in GPE , the applicant , through his legal counsel , lodged proceedings in GPE contesting the legality of the arrest warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , while he was in GPE , the applicant , through his legal counsel , requested ORG to re - examine the lawfulness of his arrest on the ground that it had not been competent to issue the warrant and that GPE did not have jurisdiction to try the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected both claims . It held that the facts which formed the basis of the charges against the applicant amounted to a crime falling under the NORP authorities\u2019 jurisdiction and that in the referral stage ( \u201c rinviju \u201d ) , it had been competent to issue the warrant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant complained under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention . He maintained that his arrest in GPE had occurred consequent to an arrest warrant which was unlawful on the grounds , first , that ORG did not have jurisdiction on the facts as alleged . According to section CARDINAL of LAW ( hereinafter \u201c FAC ) , the NORP courts had jurisdiction over foreigners acting outside NORP territory only in cases specifically provided for in law and this could not be extended by means of interpretation . There was no specific law and none of the legal provisions cited in the arrest warrant ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( f ) of the LAW and ORG ( f ) of ORG ) referred to the alleged facts . Secondly , the applicant claimed that the warrant had been issued by an authority which was not competent to issue it . Moreover , he complained that ORG which had been requested to examine speedily the lawfulness of his arrest did not satisfy the requirements of LAW in so far as , according to section CARDINALA of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , only the prosecution had a right of appeal , not the accused . He requested the court to uphold the alleged violations , revoke the arrest warrant and the consequential request for extradition , and to grant him compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG partly upheld the applicant \u2019s claims . It held that the arrest warrant of CARDINAL DATE should be rescinded as the court issuing it had acted ultra vires . Indeed , ORG in its referral stage had no competence to issue the arrest warrant , even more so since the issuing of such warrant had not been requested by the Attorney General and such action did not fall within the ambit of LAW witnesses ; therefore the applicant \u2019s arrest was devoid of any legal basis and contrary to LAW and the applicant should accordingly be released . Moreover , it held that ORG when examining the lawfulness of the arrest warrant did not comply with the requirements of LAW in so far as it granted the Attorney General ( hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) an \u201c appeal \u201d and no equivalent remedy to the applicant . ORG granted the applicant compensation amounting to CARDINAL NORP PERSON ( MTL \u2013 approximately MONEY ( ORG ) ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , it held that according to the CC the NORP courts had jurisdiction over any individual who committed a crime expressly stated in law even if such crime had been committed outside GPE . In the present case there was no doubt that the relevant laws , namely section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of the LAW and section CARDINAL A ( CARDINAL ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of ORG ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , which were similarly worded , covered crimes considered as such in GPE , notwithstanding that they had occurred outside GPE . While subsection ( e ) covered only persons who were NORP citizens or residents , subsection ( f ) covered any person in GPE or outside the territory of GPE , and was not a follow - up to the previous subsection ; therefore it did not carry the same limitations . Had the legislator wanted to limit subsection ( f ) he would have done so explicitly but no such qualification had been made . Further , nothing else provided reason to believe that subsection ( f ) had to be read as a continuation of subsection ( e ) ; indeed , the use of the word \u201c or \u201d suggested that the contrary interpretation applied . Moreover , since subsection ( f ) particularly contemplated crimes against ORG and which were to the detriment of NORP society , it was plausible to infer that there was no qualification to the subsection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed requesting that his arrest be declared unlawful on the additional ground that GPE lacked jurisdiction to try a NORP national , who was not a permanent resident in GPE , for acts committed outside GPE and that the alleged conspiracy conferred jurisdiction solely on those who had acted on or from NORP soil . Moreover , he complained that the sum granted by way of compensation was too low in view of the fact that he had been under arrest since DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , on DATE ORG informed ORG by e - mail that the warrant had been declared unlawful . However , in line with the ORG \u2019s interpretation , ORG was also informed that the judgment was not final and had no effect until the appeal , yet to be lodged , had been decided .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the ORG lodged a cross - appeal .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the applicant \u2019s legal counsel had informed the NORP authorities of the judgment in favour of the applicant and had requested the applicant \u2019s release on this basis . According to the Government , on DATE a NORP court decided that the applicant \u2019s release was a matter to be decided on the basis of NORP law without any reference to NORP law . The applicant was not released .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , pending the main constitutional proceedings , on DATE , the applicant filed another application with ORG requesting the execution of his release according to the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . He claimed that according to NORP law , namely section CARDINAL of ORG ( hereinafter \u201c COCP \u201d ) , a judgment declaring an arrest unlawful was immediately enforceable , notwithstanding any pending appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG filed a reply making reference to LAW ( hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d ) , submitting , inter alia , that section CARDINAL of the COCP was not applicable to situations such as the present where a person was detained in a foreign jurisdiction under the law of that jurisdiction . Moreover , although the applicant had so requested , the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had not ordered the cancellation of the extradition request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant limited his ancillary claim lodged on DATE to the applicability of section CARDINAL of the COCP , thus de facto withdrawing his request for release under these proceedings in favour of a more generic request on the applicability of the law . ORG upheld the applicant \u2019s request stating that the judgment at issue was indeed provisionally enforceable in terms of section CARDINAL ( b ) of the COCP in so far as it provided remedies against unlawful arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , dealing with the main proceedings , delivered judgment on the applicant \u2019s appeal and the ORG \u2019s cross - appeal . It revoked the first judgment in so far as it had found inter alia a violation of LAW , and in so far as it had ordered the applicant \u2019s release . It ruled that the arrest warrant was null and void , but only on the ground that ORG in the referral stage ( \u201c rinviju \u201d ) had not been competent to issue the warrant and that consequently the arrest was unlawful and in violation of LAW . However , GPE , his release could not be ordered by the court . Furthermore , in its view , the arrest warrant had been validly grounded in law . Notwithstanding the general provisions of the ORG , particularly section CARDINAL A , which might have provided otherwise , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of the LAW and section CARDINAL A ( CARDINAL ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of ORG prevailed , according to section CARDINAL of the ORG , given that they were special laws . Nevertheless , ORG could not usurp the function of ORG , which was the only court competent to decide on the matter of jurisdiction . Having regard to the fact that the unlawfulness was solely due to a procedural defect , it found the compensation granted by the first court to be adequate and confirmed the sum . It further held that the parties were to bear their own costs and advised that a new warrant under section CARDINAL V of the ORG could be issued and would be perfectly legal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was granted bail by the NORP authorities with the obligation to report DATE to a police station . His passport was impounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was re - arrested by the NORP authorities on the basis of a new request by the NORP authorities , but as a continuation of the previous extradition proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Audiencia Nacional in GPE confirmed the applicant \u2019s extradition to GPE . On DATE the applicant was extradited to GPE to stand trial .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of ORG of DATE , and by the judgment of ORG of DATE confirmed by ORG judgment of DATE , it was held that ORG had the necessary jurisdiction over the facts of which the applicant was accused . The latter judgment found the applicant guilty of the said charges . The applicant has been in prison ever since .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant , who at the time was under house arrest in GPE , also introduced another application with the ORG with further complaints regarding later stages of his proceedings in GPE ( application no .
