According to the first applicant , after her admittance and preliminary checks , the gynaecologist in the hospital ordered her to be transferred to theatre for a Caesarean section . She was asked to write down names for her future child on a piece of paper . The first applicant was subsequently transferred to theatre and a Caesarean section was performed on her . During the operation , the first applicant was sterilised by tubal ligation . This was the applicant \u2019s second delivery , and also her second delivery by Caesarean section .", "CARDINAL .

The first applicant submitted that she had not been given any further details about the delivery , nor was she told that she had undergone tubal ligation and that she had been sterilised .", "CARDINAL . The next morning she was approached by the doctor treating her , who came into her room and asked her to sign a document . The first applicant was told that she had to sign the document because she had undergone a Caesarean section and all women who had Caesarean sections had to sign it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant was transferred to a hospital in PERSON due to an inflammation as a post - surgery complication . On DATE she underwent further surgery due to a serious infection and sepsis . This operation was considered life - saving . During the operation the doctors performed a hysterectomy on the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant first learned that she had been sterilised during her second delivery , while reviewing her medical files with her lawyer on DATE . The medical file contained a form entitled \u201c Request for authorisation of sterilisation \u201d . The form had been filled in using a typewriter . It was dated DATE and had been signed by the first applicant .", "CARDINAL . DATE form contained the decision of the district sterilisation committee at ORG dated DATE . This decision approved the first applicant \u2019s sterilisation . It indicated that the sterilisation was required for medical reasons , that the applicant had CARDINAL children , that she had earlier given birth by Caesarean section , and that she had a small pelvis . The conditions laid down in the CARDINAL Sterilisation Regulation had been met in relation to the applicant \u2019s sterilisation . The decision was signed by the president of the committee , the district medical specialist on the issue and the secretary to the sterilisation committee .", "CARDINAL .

The first applicant has been living in constant fear that her partner will leave her because she is not able to bear him any more children .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant was sterilised in FAC on DATE . The sterilisation was performed on her during her second delivery by Caesarean section .

When the second applicant \u2019s partner learned that she would not be able to have another child due to the sterilisation , he left her . Due to her inability to have more children , her social status in her community has fallen and , as a result , it was very difficult for the second applicant to find a new partner .", "CARDINAL .

The document states that there were \u201c medical reasons \u201d for the operation and that the applicant had already had CARDINAL children .", "CARDINAL . With a view to describing the overall situation and context in which they had been sterilised , the applicants submitted that they had received inferior treatment during their stay in ORG . In their view , racial prejudice on the part of medical personnel had played a significant role in the quality of the treatment they received .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the applicants stated that they had been accommodated separately from nonRoma women , in what were called \u201c Gypsy rooms \u201d . They had been prevented from using the same bathrooms and toilets as nonRoma women , and could not enter the dining room , where there was a television set . The second applicant had also experienced verbal abuse from health care personnel during her stay in ORG .", "CARDINAL . With reference to the Body and Soul Report ( see below ) , the applicants stated that the chief gynaecologist at ORG had admitted that patients were categorised and separated according to their \u201c adaptability \u201d and level of hygiene . That categorisation was carried out by him on an individual basis . According to the ORG and Soul Report the same physician had also stated that GPE did not know the value of work , that they abused the social welfare system and that they had children simply to obtain more social welfare benefits .", "CARDINAL . The Government disputed the above allegations . They relied , inter alia , on a statement by a gynaecologist at ORG that there had been no deliberate segregation of GPE women . On the contrary , due to the similarity of their habits GPE women themselves asked to be placed in rooms together ; they even moved without authorisation to other rooms for that purpose . There were also cases where GPE women with a higher social status requested isolation from other patients of GPE origin .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the publication by ORG and Soul : Forced and Coercive Sterilization and Other Assaults on ORG in GPE ( \u201c the Body and Soul Report \u201d ) , FAC GPE initiated a criminal investigation of the alleged unlawful sterilisation of several women , including the CARDINAL applicants .", "CARDINAL . The first and third applicants joined ORG in their criminal complaint and , together with the second applicant , also acted as witnesses and injured parties in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings were formally brought by the regional criminal investigation department in ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the regional criminal investigation department in GPE , to which the case had been transferred , discontinued the criminal investigation , finding that the alleged events underlying the investigation had not occurred and that nothing indicated that any offence under LAW had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants and CARDINAL others lodged a complaint against the police investigator \u2019s decision of DATE . On DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office in ORG dismissed it , holding that injured parties , including the applicants , were not entitled to lodge complaints against the decision of CARDINAL DATE . In a separate letter of DATE the regional prosecutor addressed the arguments of the complainants and found that the police investigator \u2019s decision had been lawful and correct .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants requested ORG to submit a complaint of a breach of law to ORG . ORG considered it a request for review of the lawfulness of the criminal proceedings . On DATE it informed the applicants that their request had been refused , and that ORG fully approved the proceedings and the decision to terminate the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed the decision given by the regional prosecutor \u2019s office in PERSON on DATE , for the reasons set out below .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a public prosecutor of the regional prosecutor \u2019s office in ORG dismissed a further complaint against the police investigator \u2019s decision of DATE . The public prosecutor found that all the available and necessary evidence had been gathered with a view to determining the issue . It had not been shown that the medical doctors concerned had taken unauthorised actions with a view to preventing the birth of children , or that they had otherwise acted in a manner contrary to the law .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG judgment of DATE ( see below ) the PERSON regional prosecutor \u2019s office , on CARDINAL DATE , quashed the investigator \u2019s decision of DATE to discontinue the criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , the police investigator examined and cross - examined the applicants and the medical staff . On DATE the investigator again discontinued the proceedings , concluding that no criminal offence had been committed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint . They argued that the investigator had failed to deal with all relevant aspects of the case and had not remedied the shortcomings to which ORG had pointed in the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG regional prosecutor \u2019s office dismissed the ORG complaint , holding that the sterilisations had been carried out in accordance with the law then in force , and that the applicants had been duly advised of their sterilisation . No objective or subjective appearance of any criminal offence had been established in any of the individual cases of sterilisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained about that decision to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the latter replied that no reason had been found to reach a different conclusion . In particular , the prosecuting authorities had considered all relevant aspects of the case and had correctly concluded that no criminal offence had been committed . ORG expressed the view that , contrary to what the prosecuting authorities at lower level had held , the applicants could not be considered injured parties for the purpose of the criminal proceedings , as they had suffered no harm to their health , nor any other damage , and their rights had not been infringed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE respectively the first and second applicants claimed damages from ORG . They relied on Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of ORG and claimed that they had been unlawfully sterilised by the defendant \u2019s employees . The third applicant brought a similar action with FAC on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The cases were examined by courts at CARDINAL levels of jurisdiction . It was established that the GPE municipality was to be considered the defendant once ORG had ceased to exist . The ORG claims were determined as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE FAC rejected the first applicant \u2019s claim as statute - barred . On DATE the ORG quashed that decision .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the ORG heard the parties and witnesses , obtained the opinion of an expert and took documentary evidence . On DATE it dismissed the first applicant \u2019s claim . In the judgment it admitted that the first applicant \u2019s sterilisation had not been life - saving surgery . As the applicant had been under the age of majority , her GPE approval should have been obtained prior to the surgery .", "CARDINAL . With reference to the expert opinion , the court further established that the reason for the first applicant \u2019s permanent infertility was the hysterectomy . That operation had been carried out as a life - saving intervention DATE after the delivery , for reasons which were unrelated to the sterilisation . The operation had thus had no lasting consequences for the first applicant . The court concluded that there was no causal link between the breach of the first applicant \u2019s rights in the context of her sterilisation and its alleged effect on her health , private and family life and position in society .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant appealed . She argued that she had been deprived of the ability to have children by her sterilisation on DATE . The subsequent hysterectomy could not absolve the defendant from liability for her unlawful sterilisation . She contested ORG argument that the sterilisation had not permanently deprived her of the ability to conceive .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the first - instance judgment . It held that ORG had established the relevant facts and had applied the law correctly . A causal link between the unlawful sterilisation of the first applicant and the damage which she alleged she had thereby suffered had ceased to exist with the performance of the hysterectomy . ORG concluded that during the short period between the sterilisation and the hysterectomy the first applicant could not have suffered any damage resulting from an impairment of her position in society , contrary to her allegation . Without further specification the judgment indicated that the first applicant might have suffered damage of a different nature , but that this was not the subject matter of the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the action of the second applicant . On DATE ORG quashed that decision .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the ORG heard the parties and witnesses and examined documentary evidence . It also obtained the opinion of an expert , the second applicant having previously challenged several other experts appointed by that court .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the action . On the basis of the expert opinion it established that the second applicant had not suffered serious damage to her health and that the operation had not affected her life and position in society . The judgment stated that the second applicant could become pregnant , for example by means of sterilisation reversal surgery or by assisted reproduction . The applicant had been living with her second partner for DATE and she had not shown that her social life had been impaired . Finally , ORG held that , had the second applicant shown that her health had been damaged as a result of her sterilisation , she would have been entitled to MONEY ( ORG ) in compensation under the relevant law .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed that judgment as erroneous . It held that the hospital staff had acted contrary to the law in that they had not obtained the approval of the second applicant \u2019s legal guardians prior to her sterilisation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the defendant to pay ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL to the second applicant . It found no reason to avail itself of its right under Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL to grant a higher award .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment of DATE while holding second applicant \u2019s argument that it was not clear whether she could become pregnant as a result of sterilisation reversal surgery or assisted reproduction , and that such methods were not accessible to her . For the appeal court , it had not been reliably established that the second applicant and her partner would have had children if she had not been sterilised . Finally , ORG held that the award could not be increased on the ground of the alleged impairment of the applicant \u2019s position as a member of a socially excluded ORG . That issue was to be assessed from the perspective of cultural norms shared in society as a whole , under which infertile men and women were no longer subject to denigration and mockery .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG discontinued the proceedings in respect of the third applicant . It held that under the relevant law the right claimed had been extinguished upon her death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a complaint with ORG . They referred to the above decisions by the police investigator of the regional criminal investigation department in PERSON and the regional prosecutor \u2019s office in PERSON of DATE and DATE respectively , and alleged that their rights under LAW , DATE , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the ORG and several constitutional provisions had been breached .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the regional prosecutor \u2019s office in PERSON had violated the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention , in that it had erroneously rejected their complaint against the police investigator \u2019s decision of DATE without addressing its merits . ORG quashed the decision of the regional prosecutor \u2019s office of DATE and ordered that authority to examine the ORG complaint . That order , together with the finding of a violation of the ORG \u2019s office in ORG to reimburse the applicants\u2019 costs and expenses in the constitutional proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants complained that the authorities involved in the above criminal investigation had failed to ensure that those responsible for their sterilisation were prosecuted and that the applicants were awarded compensation . The applicants alleged a violation of Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention . They also relied on several constitutional rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that by its decision of CARDINAL DATE the regional prosecutor \u2019s office in PERSON had violated the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW in their procedural aspect ,", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court quashed the decision in issue and ordered the regional prosecutor \u2019s office to re - examine the case , taking into account the applicants\u2019 rights under LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW . The decision indicated the issues which the prosecuting authorities were required to clarify .", "CARDINAL . ORG awarded the equivalent of ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL to each of the applicants . It ordered the regional prosecutor \u2019s office to reimburse the applicants\u2019 costs .", "DATE . On DATE the applicants complained under Articles CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL of the Convention about the PERSON regional prosecutor \u2019s decision of DATE and the fact that their case had not been investigated in a prompt and efficient manner . The applicants indicated that they had also complained about that decision to ORG by way of an extraordinary remedy , and that the latter had not yet replied to them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sent ORG a copy of the letter of ORG of DATE rejecting their complaint about the regional prosecutor \u2019s decision .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the ORG complaint on CARDINAL DATE . It held that the decision of the ORG regional prosecutor \u2019s office of DATE had been reviewed by ORG at the ORG request . Any interference with the applicants\u2019 rights which ORG was entitled to examine in the context of the proceedings complained of therefore stemmed from the decision ORG had given on DATE . Since the applicants had exclusively challenged the decision of the regional prosecutor \u2019s office , and since ORG was bound by the way in which they had specified the subject matter of their complaint , the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant complained about the proceedings leading to ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE . She alleged a breach of ORG , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE of the LAW , as well as of her rights under several other international treaties and LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared the complaint manifestly ill - founded . It held that ORG judgment was not arbitrary or otherwise contrary to the first applicant \u2019s rights .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second applicant alleged a breach of , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention in the context of the proceedings leading to ORG judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint as manifestly ill - founded . It held that the manner in which the ordinary courts had determined the amount of compensation due to the second applicant was not arbitrary or otherwise contrary to her fundamental rights and freedoms .", "CARDINAL . The applicants referred to a number of publications pointing to a history of sterilisation of GPE women , which had originated under the NORP regime in GPE in DATE and which they believed had influenced their own sterilisation . They also referred to the Body and Soul Report and a number of other reports and statements by human rights organisations , both in GPE and abroad , including governmental and inter - governmental bodies , requesting the NORP authorities to conduct an impartial and fair investigation of the allegations of forced and coerced sterilisation of GPE women in GPE , or criticising the absence of such an investigation ( for further details see also GPE v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL - CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "DATE . The Government cited a report of CARDINAL DATE drawn up by a group of experts established by ORG with a view to investigating allegations of unlawful sterilisations and segregation of GPE women ( for further details see GPE v. GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In their opinion on the ORG and Soul Report representatives of ORG and ORG admitted that the requirement of prior informed consent to sterilisation had been absent from the regulatory framework in GPE at the relevant time . However , in the case of GPE women it was frequently the only opportunity for medical personnel to inform them about contraception and sterilisation shortly before or during delivery . According to the opinion , the medical practitioners involved in sterilisations acted in good faith and in accordance with the law in force .", "CARDINAL . In a letter dated DATE the director of ORG contested the allegation that GPE women had been forcibly sterilised in his hospital . The letter contained the following information .", "CARDINAL . In the area covered by ORG the post - natal mortality rate of GPE children had fallen from QUANTITY per thousand in DATE to CARDINAL per thousand in DATE . The majority of deliveries in the hospital concerned GPE women ; the perinatal mortality rate was around CARDINAL per thousand , approximately the same as in other hospitals within the region .", "CARDINAL . The GPE settlement in NORP ( where the first and second applicants lived ) was outside the area served by ORG . However , its staff did not refuse to treat inhabitants of that settlement , as it was closer than the hospital to which they administratively belonged .

Furthermore , ORG had carried out CARDINAL procedures on GPE women who were experiencing difficulty in conceiving . In several cases the patients had become pregnant thereafter .", "CARDINAL . The letter also mentioned the case of a GPE woman who had delivered her eighth child in DATE . As she had been brought to the hospital in a state of shock , the staff could not inform her about sterilisation prior to delivery , which was carried out by Caesarean section .
