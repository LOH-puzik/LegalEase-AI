Some parents chose to educate their children at home .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the facts at issue , primary education in ORG schools was governed by GPE ( Lov om folkeskolen ) ( a consolidated version of which was set out in Executive Order No .

In DATE , LANGUAGE and woodwork were added , and in DATE NORP , mathematics , natural sciences and domestic science . As from DATE the pupils were , to some extent , allowed to choose from these courses the subjects they preferred .", "Under the LAW , the Minister of ORG determined the objectives of schooling and the local school authorities fixed the contents of the curriculum and the number of lessons . There were , however , CARDINAL exceptions to this rule . Firstly , religious instruction was to be in conformity with the NORP GPE doctrine of ORG , but children might be exempted therefrom . Secondly , the legislator had directed schools to include in their curricula , often in conjunction with traditional subjects , certain new topics such as road safety , civics , hygiene and sex education .", "CARDINAL . The administration of ORG schools in GPE is largely decentralised . These institutions are run by the municipal council , the highest education authority in each of the CARDINAL municipalities in that country , as well as by a school commission and a school board .", "The school commission ( skolekommissionen ) is as a general rule composed of CARDINAL members of whom CARDINAL are elected by the municipal council and CARDINAL by the parents . The commission , in consultation with the ORG council and within the limits laid down by law , prepares the curriculum for the schools within its district . The curriculum must be approved by the municipal council . To assist these bodies in the performance of their tasks , the Minister of ORG issues guidelines prepared by ORG ( hereinafter referred to as \" ORG \" ) , set up in DATE .", "Each State school has a school board ( skolen\u00e6vn ) which comprises CARDINAL or CARDINAL members ; CARDINAL member is chosen by the municipal council , the CARDINAL others by the parents . The board supervises the school and organises co - operation between school and parents . It decides , upon recommendation from the ORG council , what teaching aids and in particular what books are to be used by the school and it also determines the distribution of lessons among the teachers .", "CARDINAL . Primary education at private schools or at home must not fall below the standards laid down for ORG schools ; it must cover the same compulsory subjects and be of comparable quality . While a school may be established without any advance approval , it is subsequently supervised by the school commissions in order to ensure , in particular , that adequate instruction is given in NORP , writing and arithmetic . The same applies to education given in the home ; if the school commission finds twice in succession that such teaching is inadequate , the parents are required to send the child to a ORG or private school .", "The ORG supports private schools provided that they have not CARDINAL pupils in all and not less than ten pupils per class . The ORG subsidises CARDINAL per cent of their running costs ( principal \u2019s and ORG salaries , maintenance of buildings , heating , electricity , water , cleaning , insurance , etc . ) . In addition , private schools may be granted government loans on favourable terms for construction and improvement of buildings . As a result , parents who enrol their children at a private school do not in general have to bear school fees in excess of CARDINAL MONEY per child per annum ; during the DATE their average expenditure scarcely exceeded CARDINAL MONEY . ORG voted in DATE in favour of a proposal which would oblige municipalities to bear a large proportion of the cost of transport for children attending private schools .", "The statistics on private schools show that , in DATE , there were CARDINAL \" free \" schools ; CARDINAL private grammar schools without special religious background ; CARDINAL NORP schools ; CARDINAL NORP minority schools ; CARDINAL schools for members of other religious societies ; CARDINAL \" NORP free \" schools ; and CARDINAL other schools .", "The applicants claim that there are insufficient private schools and that their pupils frequently have to travel long distances to attend them ; moreover , parents wishing to send their children to a private school in ORG have to enter them on waiting lists DATE in advance .", "Sex education", "CARDINAL . In GPE , sex education in State schools has been a topic of discussion for DATE . DATE , sex education was introduced in the ORG schools of ORG and several institutions outside the capital copied this example . Nevertheless , the Minister of ORG spoke against compulsory sex education when the question was raised in DATE .", "In DATE , ORG published a \" Guide to teaching in ORG schools \" which distinguished between instruction on the reproduction of man and sex education proper . The ORG recommended that the former be integrated in the biology syllabus while the latter should remain optional for children and teachers and be provided by medical staff . ORG also advised that guidelines for schools be drawn up on the contents of , and the terminology to be used in , sex education .", "In a Circular of CARDINAL DATE , the Minister of Education adopted the ORG \u2019s conclusions : as from DATE CARDINAL/CARDINAL reproduction of man became a compulsory part of biology lessons whereas an official guide issued by ORG , dating from DATE , specified that only those children whose parents had given their express consent should receive sex education proper .", "CARDINAL . ORG , anxious to reduce the disconcerting increase in the frequency of unwanted pregnancies , instructed a committee in DATE to examine the problem of sex education ( ORG ) . The setting up of such a committee had been urged , among others , by ORG ( ORG ) under the chairmanship of Mrs. Else - Merete Ross , a Member of ORG , and by ORG ( PERSON ) . DATE the latter bodies received applications for assistance from CARDINAL young unmarried mothers of whom CARDINAL were DATE below CARDINAL . In addition , many children , often of very young parents , were born within DATE after marriage . Legal abortions , for their part , numbered CARDINAL every year and , according to expert opinions , illegal abortions CARDINAL whereas the DATE birth rate was hardly CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , after a thorough examination of the problem , the above - mentioned committee , which was composed of doctors , educationalists , lawyers , theologians and government experts , submitted a report ( No . CARDINAL ) entitled \" Sex Education in State Schools \" ( ORG m.v . , PERSON . CARDINAL ) . Modelling itself on the system that had been in force in GPE for DATE , the committee recommended in its report that sex education be integrated into compulsory subjects on the curriculum of ORG schools . However , there should be no obligation for teachers to take part in this teaching .", "The report was based on the idea that it was essential for sexual instruction to be adapted to the children \u2019s different degrees of maturity and to be taught in the natural context of other subjects , for instance when questions by the children presented the appropriate opportunity . This method appeared to the committee particularly suited to prevent the subject from becoming delicate or speculative . The report emphasised that instruction in the matter should take the form of discussions and informal talks between teachers and pupils . Finally it gave an outline of the contents of sex education and recommended the drawing up of a new guide for State schools .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the Minister of ORG tabled a PERSON before ORG to amend LAW . The PERSON provided , inter alia , that sex education should become obligatory and an integrated part of general teaching in ORG primary schools . In this respect , the PERSON was based on the recommendations of the committee on sex education , with CARDINAL exception : following a declaration from ORG , it did not grant teachers a general right of exemption from participation in such instruction .", "The PERSON had received the support not only of this ORG but also of ORG representing on the national level education committees , school boards and GPE associations , and of ORG .", "Section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the DATE Act , which was passed unanimously by ORG and became law on CARDINAL DATE , added \" library organisation and sex education \" to the list of subjects to be taught , set out in LAW para .

As early as DATE , a Circular from the Minister of Education ( ORG om \u00e6ndring af folkeskoleloven ) had advised municipal councils , school commissions , school boards , ORG councils and headmasters of schools outside ORG \" that further texts , accompanied by new teaching instructions , on sex education would be issued \" . The ORG specified that \" henceforth , parents ( would ) still have the possibility of exempting their children from such education and teachers that of not dispensing it \" .", "CARDINAL . After the passing of LAW , the Minister of ORG requested ORG to prepare a new guide to sex education in State schools intended to replace the DATE guide ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The new guide ( PERSON om seksualoplysning I folkeskolen , hereinafter referred to as \" the Guide \" ) was completed in DATE ; it set out the objectives of sex education as well as certain general principles that ought to govern it , and suggested detailed curricula for the various classes .", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the recommendations in the Guide , the Minister of ORG laid down in Executive Order No . CARDINAL of DATE ( ORG om seksualoplysning i folkeskolen ) the rules of which he had given notice in his FAC of DATE .", "The Executive Order - which applied to primary education and the first level of secondary education in State schools outside GPE DATE was worded as follows :", "( CARDINAL ) The objective of sex education shall be to impart to the pupils knowledge which could :", "( a ) help them avoid such insecurity and apprehension as would otherwise cause them problems ;", "( b ) promote understanding of a connection between sex life , love life and general human relationships ;", "( c ) enable the individual pupil independently to arrive at standpoints which harmonise best with his or her personality ;", "( d ) stress the importance of responsibility and consideration in matters of sex .", "( CARDINAL ) Sex education at all levels shall form part of the instruction given , in the general school subjects , in particular NORP , knowledge of NORP , biology ( hygiene ) , history ( civics ) and domestic relations . In addition , a general survey of the main topics covered by sex education may be given in DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) The organisation and scope of sex education shall be laid down in or in accordance with the curriculum . Assistance in this respect is to be obtained from ORG issued by ORG . If the special instruction referred to in the second sentence of LAW para .

CARDINAL .", "( CARDINAL ) ... \"", "CARDINAL . A Ministry of Education Circular ( NORP om seksualoplysning i folkeskolen ) , also dated DATE and sent to the same authorities as that of DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , gave the recipients , inter alia , certain particulars on the preparation of ORG school curricula in this field . It drew , in particular , their attention to the fact that \" it was for the school commission , after discussion with the joint council of teachers , to prepare draft provisions governing sex education to be included in the curricula of the schools of the municipality \" . Recalling that these provisions may take the form of a simple reference to the recommendations in the Guide , the ORG pointed out that the Guide gave , for DATE classes , various possibilities as regards the manner and scope of teaching . Thus , if there were a simple reference to the Guide , \" it is for the institution ( ORG council ) to take a decision in this respect with the agreement of the school board \" .", "CARDINAL . The objectives set out in ORG of DATE were identical with those of the Guide , except that the latter contains an addition to the effect that schools must try to develop in pupils openness with regard to the sexual aspects of human life and to bring about such openness through an attitude that will make them feel secure .", "CARDINAL . The principle of integration , provided for in paragraph CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of ORG , is explained as follows in the Guide :", "\" The main purpose of integration is to place sex guidance in a context where the sexuality of man does not appear as a special phenomenon . Sexuality is not a purely physical matter ... nor is it a purely technical matter .... On the other hand it is not of such emotional impact that it can not be taken up for objective and sober discussion . ... The topic should therefore form an integral part of the overall school education ... \"", "CARDINAL . As for the definition of the manner and scope of sex education ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of ORG ) , the Guide indicates the matters that may be included in the ORG school curricula .", "In DATE instruction begins with the concept of the family and then moves on to the difference between the sexes , conception , birth and development of the child , family planning , relations with adults whom the children do not know and puberty .", "The list of subjects suggested for DATE includes the sexual organs , puberty , hormones , heredity , sexual activities ( masturbation , intercourse , orgasm ) , fertilisation , methods of contraception , venereal diseases , sexual deviations ( in particular homosexuality ) and pornography .", "The teaching given in DATE returns to the matters touched on during DATE but puts the accent on the ethical , social and family aspects of sexual life . The ORG mentions sexual ethics and sexual morals ; different views on sexual life before marriage ; sexual and marital problems in the light of different religious and political viewpoints ; the role of the sexes ; love , sex and faithfulness in marriage ; divorce , etc .", "CARDINAL . ORG advocates an instruction method centred on informal talks between teachers and children on the basis of the latter questions . It emphasises that \" the instruction must be so tactful as not to offend or frighten the child \" and that it \" must respect each child \u2019s right to adhere to conceptions it has developed itself \" . To the extent that the discussion bears on ethical and moral problems of sexual life , the PERSON recommends teachers to adopt an objective attitude ; it specifies :", "\" The teacher should not identify himself with or dissociate himself from the conceptions dealt with . However , it does not necessarily prevent the teacher from showing his personal view . The demand for objectivity is amplified by the fact that the school accepts children from all social classes . It must be possible for all parents to reckon safely on their children not being influenced in a unilateral direction which may deviate from the opinion of the home . It must be possible for the parents to trust that the ethical basic points of view will be presented objectively and soberly . \"", "ORG also directs teachers not to use vulgar terminology or erotic photographs , not to enter into discussions of sexual matters with a single pupil outside the group and not to impart to pupils information about the technique of sexual intercourse ( section CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of ORG ) .", "The applicants claim , however , that in practice vulgar terminology is used to a very wide extent . They refer to a book by PERSON called \" Dreng og Pige , PERSON \" ( \" Boy and Girl , Man and Woman \" ) of which CARDINAL copies have been sold in GPE . According to them it frequently uses vulgar terminology , explains the technique of coitus and shows photographs depicting erotic situations .", "CARDINAL . On the subject of relations between school and parents , the LOC points out , inter alia :", "\" In order to achieve an interaction between sex education at the school and at home respectively , it will be expedient to keep parents acquainted with the manner and scope of the sex education given at school . Parent class meetings are a good way of establishing this contact between school and parents . Discussions there will provide the opportunity for emphasising the objective of sexual instruction at the school and for making it clear to parents that it is not the school \u2019s intention to take anything away from them but rather ... to establish co - operation for the benefit of all parties . It can also be pointed out to parents that the integrated education allows the topic to be taken up exactly where it arises naturally in the other fields of instruction and that , generally , this is only practicable if sex education is compulsory for pupils . ... Besides , through his contacts with the homes the class teacher will be able to learn enough about the GPE attitude towards the school , towards their own child and towards its special problems . During discussions about the sex education given by the school , sceptical parents will often be led to realise the justification for co - operation between school and home in this field as well . Some children may have special requirements or need special consideration and it will often be the parents of these children who are difficult to contact . The teacher should be aware of this fact . When gradually the teacher , homes and children have come to know each other , a relationship of trust may arise which will make it possible to begin sex education in a way that is satisfactory to all parties . \"", "CARDINAL .

In a Circular of DATE ( NORP om \u00e6ndring af reglerne om seksualoplysning i folkeskolen ) , sent to the same authorities as that of DATE ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the Minister of ORG stated that the aim of the new Executive Order was to enable local school authorities and , consequently , parents to exert greater influence on the organisation of the teaching in question . In addition , sex education , which \" remains an integral part of school education , which is to say that it should form part of the instruction given in obligatory subjects \" , was to have a more confined objective and place greater emphasis on factual information .", "The ORG pointed out that henceforth sex education could be postponed until DATE . It also mentioned that , whilst ORG no longer contained a reference to ORG - which was still in force - , this was to emphasise that the Guide was simply an aid to local school authorities in the drawing up of curricula .", "Finally , the ORG gave details on the role of teachers . If a teacher thought he would not be able to take care of this instruction in a satisfactory manner , he should be afforded the opportunity of attending one of the information courses provided by ORG . In addition , the Minister expressly recommended that special consideration be given to the personal and professional qualifications of teachers when courses including sex education are distributed amongst them .", "According to the applicants , the result of ORG of DATE was to free teachers from the duty of giving instruction in sex .

This amendment was rejected by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Although primary education in private schools must in principle cover all the topics obligatory at State schools ( paragraph CARDINAL above ) , sex education is an exception in this respect .
