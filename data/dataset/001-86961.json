In ORG view , the absence of a specific regulation of detention matters in LAW did not create a legal lacuna incompatible with LAW .

The Constitutional Court reiterated its constant case - law that the scope of the constitutional right to liberty and personal inviolability was identical for foreign nationals and stateless persons as for NORP nationals . A foreign national or stateless person may not be detained in GPE for more than TIME without a judicial decision . That constitutional requirement served as a guarantee against an excessively long detention beyond TIME , and also against arbitrary detention as such , in that it required a court to examine whether the arrest was lawful and justified .", "CARDINAL . ORG held that LAW , read in conjunction with LAW , could not be construed as permitting the detention of an individual for DATE on the basis of a request for his or her extradition , without a decision by a NORP court .

Similar to the situation observed during previous visits , none of the district commands ( RUVD ) and local divisions of ORG visited were equipped with facilities suitable for TIME stays ; despite that , the delegation found evidence that persons were occasionally held TIME at such establishments ... The cells seen by the delegation were totally unacceptable for extended periods of custody : dark , poorly ventilated , dirty and usually devoid of any equipment except a bench . Persons held TIME were not provided with mattresses or blankets . Further , there was no provision for supplying detainees with food and drinking water , and access to a toilet was problematic .", "The ORG reiterates the recommendation made in its report on the DATE visit ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL of document ORG ( DATE ) CARDINAL ) that material conditions in , and the use of , cells for administrative detention at district commands and local divisions of ORG be brought into conformity with ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the general conditions and regulations of detention in administrative detention cells .
