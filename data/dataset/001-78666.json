THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and DATE respectively , and live in FAC . They are represented before the ORG by ORG , lawyers practising in GPE - upon - GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicants married in DATE . They have had CARDINAL children , born in DATE , DATE and DATE . They remain lawfully married . Both have deep religious convictions ; the first applicant was ordained as a church minister in DATE .", "The first applicant was born male . However , the first applicant felt from DATE a strong desire to live as a woman . In DATE , the first applicant started to take steps to come to terms with this need . The first applicant was ultimately advised by doctors that he would require gender reassignment surgery ; this was carried out at public expense on ORG ( although it is not entirely clear when this took place ) . She continues to undergo hormone replacement treatment and other forms of treatment such as laser treatment and electrolysis . She changed her name by deed poll from PERSON to PERSON in DATE . She has completed all of her surgical interventions and contends that she is in all private and public relationships a woman .", "The second applicant has stood by the first applicant , and they contend that they remain together as \u201c a loving and married couple . \u201d", "Following the introduction of LAW ( \u2018 GPE CARDINAL\u2019 ) , the first applicant made an application to ORG ( \u2018 the Panel\u2019 ) on DATE for the issue of ORG ( \u2018 GRC\u2019 ) .", "Because the first applicant is married , the ORG could only issue an interim ORG , which they did on DATE . The only purpose of such a certificate is to enable the first applicant to seek annulment of a lawful marriage . On annulment , she would then be able to obtain a full ORG , a formal recognition of her acquired gender .", "Neither applicant wishes to annul their marriage , so the first applicant is unable to obtain a full ORG .", "LAW ( \u2018 ORG ) provides a mechanism whereby transsexuals may have their new genders recognised . LAW provides that ORG must grant an application if it is satisfied that the applicant : ( CARDINAL ) has , or has had , gender dysphoria ; ( CARDINAL ) has lived in the acquired gender throughout DATE ; and ( CARDINAL ) intends to continue to live in the acquired gender until death .", "By section CARDINAL , an application must include a report from a registered medical practitioner , or a chartered psychologist , either of whom must be practising in the field of gender dysphoria . This report must include details of diagnosis . A second report must also be included , which need not be from a medical professional practising in the field of gender dysphoria , but could be from any registered medical practitioner . CARDINAL of the reports must include details of any treatment that the applicant has undergone , is undergoing or that is prescribed or planned , for the purposes of modifying sexual characteristics .", "Section CARDINAL sets down the consequences of an application being successful . It reads in material part as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) If a ORG grants an application under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) it must issue a gender recognition certificate to the applicant .", "( CARDINAL ) Unless the applicant is married , the certificate is to be a full gender recognition certificate .", "( CARDINAL ) If the applicant is married , the certificate is to be an interim gender recognition certificate .", "( CARDINAL ) Schedule CARDINAL ( annulment or dissolution of marriage after issue of interim gender recognition certificate ) has effect .", "Section CARDINAL governs the situation where an interim certificate has been granted . It reads in relevant part as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A court which -", "( a ) makes absolute a decree of nullity granted on the ground that an interim gender recognition certificate has been issued to a party to the marriage , or", "( b ) ( in GPE ) grants a decree of divorce on that ground ,", "must , on doing so , issue a full gender recognition certificate to that party and send a copy to the Secretary of ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) If an interim gender recognition certificate has been issued to a person and either-", "( a ) the person \u2019s marriage is dissolved or annulled ( otherwise than on the ground mentioned in subsection ( CARDINAL ) ) in proceedings instituted during DATE beginning with DATE on which it was issued , or", "( b ) the person \u2019s spouse dies within that period ,", "the person may make an application for a full gender recognition certificate at any time within the period specified in subsection ( CARDINAL ) ( unless the person is again married ) .", "( CARDINAL ) That period is the period of DATE beginning with the day on which the marriage is dissolved or annulled or the death occurs .", "( CARDINAL ) An application under subsection ( CARDINAL ) must include evidence of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage and the date on which proceedings for it were instituted , or of the death of the spouse and the date on which it occurred .", "( CARDINAL ) An application under subsection ( CARDINAL ) is to be determined by ORG .", "( CARDINAL ) The Panel \u2013", "( a ) must grant the application if satisfied that the applicant is not married , and", "( b ) otherwise must reject it .", "( CARDINAL ) If the Panel grants the application it must issue a full gender recognition certificate to the applicant . \u201d", "The only function of an interim gender recognition certificate is therefore to provide a document which can be used to obtain a divorce .", "The other provisions of DATE only apply where a full gender recognition certificate is concerned . These include , for instance , section CARDINAL , which provides that :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Where a full gender recognition certificate is issued to a person , the person \u2019s gender becomes for all purposes the acquired gender ( so that , if the acquired gender is the male gender , the person \u2019s sex becomes that of a man and , if it is the female gender , the person \u2019s sex becomes that of a woman ) . \u201d", "By Paragraph CARDINAL of Part CARDINAL of Schedule CARDINAL to the GRA DATE , the issue of a full gender recognition certificate obliges the Registrar General to make an entry in the ( new ) ORG and to mark the original entry in the register of births referring to the birth ( or adoption ) of the transsexual person to show that the original entry has been superseded . Paragraph CARDINAL makes provision for certified copies to be made of any entry in the ORG and to be issued to anyone who would be entitled to a certified copy of the original entry relating to the transsexual person . It will not be apparent from the certified copy that it is compiled from the ORG . A short certificate of birth compiled from the ORG must , by LAW , not disclose that it is compiled from the ORG . Both copies of and short - form certificates therefore look the same as any other birth certificates ; they therefore act , to all outward intents and purposes , as new birth certificates .", "Not all provisions of the ORG require status or situations existing prior to gender recognition to be changed or dissolved . For instance , provisions as to parenthood ( section CARDINAL ) , succession ( section CARDINAL ) and peerages ( section CARDINAL ) explicitly provide that the person \u2019s gender has become the acquired gender does not effect their status or rights flowing therefrom .", "Section CARDINAL(c ) of LAW DATE provides that a marriage is void unless the parties are \u201c respectively male and female . \u201d", "In PERSON v PERSON [ DATE ] Probate Reports CARDINAL it was held that marriage could only be between a woman and a man , determined on genital , gonadal and chromosomal factors , and should not take into account the party \u2019s psychological beliefs , however genuine and profound .", "Section CARDINAL(c ) of LAW DATE and PERSON v PERSON have recently been reconsidered by ORG in PERSON v PERSON [ DATE ] UKHL CARDINAL . Their Lordships considered that the words \u201c male \u201d and \u201c female \u201d were to be given their ordinary meaning and referred to a person \u2019s biological gender as determined at birth so that , for purposes of marriage , a person born with CARDINAL sex could not later become a person of the opposite sex . They therefore held that it was not possible under LANGUAGE law for a person to marry another person who was of the same gender at birth , even if one of them had undergone gender reassignment surgery . They did , however , issue a declaration that Section CARDINAL(c ) of the DATE Act represented a continuing obstacle to the ability of the ( male to female ) transsexual petitioner to enter into a valid marriage with a man , and that it was therefore incompatible with her rights under LAW .", "LAW ( the CPA DATE ) came into force on DATE . It has the effect of allowing same sex couples to acquire a legal status for their relationships , with legal rights and responsibilities . It is , however , devoid of any religious element ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
