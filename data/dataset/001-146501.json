Where certain facts are in dispute , each party \u2019s version of events is set out .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a coalition of armed forces under unified command , led by GPE with a large force from GPE and small contingents from GPE , GPE and GPE , commenced the invasion of GPE from their assembly point across the border with GPE . By DATE NORP forces had captured PERSON and by DATE GPE troops had gained control of GPE . Major combat operations in GPE were declared complete on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the invasion , the applicant was a general manager in the national secretariat of ORG and a general in ORG , the army of ORG . He lived in Umm PERSON , a port city in the region of PERSON , near the border with GPE and QUANTITY from ORG ( GPE ) . After the NORP army entered into occupation of PERSON , they started arresting high ranking members of ORG . Other Ba\u2019ath ORG members were killed by NORP militia . The applicant and his family therefore went into hiding , leaving the applicant \u2019s brother , PERSON PERSON ( henceforth , \u201c PERSON \u201d ) , and his cousin to protect the family home .", "CARDINAL . According to information given by the ORG , members of a NORP army unit , ORG , went to the applicant \u2019s house TIME of CARDINAL DATE , hoping to arrest him . The applicant was not there , but the NORP forces encountered PERSON , who was described in the contemporaneous report drawn up by the arresting unit ( \u201c the battalion record \u201d ) as a \u201c gunman \u201d , found on the roof of the house with an AK-CARDINAL machine gun . The battalion record indicated that the \u201c gunman \u201d identified himself as the brother of the applicant and that he was arrested at TIME It further indicated that the house was found by the arresting soldiers to contain other firearms and a number of documents of intelligence value , related to local membership of ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to a statement made by the applicant and dated DATE , PERSON was arrested by NORP troops on DATE , in the applicant \u2019s absence . According to this statement , \u201c When my sisters approached the NORP military authority they were told that I had to surrender myself to them before they would release my brother \u201d . In a later statement , dated DATE , the applicant did not mention his sisters but instead stated that he asked his friend , PERSON , and his neighbour PERSON , to ask NORP forces for information about PERSON . The applicant asked these friends because he could trust them ; PERSON was a respected businessman and PERSON had been to university and spoke LANGUAGE . According to the applicant , \u201c [ W]hen they approached the NORP military authorities the NORP told them I had to surrender myself to them before they would release my brother \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to a summary of a telephone interview with the applicant \u2019s neighbour , Mr PERSON , dated DATE , PERSON was taken away by NORP soldiers on an unknown date in DATE at TIME , with his hands tied behind his back . Mr ORG stated that he approached one of the NORP who accompanied the soldiers to ask what they wanted , and was told that the soldiers had come to arrest the applicant . DATE , the applicant telephoned Mr PERSON and asked him to find a guard for his house and to find out from the NORP army what had happened to PERSON . DATE , Mr PERSON went to the NORP headquarters at FAC . He asked an NORP translator if he could find out anything about PERSON . DATE , when PERSON returned , the translator informed him that the NORP forces were keeping PERSON PERSON until the applicant surrendered . The translator further advised PERSON ORG not to return , as this might expose him to questioning .", "CARDINAL . Both parties agreed that PERSON was taken by NORP forces to GPE . This FAC , situated QUANTITY from Umm PERSON and QUANTITY south of ORG was first established on DATE as a GPE detention facility . However , it officially became GPE facility , known as \u201c GPE \u201d , on DATE . In DATE the FAC was composed of CARDINAL compounds , divided by barbed wire fencing , each with a single entry point . Each compound contained open - sided tents capable of housing CARDINAL detainees , a water tap , latrines and an uncovered area .", "CARDINAL . For reasons of operational convenience , GPE continued to detain individuals they had captured at GPE . CARDINAL compound was set aside for internees detained by GPE on suspicion of criminal offences . In addition , GPE operated a separate compound at the Camp for its ORG ( ORG ) . This compound had been built by NORP forces and continued to be administered by them . Although detainees captured by both GPE and GPE armies were interrogated at the ORG compound , and teams of GPE and GPE interrogators worked there , the GPE ORG team controlled the detention and interrogation of all prisoners held there . Elsewhere in the FAC , the GPE army was responsible for guarding and escorting detainees and GPE was obliged to reimburse GPE for costs involved in maintaining GPE captured detainees held at the FAC . ORG ( military police ) had an \u201c overseeing responsibility \u201d for GPE detainees transferred to GPE custody , except those detained in the ORG compound . GPE detainees who were ill or injured were treated in NORP field hospitals . GPE authorities were responsible for liaising with ORG ( ICRC ) about the treatment of GPE detainees and the notification of their families regarding the detention ( see further paragraph CARDINAL below ) . GPE also remained responsible for classifying detainees under LAW and CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In anticipation of GPE using shared facilities to hold GPE detainees , on DATE GPE , GPE and ORG entered into a Memorandum of Arrangement ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) relating to the transfer of custody of detainees , which provided as follows :", "\u201c This arrangement establishes procedures in the event of the transfer from the custody of either the GPE , GPE or NORP forces to the custody of any of the other parties , any Prisoners of War , NORP Internees , and Civilian Detainees taken during operations against GPE .", "The Parties undertake as follows :", "CARDINAL . This arrangement will be implemented in accordance with LAW to the Treatment of Prisoners of War and LAW to ORG in Time of War , as well as customary international law .", "CARDINAL . GPE , GPE , and NORP forces will , as mutually determined , accept ( as Accepting Powers ) prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees who have fallen into the power of any of the other parties ( the Detaining Power ) and will be responsible for maintaining and safeguarding all such individuals whose custody has been transferred to them . Transfers of prisoners of war , civilian internees and civilian detainees between Accepting Powers may take place as mutually determined by both the Accepting Power and the Detaining Power .", "CARDINAL . Arrangements to transfer prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees who are casualties will be expedited , in order that they may be treated according to their medical priority . All such transfers will be administered and recorded within the systems established under this arrangement for the transfer of prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees .", "CARDINAL . Any prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees transferred by a Detaining Power will be returned by the Accepting Power to the Detaining Power without delay upon request by the Detaining Power .", "CARDINAL . NORP The release or repatriation or removal to territories outside GPE of transferred prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees will only be made upon the mutual arrangement of the Detaining Power and the Accepting Power .", "CARDINAL . The Detaining Power will retain full rights of access to any prisoner of war , civilian internees and civilian detainees transferred from Detaining Power custody while such persons are in the custody of the Accepting Power .", "CARDINAL .

Such records will be available for inspection by the Detaining Power upon request . If prisoners of war , civilian internees , or civilian detainees are returned to ORG , the records ( or a true copy of the same ) relating to those prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees will also be handed over .", "CARDINAL . The Detaining Powers will assign liaison officers to Accepting Powers in order to facilitate the implementation of this arrangement .", "CARDINAL . The Detaining Power will be solely responsible for the classification under ORG CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW to the Treatment of Prisoners of War of potential prisoners of war captured by its forces . Prior to such a determination being made , such detainees will be treated as prisoners of war and afforded all the rights and protections of the LAW even if transferred to the custody of an ORG .", "CARDINAL . Where there is doubt as to which party is the Detaining Power , all Parties will be jointly responsible for and have full access to all persons detained ( and any records concerning their treatment ) until the Detaining Power has by mutual arrangement been determined .", "CARDINAL . To the extent that jurisdiction may be exercised for criminal offenses , to include pre - capture offenses , allegedly committed by prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees prior to a transfer to an ORG , primary jurisdiction will initially rest with ORG . Detaining Powers will give favourable consideration to any request by an ORG to waive jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . Primary jurisdiction over breaches of disciplinary regulations and judicial offenses allegedly committed by prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees after transfer to an ORG will rest with the Accepting Power .", "CARDINAL . The Detaining Power will reimburse the Accepting Power for the costs involved in maintaining prisoners of war , civilian internees , and civilian detainees transferred pursuant to this arrangement .", "CARDINAL . At the request of CARDINAL of the Parties , the Parties will consult on the implementation of this arrangement . \u201d", "CARDINAL . According to the witness statement of Major PERSON , who served with ORG at GPE during the period in question , the usual procedure was for a detainee to arrive at the FAC with a military escort from the capturing unit . On arrival he would be held in a temporary holding area while his documents were checked and his personal possessions were taken from him . Medical treatment would be provided at this point if required . The detainee would then be processed through the arrivals tent by GPE personnel with the aid of an interpreter . A digital photograph would be taken and this , together with other information about the detainee , would be entered on the database used by GPE authorities to record a wide range of military personnel information during the operations in GPE , including detainee information , known as the PERSON database .", "CARDINAL . Examination of this database showed that there was no entry under the name PERSON but there was an entry , with a photograph , for \u201c PERSON \u201d . In his witness statement the applicant explained that for official purposes NORP use their own first name , followed by the names of their father , mother , grandfather and great - grandfather . \u201c PERSON \u201d was the applicant \u2019s great - grandfather \u2019s name and it appeared that PERSON ( his grandfather \u2019s name ) was omitted by mistake . PERSON was issued with a wristband printed with his GPE internment serial number UKDFCARDINALIZSM ; with \u201c DF \u201d denoting \u201c detention facility \u201d , \u201c IZ \u201d meaning allegiance to GPE and \u201c ORG \u201d standing for \u201c soldier male \u201d . Screen shots from the PERSON database also show that PERSON was asked whether he consented to the national authorities being informed of his detention and that he did not consent to this .", "CARDINAL . Following the GPE registration process , detainees would be transferred to GPE forces for a second registration . This involved the issue of GPE number , printed on a wrist band . PERSON GPE registration number was UKCARDINAL - CARDINALEPWCARDINAL . The \u201c GPE \u201d reference indicated that GPE was the capturing nation and \u201c EPW \u201d indicated that he was treated by GPE forces as an enemy prisoner of war ; however , at this stage all detainees were classified as prisoners of war except those captured by NORP forces on suspicion of having committed criminal offences . After registration , detainees were usually medically examined , then provided with bedding and eating and washing kits and transferred by GPE forces to the accommodation areas .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted a witness statement by PERSON , who was charged with running ORG ( ORG ) in respect of GPE from the start of military operations there in DATE . He stated that the ORG operated in GPE as the \u201c ORG \u201d required by LAW and monitored details of prisoners of war internees and criminal detainees in order to facilitate contact with their nextof - kin . LAW also required the establishment of a \u201c Central Prisoners of War Information Agency \u201d . This role was subsumed by ORG of ORG ( ICRC ) . The ICRC collected information about the capture of individuals and , subject to the consent of the prisoner , transmitted it to the prisoner \u2019s country of origin or the power on which he depended . In practice , details of all prisoners taken into custody by NORP forces were entered by staff at the detention facility in GPE and sent to Mr GPE in GPE , who then transferred the data to a spread - sheet and downloaded it to the ICRC \u2019s secure website . He stated that during the active combat phase he typically passed data to the ICRC on a DATE basis , and DATE thereafter . However , PERSON details were not notified to the ICRC until DATE , because of a delay caused by the updating of ORG computer system . In any event , it was noted on PERSON record that he did not consent to the NORP authorities being notified of his capture ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the absence of consent , PERSON considered it unlikely that the ICRC would have informed the NORP authorities and that those authorities would , in turn , have informed the PERSON family .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , where the status of a prisoner was uncertain at the time of his arrival at GPE , he would be registered as a prisoner of war by GPE authorities . Any detainee , such as PERSON , captured in a deliberate operation was taken immediately to the ORG compound for a CARDINAL - stage interview . According to the Government , there were GPE and GPE interrogation teams working in the ORG compound , and both teams interviewed both ORG Kingdom- and ORG - captured detainees . The first interview may have been undertaken simply by whichever team was available when the detainee arrived . The aim of the interview process was to identify military or paramilitary personnel who might have information pertinent to the military campaign and , where it was established that the detainee was a non - combatant , whether there were grounds to suspect that he was a security risk or a criminal . If no such reasonable grounds existed , the individual was classified as a civilian not posing a threat to security and ordered to be released immediately .", "CARDINAL . A print - out from the ORG computer database indicated that in FAC PERSON was assigned ORG no . CARDINAL and registration no . ORG . His arrival was recorded as CARDINAL DATE at CARDINAL and his departure was recorded as CARDINAL DATE at CARDINAL , with his \u201c final destination \u201d recorded as \u201c Registration ( Civ Cage ) . \u201d Under the entry \u201c ORG \u201d the letter \u201c R \u201d was entered . Under the heading \u201c LOC , which stood for \u201c tactical questioning \u201d , there was the entry \u201c CARDINAL \u201d and under the heading \u201c FAC \u201d was the entry \u201c CARDINALZAPRCARDINAL \u201d . According to the Government , the first of these entries meant that PERSON PERSON was first subjected to tactical questioning on DATE at CARDINAL PERSON ( \u201c NORP \u201d in this context meant Coordinated Universal Time , also known as ORG ) . On DATE , CARDINAL PERSON would have been CARDINAL NORP time . The second entry indicated that PERSON was again subject to questioning on DATE at CARDINAL PERSON , or CARDINAL local time and then released into the civilian pen at GPE at CARDINAL local time on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Government provided the ORG with a copy of a record of an interview between PERSON and GPE agents , dated DATE , CARDINAL PERSON , which stated as follows :", "\u201c EPW [ Enemy Prisoner of War ] was born in GPE on DATE . He currently resides in his home with his father , mother , older brother ( Name : PERSON ; born in DATE ) , and his little sister ( age ; unexploited ) . Home is across from the PERSON school in the GPE region in GPE . EPW left middle school as a recruit to play soccer . He currently plays in ORG and his position is attacker / forward . His team receives money from the government and the PERSON committee to pay for team expenses . EPW has no job since soccer is his life and they pay for all of his soccer expenses .", "ORG knows that he was brought in because of his brother , PERSON . PERSON is a Othoo Sherba in the Ba\u2019ath party and he fled his home DATE to an unknown destination . PERSON joined the Ba\u2019ath party in DATE and is involved in regular meetings and emergency action planning ( nothing else exploited ) . Before the war , PERSON received a pickup from the Ba\u2019ath party . When the coalition forces entered GPE , PERSON gave the pickup to a neighbour ( name not exploited ) to safeguard it and PERSON went to a hotel in downtown GPE ( name of hotel is unknown ) . PERSON made a few phone calls during that time , but never mentioned where he was staying . A problem arose when the original owners of the pickup , the local petroleum company , came to reclaim the vehicle they had lent the Ba\u2019ath party . PERSON became frustrated with the whole mess and fled soon after that .", "ORG seems to be a good kid who was probably so involved with soccer that he did n\u2019t follow his brother \u2019s whereabouts all that much . But it seems they have a close knit family and ORG could know more about his brother \u2019s activities in the Ba\u2019ath party , and some of his friends involved in the party , too . Using any type of harsh approach is not going to be effective . EPW loves his family and soccer . ORG will cooperate , but he needs someone he can trust if he \u2019s going to tell information about his brother that is going to harm him . EPW seems to be innocent of anything himself , but may help with information about others around him . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A record of the second questioning was provided by the Government in the form of ORG . This document indicated that it related to \u201c PW CARDINAL \u201d with the \u201c date of information \u201d recorded as \u201c CARDINALZAPRCARDINAL \u201d , that is CARDINAL PERSON or CARDINAL local time on DATE . The report stated :", "\u201c CARDINAL . EPW [ Enemy Prisoner of War ] is DATE , single , living with his DATE father ( who is a PERSON ) and his mother in the NORP district of ORG . He works as a handyman and has not done his military service due to his status as a student . He stated that an AK CARDINAL was present in their house at the time of his arrest but it was only kept for personal protection . The ORG and his father are not ORG members .", "CARDINAL . EPW says he was arrested at his house by GPE troops [ sic ] who were looking for his brother , PERSON . His brother is a ORG member , an ORG Shooba . He joined the party in DATE when he became a law student in the school of law in ORG . His brother is still a student , in DATE of study , married but with no children . He has alternated study with periods of work as a car trader . His brother was in fear of his life because of fear of reprisals against ORG members and so had run away possibly to ORG or ORG . The ORG last spoke with his brother DATE by phone . His brother did not disclose his location .", "ORG COMMENT : EPW appears to be telling the truth and has been arrested as a result of mistaken identity . He is of no intelligence value and it is recommended that he is released to the civilian pen . JFIT COMMENT ENDS . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted a summary of an interview dated DATE with PERSON , the former chairman of ORG in PERSON and a friend of the applicant \u2019s family . He had been arrested by NORP troops and detained at GPE , in a tent holding CARDINAL detainees . He stated that on DATE at TIME PERSON was brought to the tent . Mr PERSON stated that PERSON seemed scared and confused but did not mention that PERSON complained of having been ill - treated . PERSON was not interrogated during the time they were together in GPE . Since Mr PERSON was in ill - health , PERSON brought him food and cared for him . Mr PERSON was released on CARDINAL DATE , in a batch of CARDINAL prisoners , since GPE authorities had decided to release all detainees aged DATE . The detainees were released at TIME , on a highway between LOC and PERSON and had to walk QUANTITY to the nearest place they could hire cars . Following his release , he informed the applicant \u2019s family that he had seen PERSON at GPE . According to the applicant , this was the only information received by the family about his brother \u2019s whereabouts following the latter \u2019s arrest . In response to this statement , the Government submitted that PERSON might have been mistaken about the date , because it appeared from the interrogation records that PERSON was released to the civilian holding area on DATE . They also emphasised that stringent efforts were made to return individuals to their place of capture or to an alternate location if requested , and that QUANTITY was much greater than the distance between PERSON and PERSON .", "CARDINAL . According to the witness statement , provided by the Government , of Major PERSON , who commanded a group of soldiers from ORG who advised on detention issues within the GPE area of operations in GPE during the relevant period , the decision to release GPE captured detainees held at GPE , other than those facing criminal charges , was taken by a tribunal convened by GPE military legal officers . Details were then passed to GPE guards , before those released were processed out of the Camp , with their details checked and entered on the PERSON database . According to the orders made by GPE Military Divisional Headquarters based in PERSON and applying at that time , the GPE forces were responsible for the repatriation of all prisoners to the areas within their field of operation and the GPE forces were responsible for returning prisoners to areas within their field of operation , namely GPE , regardless of which force had captured the prisoners . The ICRC was to have access to all those being released . Again according to the applicable orders , prisoners repatriated by NORP forces were to be loaded on to buses with armed guards on - board and armed military escort vehicles to the front and rear . Release was to be to specific repatriation points in TIME , with sufficient food and water to last the individuals being released until they got home . According to the evidence of Major PERSON , efforts were made to return individuals to their point of capture . There were CARDINAL drop - off points within the GPE field of operation , including \u201c PERSON GPE [ grid reference to be confirmed ] \u201d . Umm PERSON was not listed as a dropoff point but could be entered as a point of release on the records of individuals being processed for release .", "CARDINAL . The Government also submitted a military order dated DATE ( FRAGO CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the purpose of which was to ensure the release from detention of the maximum possible number of civilians and prisoners of war prior to the cessation of hostilities ( which was subsequently announced on CARDINAL DATE ) . The annex to the order set out the procedures to be followed . A number of individuals would continue to be detained on security grounds or because they were suspected of being criminals ; they had already been identified by ORG , with the decision recorded on the APCARDINAL-Ryan database , and a list given to GPE authorities to ensure they were not released . The remaining population would stay within the individual compounds and await release processing by GPE authorities . At the processing tent , a CARDINAL - point check would be made of each detainee \u2019s wrist - band , face and digital profile held on APCARDINAL-Ryan . The following information was then required to be entered into the database : \u201c ( CARDINAL ) Releasing Force Element ; ( CARDINAL ) Release Date ; ( CARDINAL ) Releasing Nation ; ( CARDINAL ) ORG . \u201d The text of the order itself referred to CARDINAL dropoff points ( ORG , PERSON , PERSON and An PERSON ( the latter CARDINAL towns were to the north of ORG ) , but the annex listed in addition Um PERSON ( south of PERSON and QUANTITY from the FAC ) as a drop - off point . The GPE forces would then retain the detainee \u2019s identity card and pass him back to GPE authorities for final processing , including the issue of food and water and the return of personal belongings . CARDINAL holding areas would be established , \u201c one for each release location \u201d , from which the detainees would then be transported to the agreed repatriation points and released in daylight hours . The order also required a final audit to be conducted to check that all GPE detainees listed on the APCARDINAL-Ryan database had either been released or continued to be detained . Should the record be identified of any person who had neither been released nor detained , a board of inquiry had to sit to determine what had happened .", "CARDINAL . In addition , the ORG submitted a witness statement dated CARDINAL DATE by Warrant Officer Class CARDINAL PERSON , who had responsibility for the management of the APCARDINAL-Ryan database . He stated that by CARDINAL DATE PERSON showed that the GPE forces had captured and processed CARDINAL detainees in GPE since the start of hostilities and had released all but CARDINAL . Annexed to Warrant Officer PERSON \u2019s statement were a number of screen prints showing entries on the database relating to PERSON . They showed that an entry was made on APCARDINAL-Ryan on DATE at TIME recording the release of \u201c PERSON \u201d at CARDINAL on DATE . The releasing authority was stated to be \u201c GPE ( ORG ) ORG SIG REGT \u201d ; the place of release was stated to be \u201c Umm Qasr \u201d ; the method of release was \u201c By Coach \u201d and the ground of release was recorded as \u201c End of Hostilities \u201d . A further entry was made in the GPE APCARDINAL-Ryan system on CARDINAL DATE at CARDINAL p.m. recording that : \u201c PW was found to be absent from the internment facility when PERCENT check was conducted . PW was released on APCARDINAL on CARDINAL DATE \u201d . According to the Warrant Officer PERSON , CARDINAL ORG records included the statement \u201c PW was released on APCARDINAL on CARDINAL DATE \u201d , when they had in fact been released earlier and it was therefore likely that the FAC \u2019s computer release records were brought up to date on DATE following a physical check . GPE computer system did not record any release until DATE but again , according to the Government , this was probably explained by a reconciliation of GPE Camp Bucca database with a physical check of occupants of the FAC by GPE authorities on DATE", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , PERSON did not contact his family during the period following his purported release . On DATE one of the applicant \u2019s cousins received a telephone call from a man unknown to them , from PERSON , a town north of GPE . This man informed them that a dead man had been found in the nearby countryside , with a plastic ID tag and piece of paper with the cousin \u2019s telephone number written on it in the pocket of the sport \u2019s top he was wearing . According to the applicant , PERSON was wearing sportswear when he was captured by NORP forces . The applicant \u2019s cousin called him and , together with another brother , the applicant went to the forensic medical station of ORG in GPE . There they saw the body of PERSON with CARDINAL bullet wounds from an AK-CARDINAL machine gun in his chest . According to the applicant , PERSON hands were tied with plastic wire . The identity tag found in his pocket was that issued to him by GPE authorities at GPE . A death certificate was issued by the NORP authorities on DATE , giving the date of death as DATE , but the sections reserved for the cause of death were not completed . A police report identified the body as \u201c PERSON \u201d but gave no information about the cause of death .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained in hiding in GPE until DATE , when he crossed the border to GPE . In DATE , through a representative in GPE , he made contact with solicitors in GPE . The applicant \u2019s solicitors wrote to the ORG \u2019s ORG on DATE requesting explanations for the arrest and detention of PERSON and the circumstances that resulted in his death . It took some time to identify the applicant \u2019s brother , because he was entered in the GPE databases under the name \u201c PERSON \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , in a letter dated DATE ORG stated that a check of GPE prisoner of war computer records had produced a record of PERSON being detained at GPE . In a further letter dated DATE ORG stated that further computer records had been recovered which \u201c confirm the handover \u201d of PERSON from GPE authorities to GPE authorities at GPE and which recorded his release on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant commenced proceedings in ORG on DATE seeking declarations in respect of breaches of his brother \u2019s rights under LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , as set out in Schedule CARDINAL to LAW DATE , financial compensation and an order requiring the Government to initiate an independent and public investigation into the fate of the deceased after he was detained by NORP forces on DATE . The claim was heard on DATE and was rejected in a judgment delivered by PERSON on DATE ( [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ) . The judge held that , in the light of the judgment of ORG in PERSON ( see further the summary of ORG judgment in PERSON v. the GPE , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) , it could not be said that PERSON was within GPE jurisdiction LAW at any time . In ORG had recognised a number of exceptions to the general rule that a ORG did not exercise jurisdiction extra - territorially , but these did not include detention of a person unless this took place within a military prison or other comparable facility controlled by ORG . The judge \u2019s analysis of the ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) indicated that GPE was GPE rather than a GPE military establishment , for the following reasons :", "\u201c ... It is plain that the detaining power [ GPE ] relinquishes , until such time as it requires return of the individual in question , responsibility for maintaining and safeguarding those transferred . Accountability in that regard is the responsibility of the accepting power [ GPE ] . As regards adjudications concerning the individual \u2019s contact after transfer to the accepting power the detaining power relinquishes to the accepting power primary jurisdiction . Overall this amounts to a legal regime in which the detaining power has no substantial control over DATE to day living conditions of the individual in question . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant was advised that an appeal would have no prospect of success .", "CARDINAL . The applicant contended that the evidence of his sisters , friend and neighbour demonstrated that his brother was captured and detained by NORP forces with the purpose of inducing the applicant to surrender himself . The first reference made by the Government to the battalion record , which referred to PERSON arrest ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , was in its observations to ORG in DATE . No good explanation for the recent appearance of this material had been provided , which was surprising given the emphasis placed on the document by the Government . The applicant made no admissions as to whether or not he accepted it was genuine . He underlined , also , that it was the sole document to make any reference to PERSON having been found in possession of an ORG machine gun and positioned on the roof . Neither of the records of his interviews ( see paragraphs DATE above ) referred to his having been detained as a suspected combatant or having posed any threat , real or suspected , to NORP forces at any time .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further contended that the GPE computer detention records recorded CARDINAL different release dates , none of which appeared reliable ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Similarly , the place of release was a matter of speculation based on unclear and inconsistent evidence ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . It could not even be said with any certainty that PERSON was not still being detained after the search of GPE on DATE , given in particular the release date entered on GPE records . The applicant pointed out that his brother was found dead with GPE identity tag still on him ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and that he had not contacted his family at any point after he had been captured by GPE forces , which strongly suggested that he had had no opportunity to do so .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the applicant had not established an adequate justification for the delay in raising his complaints with the GPE authorities . The delay had imposed an inevitable impediment to the effective investigation of PERSON death . No adverse inferences should be drawn from the ORG \u2019s inability to provide an explanation for PERSON death in circumstances where the evidence provided a satisfying and convincing explanation of his arrest , detention and release .", "CARDINAL . The Government denied the allegation that PERSON was detained as a means of putting pressure on the applicant to surrender . They contended that the evidence submitted by the applicant in support of this claim was imprecise and hearsay and that such a purpose on the part of GPE authorities would have been inconsistent with PERSON subsequent release from GPE as soon as his status had been established as a civilian who did not pose a threat to security . Instead , they contended that it was reasonable for the NORP forces to suspect PERSON of being a combatant , since he was found , armed , on the roof of the house of a general of ORG , which house contained other firearms and a number of documents of intelligence value relating to local members of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Government further pointed out that , apart from the applicant \u2019s witness statement , there was no independent evidence of the cause of death because this information had not been entered on the death certificate ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In any event , they emphasised that PERSON was QUANTITY from GPE , in an area that had never been occupied by NORP forces , and that the AK-CARDINAL machine gun was not a weapon used by NORP forces .", "CARDINAL . At the outset , the ORG recalls that the domestic proceedings were dismissed on the ground that the applicant \u2019s brother did not fall within the jurisdiction of GPE at any material time ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It was not therefore necessary for the national courts to establish the facts in any detail . The ORG is generally sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and cautious in taking on the role of a first - instance tribunal of fact ( see PERSON v. GPE DATE . ) , no . CARDINAL , DATE ) . However , in the present circumstances it is unavoidable that it must make some findings of fact of its own on the basis of the evidence before it .", "CARDINAL . In cases in which there are conflicting accounts of events , the ORG is inevitably confronted when establishing the facts with the same difficulties as those faced by any first - instance court . It reiterates that , in assessing evidence , it has adopted the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d . However , it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard . Its role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the LAW . The specificity of its task under LAW to ensure the observance by GPE of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions the ORG \u2019s approach to the issues of evidence and proof . In the proceedings before it , there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or pre - determined formulae for its assessment . It adopts the conclusions that are , in its view , supported by the free evaluation of all evidence , including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions . According to its established case - law , proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . Moreover , the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and , in this connection , the distribution of the burden of proof , are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts , the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake . ORG is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a ORG has violated fundamental rights ( see GPE v. \u201c the former GPE \u201d [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , it is to be recalled that Convention proceedings do not in all cases lend themselves to a strict application of the principle affirmanti incumbit probatio ( the principle , that is , that the burden of proof lies on the person making the allegation in question ) . The ORG reiterates its case - law under LAW and CARDINAL of the Convention to the effect that where the events in issue lie within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities , as in the case of persons under their control in custody , strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during that detention . The burden of proof in such a case may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation . In the absence of such explanation the ORG can draw inferences which may be unfavourable for the respondent Government . The ORG has already found that these considerations apply to disappearances examined under LAW , where , although it has not been proved that a person has been taken into custody by the authorities , it is possible to establish that he or she was officially summoned by the authorities , entered a place under their control and has not been seen since . In such circumstances , the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible and satisfactory explanation as to what happened on the LOC and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities , but left the LOC without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty . Furthermore , the ORG reiterates that , again in the context of a complaint under LAW , it has required proof in the form of concordant inferences before the burden of proof is shifted to the respondent Government ( see PERSON , cited above , \u00a7 \u00a7 QUANTITY - CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It is not in dispute in the present case that the applicant \u2019s brother was captured by GPE forces on DATE , subsequently detained at GPE and that he died shortly before his body was found in GPE on DATE . The disagreement over the facts centres on CARDINAL issues : first , whether PERSON was arrested and detained as a means of exerting pressure on the applicant to surrender himself and , secondly , in what circumstances PERSON left GPE . In addition , since the applicant alleges that PERSON body had marks of ill - treatment on it , the question arises whether he was ill - treated while in detention .", "CARDINAL . As to the first point , the ORG notes that the only evidence before it which supports the claim that PERSON was taken into detention in an attempt to force the applicant to surrender himself are the CARDINAL statements made by the applicant and the note of a telephone interview with the applicant \u2019s neighbour , both prepared for the purposes of the domestic proceedings ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . In the applicant \u2019s first statement he alleged that his sisters had been told by the NORP military authority that PERSON would not be released until the applicant gave himself up . In the second statement , the applicant claimed that this information was given to his neighbour and his friend . In neither of the applicant \u2019s statements , nor that of his neighbour , Mr PERSON , is the representative of the GPE military who made the alleged assertion identified , by name or rank . Given the lack of precision , the hearsay nature of this evidence and the internal inconsistencies in the applicant \u2019s statements , the ORG does not find the evidence in support of the applicant \u2019s claim to be strong .", "CARDINAL . For their part , the Government were not able to present the ORG with any witness evidence relating to PERSON capture . However , they provided the ORG with the operational log of ORG which was created contemporaneously with the events in question ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . It records that , when NORP forces arrived at the house , PERSON was positioned on the roof , armed with an ORG machine gun and that other firearms and documents of intelligence value were found in the house . In addition , the Government provided records of interviews at FAC with PERSON and screen shots of entries relating to him on the APCARDINAL-Ryan database ( see , respectively , paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL , DATE and DATE above ) . The ORG has no grounds on which to question the authenticity of these records . They show that PERSON was registered at GPE on DATE , taken to the ORG compound at CARDINAL on DATE and released to the civilian holding area of GPE on DATE at TIME local time . The computer records further show that he was questioned once on DATE CARDINAL local time and again on DATE at TIME local time . Records of both interviews have been provided to ORG . They show that PERSON identity as the applicant \u2019s brother was known and that it was established in the course of questioning that he had no personal involvement with ORG or ORG .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s view , the capture and questioning records are consistent with the ORG \u2019s submission that PERSON was captured as a suspected combatant or a civilian posing a threat to security . This view is supported by other evidence which tends to show that PERSON PERSON may well have been armed with , or at least in the possession of , an AK-CARDINAL machine gun at the moment of his capture , namely the applicant \u2019s assertion that his younger brother had been left to protect the family home ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and PERSON reported explanation , during his interrogation by NORP agents , of the presence of the weapon as being for personal protection ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The GPE records further indicate that he was cleared for release as soon as it had been established that he was a civilian who did not pose a threat to security .", "CARDINAL . The ORG accepts that PERSON capture was linked to his relationship with his brother , but only to the extent that the NORP forces , having been made aware of the relationship by PERSON himself and finding PERSON armed at the moment of capture ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , may have suspected that he also was involved with ORG and ORG . ORG does not find that the evidence supports the claim that PERSON was taken into custody to be held until the applicant should surrender . If that had been the intention of the GPE forces , he would not have been cleared for release immediately after the second interview and TIME after his admission to GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . As regards the date and place of PERSON release , the principal evidence consists of entries from PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . CARDINAL entry made on CARDINAL DATE recorded that PERSON had been released on CARDINAL DATE , by coach , to PERSON , on the ground of the \u201c End of Hostilities \u201d . Another entry on CARDINAL DATE found that PERSON PERSON was not present in the Camp when a full check of detainees was made . The ORG considers , on the basis of these entries , taken together with the decision made following the second screening interview not to continue to detain PERSON , that he was in all probability released early in DATE . This view is further supported by the evidence provided by the Government concerning the policy decision taken by GPE forces to release all detainees prior to or immediately following the cessation of hostilities announced on DATE , save those suspected of criminal offences or of activities posing a risk to security ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . As to the place of release , the ORG notes that GPE was situated QUANTITY from Umm PERSON . Although the main text of the relevant military order relating to the release of detainees from GPE did not list PERSON as a drop - off point ( listing CARDINAL towns to the north of the FAC ) , the annex to the order did describe Umm PERSON as a release area . It is impossible to be certain in the absence of more conclusive evidence , but given the town \u2019s proximity to the FAC , its mention in the annex , the GPE policy of releasing detainees following the end of hostilities and the computer entries concerning PERSON release , the ORG finds that it is probable that PERSON was released in or near Umm PERSON on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is of the view that , in this case , since the evidence concerning PERSON detention and release was , for the most part , accessible only to the Government , the onus is on them to provide a plausible and satisfactory explanation as to what happened to PERSON in the FAC and to show that he was released and that the release followed a safe procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The computer records show that by CARDINAL DATE GPE had captured and processed CARDINAL detainees in GPE since the start of hostilities and had released all but CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In the light of the time that had elapsed before the applicant lodged his claim and the large number of GPE detainees that were released from GPE DATE and DATE , it is unsurprising that no eye witness able to remember PERSON release has been traced . In the circumstances of the present case , the ORG finds that the evidence referred to above is sufficient to satisfy the burden of proof on the Government .", "CARDINAL . Finally , there is no evidence before the ORG to suggest that PERSON was ill - treated while in detention . The interview records show that he was questioned on CARDINAL occasions , shortly after having been admitted to the FAC , and found to be a civilian , of no intelligence value and not posing any threat to security . The witness statement submitted by the applicant , of PERSON , who claimed to have seen PERSON in the civilian holding area in GPE in the period after he was questioned and before he was released , makes no mention of any sign of injury on PERSON or any complaint by him of ill - treatment . Moreover , apart from the applicant \u2019s witness statement , there is no evidence before the ORG as to the cause of PERSON death or the presence of marks of ill - treatment on his body , since the death certificate contains no information on either point . Assuming the applicant \u2019s description of his brother \u2019s body to be accurate , the lapse of DATE between PERSON release and his death does not support the view that his injuries were caused during his time in detention .", "CARDINAL . Having established the facts of the case , the ORG must next examine the applicant \u2019s complaints under the Convention ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-2", "5-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
