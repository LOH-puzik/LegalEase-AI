On DATE the applicant sold the real estate , in accordance with this other person \u2019s instructions , on behalf of the company to another company . On DATE was declared personally bankrupt while he was at the same time charged with dishonesty by a debtor ( velallisen ep\u00e4rehellisyys , oredlighet som g\u00e4lden\u00e4r ) . On DATE , when the first swearing of the inventory of the bankruptcy estate was held , PERSON refused to swear the inventory . The inventory did not include the real estate .

NORP By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted leave to appeal to Mr A. The applicant was granted leave to appeal only in respect of the removal from office and the obligation to pay costs and expenses to PERSON bankruptcy estate . As to the merits , the court upheld ORG judgment . The court found that the information PERSON had declined to give in DATE was not such that it would in all probability have provided a basis for his conviction . PERSON had thus not had any right to decline to give this information and he was thus guilty of aggravated debtor \u2019s fraud . As concerns the applicant , the court acquitted him of the obligation to pay costs and expenses to PERSON bankruptcy estate . As to his removal from office , the court did not change the earlier judgments . The judgment included several dissenting opinions .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , the ORG delivered its judgment in the case GPE v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) in which it found that there had been a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to silence and his right not to incriminate himself guaranteed by LAW . In that case the applicant was charged with for having previously given false accounts of his assets at the time when coercion was used to obtain information from him . The circumstances of that case were identical to that of PERSON with the only exception that PERSON had been subject to enforcement while PERSON was subject to personal bankruptcy proceedings . They were both under threat of a similar default fine and even imprisonment if they did not agree to declare all their assets . This information could have been used against them in other pending criminal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date PERSON filed an extraordinary appeal with ORG requesting re - opening of his case on the basis of the ORG \u2019s judgment in the PERSON case .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant also filed a re - opening request with ORG as his conviction was ancillary to that of PERSON also requested that the execution of his sentence be stayed as far as the removal from office was concerned .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE ORG refused the request to stay the execution due to the fact that the removal from office had taken effect on the date of the judgment , namely , on DATE , and that there was thus no execution measure to be stayed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in plenum , re - opened Mr A. \u2019s case , dismissed all the charges against him and freed him from the sentence imposed . The court found that PERSON had had a right to remain silent as he could not rule out that the information given could be used against him in criminal proceedings . Mr A had thus been entitled to decline to declare , inter alia , the real estate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in plenum , rejected the applicant \u2019s request for re - opening . The court found that even though PERSON had had a right to remain silent , this did not mean that the applicant \u2019s acts to conceal assets , namely the real estate , from ORG \u2019s creditors were justified . The effects of the right not to incriminate oneself were limited only to the person who was asked to submit information . A person could be convicted of a receiving offence even if the perpetrator of the principal offence was freed from criminal liability . The applicant \u2019s right to a fair trial had not been violated as no information received in violation of the right not to incriminate oneself had been used as evidence vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The referendary and CARDINAL justices gave a joint dissenting opinion . According to them , there was no domestic law or jurisprudence on whether the right not to incriminate oneself could have effects on other persons connected to the crime in question . ORG had already found that PERSON had not committed the debtor \u2019s fraud of which he was accused . Therefore the applicant could not have been guilty of receiving the assets that PERSON had acquired through debtor \u2019s fraud , as indicated in the charges . There were no other charges against him . Consequently , the applicant \u2019s case should be re - opened , all charges against him dismissed and he should be freed from all sanctions imposed on him .", "CARDINAL .
