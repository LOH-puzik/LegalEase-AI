The applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention was subsequently extended by decisions of ORG ( PERSON ) of DATE and DATE , CARDINAL May , DATE , and DATE .", "CARDINAL . The domestic court justified the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention by the existence of strong evidence against him and the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed in the case . The court also noted that it was necessary to carry out further investigations , such as obtaining evidence from new witnesses , psychiatric reports on the suspects and various forensic reports .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the applicant was indicted on charges of robbery , manslaughter , distribution of drugs , assault and battery . There were CARDINAL other defendants in the applicant \u2019s case . The prosecutor asked the trial court to examine CARDINAL witnesses and to read out the testimonies of another CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the trial court decided that certain procedural shortcomings had occurred in the proceedings and returned the bill of indictment to the prosecutor .

The courts reiterated that there was strong evidence against the applicant and the likelihood that a severe penalty would be imposed in the case . In addition , the authorities noted that for the above reasons the applicable law allowed for a presumption of risk that the applicant would obstruct the proper course of the proceedings and the latter could only be ensured by applying the preventive measure in question .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE the ORG partly quashed the judgment and remitted the case to ORG in that part . The first - instance judgment was upheld , however , with respect to a few offences and in that connection the applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .

The authorities continued to briefly reiterate the reasons previously given to justify the applicant\u2019vis - \u00e0 - vis the position of each individual defendant . Thus , the fact that , in the instant case , a few of the applicant \u2019s co - defendants had been released pending trial did not have any bearing on the applicant \u2019s situation . Similarly , the court observed that the argument that there was strong evidence against the applicant , which had been relied on to justify the preventive measure , did not undermine the principle of the presumption of innocence in criminal proceedings . Finally , the court admitted that the applicant \u2019s detention had been lengthy ; however , its length was considered proportionate to the penalty envisaged under domestic law for the offences with which he had been charged .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , on DATE and CARDINAL DATE the ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request to have his detention lifted in view of his allegedly difficult family situation .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE the ORG quashed the above judgment , inter alia , in the part concerning CARDINAL charges against the applicant and remitted the case to ORG in that part . The firstinstance judgment was upheld , however , with respect to one offence and in that connection the applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The appellate court deducted from the imposed sentence the term of the applicant \u2019s detention preceding the conviction , namely DATE , DATE comprising CARDINAL periods : from DATE until DATE and from CARDINAL DATE until DATE .
