The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE , GPE .", "CARDINAL . He was a representative of a NORP company , ORG , which bought a share of a NORP company , S. The applicant was a member of ORG of company S. from DATE , and its chairman from CARDINAL DATE . He was unable , however , to exercise his powers between CARDINAL DATE and DATE , having been illegally dismissed from ORG by its NORP members . Company S. later became insolvent .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with insider trading and fraud , in particular with concluding contracts disadvantageous to company S. and causing pecuniary damage of CARDINAL NORP korunas ( CZK ) ( MONEY ( ORG ) ) . On DATE he was placed in pre - trial detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested to be released on bail and offered to pay security of CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The request contained a declaration that he was aware of the contents of LAW of LAW , which set out the conditions under which bail could be forfeited . On DATE the ORG granted the applicant bail against payment of security in the amount of CZK MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL ) . It justified the amount of the security by the exceptional gravity of the charges and the significance of the reasons for taking him into custody originally , in particular the high risk that he would abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant authorised his lawyer to pay the security in the amount set by the court . He also undertook to stay at his address in GPE and to attend hearings in his case , and declared that he was aware that the security would be forfeited if he did not comply . On DATE he was released on bail . CARDINAL of the conditions was that he stay at his address in GPE and receive mail there .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG authorised the applicant to leave GPE until DATE , on condition that he attended the first hearing , scheduled for DATE . This was the fourth time such a request by the applicant had been granted . The applicant had made CARDINAL previous trips to GPE , DATE , and had always returned .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant informed his lawyer that on DATE his passport , with an entry visa to GPE , had been stolen in GPE and that he was arranging for a new passport . As a result the hearing was adjourned to DATE .", "CARDINAL . A summons to the new hearing was sent to the applicant at his address in GPE but returned as undelivered . ORG also attempted to serve the summons on the applicant through his lawyer .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer sent certain documents to ORG , including a confirmation from the NORP authorities that the applicant \u2019s official registered address in GPE was in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the lawyer informed ORG that he did not have direct contact details for the applicant in GPE and that he had sent the summons for the hearing to the address given to him by CARDINAL of the applicant \u2019s co - accused .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant had still not received a new passport and he objected to the hearing being held in his absence , the hearing planned for CARDINAL to CARDINAL DATE was cancelled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having received no information from the applicant , made enquiries of ORG and the trade representation of GPE in GPE as to whether the applicant had applied for a new passport .", "CARDINAL . The date the applicant received a new passport from the NORP authorities is disputed between the parties . The Government claimed that it was on DATE , but according to the applicant it was not until DATE . The applicant did not inform ORG that he had obtained a new passport .", "CARDINAL . ORG scheduled another hearing for DATE and , on DATE , summoned the applicant through ORG at an address in the city of PERSON in GPE , which was registered in the case file as the applicant \u2019s place of residence in GPE . It also warned the applicant that the fact that he had not applied for a NORP visa , had remained in GPE and had not been in contact with the court was incompatible with his bail conditions , could be qualified as avoiding the criminal proceedings and could lead to the forfeiture of the sum deposited as security . The applicant was also advised of the possibility that criminal proceedings against him would be conducted in absentia .", "CARDINAL . The Russian Ministry of Justice informed the NORP authorities that the applicant was not registered and did not live at the address in PERSON , and that his current place of residence had not been established . It was thus not possible to deliver the summons to the hearing .", "CARDINAL . Nevertheless , the applicant found out about the scheduled hearing and obtained a short - term visa allowing him to visit GPE DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , however , the applicant sent a fax to ORG requesting adjournment of the hearing , referring to unspecified health problems and stating that he now had new lawyers , who would need time to study the case . He did not give his address in GPE . Consequently , ORG was obliged to adjourn the trial once again .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked ORG to request the NORP authorities to deliver a summons to the applicant to a hearing scheduled for DATE , at the address in PERSON or in PERSON . However , the summons for the trial was not served on the applicant until DATE , in Udomlya . On DATE ORG again cancelled the hearing .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to conduct the criminal proceedings against the applicant in absentia . It stated that the applicant had been avoiding the criminal proceedings by staying out of the country , that he had not returned to GPE since DATE and that he had created serious difficulties for the conduct of the trial by staying in GPE . The court also found the applicant \u2019s excuse for not attending the hearing on DATE , namely that he had health problems , totally inadequate . It further observed that the applicant was not respecting the bail conditions he had agreed to , namely that he would appear at hearings and that he would stay at his place of residence in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL to DATE , DATE and DATE hearings took place before ORG in the proceedings against the applicant in absentia .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG fully acquitted the applicant , holding that he had not committed any criminal offence but had merely engaged in standard and transparent business activities .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG upheld that judgment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , at the applicant \u2019s request , ruled that the bail should be returned to the applicant , as he had not been duly informed about the consequences of not complying with the conditions of bail . Moreover , none of the situations envisaged by LAW for forfeiting the bail was applicable .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the High Court quashed that decision and ruled that the bail was forfeited . It held that the applicant must have known about the possibility of forfeiture of the bail even though he had not been formally informed about it because his requests for release on bail had contained declarations that he had been aware of the possibility of forfeiture should he break the bail conditions . It also held that it was true that for some time the applicant had been unable to return to GPE because he had lost his passport and the NORP authorities had taken time to issue him with a new visa . However , the applicant had failed to collect correspondence at the address in PERSON , which was one of the addresses he had given to the prosecuting authorities , and thus letters from the court could not be delivered to him in time . It was also clear from the applicant \u2019s behaviour that he was avoiding criminal prosecution by remaining out of the country . Nor had he kept in contact with ORG , even though he had known about the proceedings . The conditions for forfeiture of the bail under LAW were thus fulfilled , and in particular the applicant had been in hiding , had failed to inform the relevant authorities of his place of residence , and had thus frustrated delivery of an official letter .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal against that decision , arguing that it was unjust that such a large sum should be forfeited , even though he had not committed any crime . He also disputed the findings of ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal as manifestly ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALa \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that individuals in pre - trial detention may be released on bail with a minimum security of CZK CARDINAL,CARDINAL , the actual amount being determined by the court , depending on the particular circumstances of the accused and the case .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW ( \u00a7 CARDINAL at the relevant time ) of that provision bail will be forfeited , inter alia , if the accused absconds , goes into hiding or does not inform the relevant authorities of a change of place of residence , and thus frustrates delivery of an official letter . Under LAW ( \u00a7 CARDINAL at the relevant time ) the accused must be informed in advance of the conditions under which bail may be forfeited ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"]}
