ORG Mr PERSON lives at GPE , near PERSON .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE ORG municipal council granted PERSON ORG planning permission for the construction of new commercial premises , subject to various detailed conditions : CARDINAL groceries should be built , each with appropriate commercial and sanitary amenities and separate entrances ; and a dividing wall was to be erected between the CARDINAL shops .", "At a later stage the applicant informed the council that he was envisaging opening a supermarket on the LOC , whereupon the council drew his attention to the specifications in the planning permission , which allowed only for CARDINAL different smaller shops to be built , with separate entrances and divided by a party wall . They further warned the applicant that failure to comply with these specifications would result in the works being immediately halted .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the council ordered the applicant to suspend the works . An inspection of the site had shown that , contrary to the terms of the planning permission , CARDINAL larger shop was being built instead of the CARDINAL smaller ones . The applicant had thus disregarded several conditions of the planning permission .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the PERSON district authority ( ORG ) served a \" sentence order \" ( PERSON ) on the applicant pursuant to sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) and CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Tiroler PERSON - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . According to the order , it had been established that the applicant had not only failed to erect the party wall as well as certain amenities , but had also opened an additional entrance , considerably enlarged the LOC , built an additional wall and created CARDINAL large shop instead of the CARDINAL smaller ones originally planned . In so doing , the applicant had carried out works without planning permission .", "Mr PERSON was ordered to pay a fine of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) with DATE imprisonment in default of payment , plus costs . An appeal by him to the LOC regional government ( ORG PERSON ) was dismissed on DATE on the ground , among others , that the works carried out by the applicant not only failed to comply with the permission granted but were in part illegal .", "CARDINAL . ORG Mr PERSON then applied to ORG ) , alleging , inter alia , a violation of LAW ) of the LAW in that he had not been able to bring his case , or have an oral hearing held , before a tribunal which conformed with that provision ( article CARDINAL ) . On DATE ORG declined to accept the case for adjudication under LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ( Bundes- Verfassungsgesetz - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) as raising questions concerning the application of ordinary law ( einfaches PERSON ) ; in so far as the complaint did raise issues of constitutional law , ORG found that the application did not have sufficient prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . ORG The applicant then requested to have his case transferred to ORG ( Verwaltungsgerichtshof ) , with which grounds of appeal against the administrative authorities ' decision were subsequently lodged .", "CARDINAL . ORG On DATE the applicant 's appeal was dismissed by ORG pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( Verwaltungsgerichtshofsgesetz - see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . With regard to the complaints concerning LAW , the court pointed out that LAW ( GPE ) did not confer a general right to a hearing before the administrative authorities . Only in special circumstances was a hearing to be held .", "ORG then dealt with the remaining complaints as follows :", "\" The applicant further submitted that the impugned decision dealt only with the obligation , noted in the decision at first instance , to obtain permission not to erect the dividing wall , and not with the obligation to obtain permission for the other - in his view minimal - failures to comply with the plan . But as , he maintained , the question whether these other failures to comply with the plan might lead to the applicant 's being punished was of importance if the failure to erect the wall was not punishable , the reasoning was inadequate . This submission is inaccurate , because the respondent authority did in fact , as it was entitled to do , take it for granted that planning permission was necessary for all the measures mentioned in the original decision . The major building works undertaken by the applicant were , as the file shows , not covered by permission from the planning authorities . There was also clearly a consistent intention to go ahead and build in disregard of the planning regulations . The applicant further overlooks that , quite apart from the principle that planning permission was necessary for such a building project , permission could never have been given for a shopping centre such as was built in the instant case , having regard to the provision in section CARDINAL(b ) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act , which was declared constitutional by ORG in a decision ( B CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of DATE .", "During the planning - application proceedings Mr GPE acted as the applicant for planning permission and as the owner of the land and the building on it . The [ Z. ] firm put itself forward as the future user of the building . The applicant never disputed during the administrative criminal proceedings that he was the person for whom the building was being constructed and that he was thus liable in administrative criminal law . His submission that the dividing wall was not built not on his orders but on those of the [ Z. ] firm that was using the commercial premises can therefore not exonerate him as he bore the responsibility for accepting and carrying out the orders of the future occupier . The suggestion set out for the first time in the statement of facts in the supplementary application that the building was being constructed for another firm is a new submission that is inadmissible in administrative proceedings by virtue of CARDINAL ) of LAW .", "It was further submitted that the suspension of the building works that had been ordered had made it impossible to erect the dividing wall , although this could have been done without substantial expenditure even after the building work had stopped , so that there had been no negligence .", "This submission likewise can not assist the applicant . As the evidence and the applicant 's submission clearly show , there had been no intention to build the dividing wall even before building work was suspended ; on the contrary , the applicant deliberately refrained from doing so in order to secure a review of section CARDINAL(b ) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act by ORG . Furthermore , at the time when the building works were suspended , there were other important failures to comply with the planning permission for which approval would have been needed ( see in the statement of facts the details of the findings made by the authority on DATE during an inspection of the works ) . The subsequent suspension of building work is accordingly of no legal significance in the present context .", "The respondent authority also rightly noted that the very fact of the repeatedly expressed intention not to erect the dividing wall and to maintain the building in issue in a state that did not comply with the planning permission and for which no approval had been given showed that there had been culpable intent . Similarly , as the respondent authority rightly recognised , the theoretical possibility that ORG might declare section CARDINAL(b ) of the Tyrol ORG unconstitutional can not be prayed in aid as a mitigating circumstance . Contrary to the applicant 's submissions , this purpose could have been achieved other than through failing to comply with the planning permission by not erecting the dividing wall and carrying out unauthorised works . It was open to the applicant at the outset to make an application for planning permission to build large - scale commercial LOC , a shopping centre , and in this way challenge section CARDINAL(b ) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act in ORG . The submission on this point therefore fails .", "As to the submission that , contrary to what was stated in the impugned decision , the authority ( municipal council ) had agreed to the dividing wall not being built after a report had been made by a fire - safety expert , the applicant is referred to the evidence given by the chairman of the municipal council and to the note for the file made by him on DATE of the meeting , from which it is quite clear that there was disagreement between the participants over the question whether authorisation was needed not to build the dividing wall and that the applicant was expressly warned by the municipal council that under LAW of FAC read together with section CARDINAL(b ) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act , a building scheme that was altered in this way could not be authorised . The applicant is mistaken in suggesting that the statement made by the legal representative of the [ Z. ] firm , who was also present at the meeting , constitutes a ground for excluding his guilt . From the observations filed by counsel for the applicant on the evidence given by the chairman of the municipal council it appears that the whole question of suspending the building works and the issue of the constitutionality of section CARDINAL(b ) of the Tyrol Town and Country Planning Act were discussed and the possibility of challenging that provision in ORG envisaged . The municipal council was allegedly made aware of this ' outcome of the negotiations ' . The applicant himself , however , states in his application that there was disagreement among those taking part in the discussions as to the question of the need for authorisation not to build the dividing wall , with the municipal council assuming that such authorisation was necessary whereas the representative of the [ Z. ] firm assumed it was sufficient merely to report the fact . The applicant thus himself admits that , contrary to later statements in the application and in the observations on the evidence given by the chairman of the municipal council , no agreement was reached between the municipal council and the applicant , so that the assumption that there was a ground here for excluding the applicant 's guilt is invalid on this ground alone . Nor can ORG find that the respondent authority committed any significant procedural irregularities in this respect in the reasons given for the impugned decision . The submission on this point is accordingly unfounded .", "The respondent authority dealt at length and accurately with the grounds for the assessment of punishment and with the assessment of punishment in general , so that it can not be criticised in this respect either .", "... \"", "CARDINAL .
