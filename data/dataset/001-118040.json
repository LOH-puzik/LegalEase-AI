The report was signed by PERSON and CARDINAL prison officers who were present during the search . The parties agreed that CARDINAL of them had been a man ( Mr F. ) ; the identity and sex of the second officer was in dispute : the Government claimed that it had been a woman , \u201c L - va \u201d ; the applicant insisted that it had been a man , \u201c L - vich \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The investigators claimed that the note had contained instructions about exercising influence on witnesses and interfering with the investigation . On DATE ORG asked ORG to disbar PERSON for acting in breach of the law and the lawyers\u2019 code of ethics . The applicant , as President of ORG , publicly criticised the request by ORG .", "CARDINAL .

The presenter then asked the applicant about the relationship between the GPE and ORG , implying that it was rather strained . The applicant denied that any tension existed and added :", "\u201c I have to say that we have now examined the matter of lawyer PERSON There was no attempt to pass any note from Mr GPE outside the remand centre . There were no grounds for carrying out a search ( \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0441\u043a ) which , by the way , was performed by men who rummaged ( \u0448\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438 ) about the body of the woman lawyer . Evidence obtained by criminal or unlawful means has no legal value . There is nothing , absolutely nothing , in PERSON records that could warrant her disbarment . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

On DATE , remand prison PERSON and warders PERSON and PERSON lodged defamation claims against the applicant and the ORG television company with ORG of GPE . They claimed that the applicant had falsely stated that male officers had \u201c rummaged \u201d about PERSON body and carried out a \u201c search \u201d on her , whereas they had merely \u201c inspected \u201d her documents . Since the domestic law made a distinction between a \u201c search \u201d ( \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0441\u043a ) and an \u201c inspection \u201d ( \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440 ) , the applicant \u2019s statement amounted to an allegation of a breach of the NORP law that was false and damaging both to the professional reputation of the remand prison and to the honour and dignity of its officers . They sought a rectification and compensation in respect of non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . In the defamation proceedings the ORG heard many witnesses and , in particular , the warders of the remand prison who had taken part in the incident involving counsel PERSON of them , PERSON , testified as follows :", "\u201c I received a phone call and I was invited to take part in the drafting of a report . When I arrived , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON were in the office . PERSON was drafting the report . A. snatched a piece of paper and began tearing it apart . We removed the document [ from her ] , I signed the report and left . \u201d", "CARDINAL . PERSON described the way in which the documents had been removed from her :", "\u201c I was subjected to a humiliating procedure , as a woman and as a lawyer . They took the materials of the defence away from me by force . How is it possible to take the materials , without touching me , while I was holding onto them ? ... Could there be any contact , other than bodily contact , if I was clutching the materials to my chest and the prison employees were tearing them away from me ? It was not just my hands that they touched . [ They touched ] the clothing that was covering my body . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE ORG formally rejected the ORG \u2019s request for PERSON disbarment . It found , in particular , that the inspection ( \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440 ) carried out on the person of PERSON on DATE and the seizure of her materials had been unlawful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment on the defamation claim , finding as follows :", "\u201c It was established at the court hearing that on DATE a televised discussion between ... PERSON and the lawyer PERSON had been broadcast live on the ORG channel . The presenters did not edit the text of the interventions by Mr PERSON or PERSON ... PERSON was connected with the presenter via a direct link , the defendant PERSON was present in the studio . It can be seen from a video recording which the court examined ... that PERSON and the defendant made statements of a controversial nature . The participants put questions to each other and replied to questions from the presenters . ...", "The court considers that the statements by the defendant [ Mr PERSON ] were simply an expression of his opinion on an event that had attracted public attention and was widely discussed at the time . During the show \u201c The Country and the World \u201d on DATE , a public official and a lawyer held a discussion in which they expressed different opinions on the same event . The statements by the defendant Mr PERSON were not offensive and did not damage the GPE honour , dignity or professional reputation . The defendant , in his reply to the presenter \u2019s question , did not mention either remand prison no . CARDINAL or the plaintiffs F. and B. ...", "The plaintiff \u2013 remand prison no . DATE alleged a violation of the rights of individuals rather than those of prison no . CARDINAL . ... In the instant case , the statements by the defendant , PERSON , did not contain allegations about the plaintiff , remand prison no . CARDINAL , nor did Mr PERSON \u2019s statements damage its reputation . It follows that the claims by remand prison no . CARDINAL are unlawful and unjustified because the plaintiff seeks the rectification of allegations concerning its employees .", "The claims by the plaintiffs F. and B. are likewise unjustified because the statements by the defendant did not mention any names , still less the plaintiff \u2019s names . Moreover , ... there was no mention of their place of work or place of residence , or of their appearance or characteristic features , their rank or their position ; the discussion was not accompanied by any photographs or video footage of the plaintiffs ; nor were their voices broadcast . It follows that the defendant \u2019s statements did not contain any information damaging to the honour or dignity of Mr F. or Mr B.", "[ The court rejects as ] unfounded the arguments by remand prison no . CARDINAL to the effect that the discussion was preceded by footage showing a building with its postal address , which could have enabled television viewers to recognise PERSON remand prison no . CARDINAL . Neither PERSON nor PERSON mentioned remand prison no . CARDINAL in their replies . Moreover , it was the ORG channel that decided to broadcast the footage featuring the building with its address at the beginning of the show , but the plaintiffs have lodged no defamation claim against the channel ...", "Having regard to the above - stated , the court finds that the claims are unjustified and must be rejected . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The remand centre , PERSON , and PERSON , all lodged statements of appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG quashed ORG judgment and granted the defamation claims by CARDINAL plaintiffs , finding as follows :", "\u201c ... the conclusion of the [ district ] court to the effect that the statements made by the defendant in a live television show did not damage the reputation [ of the plaintiffs ] is not correct . The statements did damage the honour and dignity of the prison officers PERSON and PERSON and the professional reputation of remand prison no . CARDINAL because they actually contained an accusation that the male prison officers had searched the female lawyer in a degrading manner . ...", "It can be seen from the statements by the witnesses PERSON and PERSON , the personal inspection report , and the conclusions of the Qualifications Panel of ORG that the prison officers did not carry out a search on PERSON , contrary to what PERSON alleged , but the [ district ] court did not take this fact into account ... The law distinguishes between the terms \u2018 inspection\u2019 and \u2018 ORG , and the defendant PERSON , a professional lawyer , could not have been unaware of that distinction . Although he had at his disposal reliable information that the prison officers had carried out an inspection of PERSON documents rather than searched her , he made untrue statements in a live television show ...", "Further , the [ city ] court can not agree with the [ district ] court \u2019s conclusion that the defendant [ Mr PERSON ] did not identify any of the plaintiffs by name ... That conclusion contradicted the operative part of the judgment , in which the [ district ] court found that the incident ... had taken place on the premises of remand prison no . CARDINAL and concerned the removal of a note from PERSON ... The ORG channel showed the building at CARDINAL GPE NORP Street , and the defendant Mr PERSON later made the contested statements . In those circumstances , the professional reputation of remand prison no . CARDINAL had been undermined and it had standing to seek judicial protection from defamation . The plaintiffs F. and B. , who were employees of the remand prison and who had taken part in the inspection of [ PERSON ] papers ... also had standing to sue in defamation . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
