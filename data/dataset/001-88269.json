GERMANY", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Isabelle Berro-Lef\u00e8vre;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Volodymyr Butkevych;Zdravka Kalaydjieva", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the Court by Ms PERSON Pahl , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The applicant is an electrical engineering technician and a member of ORG of GPE ( ORG , hereafter , \u201c the NORP \u201d ) . In DATE he was a local chairperson of that party . The ORG was considered right - wing extremist and populist and was under scrutiny by ORG and those of various GPE ( L\u00e4nder ) . The ORG has not been declared unconstitutional by ORG in accordance with LAW of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant commenced his compulsory military service , which was to end on DATE . To serve one \u2019s compulsory military service is an obligation imposed by LAW without conferring a right to the conscript to be enlisted . A conscript receives approximately ORG CARDINAL net allowance a month . On DATE the applicant \u2019s superior notified ORG of his membership of and functions in the ORG . On DATE he was appointed as a Private First Class . The applicant performed his duties within the army conscientiously and without any disciplinary reprimand . He did not carry out any political activities within the army .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s military service was terminated with effect from CARDINAL DATE . His presence in the army was found to endanger its integrity and order within the meaning of section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL No . CARDINAL of the Compulsory Military Service Act ( PERSON ) on account of his membership of and functions in the ORG , a party considered to be right - wing extremist and populist . Moreover , the toleration of an ORG functionary within the army would harm its reputation .", "On DATE the objection he filed was rejected on the ground that his membership of and functions in the ORG were in breach of a soldier \u2019s special duty of loyalty to LAW . His membership of and functions in the ORG , a party that pursued unconstitutional aims , manifested his lack of readiness to defend the free democratic order within the meaning of LAW , which posed a danger to military order .", "On DATE ORG rejected a claim lodged by the applicant , finding that the order of CARDINAL DATE gave sufficient reasons to consider that his continuing military service would pose a serious danger to military order . LAW \u00a7 CARDINAL No . CARDINAL of the Compulsory Military Service Act gave the authorities no discretion where conduct posing a serious danger to military order was established . Military order within the meaning of that provision embraced the readiness to defence which was guaranteed , inter alia , by the army \u2019s bond to the constitutional order of which it was a guarantor . Relying on the DATE annual reports on the protection of LAW and the NORP State Ministry of the ORG the court established that at the relevant time the ORG aimed at DATE if need be violent \u2013 subversion of the democratic order . It referred to several statements by the party leader who pursued the political aim to \u201c install the ORG in absolute power \u201d . Moreover it referred to the speech given by a convicted neo - Nazi at the party congress , who appealed for a \u201c revolution which could not be achieved without blood and victims \u201d . The court found that the above statements by party functionaries had to be attributed to the applicant in his function as a local chairperson at the relevant time . Therefore , his further presence in the NORP army posed in itself a danger to military order even though his behaviour within the army did not give rise to any complaints . The court clarified that his dismissal did not result in the loss of his rank .", "On DATE ORG rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant . It endorsed the reasons given by the lower instances and observed that the applicant \u2019s holding of functions in the ORG during his military service was in breach of a soldier \u2019s special duty of loyalty to LAW , which was manifested in section CARDINAL of LAW and was a requisite for the functioning of the army . The ORG \u2019s anti - constitutional attitude , which was expressed by the party leader , had to be attributed to the applicant , who held functions in the party and failed to dissociate himself from those statements . The court referred to ORG settled case - law that it was not contrary to LAW that the NORP army drew consequences from the applicant \u2019s membership of a party which had not been declared unconstitutional , as that provision merely protected the political activity of the party members .", "On DATE the ORG refused to admit a constitutional complaint by the applicant . It found the arguments given by the lower instances sufficient to justify the termination of his military service , which was therefore in line with the German Constitution and particularly with the prohibition of discrimination .", "\u201c CARDINAL . Parties which , through their aims or the conduct of their members , seek to damage or to overthrow the free democratic constitutional system or to endanger the existence of GPE shall be held to be anti - constitutional . The ORG shall determine the question of anti - constitutionality . \u201d", "\u00a7 CARDINAL [ ... ] Furthermore [ military service ] shall be terminated , if [ ... ]", "CARDINAL . based on his previous conduct [ the conscript \u2019s ] continued presence in the army would pose a serious danger to military order or to the security of the troops , [ ... ]", "\u201c A soldier must recognise the free democratic order within the meaning of LAW and must act at all times in such a way as to uphold it . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
