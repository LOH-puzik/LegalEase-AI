FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants , PERSON , and PERSON , are NORP nationals , who were born in DATE and DATE , respectively , and live in GPE . The first applicant is represented before the ORG by the second applicant .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "Until DATE at the time of retirement a person was granted , inter alia , ( a ) an employment pension which was counted on the basis of his or her salary earned prior to the retirement , amounting to a maximum of CARDINAL per cent of that salary , and ( b ) a national pension \u2019s basic amount ( kansanel\u00e4kkeen pohjaosa , folkpensionens basdel ) , if the person was entitled thereto on the basis of his age and/or number of DATE of employment .", "DATE , employees were obliged by law to deposit part of their salaries in individual accounts kept by ORG for the purpose of accumulating employment pensions for their retirement . From DATE onwards these contributions were no longer deposited on accounts earmarked for the employees themselves but went into the general pension fund .", "The CARDINAL parts of the pension ( the above - mentioned ( a ) and ( b ) ) were considered together with the result that a pensioner \u2019s employment pension was reduced by the amount of the national pension \u2019s basic amount so that the total amount did not exceed the maximum limit of CARDINAL per cent of his salary . The national pension \u2019s basic amount was granted to all persons entitled to it without their requesting it ( although it was apparently possible to refuse it ) , reducing automatically the amount of the employment pension .", "In DATE LAW was amended ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) as a budgetary savings measure to the effect that , as from DATE , the national pension such as the old - age pension was to be replaced by a pension calculated with reference to new criteria . Those whose total income in the form of other pensions and various entitlements exceeded certain ceilings would no longer be entitled to a national pension . In such a case the so - called basic amount of their national pension would be reduced by MONEY annually DATE , when payment thereof would cease .", "Following a public debate on the matter ORG passed LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on DATE , according to which pensioners whose employment pension has been twice reduced on the basis of their national pension \u2019s basic amount , are entitled to receive a compensation for their loss as from DATE . The compensatory amount will be CARDINAL per month , depending on the amount of the pension at issue . The applicants in the present case will not benefit from LAW as their pensions were reduced only once . So they will not receive any compensation for their loss .", "The applicants are CARDINAL retired social workers . They both worked for GPE for DATE until their retirement in DATE when they were granted an employment pension but no national pension \u2019s basic amount as they had not yet reached the required age . Their employment pensions amounted to MONEY of their salaries .", "In DATE , when they reached DATE , they were granted a national pension \u2019s basic amount of FAC ( MONEY ) per month . The CARDINAL pensions ( a ) and ( b ) were , however , considered together with the result that the total amount of the CARDINAL pensions was the same as the earlier pension had already been ( MONEY of the applicants\u2019 salaries ) .", "In DATE their national pension \u2019s basic amounts were affected by the LAW as described above . That lead to a situation in which the applicants now only receive a pension which is MONEY of their salaries on which their pensions were originally based .", "The applicants have used all domestic remedies . The appeal instance decisions were given by ORG in DATE . According to the decisions of the domestic courts , it is impossible to revoke the reduction of the pensions which is based on the amendment to LAW as the courts can not override a law . The applicants have also complained to ORG without any success ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
