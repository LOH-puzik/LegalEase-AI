NORP The applicant party was founded in DATE and is based in PERSON . It claims to represent the interests of the NORP minority in GPE but limits its political activities to ORG ( GPE ) where LOC traditionally settle . The applicant party estimates the number of people of NORP origin within the territory of ORG at CARDINAL out of the total population of CARDINAL . The PERSON have their own language and cultural identity which is similar among the West Frisians in the GPE and ORG in GPE , while ORG in GPE have mainly stopped speaking their language .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW GPE ( PERSON , see relevant domestic law , paragraph CARDINAL below ) , parliamentary seats \u2013 apart from those seats attributed to the candidates obtaining the majority of the votes in their constituency \u2013 are allocated under the D\u2019Hondt system of proportional representation . Under section QUANTITY of LAW , seats are attributed only to parties which obtain a minimum threshold of PERCENT of the total of votes validly cast . This threshold is also included in LAW of LAW ( see relevant domestic law , paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of CARDINAL DATE to the Prime Minister of PERSON and by letter of CARDINAL DATE to the President of ORG , the applicant party asked to be granted an exemption from the minimum threshold for the upcoming elections . The request was refused .", "CARDINAL . In the elections of DATE , the applicant party attained an overall total of CARDINAL votes , amounting to PERCENT of all votes validly cast . Irrespective of the minimum threshold , the number of votes received would not have been sufficient to obtain a parliamentary mandate .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant party lodged an objection against the validity of the election result . The applicant party submitted , in particular , that it represented the interests of the NORP people residing in GPE . The NORP people formed a national minority within the meaning of LAW for ORG ( \u201c the LAW \u201d , ORG . CARDINAL , see ORG documents , paragraphs CARDINAL below ) . The applicant party complained , in particular , that the minimum threshold resulted in their factual exclusion from participating in the parliamentary elections and amounted to discriminatory treatment vis\u00e0vis other small political parties which were , at least theoretically , capable of reaching that threshold . The applicant party further relied on LAW in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Election Supervisor of Lower Saxony ( Landeswahlleiter ) , jointly with ORG , submitted written comments on the objection . They considered , firstly , that it was doubtful whether the group of NORP qualified as a national minority . Under the declaration submitted by ORG when signing LAW , only the NORP of NORP citizenship and members of the NORP people with NORP citizenship were recognised as national minorities in GPE . Conversely , the declaration merely stated that LAW also applied to the ethnic group of NORP with NORP citizenship . It was thus clear from the wording of the declaration that the PERSON did not qualify as a national minority . Even assuming that the ethnic group of PERSON had the status of a national minority , this did not necessarily entail the obligation to exempt the applicant party from obtaining the minimum threshold of PERCENT of the votes . There was no such obligation under LAW or under LAW or under LAW . Neither could such an obligation be derived from section QUANTITY of LAW ( Bundeswahlgesetz ) , as the ORG were competent to pass their own electoral laws without being bound by LAW . The privileges enjoyed by ORG in ORG did not allow any further conclusions , as the protection and promotion of the NORP minority was prescribed by the constitution of the respective Land . Finally , and again assuming the minority status of the ethnic group of PERSON , it was questionable whether the applicant party would qualify as the party of the NORP national minority . The assessment of this question did not only depend on the party \u2019s vision of itself , but on an overall assessment of all factual and legal circumstances .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG on ORG ) held a public hearing on the applicant party \u2019s objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant party \u2019s objection as being unfounded . Relying on the submissions made by ORG jointly with ORG , the ORG considered that an obligation to exempt the applicant party from the minimum threshold could neither be derived from LAW , nor from ORG . It followed that the applicant \u2019s objection was unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( PERSON ) . The applicant party requested ORG to quash the parliamentary decision of DATE and to declare the result of the elections held on DATE invalid ; or , alternatively , to declare section QUANTITY of LAW unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Constitutional Court of Lower Saxony rejected the applicant party \u2019s complaint as being unfounded . ORG observed , at the outset , that the relevant provisions did not allow for an exemption from the minimum threshold for national minorities . ORG further considered that the minimum threshold interfered with the principle of equality of the vote . This interference was justified because it pursued the legitimate aim of safeguarding the functioning of the elected parliament . Parliamentary work within a democracy necessitated that the parliaments remain able to take decisions and that they were not inhibited in their work by the participation of splinter parties . ORG further referred to the case - law of ORG regarding the PERCENT minimum threshold . There was no obligation under LAW to exempt parties of national minorities from the PERCENT threshold . It was true that certain electoral laws provided for such exemptions . This was , in particular , the case with LAW , which provided an exemption for parties of national minorities , and with LAW and GPE , providing for exemptions for the parties of the NORP and the NORP minorities , respectively . However , both ORG provided special rights for national minorities in their respective constitutions . No such provisions could be found in LAW . ORG had declared the respective provision in LAW constitutional , even though LAW did not contain special rights for national minorities . However , ORG had also emphasised that the legislator enjoyed a margin of appreciation in this respect . ORG finally considered that the alleged right could be derived neither from ORG nor from LAW . LAW did not contain any special rights for national minorities . Relying on the wording of LAW , the court considered that this provision did not contain any obligation to exempt national minorities from the minimum threshold , but left the question undecided as to how to create the conditions necessary for the effective participation of persons belonging to national minorities in public affairs . It followed that the contracting parties enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in this respect . In GPE , participation of national minorities in public life was already guaranteed by the constitutional system . By including the PERCENT threshold in LAW without providing for an exemption , ORG had given precedence to the functioning of the parliament over granting privileges to national minorities . Accordingly , ORG did not find it necessary to determine whether the PERSON qualified as a national minority and whether the applicant party qualified as the political party of this national minority ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "P1"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-3"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
