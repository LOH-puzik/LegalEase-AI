Although no explicit undertaking by GPE to abolish the death penalty was made at the moment of GPE 's accession to ORG DATE , such a requirement was regarded as implied in the general undertaking to comply with LAW ( see the reports of ORG commission on GPE 's compliance with its obligations and undertakings ( report of QUANTITY DATE , ORG .

On DATE the President of ORG submitted the applicant 's case to the President of the Republic for a decision whether or not to pardon him . In the accompanying letter the President of ORG expressed his opinion that the applicant should be pardoned and his death sentence replaced by a term of imprisonment . He argued that due consideration should be given to the fact that the applicant was a person of limited self - control abilities and had acted under distress when murdering his wife . The President of the Republic did not make a decision , leaving the question of pardon pending .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant wrote to the President of the Republic requesting to be pardoned and to the prosecution authorities seeking reopening of the criminal case .

CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . NORP The death penalty was an issue often debated DATE . A number of members of ORG expressed views in support of reintroducing executions whereas others sought the abolition of the death penalty . The media periodically discussed the topic . It was widely known that the abolition of the death penalty was urged by ORG and other international organisations and was a step towards GPE 's NORP integration .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period LAW was amended several times . Some amendments expanded the scope of the death penalty . At the same time , work started on a draft LAW which excluded the death penalty . In DATE an amendment to LAW introduced for the first time life imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The following attempts to reintroduce executions were made by supporters of the death penalty :", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Chair of ORG and another member of ORG introduced a motion proposing the annulment of the ORG 's decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a similar proposal was introduced in ORG by a minority parliamentary group , ORG . CARDINAL parliamentary committees discussed the issue and voted against reintroducing executions . On DATE ORG held a hearing on both proposals which were defeated .", "CARDINAL . The issue of reintroducing executions was discussed several times in the ORG elected at DATE . There were CARDINAL motions : CARDINAL for a parliamentary vote on restarting executions and CARDINAL for calling a referendum .", "CARDINAL . The first proposal was discussed by ORG , which supported the idea of reintroducing executions by a majority of CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL . Thereafter , a member of ORG on several occasions unsuccessfully sought to have the motion discussed by a plenary session of the ORG . On CARDINAL occasion the motion gathered the required number of votes to be entered on the DATE agenda , but eventually was not discussed . Most proposals to include the issue on the agenda of the ORG 's plenary session were defeated through abstention votes .", "CARDINAL . The first motion for a referendum was defeated on a procedural ground as the proposed date in DATE did not allow sufficient organisation time . The second proposal for a referendum , filed on DATE , was considered by ORG on DATE and was defeated by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , with CARDINAL abstentions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a proposal for restarting executions was introduced by opposition deputies . It was discussed by ORG and was defeated on DATE by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . According to CARDINAL of the Execution of Sentences Act , as in force at the time of the moratorium on executions , persons awaiting execution were to be detained in complete isolation , correspondence and visits being only possible if permitted by the competent prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Director of ORG instructed prisons administrations that the ORG 's decision suspending executions also suspended by implication this restrictive regime of detention .", "CARDINAL . The instruction stated , in so far as relevant , that persons sentenced to death should be held in individual cells or together with other persons sentenced to death or detained under a \u201c special regime \u201d ( the regime of detention of recidivists and , after DATE , persons sentenced to life imprisonment : sections CARDINAL and ORG of LAW as in force at the time ) .

If possible , they could work in the cell .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Director of ORG and a prosecutor of ORG issued an instruction which stated that , \u201c in view of the continuing moratorium on executions \u201d , persons sentenced to death should be allowed unlimited correspondence , TIME DATE outdoor walk , CARDINAL visit per month and the receipt of CARDINAL food parcels and CARDINAL packs of cigarettes per month and small amounts of money .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was detained in the PERSON prison , in a wing for prisoners under the \u201c special regime \u201d provided for by section QUANTITY of the Regulations on the Application of the Execution of Sentences Act , approximately CARDINAL inmates . He was moved several times , but was always in cells measuring CARDINAL by QUANTITY .", "CARDINAL . It appears that during most of the above period the applicant was alone in a cell . Other prisoners sentenced to death and detained in the same prison as the applicant were allowed to share a cell DATE . It is unclear whether it was possible for the applicant to request to share a cell with another prisoner .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's cell invariably had CARDINAL bed with a mattress , CARDINAL blankets , a metal chamber pot and a centrally operated radio loudspeaker . There was no chair or a table . Until DATE , when all cell windows were replaced by larger ones , the window in the applicant 's cell was very small , covering QUANTITY , and did not allow sufficient light and fresh air .", "CARDINAL . There was one CARDINALWatts electric bulb in the cell . As it was installed on the wall above the door , its light was insufficient .", "CARDINAL . The central heating pipes in cells for special regime prisoners were covered by a layer of bricks . According to the applicant that impeded the normal heating and as a result it was often cold in DATE . According to the Government the bricks accumulated heat and released it normally .", "CARDINAL . Inmates were given TIME out - of - cell time in the morning in an open yard . There they could walk together with other inmates from the special regime wing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The cells of special regime prisoners had no electrical sockets . Despite an amendment of the relevant instructions in DATE which authorised the use of radio and television receivers by special regime prisoners , such devices could therefore only be used on batteries .", "CARDINAL . As they were considered to be high risk prisoners , inmates sentenced to death were not eligible for outside work assignment . As a result , the applicant used to spend TIME a day on his own in his cell . Food was delivered CARDINAL times a day in the cell . The applicant was permitted to leave his cell during TIME walk , again in TIME for TIME for use of the sanitary facilities , and when receiving visits or for medical consultations . Also , inmates could have a shower once per week , for TIME .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL or two visits of TIME were allowed per DATE . Visits by lawyers were not limited . At least on CARDINAL occasion the applicant was visited by journalists .", "CARDINAL . During the relevant period there has been no limitation on correspondence . The applicant could also receive food parcels and money . He could buy small food and toilet items from the prison shop , if he had the money to do so . He could borrow books from the prison library .", "CARDINAL . The applicant received the same medical service as all other prison inmates . DATE he was seen CARDINAL times by a dentist and many times by other medical doctors . There is an infirmary opened TIME per day .", "CARDINAL . Ever since his imprisonment in DATE the applicant has been monitored by the prison psychological service . An assessment written by CARDINAL of its employees on DATE and submitted by the ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c [ I]n crucial moments , such as the moratorium on executions and the ensuing period of debates about the abolition of the death penalty ... [ the applicant ] was unable to cope on his own with the fear and anxiety that had gripped him : his neurotic and depressive complaints reappeared , as well as his ... defence reactions ( ... denial of any guilt ... ) .", "During that period a number of psychological consultations and examinations were carried out with the [ applicant ] ... [ These ] brought about a temporary improvement : his neurotic and depressive reactions and his fright phased out but may reappear if the situation changes ...", "[ The applicant ] 's personality is characterised by contradictions , domineering tendencies and aspirations ... He ... seeks justifications [ in respect of the murder ] and aspires to preserve his self - respect , adopting the pose of a victim ...", "The [ applicant 's ] current need of self assertion - which on a behavioural level is manifested by an aspiration for increased physical and psychological activity and a pursuit of positive social reactions - may , in the situation where there are no changes in his legal status , provoke negative psychological developments by reactivating his pessimistic attitude and the feeling of lack of prospects ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant has also been seen several times by psychiatrists at the prison hospital and by outside psychiatrists . They were unanimous that the applicant did not have a mental disorder but displayed signs of \u201c psychopathy and emotional and volitional instability [ typical of ] a primitive personality \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , DATE , DATE and again in ORG DATE the applicant was admitted to the prison hospital and treated against neurosis , sleeplessness and loss of appetite . The applicant also complained that he was hearing voices and suffered from feelings of fear . He was treated with sedatives and other medicaments . The examinations revealed his good general condition . The doctors recommended frequent visits to the psychologist .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date he was examined as a matter of emergency as he had stated that he would hang himself . The psychiatrist at the prison hospital directed the applicant to a psychiatric hospital for treatment while noting that his behaviour disclosed a demonstrative element . On several occasions the doctors who examined the applicant noted that he simulated sensory disorders .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has not visited the PERSON prison where the applicant was detained .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE it visited , however , CARDINAL inmates sentenced to death and detained in the PERSON prison facilities and described the conditions of detention as follows :", "\u201c The material conditions in the cells left a great deal to be desired : mediocre access to natural light and weak artificial lighting ; inadequate heating ; cell furnishings in a poor state of repair ; dirty bed linen , etc . As regards out - of - cell activities , they were limited to TIME for use of the sanitary facilities , TIME outdoor exercise ( which the prisoners alleged was not guaranteed DATE ) and CARDINAL visit per month . The CARDINAL prisoners were not allowed to work ( not even inside their cells ) , nor to go to the library , the cinema room or the refectory ( their food was brought to the cell ) . In short , they were subject to an impoverished regime and , more particularly , were offered very little human contact . The latter consisted essentially of the possibility to talk to each other during outdoor exercise ( which they took together ) , and occasional dealings with prison officers . Practically the only forms of useful occupation at their disposal were reading newspapers and books , and writing letters .", "The above - described situation is in accordance with the rules concerning prisoners sentenced to death , adopted after the moratorium on the execution of the death penalty ... Nevertheless , in the ORG 's view it is not acceptable .", "It is generally acknowledged that all forms of solitary confinement without appropriate mental and physical stimulation are likely , in the long term , to have damaging effects , resulting in deterioration of mental faculties and social abilities . The delegation found that the regime applied to prisoners sentenced to death in FAC did not provide such stimulation .", "The ORG recommends that the regime applied to prisoners sentenced to death held in FAC , as well as in other prisons in GPE , be revised in order to ensure that they are offered purposeful activities and appropriate human contact . Further , the ORG recommends that steps be taken to improve the material conditions in the cells occupied at FAC by prisoners sentenced to death . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Historically , most Member States of ORG approached the question of the abolition of the death penalty by suspending executions pending debate on a final abolition . States which became members of ORG during DATE were urged by ORG to introduce moratoria on executions as a first step towards the abolition of the death penalty ( see , Report on the abolition of the death penalty in LOC , ORG . CARDINAL ( DATE ) ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG has held that \u201c in the absence of further compelling circumstances \u201d prolonged detention on death row per se does not constitute a violation of LAW ( prohibition of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ) ( see PERSON v. GPE , Views of DATE , communication no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , PERSON , ORG , communication no . CARDINAL ; and PERSON v. GPE and GPE , Views of DATE , communication no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Commission , when examining complaints by persons on death row , has found violations of LAW ( prohibiting cruel , infamous or unusual punishment of persons accused of offences ) and LAW and CARDINAL of ORG ( right to humane treatment and prohibition of torture , cruel , inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment ) mainly on the strength of facts concerning irregularities in the sentencing process , the material conditions and regime of detention and ill - treatment in prison , while also taking into account the length of the period spent on death row ( PERSON v. GPE , Case No . CARDINAL , Report No . CARDINAL , ORG / II.CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON v. GPE , Case No . CARDINAL , Report CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG , examining cases from GPE , had to decide whether the execution of a person following long delay after his sentence to death could amount to inhuman punishment or treatment contrary to those GPE ' Constitutions . Initially , ORG considered that a condemned person could not complain about delay of his execution caused by his resort to appellate proceedings ( PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL , ORG v. Attorney - General of GPE and GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL W.L.R. DATE ) , or indeed about any delay , \u201c whatever the reasons \u201d , including a temporary moratorium on executions which had been lifted ( PERSON v. Attorney - General of GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , departing from its earlier decisions , ORG held that to execute the appellants , who had spent DATE on death row and had on CARDINAL occasions lived through TIME stays of execution , would be unlawful as being inhuman punishment and therefore advised that their death sentences should be commuted to life imprisonment ( PERSON and PERSON v. The Attorney General for GPE and another [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In PERSON and PERSON , part of the relevant period was taken up by a temporary moratorium on executions .", "\u201c [ P]olitical debate on the desirability of retaining the death sentence in GPE ... resulted in a resolution of the ORG on DATE to suspend all executions for DATE pending the report of a ORG of inquiry . ORG was appointed in DATE . Before the ORG reported , an execution took place on DATE which drew a protest to ORG from the Chairman of the ORG . No further executions took place before the ORG reported in DATE . On CARDINALth DATE executions were resumed \u201d ( PERSON , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The judgment in PERSON and PERSON stated , inter alia :", "\u201c There is an instinctive revulsion against the prospect of hanging a man after he has been held under sentence of death for DATE . What gives rise to this instinctive revulsion ? The answer can only be our humanity ; we regard it as an inhuman act to keep a man facing the agony of execution over a long extended period of time . But before their Lordships condemn the act of execution as ' inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment ' within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) [ of LAW ] there are a number of factors that have to be balanced in weighing the delay . If delay is due entirely to the fault of the accused such as an escape from custody or frivolous and time wasting resort to legal procedures which amount to an abuse of process the accused can not be allowed to take advantage of that delay for to do so would be to permit the accused to use illegitimate means to escape the punishment inflicted upon him in the interest of protecting society against crime ...", "In their Lordships ' view a ORG that wishes to retain capital punishment must accept the responsibility of ensuring that execution follows as swiftly as practicable after sentence , allowing a reasonable time for appeal and consideration of reprieve . It is part of the human condition that a condemned man will take every opportunity to save his life through use of the appellate procedure . If the appellate procedure enables the prisoner to prolong the appellate hearings over DATE , the fault is to be attributed to the appellate system that permits such delay and not to the prisoner who takes advantage of it . Appellate procedures that echo down DATE are not compatible with capital punishment . The death row phenomenon must not become established as a part of our jurisprudence ...", "There may of course be circumstances which will lead ORG to recommend a respite in the carrying out of a death sentence , such as a political moratorium on the death sentence , or a petition on behalf of the appellants to [ international human rights bodies ] or a constitutional appeal to ORG . But if these respites cumulatively result in delay running into DATE an execution will be likely to infringe section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and call for commutation of the death sentence to life imprisonment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Further , calculating the normal length of relevant appellate proceedings in GPE and taking into consideration the time necessary for examination of applications to ORG and ORG , ORG held that :", "\u201c in any case in which execution is to take place DATE after sentence there will be strong grounds for believing that the delay is such as to constitute inhuman or degrading punishment or ... treatment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In cases which followed ORG accepted a claim that DATE and DATE also warranted a finding in favour of the appellant ( PERSON v. PERSON and Others [ DATE ] CARDINAL A.C. CARDINAL ) but dismissed appeals concerning shorter periods ( PERSON v. The Attorney General of the GPE of The GPE [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL ; ORG ) v. The Minister of ORG ( GPE ) [ DATE ] A.C. CARDINAL ; and PERSON and PERSON v. The Minister of ORG ( GPE ) [ DATE ] ORG CARDINAL ) and held that save in exceptional circumstances , periods of pre - sentence detention should not be taken into account since , inter alia , \u201c the state of mind of the person ... during this earlier period is not the agony of mind of a man facing execution , but ... anxiety and concern of the accused\u201d(Fisher , \u00a7 DATE ) . In PERSON and PERSON , ORG stated , inter alia :", "\u201c If a man has been sentenced to death , it is wrong to add other cruelties to the manner of his death ... In PERSON ... the [ ORG ] held that the execution after excessive delay was an inhuman punishment because it added to the penalty of death the additional torture of a long period of alternating hope and despair . It is not the delay in itself which is a cruel and unusual punishment ... , ' it is the act of hanging the man that is rendered cruel and unusual by the lapse of time \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that execution following inordinate delay after sentence of death violated LAW which provides that \u201c no one shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law \u201d and that the reasons for the delay were immaterial ( PERSON v. ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R. CARDINAL , PERSON and Others v. the ORG of ORG [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R. CARDINAL and Smt . PERSON v. State of GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.J. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . GPE ORG has refused to accept claims that lengthy detention on death row violated the prohibition , contained in LAW to LAW , of cruel and unusual punishment , emphasising that the delay is due to the convicted person 's own decision to make use of all possibilities to appeal ( PERSON v. GPE , CARDINAL US CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has held that NORP constitutional standards did not bar extradition to GPE of a defendant facing the death penalty ( PERSON v. GPE ( Minister of ORG ) , [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R. CARDINAL ) . However , in DATE it changed its approach and held that if the person being extradited could face the death penalty , constitutional standards required that in all but exceptional cases assurances must be sought from GPE that the death penalty would not be imposed or , if imposed , would not be carried out ( GPE v. PERSON , [ DATE ] CARDINAL S.C.R.
