THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE", "CARDINAL . The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . The present case concerns the circumstances surrounding the killing of the applicants\u2019 DATE brother PERSON during a police operation on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP On that date at TIME three plain - clothed police officers ( N. , B. and C. ) entered a QUANTITY apartment block to arrest a person suspected of armed robbery . According to their information , the suspect in question was supposed to be visiting his ex - girlfriend TIME , who lived on the fourth floor of the building .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , PERSON was coming down the stairs from the fourth floor with a group of CARDINAL friends . None of them was the suspect wanted by the police . CARDINAL young women ( S. and PERSON ) and a young man ( PERSON ) were at the front of the group and they passed the police officers between the third and second floor .", "CARDINAL . Upon passing the first part of the group CARDINAL of the police officers immediately apprehended PERSON and PERSON were several storeys up and saw the police officers as they approached the rest of the group . CARDINAL police officers rushed after PERSON , who started to run back up the stairs . They apprehended him on the fifth floor . Shortly afterwards , CARDINAL of the police officers shot him in the back of the head at very close range . He died instantly .", "CARDINAL . An investigation followed , during which all the witnesses and police officers were questioned . There were CARDINAL versions of events : that of the group of friends coming down the stairs with the victim ( the witnesses ) , and that of the police officers .", "CARDINAL . The ORG version was that QUANTITY police officers , N. and C. , were armed with pistols which they were holding upwards . Upon passing the first part of the group , the officers saw that there was someone else upstairs and ran in that direction , leaving the first part of the group with police officer PERSON then told police officer PERSON to come upstairs with the rest of the group . After apprehending PERSON somewhere on the fifth floor , police officers PERSON and PERSON started to beat him up . All the members of the group recounted an almost identical description of what they had heard and the conversation that had taken place between the QUANTITY police officers and PERSON . According to them , one of the police officers ( B. ) called PERSON by his first name and told him to follow them . In response , he addressed PERSON by his first name and told him to stop beating him up . Sounds of someone being beaten up were heard and PERSON threatened to report his injuries to a forensic doctor . The manner in which he said this last sentence was very specific , as he used a mixture of both NORP and NORP words and the witnesses recounted it in the same manner . It later transpired that police officer PERSON and PERSON already knew each other , as in DATE the latter had been arrested by the former for bicycle theft .", "CARDINAL . NORP The encounter between police officers PERSON and C. and PERSON took place on the fifth and top floor . CARDINAL of the witnesses PERSON and PERSON were the closest to the scene at the time , being held by police officer PERSON on the fourth floor . The fourth floor was separated from the fifth floor by CARDINAL flights of stairs going in opposite directions joined by an intermediate landing . PERSON ( who also already knew police officer PERSON ) started to shout at him , telling him to leave PERSON alone . She called him by his first name and tried to get past police officer PERSON in order to help PERSON . In her struggle with police officer PERSON she could partly see what was happening on the fifth floor . PERSON was also there . According to them , police officer PERSON grabbed PERSON by his right hand while officer PERSON grabbed him by his left hand and started to make his way down the stairs from the fifth floor to the landing between the fifth and fourth floors . At CARDINAL from last step , PERSON was facing the handrail and grabbed it . The police officers who were behind him bent him over and , according to CARDINAL of the witnesses , held both his hands behind his back . According to another witness , CARDINAL of his hands was on the handrail while the other was held by a police officer behind his back . Police officer C. was holding his pistol at the back of PERSON head while he was bent over . Police officer PERSON punched him in the ribs and he repeated again that he would be reporting his injuries to a forensic doctor . Immediately afterwards , he was shot in the back of the head by police officer C. at very close range . He collapsed on the landing between the CARDINAL flights of stairs , with his feet on the stairs and his body on the landing . Blood started to spurt out of his head wound . PERSON shouted : \u201c He shot him straight in the head ! \u201d and her first reaction was to try to stop him losing any more blood with her hands . In what appeared to be an attack of hysteria she started to scream and to attack police officer PERSON and shouted \u201c Why did you do that ? \u201d Another female friend in the group approached her from behind , hugged her and tried to pull her away from the body .", "CARDINAL . According to the witnesses , PERSON did not have anything in his hands after collapsing to the ground . Police officer PERSON asked officer C. : \u201c What the hell did you do ? ! \u201d C. did not respond with anything intelligible but remained still , holding his head in his hands . CARDINAL of the witnesses said they heard him respond in a low voice : \u201c I did n\u2019t want to do that \u201d . He was very pale . According to the witnesses he did not have any visible injuries and could walk perfectly well . Immediately afterwards , officer PERSON ordered all the witnesses to go into PERSON \u2019s apartment on the fourth floor . He and police officer PERSON pushed everybody into her apartment and closed the door . Police officer PERSON was holding the doorknob so that nobody could leave . Many of the neighbours started to look out of their apartments but the police officers ordered them all to close their doors and stay inside .", "CARDINAL . According to the police officers , when PERSON ran up the stairs , they thought he was the suspect they had been after . They claimed to have been convinced that the victim was the suspect they were looking for and that they only realised their mistake after he had been shot . However , during a confrontation which took place later , police officer PERSON admitted he had known PERSON for DATE . The following description of the police ORG version of events was made after a video reconstruction of the scene , which was filmed during the investigation with the participation of police officer C. on DATE . Police officer PERSON recounted an identical version of events .", "CARDINAL . Police officer PERSON chased PERSON and approached him from behind on the landing of the top , fifth floor . He put his hand on his shoulder , called him by the name of the wanted suspect , announced that he was a police officer and asked him to come with him . At that moment PERSON turned around and punched police officer PERSON in the face with his right fist and attempted to run down the stairs . When he punched police officer PERSON he did not have anything in his hand . Police officer PERSON was pushed into a wall on his right and lost his balance . However , police officer PERSON , who had already approached them from behind , managed to apprehend PERSON by pulling his left arm near his shoulder ( in his initial statement police officer PERSON stated that he had apprehended him by the collar of his jacket ) . The apprehension took place on the top CARDINAL steps of the flight of stairs leading to the fifth floor . Police officer C. was behind PERSON on a higher step , holding his hand with his left hand and holding his pistol pointed upwards in his right hand . At that moment , without changing his position , PERSON stabbed police officer C. in the right thigh with a knife , which he had been holding in his right hand in reverse grip . Then , without changing the position of the knife , PERSON attempted to turn to his left and to stab police officer C. in the face . According to police officer C. , PERSON had been standing upright . Fearing for his life , police officer C. pulled the trigger of the pistol he was still holding upwards and shot him in the upper neck . The police officers did not say how the victim \u2019s body ended up on the landing between the fifth and fourth floor CARDINAL or CARDINAL steps lower , but it is reasonable to infer that it rolled down by itself before slumping at the bottom of the stairs .", "CARDINAL . A criminal investigation was formally initiated on DATE . According to a report describing the scene , PERSON body was lying in a pool of blood on the intermediate landing between the fourth and fifth floors . There was an open small pocket knife with a lock mechanism with a blade QUANTITY long in the palm of his right hand . His feet were on the first CARDINAL steps of the flight of stairs leading to the fifth floor . There were traces of blood on those steps . The report contains pictures of areas stained with blood , such as the landing where the body was lying , the walls around it , and the landing between the third and the fourth floor , where blood had run down from above . No traces of blood appear to have been found above the steps on which the victim \u2019s feet were located . On the wall above the sixth step of the flight of stairs going down to the fourth floor from the landing where the body was lying , there was a bullet hole QUANTITY above the step , exactly opposite where the witnesses alleged the victim had been shot when facing the handrail .", "CARDINAL . During the investigation , the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office obtained several forensic reports which found , inter alia , that the entry wound was on PERSON upper left neck and the exit wound was on the right side of his forehead above his eyebrow . According to the forensic report , the shot was fired at such close range that gunshot residue was present on the victim \u2019s skin around the entry wound . Another forensic report found that the police officer who had shot him had had an injury to his right thigh made by a knife wound and the other police officer who had allegedly been punched in the face by PERSON had had a bruise on his face . Another expert report did not find any fingerprints on the knife found in PERSON palm after his death .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office decided to discontinue the criminal investigation on the grounds that the police officer who shot PERSON had acted in self - defence . The prosecutor \u2019s office was based on the police ORG version of events . The applicants challenged the above decision before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a deputy Prosecutor General quashed the above decision on the grounds that it was based exclusively on the police ORG version of events and that no consideration was given to the ORG statements . The investigator had failed to determine the exact place of the shooting and the victim \u2019s position in relation to the shooter . Moreover , no ballistics test had been conducted in order to determine the trajectory of the bullet .", "CARDINAL . In the reopened investigation some of the witnesses were re - questioned . CARDINAL of them , PERSON , changed his statements and submitted that he had not seen or heard anything , but later claimed that he had only done so because he had been pressured and threatened to do so by the accused police officers .", "CARDINAL . A ballistics test was carried out with the help of an assistant standing where the police officers alleged the victim had been standing at the time of shooting . The assistant had a cabbage placed on his shoulder , near his head . Through a hole pierced in the cabbage , a thread was led to the bullet hole in the wall , which was considerably lower than the cabbage . Taking into consideration the positions of the entry and exit wounds on the victim \u2019s head , it was concluded that , at the moment of the shooting , the victim had been bent over and not standing upright as suggested by the police officers in their version of events .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office again discontinued the criminal proceedings on similar grounds as the first time , namely on the basis of the police ORG version of events . It does not appear that the prosecutor attempted to reconcile the findings of the ballistics test with the police ORG version of events concerning the circumstances of PERSON shooting . The applicants appealed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the ORG appeal . They appealed to an investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge from ORG upheld the ORG appeal , quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE and ordered a re - investigation of the case . He concluded that the investigation had been incomplete and that the conclusions reached by the investigators were inconsistent with the evidence in the case file . The investigating judge also noted that no confrontations had been carried out between all the witnesses and the accused officers , no importance had been attached to the fact that no fingerprints had been found on the knife the victim had allegedly stabbed police officer C. with , and that the investigation had not been conducted within a reasonable time .", "CARDINAL . Following the investigating judge \u2019s decision , the applicants applied to ORG with a request to have the case removed from the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office on account of its bias and to have it transferred to another prosecutor \u2019s office . On DATE a deputy ORG rejected the ORG request as ill - founded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office questioned witness PERSON again . On CARDINAL DATE witness PERSON was questioned again . He submitted having seen police officer PERSON stabbing police officer C. in his thigh with a knife before being forced into PERSON \u2019s apartment after the shooting . According to him , this took place CARDINAL and the fourth floor and he had mentioned it during his initial questioning , but no record had been made . Confrontations were organised between PERSON and police officer PERSON and between PERSON and police officer PERSON on DATE , during which each party maintained their statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE witness PERSON took a lie - detector test to determine whether his statement about police officer B. stabbing police office C. with a knife was truthful . The test result was negative , i.e. PERSON \u2019s statement was not truthful .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office again discontinued the criminal investigation on similar grounds as the previous occasions . The results of the lie - detector test were added to the decision . The applicants appealed against it and argued that the results of the liedetector test were inadmissible because the test had been carried out by colleagues of the accused police officers rather than by independent experts .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the ORG appeal . They appealed to an investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge from ORG upheld the ORG appeal , again finding that the investigation had been incomplete . The judge also declared the results of the lie - detector test inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , without conducting any further investigative measures , a prosecutor from the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office again discontinued the criminal investigation . The content of the decision was identical to that of the decision of DATE , including reference to the lie - detector test .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the ORG appeal . They appealed to an investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge from ORG again upheld the ORG appeal , quashed the decisions of DATE and DATE and ordered a reopening of the investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a prosecutor from the PERSON prosecutor \u2019s office again discontinued the criminal investigation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the ORG appeal . They appealed to an investigating judge .", "CARDINAL . On DATE an investigating judge from ORG again upheld the ORG appeal , quashed the decisions of CARDINAL DATE and DATE and ordered a reopening of the investigation .
