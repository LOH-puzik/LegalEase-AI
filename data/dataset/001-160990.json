The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant is a civil servant working as a lawyer for the GPE tax authorities . In DATE , the applicant was a board member of the local branch of a registered association called \u201c FAC \u201d . In this capacity he opened a bank account for the association . He and CARDINAL other members of the association were authorised to draw on the account . The account was used for the deposit of donations and membership fees . The account data was therefore published , for example in brochures . In DATE the applicant left the board of the association .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , a third person reported to the police that he had bought a watch via ORG . The watch had turned out to be a fake . He had tried to rescind the purchase when he found out , but the seller \u2013 of whom he knew only the email address \u201c sternschnuppeCARDINAL@uboot.com \u201d DATE refused to cooperate . The police investigations showed that a certain Mr NORP was registered with ORG as user of the email address \u201c sternschnuppeCARDINAL \u201d . The bank account registered for the email address \u201c sternschnuppeCARDINAL \u201d was the account of the \u201c ORG \u201d association . Investigations further showed that various other users , who were registered with ORG , cited the bank account of the \u201c ORG \u201d association as their bank account . The police also found out that the user of \u201c sternschnuppeCARDINAL \u201d had traded computer programmes via ORG . An investigation of the transactions of the \u201c ORG \u201d bank account showed that there had only been CARDINAL transaction connected to ORG : ORG had tried to collect fees ( ORG CARDINAL ) on DATE . The \u201c ORG \u201d association had protested against the payment , which had been returned on DATE . Mr NORP was questioned by the police . He explained , convincingly , that he had nothing to do with the email address \u201c sternschnuppeCARDINAL \u201d or the bank account of the \u201c ORG \u201d association .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , upon a request of the prosecutor \u2019s office of GPE I , ORG issued a search warrant in respect of the applicant \u2019s home ( and the home of CARDINAL other members of the \u201c ORG \u201d association who were authorised to draw on the association \u2019s bank account ) on suspicion that they had committed \u201c copyright piracy \u201d by selling fake goods such as watches and computer programmes . The search warrant authorised the search and seizure of computers and documents containing information about the sale of the fake watch and the computer programmes .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s ( shared ) flat in GPE was searched . The police found none of the items they were searching for . Instead , by coincidence , the police found QUANTITY of hashish , which contained QUANTITY of pure THC ( tetrahydrocannabinol ) , and CARDINAL defective weighing scales in the flat . The amount and quality of the hashish was asserted by an expert . The amount was enough for CARDINAL consumption units . The criminal proceedings regarding the suspected \u201c copyright piracy \u201d were discontinued . However , new proceedings for possession and trafficking of a substantial amount of drugs were initiated against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The applicant , represented by counsel , lodged a complaint against the search warrant before the criminal courts arguing that the warrant , and consequently the search , had been unlawful and had infringed his constitutional right to respect for his home under LAW ( \u201c LAW ; see paragraph CARDINAL , below ) . ORG and the GPE ORG dismissed the complaint .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that the complaint was manifestly well - founded , found a violation of LAW , declared the house search unlawful and quashed the search warrant and the decisions of LOC . The court left open whether the few indications supporting the initial suspicion that the applicant might have committed \u201c copyright piracy \u201d justified the ordering of a search warrant . In any event , however , ORG ruled that having weighed the few indications supporting a suspicion that the applicant could have committed \u201c copyright piracy \u201d against the massive impact of a house search on the applicant \u2019s constitutional right to respect for his home , the issuing of a search warrant and hence the house search had not been proportionate . It would have been possible and necessary to take other investigative measures that would have interfered less with the applicant \u2019s right before searching the applicant \u2019s home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was indicted by the GPE prosecution on charges of possession of and trafficking in a substantial amount of drugs . On DATE the GPE ORG convicted the applicant of possession of a substantial amount of drugs in less serious circumstances and imposed a CARDINAL months\u2019 suspended prison sentence . The judgment was exclusively based on the presence of hashish found during the house search of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law before ORG , arguing that he should have been acquitted as the evidence found during the house search could not be admitted as evidence in the criminal proceedings for drug possession . As the search warrant had been invalidated by ORG , the police had never had a right to enter the applicant \u2019s shared flat and would therefore never have had a legal possibility of finding the drugs at the applicant \u2019s flat . Moreover , the seizure of the hashish had not even been covered by the unlawful search warrant . The infringement of the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his home had been so severe that the evidence which had coincidentally been found during the house search could not be admitted as evidence against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment and referred the case back to ORG because it was of the view that ORG had not sufficiently examined whether the hashish belonged to the applicant . As he lived in a shared flat , the room , and hence the drugs , could have belonged to any of his flatmates . With regard to the admissibility of the evidence ORG found that the hashish found during the search could be used as evidence against the applicant . The infringement of the applicant \u2019s basic rights with regard to the criminal proceedings concerning copyright piracy had not been so serious that the applicant \u2019s interest in respect for his home outweighed the public interest in prosecution . ORG referred to ORG case - law ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , according to which unlawfully obtained evidence could be used in criminal proceedings as long as , after a thorough balancing of the different interests at stake , the public interest in prosecution did not have to stand back against the right to respect for his home of the person concerned and as long as that person \u2019s rights had not been violated on purpose . It reiterated ORG finding that the applicant \u2019s basic rights had been seriously infringed ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Whether or not the search warrant had been sufficiently precise , and whether a sufficient initial suspicion for issuing a search warrant had been present or not , did not have to be determined because , even assuming that this had not been the case , such shortcomings did not render the obtained evidence unlawful . Because of the seriousness of the crime of drug possession , and the substantial amount of hashish found , the public interest in prosecution outweighed the applicant \u2019s interest in respect for his home . Furthermore , the applicant \u2019s rights had not been deliberately infringed , the house search had not been arbitrary and the amount of hashish found would theoretically have justified a house search . ORG was hence of the view that the hashish found during the search could be used as evidence against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . Considering that it was legally unclear whether or not ORG findings regarding the admissibility of the evidence found during the house search were binding on the lower courts , the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG . On DATE ORG rejected the complaint as inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . In the resumed proceedings before ORG , the applicant made a statement that the room in which the hashish had been found was exclusively used by him . On DATE ORG acquitted the applicant , ruling that the hashish found during the house search could not be used as evidence against him . The court noted that under the well - established case law of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) an unlawful house search did not automatically mean that the evidence seized during such a house search could not be used in the trial against the person concerned . Evidence might , however , be precluded if the violation of the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his home had been particularly serious . The court weighed the public interest in prosecuting the crime of possession of drugs against the applicant \u2019s interest in respect for his home . It was of the view that the initial suspicion that the applicant might have committed the offence of copyright piracy had been so vague that the issuing of a search warrant had not been justified at all . Hence , the applicant \u2019s right to respect for his home had been infringed in such a severe way that despite the seriousness of the crime of drug possession and the substantial amount of hashish found , the public interest in prosecution could not outweigh the applicant \u2019s interest in respect for his home .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , on appeal by the prosecution , ORG quashed the acquittal , convicted the applicant of possession of a substantial amount of drugs in less serious circumstances and sentenced him to a CARDINAL months\u2019 suspended prison sentence . As regards the question whether the applicant had been in possession of the drugs ORG relied on a statement of the applicant dated DATE according to which the room in which the hashish had been found was solely used by himself . Furthermore , ORG was of the view that ORG findings in its judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on the admissibility of the hashish as the sole evidence were binding and that hence the hashish found in the applicant \u2019s flat could be used as evidence against him . Moreover , the court made it clear that even if ORG findings were not binding in this respect it was itself of the view that , weighing the applicant \u2019s interest in respect for his home against the public interest in prosecution , the latter prevailed and that the evidence was thus admissible .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently lodged a fresh appeal on points of law before ORG , arguing that ORG should not have admitted the evidence . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . The court weighed the public interest in prosecuting the crime of possession of drugs against the applicant \u2019s interest in respect for his home . It took the view that , considering the seriousness of the crime of drug possession and the substantial amount of hashish found , the public interest in prosecution outweighed the applicant \u2019s interest in respect for his home because the applicant \u2019s rights had not been deliberately infringed , the house search had not been arbitrary and the amount of hashish found would theoretically have justified a house search .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged a fresh constitutional complaint , arguing that the admission of the evidence infringed his right to respect for his home under LAW and his right to a fair trial under LAW read in conjunction with LAW of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint ( file no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . The decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE . The court assessed the applicant \u2019s arguments mainly under the head of LAW . It held that ORG had balanced all the interests at stake in a way that was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable and that the conviction of the applicant , although exclusively based on the evidence found during the house search , did not infringe the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights . With regard to the applicant \u2019s claim that the use of the hashish seized as evidence against him had violated his rights under LAW read in conjunction with LAW , the court held that the principle of a fair trial had been applied in a way that was neither unjustifiable nor arbitrary . Hence the applicant \u2019s constitutional rights had not been violated .", "CARDINAL . As the applicant was a civil servant , disciplinary proceedings were initiated in view of the criminal charges against him . The disciplinary proceedings were adjourned during the criminal proceedings . Following the conviction of the applicant by the criminal courts , the competent authorities formally noted that the applicant had committed a disciplinary offence and discontinued the proceedings as the offence had not been of a kind or degree demanding disciplinary measures ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
