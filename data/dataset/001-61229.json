The applicant , an NORP national born in DATE , was the general secretary of ORG ( ORG ) from DATE . From DATE to DATE he was Prime Minister of GPE . As of DATE ( according to the applicant ) or DATE ( according to the NORP authorities ) , he lived in GPE ( GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings to which this application relates were part of the criminal proceedings brought by ORG during the so - called \u201c clean hands \u201d ( mani pulite ) campaign .", "CARDINAL . DATE , ORG issued DATE notices of prosecution ( avvisi di ORG ) in respect of the applicant , in particular for corruption , dishonest receipt of money by a public officer , concealment of dishonest gain and offences against the legislation on the financing of political parties .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE ORG also issued notices of prosecution in respect of the applicant for dishonest receipt of money by a public officer , offences against the legislation on the financing of political parties , corruption and misuse of public office .", "CARDINAL . The prosecutions against the applicant and other figures in politics , business and public institutions received attention from the media .", "CARDINAL . Amongst the cases against the applicant was that of PERSON , which concerned payments of large sums of money made DATE by a number of firms to the representatives of political parties and the influence the latter exerted on the board of directors of the ORG company with a view to awarding contracts to those firms in connection with works on the GPE underground system .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigating judge committed the applicant and CARDINAL co - defendants for trial before ORG . The applicant was charged , in particular , with interference with freedom of contract and corruption .", "CARDINAL . The first trial hearing took place on DATE . The applicant was not present and ORG accordingly declared him absent ( contumace ) . Some of the accused requested and obtained a plea bargain , while the position of some other accused persons was separated from that of the applicant . The trial before ORG thus continued only against the applicant and CARDINAL co - defendants . The ORG company joined the proceedings as a civil party .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ORG remanded the applicant in custody . On DATE counsel for the applicant informed ORG that he had learned of that decision through the press and asked for a copy of it . On DATE ORG declared the applicant to be latitante , that is , to be deliberately evading the court 's jurisdiction .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed against the decision of DATE . In an order of CARDINAL DATE , ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . The court held that once the preliminary investigation was completed it was for the trial court to consider whether there were substantial indications of guilt and whether in particular there was still a danger that the applicant would abscond . In this respect the court noted that since DATE it had been impossible to find the applicant in GPE and that in the various proceedings brought against him a number of coercive measures had been ordered that could not be enforced . Moreover , in judgments of DATE and DATE the applicant had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment . In ORG view , the applicant 's lengthy stay abroad demonstrated his determination to evade the coercive measures ordered against him in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG sought an order for the interception of the applicant 's telephone calls between GPE and his home in GPE . The interceptions were aimed at gathering information with a view to arresting the applicant .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed those applications with a view to facilitating the arrest of the applicant . The court noted that the interceptions had a legal basis and were essential to supervise the applicant 's movements and his personal and international relations which had allowed him to continue absconding . The interceptions , carried out by a specialist branch of the NORP police , began on DATE and were concluded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the same time , ORG sought an order for the interception of the applicant 's telephone calls between GPE and his home in GPE in the context of a set of criminal proceedings for defamation which were pending against the applicant . The GPE investigating judge allowed the interceptions with a view to gathering evidence against the applicant and to identifying the accomplices . The interceptions , carried out by a specialist branch of the NORP police , began on DATE . The prosecution applied for CARDINAL extensions of the duration of the interceptions , which were allowed by the investigating judge on CARDINAL and CARDINAL DATE , and on CARDINAL and DATE . A request for a further extension was refused on CARDINAL DATE . The interceptions were thus concluded on DATE .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing on DATE in the case of PERSON , ORG in charge of the applicant 's case , Mr PERSON , filed the transcripts of the telephone interceptions with the registry and asked that they be admitted as evidence against the applicant . The prosecution argued that they were necessary to assess the applicant 's personality in order to determine the sentence if he were convicted , and that they could support the prosecution 's allegation that the applicant intended to continue to abscond . The prosecution subsequently read out in court certain extracts of interceptions with a view to proving : a ) that the applicant could leave GPE ; b ) that the applicant had started or influenced CARDINAL virulent press campaigns against a magistrate of ORG and against an NORP political party ; c ) that the applicant was collecting information concerning certain politicians and magistrates , with a view to damaging their reputation ; d ) that the applicant continued to show aggressiveness towards the magistrates who were investigating him . ORG compared the applicant 's conduct to that of a \u201c certified criminal \u201d ( criminale matricolato ) who attacked all those who had done their job and had tried to do it well . ORG declared that the transcripts of the telephone conversations were at the disposal of ORG and of the defendants .", "CARDINAL . NORP The transcript of the speech given by Mr PERSON at the hearing of CARDINAL DATE reads as follows :", "\u201c I am submitting these further pleas under LAW . I have already explained why I intend to submit these documents , which consist , firstly , of assessments of LOC 's criminal potential , within the meaning of LAW , with reference in particular to his conduct after the offence was committed , and , secondly , of assessments as to whether the measure affecting his personal freedom should be maintained for the reasons for which it was decided on , and whether it should be extended for other reasons . I shall try to be extremely brief , although what I have to say will take a little time . I have tried to divide the documents submitted according to subject - matter , and have put together the telephone transcripts - the documents include the measures authorising the telephone tapping and the confiscation orders , which were moreover confirmed by the tribunale della libert\u00e0 [ the court responsible for deciding on the justification for measures restricting personal freedom or property rights ] . The first set consists of telephone transcripts and clearly shows that LOC can move about in GPE . This seems self - evident , yet LOC is someone who , during the proceedings - all the proceedings taking place in GPE - said he had a legitimate reason for not attending and sent doctors ' certificates . First he complained that the trials were not taking place , and now that the trials are taking place he wants them postponed on the grounds that he has a legitimate reason for being unable to attend . It is absolutely clear from these telephone transcripts that LOC is someone who is able to move from the address of the subscription to the telephone line on which he receives calls . Why is this important ? The reason is clear : LOC is such a liar that he continues to lie even before the courts , saying things that are untrue and belied by documentary evidence .", "The second point concerns LOC as a danger to the community , in particular his capacity to operate in the current situation , and become involved in the processes whereby public opinion is shaped and in other processes , which I shall discuss . In my opinion , CARDINAL operations are particularly important - CARDINAL press campaigns which were co - ordinated ... or at any rate CARDINAL press campaigns in which LOC clearly played an important role . The first is a recent one : I am referring to the telephone calls on DATE - I apologise for the vulgarity , but I am reporting the speech of others and am not responsible .", "PERSON , talking to PERSON , says , ' the son of the hero ' - the reference to Di PERSON is clear . An incomprehensible sentence ' He contributes to the tune of CARDINAL a year , no less , when it all comes out . ' PERSON says , ' Now we take the wraps off the case and then we shoot him in the balls . ' DATE the front page news is : ' PERSON too , has a house in the centre for CARDINAL . '", "The second press campaign was co - ordinated directly from GPE . It is the press campaign that was waged in GPE , whose editor is PERSON . What happened ? In a nutshell , LOC sent PERSON a file on the [ NORP ] League , concerning alleged arms dealings by ORG , and PERSON willingly received and published it . What is particularly important is that , in my opinion , the file came from LOC himself : it was found on LOC 's computer or , rather , on the computer in LOC 's office in via PERSON in GPE and , in particular , was referred to in the conversation between Caprettini and LOC , in CARDINAL respects . Firstly , the subscriber - when I say subscriber , I mean Craxi - says , word for word , ' In any case we can do more with them - we can investigate but we can also raise questions . ' What he means is that they can be used to raise questions about ORG , an NORP political party receiving special attention from a fugitive from justice , who agrees with the editor of a DATE to launch a campaign of this type . The second important thing is : ' Of course I publish the article , and then I go to a prosecutor who is a friend of mine and say , \u201c Hey , look into this affair , will you ? \u201d - but this is the sort of thing one does nothing about ' . Further evidence that LOC is a liar comes from an article in the GPE , which published the news that LOC had denied being the author of the material sent to LOC . I am producing this evidence to make it clear that when we talk of LOC it is not like shooting at ORG : we are talking of someone who is fully active and has a great capacity to influence the media . In this connection , there is a set of telephone transcripts which show that LOC was in constant contact with journalists in a wide variety of areas .", "Let us now move on to the last CARDINAL points which , I believe , deserve a minimum of attention .", "There is documentary proof , and proof from the telephone transcripts , that LOC is mounting dossiers in GPE against some political activists . I am referring - with particular regard to the evidence that has been found - to dossiers against PERSON . He is engaging in \u201c dossierism \u201d ...", "The President : What does the neologism mean ? Compiling information or a dossier ?", "ORG : Compiling information in order to attack someone 's reputation . This is an activity that was also to be pursued against judges , including myself , but we shall discuss that later .", "I said \u201c dossierism \u201d , which consists in compiling information that can damage people 's reputation . This is documented by the telephone transcripts . CARDINAL alarming aspect , in my view , is that it provides further evidence of PERSON criminal potential .", "I am talking about compiling dossiers of information designed to damage the reputation of certain eminent people , and I am thinking of GPE , PERSON and PERSON , about whom I shall talk in connection with a specific note that was found in LOC 's office . The dossiers were mounted with a certain PERSON from GPE , who is an old friend of LOC 's - by friend I mean someone with whom he had relations which were , I imagine , of a political nature - to the extent that PERSON appears on a list of presents that LOC gave . She is a leading supporter of ORG , and is known to the judicial authorities for having arranged to put the GPE judicial authorities off the track when they were investigating the massacres , by bribing witnesses . In this connection , I can produce evidence that identifies PERSON : the order from the GPE investigating judge , Dr PERSON if I am not mistaken , which shows that the most recent contact between ORG and PERSON dates back to DATE , and which makes it clear that she attempted to put the investigators off track and bribed witnesses in the course of the proceedings . These are the sort of people PERSON , a fugitive from justice who is the subject of pre - trial detention orders , uses in order to hinder investigations . You will be able to see for yourselves what these documents contain , and I shall not dwell on them . What is significant is another note on ORG also found in LOC 's office . I shall read you out the beginning so you can understand what all this is about . ORG administration has always helped to support the NORP current of ORG ] . PERSON took over from ORG , and the flow of money never stopped . ' On average , PERSON received CARDINAL to CARDINAL a month from GPE . On the occasion of every election or conference , there were extraordinary payments for instance , and so it went on ' , and the note continues with information about the politician .", "There are also telephone transcripts of statements by PERSON in which he appears to be talking about GPE ... These are statements that have been filed and can be seen by anyone : it is clear to all why they are important from a criminal point of view .", "Then there are documents that show that PERSON has , or at any rate had , relations with important members of the NORP institutions . I am referring in particular to the telephone transcript of DATE , during which the subscriber , LOC , talks to Margherita - she is not identified , who says : ' PERSON told me that he attended a meeting between PERSON and PERSON , and they spent TIME talking about you alone . PERSON came to GPE to see you and told PERSON to tell you that he too would be happy to have you as his guest in GPE . ' Again in connection with the capacity for communication of the accused , PERSON , who I repeat is a fugitive from justice and the subject of an arrest warrant for corruption with aggravating circumstances , there is a letter which the ORG Under - Secretary to the Prime Minister 's office sent to LOC 's secretary on DATE , in which the ORG Under - Secretary to the Prime Minister 's office writes : \u201c Dear PERSON , what you feared has happened , although both PERSON and GPE promise their good offices and will put things right ' .", "Basically , this concerns a recommendation addressed to the ORG Under - Secretary , who hastens to reply , saying ... PERSON is PERSON . And let it be clear that PERSON is nobody in her own right , and yet as PERSON secretary she was still able , on DATE , to make recommendations concerning the allocation of service areas in GPE .", "The last point on which I intend to dwell is the constant attacks by PERSON on those who investigated him . The right to defend oneself is sacred and culminates in a fair trial , but when it is exercised by attacking those involved in the proceedings , those who carried out the investigations , it is , in my view , proof of a very highly developed potential for crime .", "A note found in LOC 's office - LOC 's own office - you may , if you wish , in this connection hear PERSON , who , I repeat , confirmed this - contained , among other pleasantries , a very precise reference in time in the form of ORG 's release from prison - it is dated after ORG 's release . Among the pleasantries , the note says : ' The PERSON case must become an exemplary case : we must get to the bottom of things because all the conditions are right . The usual logic of hitting CARDINAL person in order to teach CARDINAL others a lesson . ORG must regain its independence and this means it must not be subjected to the requirements of allies and exposed to dangers and uncertainty . There are key targets , particularly FAC [ a group of GPE public prosecutors waging war on corruption ] . We need to have the courage to call for its arrest before they do . We need to denounce the damage caused by the revolt . We must begin by using people as examples and waging war . We need to use parliamentary force in every way possible . This includes calling for enquiries with a lot of publicity and denouncing abuses of authority - by LOC . There is the seizure of the parliamentary question from Maiolo , faxed by ORG parliamentary group ... PERSON , who sent it for information to PERSON DATE with a covering letter which says : ' I would point out , inter alia , that Maiolo has in TIME been collecting more documentation with a view to asking further questions in the near future about the management of ORG . ' There are telephone transcripts in which we read : ' We need to bombard them in the press ' . There are also attacks connected with what was published in PERSON . There is something for everyone - not just for ORG . There are attacks on other colleagues and references to other colleagues . A woman talking to LOC says , ' He 's bewildered too ' and says that the person in question was used by ORG group as a killer ; she says she has heard from PERSON that the person coming down to speak is virtually in the service of PERSON . I will spare you all the rest because you can read it for yourself . I shall just read you one extract , partly because it concerns me and partly because it concerns these proceedings . ' So why does n't someone else come ? ' , with reference to PERSON , who is clearly involved ... he knows the truth of the matter . ' I think GPE stopped him . ' ' I am about ' - here it is the subscriber , PERSON , speaking - ' to denounce this PERSON . Both PERSON 's statements against PERSON and the statements by PERSON come under LAW [ of LAW ] ' .", "He is speaking to a certain PERSON , who has not yet been identified , but I hope very soon to identify him , who repeats , ' Yes , but he 's dealing with it . ' LOC replies , ' He has nothing to do with this . ' The person to whom he is speaking says , ' No , of course not . The minister 's dealing with it . '", "The President : The public prosecutor is requested to bring the charges without making allusions or taking stands , or making comments of a personal nature .", "The public prosecutor : President , the charge is based on the premise that these telephone transcripts show , within the meaning of LAW , behaviour - and this is where the accused , PERSON , has committed an offence - worthy of a certified criminal - it is the behaviour of someone who attacks all those who have simply done their job , because that is what they are paid to do and that is what they have chosen to do , and have sought to do it properly , but he does n't care , he has to attack them and ...", "President : We have understood why the public prosecutor has asked for these documents to be produced .", "Public Prosecutor : The evidence submitted has been greatly summarised , President , because there is further material and I am at the disposal of defence counsel and the court . Ah , wait TIME - there are all the measures authorising the requests for telephone tapping and seizures ; they are all appended .", "The President : Appended to the individual sets of evidence ... these pleas from the public prosecutor ... Let us begin to hear LOC 's defence counsel , who is the person most directly concerned , and then if the others want to intervene ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's lawyer requested to be granted access to the decisions authorising the interceptions and to all the documents to which ORG had made reference . He declared that he would have commented on them at a later stage , observing , anyway , that some of the facts imputed to his client could not be described as aggressive behaviours , being rather simple statements of the truth .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reserved its decision on the prosecution 's request of admittance of evidence until the hearing of DATE . The transcripts of the telephone conversations intercepted on the applicant 's line were made available to the parties immediately after the hearing of CARDINAL DATE . PERSON , the applicant 's lawyer , was provided with the file including all the transcripts and afforded the possibility of making written submissions .", "CARDINAL . Respectively on CARDINAL and DATE , the CARDINAL applicant 's counsels ( Mr PERSON and PERSON ) were informed that the telephone interceptions had been filed with ORG registry . The applicant 's counsels subsequently objected to the admission of the interceptions as evidence . In particular , they argued that contrary to LAW hereinafter , the \u201c CPP \u201d ) ORG had failed to hold a specific sitting before the trial hearing in the presence of both the defence counsels and of the prosecution in order to select those interceptions that were significant and exclude those considered illegal . Further , the prosecution had failed to apply for an extension of the DATE duration of the telephone tapping , so that those interceptions which had been carried out after DATE were illegal and could not be used .", "CARDINAL . The content and the name of the interlocutors of certain telephone conversations were subsequently published in the press .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , \" PERSON \" of CARDINAL DATE published an article entitled \u201c PERSON and conspiracies against PERSON [ one of the magistrates of the clean hands team ] \" . It stated that the interceptions made on the applicant 's phone showed that he was preparing a defamatory campaign against some political men with the help of a \" lady from GPE \" , who was a member of an illegal association of free - masons . Moreover , in CARDINAL of the interceptions PERSON ( an NORP politician ) had told LOC that Mr PERSON ( the current Prime Minister of GPE ) had had a conversation with Mr PERSON about him and that PERSON would have \" invited \" LOC . In another telephone call , the son of one of the applicant 's lawyers had said that \" the Minister \" would have commenced proceedings against Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , as well as on CARDINAL and DATE , PERSON also published the following extracts from some of the intercepted phone calls .", "Conversation on DATE with a certain PERSON :", "LOC ( speaking with PERSON ) : \u201c This PERSON [ ORG ] is another one who wants to make a show of himself , I am going to see whether there are elements to introduce a criminal complaint against him . \u201d", "Conversation on DATE with an unknown woman :", "Woman : \u201c I 'm in a telephone box in GPE .

Articles appeared in ORG della sera and in other newspapers concerning interviews and declarations made by Mr GPE , ORG attached to ORG , who criticised the release into the public domain of the telephone interceptions and declared that he had never followed irregular procedures in order to serve the interests of the applicant . The latter was at freedom to believe that he could have taken advantage from the legitimate and impartial investigations that Mr GPE was making . Other declarations made by the persons who spoke with the applicant on the phone were published by the press , as well as the replies of the applicant to the speech made by Mr PERSON on DATE .

In DATE , GPE , PERSON and ORG della sera published articles which referred to the above mentioned telephone conversations and to the speech made by PERSON at the hearing of DATE .

Some of the newspapers commented that the transcripts of the telephone conversations showed , together with other elements , that the applicant was trying to use his influence and his relationships to organise a defamatory campaign against his political adversaries and against the magistrates who were investigating on him . It was moreover discussed in the press whether the applicant had the power to influence the political line of the party ORG , with some members of which he had , apparently , kept close contacts .

Even if the telephone interceptions did not disclose any criminally relevant behaviour , they should be taken into account in order to assess the applicant 's personality and to fix the penalty that ORG could have demanded at the outset of the court proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

Mr PERSON concluded that ORG could not be held responsible for the divulging of these acts . The representative of the civil party declared that he had nothing to say on this point : he had not copied the transcripts and he had not given them to third persons . Mr Guiso confirmed the version given by Mr PERSON . He indicated that he had copied the file which had been forwarded to him , but that this was done in a particularly secret manner , in order to protect the applicant 's interests and to avoid any divulging which could be prejudicial for him . Some journalists had requested to be granted access to the transcripts , but Mr PERSON had categorically refused . Mr Giuso underlined that , as prescribed by the law , the file with the transcripts had been made available to all the parties of the trial , and not only to the applicant 's defence lawyers . Mr PERSON concluded that the divulging of the transcripts was clearly due to the action of third persons . He was not interested in that , the only point he wanted to raise being why the telephone interceptions had been presented at the public hearing .

In an order of DATE , ORG found that contrary to the applicant 's allegations ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the failure to hold a specific hearing prior to the trial in order to select the intercepted telephone conversations did not amount to a violation of the relevant provisions of NORP law . ORG first observed that according to LAW case law , failure to respect the formalities indicated in LAW and CARDINAL of the CPP did not prevent the use of the interceptions . It moreover noted that according to LAW , the said LAW , which concerned wire - tapings made during the preliminary investigations , could apply to the trial phase only \u201c if possible \u201d . In the present case , the selection of the material had been made in the presence of the parties and in its \u201c natural \u201d place , which was the trial hearing . ORG however decided not to make use of the information yielded by the telephone interceptions made DATE and DATE , in that they were relevant but not \u201c absolutely necessary \u201d within the meaning of LAW ORG in order to assess the applicant 's personality . ORG further held that the interceptions made after DATE could not be used as evidence , as no application had been made by the prosecutor for an extension of the duration of interception , nor could such authorisation be considered as having been implicitly granted for as long as the applicant would be absconding .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE , ORG convicted the applicant to a penalty of DATE and DATE imprisonment and to a fine of MONEY ( MONEY ) . This sentence was confirmed on appeal on DATE .
