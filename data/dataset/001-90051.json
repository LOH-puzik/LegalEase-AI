The applicants were born in DATE and DATE respectively and live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The first applicant , Mr S. , was arrested on DATE at DATE and charged with attempted robbery . His fingerprints and DNA samples were taken . He was acquitted on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The second applicant , Mr PERSON , was arrested on DATE and charged with harassment of his partner . His fingerprints and DNA samples were taken . Before a pre - trial review took place , he and his partner had reconciled , and the charge was not pressed . On DATE , ORG served a notice of discontinuance on the applicant \u2019s solicitors , and on DATE the case was formally discontinued .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants asked for their fingerprints and DNA samples to be destroyed , but in both cases the police refused . The applicants applied for judicial review of the police decisions not to destroy the fingerprints and samples . On DATE ORG ( ORG and ORG ) rejected the application [ [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) ] .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the decision of ORG by a majority of CARDINAL ( Lord PERSON and PERSON ) to CARDINAL ( ORG ) [ [ DATE ] EWCA Civ CARDINAL ] . As regards the necessity of retaining DNA samples , Lord Justice PERSON stated :", "\u201c ... [ F]ingerprints and DNA profiles reveal only limited personal information . The physical samples potentially contain very much greater and more personal and detailed information . The anxiety is that science may DATE enable analysis of samples to go so far as to obtain information in relation to an individual \u2019s propensity to commit certain crime and be used for that purpose within the language of the present section [ section CARDINAL of ORG and LAW DATE ] . It might also be said that the law might be changed in order to allow the samples to be used for purposes other than those identified by the section . It might also be said that while samples are retained there is even now a risk that they will be used in a way that the law does not allow . So , it is said , the aims could be achieved in a less restrictive manner ... Why can not the aim be achieved by retention of the profiles without retention of the samples ?", "The answer to [ these ] points is as I see it as follows . First the retention of samples permits ( a ) the checking of the integrity and future utility of the DNA database system ; ( b ) a reanalysis for the upgrading of DNA profiles where new technology can improve the discriminating power of the DNA matching process ; ( c ) reanalysis and thus an ability to extract other DNA markers and thus offer benefits in terms of speed , sensitivity and cost of searches of the database ; ( d ) further analysis in investigations of alleged miscarriages of justice ; and ( e ) further analysis so as to be able to identify any analytical or process errors . It is these benefits which must be balanced against the risks identified by ORG . In relation to those risks , the position in any event is first that any change in the law will have to be itself Convention compliant ; second any change in practice would have to be Convention compliant ; and third unlawfulness must not be assumed . In my view thus the risks identified are not great , and such as they are they are outweighed by the benefits in achieving the aim of prosecuting and preventing crime . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord Justice PERSON considered that the power of a chief constable to destroy data which he would ordinarily retain had to be exercised in every case , however rare such cases might be , where he or she was satisfied on conscientious consideration that the individual was free of any taint of suspicion . He also noted that the difference between the retention of samples and DNA profiles was that the retention of samples would enable more information to be derived than had previously been possible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed an appeal by the applicants . Lord PERSON , giving the lead judgment , noted the legislative history of section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) of LAW ( PACE ) , in particular the way in which it had been introduced by ORG following public disquiet about the previous law , which had provided that where a person was not prosecuted or was acquitted of offences , the sample had to be destroyed and the information could not be used . In CARDINAL cases , compelling DNA evidence linking CARDINAL suspect to a rape and another to a murder had not been able to be used , as at the time the matches were made both defendants had either been acquitted or a decision made not to proceed for the offences for which the profiles had been obtained : as a result it had not been possible to convict either suspect .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON noted that the value of retained fingerprints and samples taken from suspects was considerable . He gave the example of a case in DATE , in which DNA information from the perpetrator of a crime was matched with that of \u201c I \u201d in a search of the national database . The sample from \u201c I \u201d should have been destroyed , but had not been . \u201c I \u201d had pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced . If the sample had not been wrongly detained , the offender might have escaped detection .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON also referred to statistical evidence from which it appeared that CARDINAL DNA profiles had been linked with crime - scene stain profiles which would have been destroyed under the former provisions . The offences involved included CARDINAL murders , CARDINAL attempted murders , CARDINAL rapes , CARDINAL sexual offences , CARDINAL aggravated burglaries and CARDINAL cases involving the supply of controlled drugs . On the basis of the existing records , ORG statistics estimated that there was a PERCENT chance that a crime - scene sample would be matched immediately with an individual \u2019s profile on the national database . This showed that the fingerprints and samples which could now be retained had in DATE played a major role in the detection and prosecution of serious crime .", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON also noted that PACE dealt separately with the taking of fingerprints and samples , their retention and their use .", "CARDINAL . As to the Convention analysis , Lord PERSON inclined to the view that the mere retention of fingerprints and DNA samples did not constitute an interference with the right to respect for private life but stated that , if he were wrong in that view , he regarded any interference as very modest indeed . Questions of whether , in the future , retained samples could be misused were not relevant in respect of contemporary use of retained samples in connection with the detection and prosecution of crime . If future scientific developments required it , judicial decisions could be made , when the need occurred , to ensure compatibility with the LAW . The provision limiting the permissible use of retained material to \u201c purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime ... \u201d did not broaden the permitted use unduly , because it was limited by its context .", "CARDINAL . If the need to justify the modest interference with private life arose , Lord PERSON agreed with Lord Justice PERSON in ORG that the purposes of retention \u2013 the prevention of crime and the protection of the right of others to be free from crime \u2013 were \u201c provided for by law \u201d , as required by LAW .", "CARDINAL . As to the justification for any interference , the applicants had argued that the retention of fingerprints and DNA samples created suspicion in respect of persons who had been acquitted . Counsel for the Home Secretary had contended that the aim of the retention had nothing to do with the past , that is , with the offence of which a person had been acquitted , but was to assist in the investigation of offences in the future . The applicants would only be affected by the retention of the DNA samples if their profiles matched those found at the scene of a future crime . Lord PERSON saw CARDINAL factors which led to the conclusion that the interference was proportionate to the aim : ( i ) the fingerprints and samples were kept only for the limited purpose of the detection , investigation and prosecution of crime ; ( ii ) the fingerprints and samples were not of any use without a comparator fingerprint or sample from the crime scene ; ( iii ) the fingerprints would not be made public ; ( iv ) a person was not identifiable from the retained material to the untutored eye ; ( v ) the resultant expansion of the national database by the retention conferred enormous advantages in the fight against serious crime .", "CARDINAL . In reply to the contention that the same legislative aim could be obtained by less intrusive means , namely by a case - by - case consideration of whether or not to retain fingerprints and samples , Lord PERSON referred to Lord Justice PERSON \u2019s comments in ORG , which read as follows :", "\u201c If justification for retention is in any degree to be by reference to the view of the police on the degree of innocence , then persons who have been acquitted and have their samples retained can justifiably say this stigmatises or discriminates against me \u2013 I am part of a pool of acquitted persons presumed to be innocent , but I am treated as though I was not . It is not in fact in any way stigmatising someone who has been acquitted to say simply that samples lawfully obtained are retained as the norm , and it is in the public interest in its fight against crime for the police to have as large a database as possible . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Lord PERSON did not accept that the difference between samples and DNA profiles affected the position .", "CARDINAL . ORG further rejected the ORG complaint that the retention of their fingerprints and samples subjected them to discriminatory treatment in breach of LAW when compared to the general body of persons who had not had their fingerprints and samples taken by the police in the course of a criminal investigation . Lord PERSON held that , even assuming that the retention of fingerprints and samples fell within the ambit of LAW so as to trigger the application of LAW , the difference of treatment relied on by the applicants was not one based on \u201c status \u201d for the purposes of LAW simply reflected the historical fact , unrelated to any personal characteristic , that the authorities already held the fingerprints and samples of the individuals concerned which had been lawfully taken . The applicants and their suggested comparators could not in any event be said to be in an analogous situation . Even if , contrary to his view , it was necessary to consider the justification for any difference in treatment , Lord PERSON held that such objective justification had been established : TIME , the element of legitimate aim was plainly present , as the increase in the database of fingerprints and samples promoted the public interest by the detection and prosecution of serious crime and by exculpating the innocent ; secondly , the requirement of proportionality was satisfied , section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) of PACE objectively representing a measured and proportionate response to the legislative aim of dealing with serious crime .", "CARDINAL . Baroness PERSON of GPE disagreed with the majority , considering that the retention of both fingerprint and DNA data constituted an interference by the ORG in a person \u2019s right to respect for his private life and thus required justification under the ORG . In her opinion , this was an aspect of what had been called informational privacy and there could be little , if anything , more private to the individual than the knowledge of his genetic make - up . She further considered that the difference between fingerprint and DNA data became more important when it came to justify their retention as the justifications for each of these might be very different . She agreed with the majority that such justifications had been readily established in the ORG cases .", "CARDINAL . PACE contains powers for the taking of fingerprints ( principally section CARDINAL ) and samples ( principally section CARDINAL ) . By section CARDINAL , fingerprints may only be taken without consent if an officer of at least the rank of superintendent authorises the taking , or if the person has been charged with a recordable offence or has been informed that he will be reported for such an offence . Before fingerprints are taken , the person must be informed that the prints may be the subject of a speculative search , and the fact of the informing must be recorded as soon as possible . The reason for the taking of the fingerprints is recorded in the custody record . Parallel provisions relate to the taking of samples ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . As to the retention of such fingerprints and samples ( and the records thereof ) , section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) of PACE was substituted by section CARDINAL of ORG and LAW DATE . It provides as follows :", "\u201c Where ( a ) fingerprints or samples are taken from a person in connection with the investigation of an offence ; and ( b ) subsection ( CARDINAL ) below does not require them to be destroyed , the fingerprints or samples may be retained after they have fulfilled the purposes for which they were taken but shall not be used by any person except for purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime , the investigation of an offence , or the conduct of a prosecution . ...", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If ( a ) fingerprints or samples are taken from a person in connection with the investigation of an offence ; and ( b ) that person is not suspected of having committed the offence , they must , except as provided in the following provisions of this section , be destroyed as soon as they have fulfilled the purpose for which they were taken .", "( CARDINALAA ) Samples and fingerprints are not required to be destroyed under subsection ( CARDINAL ) above if ( a ) they were taken for the purposes of the investigation of an offence of which a person has been convicted ; and ( b ) a sample or , as the case may be , fingerprint was also taken from the convicted person for the purposes of that investigation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL in its earlier form had included a requirement that if the person from whom the fingerprints or samples were taken in connection with the investigation was acquitted of that offence , the fingerprints and samples , subject to certain exceptions , were to be destroyed \u201c as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the proceedings \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The subsequent use of materials retained under section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) is not regulated by statute , other than the limitation on use contained in that provision . In Attorney - General \u2019s Reference ( No . DATE ) [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL , ORG had to consider whether it was permissible to use in evidence a sample which should have been destroyed under the then text of CARDINAL of PACE . The ORG considered that the prohibition on the use of an unlawfully retained sample \u201c for the purposes of any investigation \u201d did not amount to a mandatory exclusion of evidence obtained as a result of a failure to comply with the prohibition , but left the question of admissibility to the discretion of the trial judge .", "CARDINAL . LAW was adopted on DATE to give effect to Directive CARDINAL of ORG and of ORG see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Under LAW \u201c personal data \u201d means data which relate to a living individual who can be identified ( a ) from those data ; or ( b ) from those data and other information which is in the possession of , or is likely to come into the possession of , the data controller , and includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual ( section CARDINAL ) . \u201c Sensitive personal data \u201d means personal data consisting , inter alia , of information as to the racial or ethnic origin of the data subject , the commission or alleged commission by him of any offence , or any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by him , the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The Act stipulates that the processing of personal data is subject to CARDINAL data protection principles listed in Schedule CARDINAL . Under the first principle personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and , in particular , shall not be processed unless ( a ) CARDINAL of the conditions in Schedule CARDINAL is met ; and ( b ) in case of sensitive personal data , CARDINAL of the conditions in Schedule CARDINAL is also met . Schedule CARDINAL contains a detailed list of conditions , and provides , inter alia , that the processing of any personal data is necessary for the administration of justice or for the exercise of any other functions of a public nature exercised in the public interest by any person ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) and ( d ) ) . Schedule CARDINAL contains a more detailed list of conditions , including that the processing of sensitive personal data is necessary for the purpose of , or in connection with , any legal proceedings ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) ) , or for the administration of justice ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ( a ) ) , and is carried out with appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects ( \u00a7 CARDINAL ( b ) ) . Section CARDINAL notably provides that personal data processed for the prevention or detection of crime are exempt from the first principle except to the extent to which it requires compliance with the conditions in Schedules CARDINAL . The fifth principle stipulates that personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes .", "CARDINAL . The Information Commissioner created pursuant to the LAW ( as amended ) has an independent duty to promote the following of good practice by data controllers and has power to make orders ( \u201c enforcement notices \u201d ) in this respect ( section CARDINAL ) . The LAW makes it a criminal offence not to comply with an enforcement notice ( section CARDINAL ) or to obtain or disclose personal data or information contained therein without the consent of the data controller ( section DATE ) . LAW affords a right to claim damages in the domestic courts in respect of contraventions of the LAW .", "CARDINAL . A set of guidelines for the retention of fingerprint and DNA information is contained in LAW on ORG drawn up by ORG in GPE and GPE . The LAW are based on a format of restricting access to ORG ( ORG ) data , rather than the deletion of that data . They recognise that their introduction may thus have implications for the business of the non - police agencies with which the police currently share ORG data .", "CARDINAL . The Guidelines set various degrees of access to the information contained on the ORG through a process of \u201c stepping down \u201d access . Access to information concerning persons who have not been convicted of an offence is automatically \u201c stepped down \u201d so that this information is only open to inspection by the police . Access to information about convicted persons is likewise \u201c stepped down \u201d after the expiry of certain periods of time ranging from CARDINAL thirty - five years , depending on the gravity of the offence , the age of the suspect and the sentence imposed . For certain convictions the access will never be \u201c stepped down \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Chief police officers are the data controllers of all ORG records created by their force . They have the discretion in exceptional circumstances to authorise the deletion of any conviction , penalty notice for disorder , acquittal or arrest histories \u201c owned \u201d by them . An \u201c exceptional case procedure \u201d to assist chief police officers in relation to the exercise of this discretion is set out in DATE . It is suggested that exceptional cases are rare by definition and include those where the original arrest or sampling was unlawful or where it is established beyond doubt that no offence existed . Before deciding whether a case is exceptional , the chief police officer is instructed to seek advice from the DNA and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of GPE , as subsequently amended , the DNA samples and resulting profiles must be destroyed if the individual is not convicted or is granted an absolute discharge . A recent qualification provides that biological samples and profiles may be retained for DATE , if the arrestee is suspected of certain sexual or violent offences even if a person is not convicted ( section CARDINAL of LAW , adding section CARDINALA to LAW . ) . Thereafter , samples and information are required to be destroyed unless a chief constable applies to a sheriff for a DATE extension .", "CARDINAL . The Police and Criminal Evidence Order of Northern Ireland DATE was amended in DATE in the same way as PACE applicable in GPE and GPE . The relevant provisions currently governing the retention of fingerprint and DNA data in GPE are identical to those in force in GPE and GPE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . According to a recent report by ORG , the retention of fingerprints , DNA profiles and biological samples is generally more controversial than the taking of such bioinformation , and the retention of biological samples raises greater ethical concerns than digitised DNA profiles and fingerprints , given the differences in the level of information that could be revealed . The report referred , in particular , to the lack of satisfactory empirical evidence to justify the present practice of retaining indefinitely fingerprints , samples and DNA profiles from all those arrested for a recordable offence , irrespective of whether they were subsequently charged or convicted . The report voiced particular concerns at the policy of permanently retaining the bioinformation of minors , having regard to the requirements of the DATE LAW on the Rights of the Child .", "CARDINAL . The report also expressed concerns at the increasing use of the DNA data for familial searching , inferring ethnicity and non - operational research . Familial searching is the process of comparing a DNA profile from a crime scene with profiles stored on the national database , and prioritising them in terms of \u201c closeness \u201d to a match . This allows possible genetic relatives of an offender to be identified . Familial searching might thus lead to revealing previously unknown or concealed genetic relationships . The report considered the use of the DNA database in searching for relatives as particularly sensitive .", "CARDINAL . NORP The particular combination of alleles in a DNA profile can furthermore be used to assess the most likely ethnic origin of the donor . Ethnic inferring through DNA profiles is possible as the individual \u201c ethnic appearance \u201d is systematically recorded on the database : when taking biological samples , police officers routinely classify suspects into CARDINAL of CARDINAL \u201c ethnic appearance \u201d categories . Ethnicity tests on the database might thus provide inferences for use during a police investigation in order , for example , to help reduce a \u201c suspect pool \u201d and to inform police priorities . The report noted that social factors and policing practices lead to a disproportionate number of people from black and ethnic minority groups being stopped , searched and arrested by the police , and hence having their DNA profiles recorded ; it therefore voiced concerns that inferring ethnic identity from biological samples might reinforce racist views of propensity to criminality .", "CARDINAL . ORG of DATE for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data ( \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , which entered into force for GPE on DATE , defines \u201c personal data \u201d as any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual ( \u201c data subject \u201d ) . The ORG provides , inter alia :", "\u201c Personal data undergoing automatic processing shall be", "...", "( b ) stored for specified and legitimate purposes and not used in a way incompatible with those purposes ;", "( c ) adequate , relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are stored ;", "...", "( e ) NORP preserved in a form which permits identification of the data subjects for no longer than is required for the purpose for which those data are stored . \u201d", "\u201c Personal data revealing racial origin , political opinions or religious or other beliefs , as well as personal data concerning health or sexual life , may not be processed automatically unless domestic law provides appropriate safeguards . ... \u201d", "\u201c Appropriate security measures shall be taken for the protection of personal data stored in automated data files against accidental or unauthorised destruction or accidental loss as well as against unauthorised access , alteration or dissemination . \u201d", "CARDINAL .

The working party was well aware that the drafting of recommendation CARDINAL was a delicate matter , involving different protected interests of a very difficult nature .
