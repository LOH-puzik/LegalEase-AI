The third applicant was one of the co - founders of ORG and DATE holds PERCENT of the company \u2019s shares .", "ORG was founded in DATE and has remained the sole provider of TV audience data to DATE . The applicants state that it has been noticed worldwide that the relevant national markets prefer to share a common source of television audience data . This is due to the fact that commonly accepted television data in the context of national markets form a decisive parameter in the decision - making process , as regards advertising investment strategies . The applicants submit that GPE is a unique case in the field of terrestrial television broadcasting owing to the fact that , under the successive laws that have been enacted since DATE , when the ORG monopoly was abolished , there are DATE CARDINAL private , CARDINAL regional and CARDINAL local television channels , none of which has a proper operating licence . It is submitted that in this context of institutional anarchy ORG \u2019s role has become more crucial than in other countries . The applicants claim that , for this reason , ORG has occasionally been the target of campaigns in which its professionalism and reputation have been attacked .", "In DATE a high - ranking executive of ORG drafted and made public a report on ORG \u2019s activities suggesting that ORG and its executives had committed irregularities with regard to the choice of sample and the subsequent processing of television data .

This report is only an internal document and NORP law does not provide for such a report . It is only by way of a working practice that such reports are drafted by the prosecutor in charge as an informal description and assessment of the facts for the sole purpose of briefing the supervising prosecutor on the case . Moreover , the accused had not yet been notified of the report , and therefore the applicants had no official knowledge of its content .", "On DATE , PERSON , a journalist hosting a popular television show , ORG ORG ( \u201c The Jungle \u201d ) , appeared before a large panel of guests , holding a copy of the prosecutor \u2019s confidential report .

CARDINAL GPE dailies quoted parts of the prosecutor \u2019s confidential report , and CARDINAL of them published photographs of the first CARDINAL applicants and another CARDINAL pages of the original report .
