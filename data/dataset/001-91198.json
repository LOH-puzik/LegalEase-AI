He is represented before the ORG by Mr D. Ajcev , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "The applicant worked as a warden in company ORG ( \u201c the employer \u201d ) until DATE when he was dismissed . On DATE the applicant challenged his dismissal before ORG ( \u201c the first - instance court \u201d ) .", "On DATE the first - instance court accepted the applicant \u2019s action , annulled the dismissal decision and ordered his reinstatement . It established that the dismissal decision had not reached the applicant although posted by the employer . It was only on DATE that the applicant received this decision by ORG ( PERSON \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 ) . The employer \u2019s managing board ( \u201c the board \u201d ) , by a decision of DATE , rejected the applicant \u2019s objection of DATE as out of time . DATE , the employer communicated to the applicant a copy of the dismissal and board \u2019s decisions . It further invited the applicant to the board \u2019s meeting listed for DATE to discuss the applicant \u2019s objection of CARDINAL DATE . This meeting was not held . On DATE the applicant lodged a fresh objection which remained undecided .", "The court found that the applicant had not violated the rules on working discipline . It further dismissed the employer \u2019s arguments that the applicant \u2019s claim had not been filed in good time . In this connection , it held that the board had accepted jurisdiction to decide on the applicant \u2019s objection of CARDINAL DATE and rejected it DATE . The first - instance court held that the employer had failed to prove that the applicant had received the board \u2019s decision on DATE . The court therefore accepted the applicant \u2019s claim as having been submitted within the statutory time - limit , namely DATE following his second objection of DATE .", "The employer appealed , inter alia , that the first - instance court had wrongly considered the applicant \u2019s claim as having been submitted in good time . It provided in support a copy of a ORG receipt list attesting that the applicant had received a letter from the employer on DATE which included the dismissal decision and the board \u2019s decision . It also argued that the dismissal decision should be considered together with the board \u2019s decision .", "On DATE ORG accepted the employer \u2019s appeal and remitted the case for fresh consideration . It agreed that the employer \u2019s decisions should be considered together and instructed the lower court to order the applicant to specify his claim in that respect . It further found insufficient evidence as regards the alleged breach of working discipline . As to the complaints that the applicant \u2019s claim was out of time , the ORG stated that :", "\u201c ... this court accepts the reasoning of the first - instance court that the applicant \u2019s claim was submitted within the statutory time - limit calculated as of DATE of submission of the applicant \u2019s objection in respect of the dismissal decision . In this context the ORG receipt list does not alter this finding since it is impossible to determine the contents of that letter . This evidence does not substantiate the allegation that the applicant submitted his claim out of time ... \u201d", "On DATE the first - instance court accepted the applicant \u2019s claim and annulled the dismissal decision of DATE and the board \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE . It found , inter alia , that the board had not decided the merits of the applicant \u2019s objection of DATE although it should have done so by DATE . Neither did the board decide on the applicant \u2019s objection of CARDINAL DATE . The court concluded accordingly that the applicant \u2019s action had been submitted within the DATE time - limit .", "On DATE ORG accepted the employer \u2019s appeal and overturned the lower court \u2019s decision declaring the applicant \u2019s action as being out of time . It found that :", "\u201c ... on DATE the employer \u2019s second - instance commission decided on the applicant \u2019s objection of CARDINAL DATE .
