The applicant was born in DATE and currently lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG convicted the applicant of having deliberately caused severe bodily harm and sentenced him to six years\u2019 imprisonment . The court found that the applicant had beaten his CARDINALyear - old mother by kicking and punching her face , head and thorax , which resulted in a severe and lasting infirmity . The applicant had been convicted on CARDINAL previous occasions , CARDINAL of which involved similar offences of violence . Relying on a report by a psychiatric expert , the court found that even though the applicant was responsible for his acts , he was suffering from a grave mental disorder , was dangerous to the public and was likely to re - offend . For these reasons , the court ordered the applicant \u2019s detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders in accordance with section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , in addition to the term of imprisonment . Given the time the applicant had served in detention on remand , the ORG stated that the applicant \u2019s detention pursuant to the prison sentence was likely to end on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against his sentence . On DATE the applicant was placed in GPE detention centre , an institution for mentally ill offenders .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a first set of proceedings in which the applicant requested his conditional release from the institution , ORG ( \u201c the Regional Court \u201d ) ordered that the applicant remain in the institution . ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal against this decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for the lifting of the order to detain him at ORG detention centre ( under LAW ) in order to serve his sentence in an ordinary prison .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG asked the ORG prison administration and its psychiatric and psychological service to transmit further information on the applicant , which it received on CARDINAL DATE . On DATE it ordered a fresh psychiatric expert report and instructed the expert to submit the report before DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an application with ORG for the setting of a time - limit ( Fristsetzungsantrag ) under LAW of LAW ( PERSON ) for ORG to decide on his application , as the last determination of the continuing need to detain him had taken place on DATE , and he had not yet received a decision concerning his application of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant was transferred to a psychiatric institution in GPE . It appears , however , that this transfer was only temporary , and on an unspecified date , the applicant was transferred back to ORG detention centre .", "CARDINAL . After having been urged by ORG to deliver her report , the expert replied on DATE that she would submit it as soon as possible . She did so on DATE and explained that the applicant had meanwhile been transferred to an institution in GPE , for which reason she had not been able to examine him earlier . She found that the applicant , even though he had started to respond positively to his therapy , was still suffering from a serious mental disorder and that there was still the risk that the applicant would commit dangerous acts of violence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicant \u2019s application under LAW of LAW and ordered ORG to take a decision by DATE at the latest . It held that in the light of the chronology of events in this case , ORG had not fulfilled its duty to take a decision within a reasonable amount of time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing with the applicant present , ORG ordered the continuation of his detention in an institution for mentally ill offenders . On the basis of the expert opinion obtained , the court found that the applicant was still dangerous and likely to re - offend . It dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the hearing of CARDINAL prison officers as witnesses , since these persons could not make a relevant assessment in this respect and that therefore the applicant \u2019s request lacked a relevant issue on which evidence should be taken ( relevantes GPE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against this decision to ORG maintaining his view that the placement in a psychiatric institution was no longer justified . He maintained , furthermore , that the length of the proceedings for the determination of this issue was in breach of Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . On the basis of the evidence obtained , the expert report of a psychiatrist , reports by the head of GPE detention centre and its psychiatric and psychological service , it found that despite progress in the applicant \u2019s therapy he still suffered from a grave mental disorder and was likely to commit acts of violence in the future . ORG also considered that ORG had correctly dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for the taking of further evidence . As to the applicant \u2019s argument that the proceedings related to his request had lasted an unreasonably long time , ORG found that , according to the relevant caselaw , the condition under section CARDINAL of LAW for DATE review of the further necessity of detention in an institution was complied with if such a review had been started by the competent court within the DATE period , whereas it was not necessary that the decision following the review be taken within that time - limit .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again applied for the order for psychiatric detention to be lifted , and to be transferred to an ordinary prison . After a further application by the applicant under LAW of LAW , the application was finally examined on DATE , when ORG ordered the termination of the applicant \u2019s psychiatric detention , suspended DATE of his prison sentence and released him subject to a number of conditions ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["5"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
