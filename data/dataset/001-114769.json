The applicant lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for authorisation for a political demonstration in front of ORG , in FAC , a vast open area traditionally used for political demonstrations .

In particular , the speeches and music \u2013 belonging in the programme and DATE might disturb the MPs\u2019 work . Moreover , the participants \u2013 whose number was estimated at CARDINAL persons \u2013 might physically impede the MPs\u2019 driving in and out of ORG \u2019s car park , which , in the authority \u2019s view , amounted to restricting their freedom of movement and to inhibiting the functioning of the organ of the people \u2019s representation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied for judicial review . He submitted in particular that another demonstration with an agenda identical to his but scheduled for DATE , DATE , had not been forbidden on exactly the same location ; this fact showed , in his view , discrimination against him and his planned event .
