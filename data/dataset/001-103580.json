ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant was appointed as a prosecutor at ORG ( \u201c DPO \u201d ) . From DATE to DATE the applicant worked as a prosecutor at ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .", "In DATE the Prosecutor General ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) proposed that the applicant be transferred to another DPO , as a result of which he would be demoted and his earnings would decrease . The applicant contested the proposal on the ground that there was no reason for his transfer and demotion .", "On DATE ORG endorsed the ORG \u2019s proposal . By virtue of a presidential decree of DATE , the applicant \u2019s transfer took effect . On DATE the applicant took up his functions as prosecutor at the Pogradec DPO . His basic remuneration was halved .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with ORG against the presidential decree .", "On DATE ORG declared his complaint inadmissible for non - exhaustion of remedies as provided for under LAW ( f ) of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant challenged his transfer before ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . He argued that the transfer and demotion were in breach of ORG and adversely affected his career , income and related expenses .", "On DATE ORG decided to transfer the case to ORG ( \u201c the Court of Appeal \u201d ) , on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction . It reasoned that the applicant \u2019s transfer was akin to a disciplinary measure , for which ORG had initial jurisdiction pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG .", "On an unspecified date , while the proceedings were pending before ORG , the applicant made a claim for compensation for loss of earnings as a result of the transfer . In his final submissions to ORG , the applicant argued that the said court was competent to examine issues relating to the transfer of prosecutors . He contended that his transfer had been contrary to the domestic law in so far as he had not given his opinion , the transfer had not been on the same hierarchical level and the subsequent demotion had not been temporary . He maintained that he had suffered a loss of earnings as a result of the transfer .", "On DATE ORG found in the applicant \u2019s favour and quashed the presidential decree . It held that the applicant \u2019s transfer had affected his employment relationship and resulted in the change of his job and a decrease in remuneration . The court interpreted section CARDINAL of ORG to mean that the applicant \u2019s consent was required for the transfer , in the absence of which the procedure was not in compliance with the law . There was no mention of the applicant \u2019s claim for compensation for loss of earnings .", "On DATE the ORG \u2019s office appealed to ORG .", "In an effort to harmonise the judicial practice inter alia on the legal nature of the presidential decree and its amenability to judicial review , on DATE the President of ORG decided that the case should be examined by ORG ( Kolegjet e Bashkuara ) .", "On DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , quashed ORG judgment , holding that a presidential decree in relation to the appointment , transfer or dismissal of a prosecutor was not subject to judicial review , owing to the special employment relationship that existed between the ORG and such officials . ORG decided to discontinue the case .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He argued that the decision of DATE had breached his right of access to a court . He further submitted that the presidential decree ordering his transfer was an administrative act , which was subject to judicial review .", "On DATE the ORG quashed ORG decision . Relying on its decision no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ORG found that the presidential decree concerning the appointment and dismissal of a prosecutor was an administrative act which should be amenable to judicial review . Since ORG had not examined the merits of the ORG \u2019s office appeal , the case was remitted for a determination of the merits .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing . The applicant argued that his transfer was not justified . He was of the view that the term \u201c opinion \u201d in section CARDINAL of ORG should be interpreted as \u201c consent \u201d . He further contended that the transfer , which resulted in his demotion and a decrease in his remuneration , was unlawful .", "The ORG \u2019s ORG argued that the transfer was grounded on the organisational needs of the prosecutor \u2019s office . It was not essential to have the consent of the prosecutor to his transfer . Other prosecutors had also been transferred against their wishes .", "On DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , quashed ORG judgment and dismissed the applicant \u2019s claims . It found that the applicant \u2019s transfer had occurred \u201c out of necessity and in the interest of work \u201d in accordance with section CARDINAL of ORG . It further held that the applicant \u2019s consent to his transfer was not required by law . The law only stipulated that the applicant \u2019s opinion be sought before his transfer .", "ORG recognised the applicant \u2019s right to seek compensation for loss of earnings and other benefits . However , since the applicant \u2019s claim was directed at the unlawfulness of the presidential decree and since ORG had not examined his compensation claim , ORG decided that it could not examine that claim of its own motion . It ruled however that the applicant could file afresh a claim for compensation for loss of earnings . To date , it does not appear that the applicant has lodged a new claim for compensation with ORG .", "Of the CARDINAL judges of ORG who voted against the case on DATE , DATE had been members of the bench which , on DATE , had dismissed the case .", "On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG and challenged the decision of DATE . He claimed that his case had not been heard by \u201c a tribunal established by law \u201d in rehearing proceedings . Since the decision of ORG did not aim at harmonising and unifying judicial practice , the applicant argued that his case should have been heard by a ORG instead of ORG in rehearing proceedings . He also complained that , despite his request for compensation for loss of earnings , ORG refusal to award him compensation for damage as a result of the transfer and demotion was against its case - law ( see the \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d section below ) . In his view , this amounted to a lack of impartiality .", "On DATE ORG , by means of a reasoned decision , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal . It found that there had been no breach of the applicant \u2019s right of access to a court on account of the courts\u2019 failure to examine his additional claim for damages . ORG decided that his claim for compensation submitted to ORG did not meet the requirements of a proper civil action in so far as the claim had not been quantified . The lower courts were therefore not obliged to examine the request . Moreover , ORG had informed the applicant of his right to lodge a new civil claim for damages .", "ORG further found that the examination by ORG had been by a tribunal established by law . It found that the applicant \u2019s claim regarding the lack of impartiality of ORG Joint Benches in the rehearing proceedings was ill - founded .", "In an article entitled \u201c The judicial review of the lawfulness of administrative acts \u201d , published in a law journal in DATE , the then President of ORG concluded that presidential decrees concerning the appointment , dismissal and ranking of military officers , prosecutors or ambassadors could not be subject to judicial review .", "Under LAW ( f ) ORG decides on \u201c final complaints by individuals alleging a violation of their constitutional rights to a fair hearing , after all legal remedies for the protection of those rights have been exhausted . \u201d", "LAW stipulates that ORG sits in ORG to examine cases that would harmonise or amend judicial practice .", "Article PERSON provides that ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d - Prokuroria ) is a centralised institution .", "ORG is composed of CARDINAL judges ( section CARDINAL ) . It examines cases in ORG ( section CARDINAL ) . It also sits in ORG in order to , inter alia , harmonise and amend judicial practice ( section CARDINAL ) . A request to sit in ORG is made by CARDINAL of the benches , the President of ORG or ORG ( section CARDINAL ) . The quorum for the composition of ORG is CARDINAL of all the judges . A decision is taken by a simple majority of ORG ( section CARDINAL ) .", "Civil proceedings start on the strength of a civil claim ( LAW . A civil claim should contain the name of the court it is addressed to , the personal details and residence of the claimant , the object of the claim , description of facts , circumstances , documents and other evidentiary materials , the claimant \u2019s request and its value ( LAW ) .", "ORG ( \u201c GP \u201d ) is the highest authority of the ORG ( section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . The structure of the ORG is made up of CARDINAL layers : the district ORG prosecutors , the courts of appeal prosecutors and ORG prosecutors , whose duties are exercised by the prosecutors attached to the ORG ( sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) .", "District courts\u2019 prosecutors are appointed by a decree of the President of the Republic , on the proposal of the ORG , after having had the opinion of ORG ( section CARDINAL ) . Before taking up their duties , prosecutors take an oath ( section CARDINAL ) .", "According to the DATE LAW , the promotion or transfer of a prosecutor could occur only out of necessity and in the interest of work . It was finalised by a presidential decree , on the proposal of the ORG , after having heard the prosecutor \u2019s opinion ( section CARDINAL ) .", "ORG is responsible for the appointment and appraisal of prosecutors . It also examines disciplinary breaches as a result of which it adopts advisory opinions ( sections DATE ) . Disciplinary measures may be appealed against to ORG ( section CARDINAL ) .", "The case concerned the impossibility of having access to a court against a presidential decree which ordered a prosecutor \u2019s dismissal , as provided by LAW . In its decision no . CARDINAL of DATE ( CARDINAL ) ORG declared section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG unconstitutional as it was against LAW . It thus opened the way for a prosecutor to challenge a presidential decree ordering his dismissal before a court .", "The case concerned the unjust dismissal of a police officer and his right to compensation for damage . ORG ruled that a police officer who was unjustly dismissed from work was entitled to compensation for loss of earnings . Such an action did not need to be explicitly sought . It sufficed that a police officer challenged the unjust termination of his employment for the court to ( automatically ) examine the consequences that resulted from such a termination , that is , compensation for damage . The burden of proof was on the appellant in quantifying the damage ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
