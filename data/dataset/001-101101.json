AUSTRIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Sverre Erik Jebens", "TEXT": ["The applicant company , CARDINAL Hit FM ORG , is a limited liability company with its registered office in GPE . It was represented by Mr C. Ebert , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Ambassador PERSON , Head of ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE ORG ( Regionalradio- und GPE , DATE \u201c the ORG \u201d ) decided to award a licence for a local radio station for the GPE no . CARDINAL area ( CARDINAL out of a total of CARDINAL licences for the GPE area ) under ORG ( Regionalradiogesetz \u2013 \u201c the RRBA \u201d ) . The licence was awarded to the applicant company , then called KCARDINAL Privatradio GmbH , and was issued for DATE , starting on DATE and terminating on DATE . At that time the applicant company was owned by CARDINAL shareholders , each owning PERCENT of the shares . At the same time the ORG dismissed applications for the same licence from CARDINAL competitors of the applicant company . This decision was served on all parties and contained the information that a complaint could be filed against the decision with ORG within DATE after the decision had been served .", "By DATE of the applicant company 's fellow applicants for the licence had filed complaints with ORG . They argued , inter alia , that the granting of the licence to the applicant company was in breach of LAW , and asked for a review of the provisions on the establishment of the ORG , arguing that those rules were unconstitutional . They also applied for their complaints to have suspensive effect", "On an unspecified date the applicant company , assisted by counsel , commented on the complaints and opposed the request for suspensive effect .", "On DATE ORG refused to grant suspensive effect .", "On DATE the applicant company started to broadcast its radio programmes .", "On an unspecified date ORG opened proceedings for review of the constitutionality of LAW RRBA .", "In DATE , following an amendment of the PERSON dated DATE , the applicant company 's licence was extended to a total duration of DATE , that is , until DATE .", "On DATE the ORG quashed section CARDINAL PERSON , on which the establishment of the ORG was based . It held that the ORG was a special type of administrative authority , namely one whose members included a judge , which rendered all its members independent and not subject to instructions ( weisungsfreie FAC richterlichem PERSON ) . Only in exceptional circumstances , in particular if the authority was an instance of appeal , could authorities of this kind be held to be constitutional . Since the ORG was the only instance to decide on the granting of the licence and no complaint to the administrative courts was allowed by the PERSON , there was insufficient review of the lawfulness of its decisions . Accordingly , section CARDINAL PERSON was unconstitutional .", "Subsequently , on DATE , ORG also quashed the ORG 's decision of DATE on the grounds that it had been rendered by an unconstitutional authority .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the PERSON had been amended and ORG ( Privatrundfunkbeh\u00f6rde \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , a provisional authority set up to replace the ORG , was established .", "On DATE the ORG granted the applicant company a provisional licence for DATE , in order to give it the opportunity to continue broadcasting while fresh proceedings for the award of a broadcasting licence were conducted .", "The PERSON was replaced by the new LAW ( Privatradiogesetz \u2013 \u201c the PRA \u201d ) on DATE ; on DATE the LAW establishing the Communications Authority GPE ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c the LOC \u201d ) was adopted .", "On DATE ORG GPE ( GPE \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , which had replaced the former ORG , granted the licence for a local radio station for the GPE no . CARDINAL area to company NORP and dismissed the licence applications of the other CARDINAL participants , including the applicant company . The ORG examined the company structure and proposed programme content of each of the participants . It found that company NORP provided a coherent package of radio programmes for an older audience , focusing on local news and Schlager music ( NORP - language easy - listening music ) . Since this age group was underrepresented in the current radio landscape the application was given precedence . The granting of the licence to this broadcaster was therefore in the interests of plurality of the media landscape .", "As regards the other applicants for the licence , the ORG noted that the shareholder structure of the applicant company had changed fundamentally since its first application for the radio broadcasting licence at issue , as it was now owned by CARDINAL company and CARDINAL foundation , both belonging to the PERSON media group . The PERSON media group , besides owning several print media , was a shareholder in companies holding radio broadcasting licences . The PERSON media group operated , under the name ORG , GPE 's first nationwide private radio station , consisting of CARDINAL local broadcasters and covering an area of CARDINAL inhabitants . As regards the GPE area , CARDINAL company belonging to that group already operated another radio station in GPE and it was not in the interests of plurality for the same area to be covered by CARDINAL radio broadcasting stations belonging to the same media group .", "In comparison to the applicant company , company NORP was more independent , because none of its shareholders was active in the radio or print industry in GPE and it could therefore better contribute to plurality of opinion . Furthermore , company NORP provided for a larger number of self - produced programmes , although it would have to purchase world news from another provider at the beginning . Although the applicant company produced its own news , it would still provide fewer self - produced programmes .", "The applicant company stopped broadcasting and operating DATE .", "On DATE the applicant company appealed . It argued that the authority had incorrectly calculated the percentage of its shares held directly and indirectly by the various companies belonging to the PERSON media group . It had also incorrectly applied the law because section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) PRA , which stated that the authority should \u201c take into account whether CARDINAL of the applicants has already made use of the licence to be granted \u201d should have priority over any other criterion for granting a radio broadcasting licence . CARDINAL other unsuccessful applicants for the licence also appealed .", "On DATE ORG ( PERSON \u2013 \u201c the ORG \u201d ) dismissed all the appeals . It found that the ORG had described in detail the organisational set - up of the different applicants for the licence , their respective owners in the case of shareholder - owned companies and their previous experience in the field of broadcasting . The ORG had concluded that a group of participants including the applicant company met the basic professional , organisational and financial requirements of the PRA as regards their structure and the proposed programme content . Therefore the ORG had had to decide which participant out of this group was the best suited on the basis of the criteria set out under section CARDINAL PRA . This had been the CARDINAL which , within the licence area , would best fulfil the requirements of plurality of opinion through its range of programmes and which offered a greater number of self - produced programmes ( GPE ) . CARDINAL further element which had to be taken into account was whether an applicant for a licence had used a licence previously granted in accordance with the law . The ORG had taken this element sufficiently into account .", "On DATE the applicant company filed a complaint with ORG in which it complained about breaches of the principle of equality , of its right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions and of its right to freedom of expression . It submitted in particular that the NORP authorities had grossly misinterpreted section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PRA as , in the applicant 's view , the fact that a company had already held a broadcasting licence should be taken as the decisive criterion when issuing a further licence .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant company 's complaint and , ' at its request , transferred the case to ORG . It found , inter alia , that the criteria set forth in section CARDINAL of the PRA were sufficiently precise and therefore were not in contradiction with the principle of legality . Moreover , the decision taken by the authority had not been arbitrary . If the competent authority could only grant CARDINAL licence and therefore had to make a choice between several applicants , all of which satisfied the basic criteria , it had to explain in detail the reasons for its choice . The competent authority had done so properly and without making a mistake sufficiently serious to raise an issue under constitutional law ( ein in die GPE reichender PERSON ) .", "On DATE the applicant company supplemented its complaint to ORG .", "ORG dismissed the complaint on DATE . It held that section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PRA did not oblige the authority to grant the licence to the previous holder , but that the provision in question was just CARDINAL element amongst others in the decision - making process . The authority 's decision to put more emphasis on protecting diversity of opinion than on protecting the economic interests of previous licence holders was therefore in conformity with the law . In the interests of media diversity it was not in accordance with the aim and wording of the PRA , where there was a choice between several suitable applicants , for the licence to be awarded to CARDINAL which had already broadcast in the licence area as part of a media group ( GPE ) .", "Section CARDINAL of ORG , published in ORG ( ORG ) DATE ( GPE ) , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG shall be established within ORG as a CARDINAL - member collegiate body comprising the members appointed in accordance with paragraph CARDINAL plus one judge .
