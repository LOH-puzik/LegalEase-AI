{"ITEMID": "001-79402", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "CHAMBER", "DATE": 2007, "DOCNAME": "CASE OF SAARENPAAN LOMA KY v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "No violaton of Art. 6-1", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is a limited liability company whose main field of activity consisted of building and hiring holiday cottages as well as providing accommodation and travel services . It is owned by Mr PERSON and PERSON , who live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninhallitus , l\u00e4nsstyrelse ) to grant it an exemption permit ( poikkeuslupa , undantagstillst\u00e5nd ) to erect CARDINAL cabins and CARDINAL sauna building on a piece of land called GPE , situated within ORG in the Repovesi wilderness area in the municipality of GPE . The intended cabins were to be located in an area which was not covered by a shore plan ( rantakaava , strandplan ) adopted in DATE upon Mr PERSON application .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the application on DATE , noting , inter alia , that part of the Penttim\u00e4ki property was located within an area included in the nationwide shore protection programme ( rantojensuojeluohjelma , strandskyddsprogrammet ) , adopted in DATE , and that the intended construction would hamper significantly the implementation of a shore plan and the overall settlement of the area .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s appeal was rejected by ORG ( ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6ministeri\u00f6 , milj\u00f6ministeriet , \u201c Ministry \u201d ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant \u2019s further appeal ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) conducted an inspection in situ and held an oral hearing . On DATE it quashed the decisions and remitted the matter to ORG ( FAC ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6keskus , PERSON milj\u00f6central ) , which had succeeded ORG as the competent first - instance body . ORG noted , inter alia , the small - scale nature of the project and found that the intended construction would not hamper significantly the implementation of planning regulations or the overall settlement of the area . The legal conditions for granting the exemption permit had therefore existed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG nevertheless refused the applicant the exemption permit . It considered that it was not expedient to grant an exemption permit as a national park or a nature conservation area might be established in that area .", "CARDINAL . Upon the applicant \u2019s appeal , the ORG granted the exemption permit on DATE . It referred to ORG decision of DATE and observed that the application could not be rejected on the sole ground that no final decision had been made on the establishment of a nature conservation area . Subsequently , on DATE the GPE municipality granted the building permit . The last - mentioned decision acquired legal force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , however , ORG , of its own motion and without hearing the applicant , prohibited any activity which could jeopardise the natural state or landscape of the area . The prohibition on activity ( toimenpidekielto , \u00e5tg\u00e4rdsf\u00f6rbud ) was enforceable immediately and was to remain in force for DATE . ORG noted the building permit which had just been granted to the applicant but recalled the decision on the shore protection programme , according to which the authorities should attempt to preserve the areas designated in the programme - such as PERSON - in their natural and undeveloped state . The undeveloped Repovesi area was exceptionally large and its nature conservation value had been recognised in various national nature inventories .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not appeal to ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , i.e. before the prohibition on activity had expired , ORG initiated expropriation proceedings with a view to acquiring the PERSON area . The area , consisting of CARDINAL hectares belonging to the applicant , was expropriated by the ORG under a decision made by ORG on DATE . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently , on DATE the compensation proceedings began . On DATE ORG ( lunastustoimikunta , inl\u00f6sningskommissionen ) decided on the amount of compensation . The decision was upheld by ORG ( maaoikeus , jorddomstolen ) on DATE . It appears that the applicant did not lodge a further appeal . On DATE the compensation awarded was paid to the applicant ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
