NORP In DATE the applicant instituted proceedings in ORG ( tingsr\u00e4tten ) of GPE against a forwarding agent , claiming that goods belonging to the applicant had been damaged or lost while in the care of the agent . The agent was later declared bankrupt but the bankruptcy estate of the agent declined to enter as a party to the proceedings . On DATE the ORG gave judgment in default ( tredskodom ) according to which the agent \u2013 the bankruptcy debtor DATE was to pay the applicant MONEY ( SEK ) in damages and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL in litigation costs . No appeal was made and the judgment acquired legal force .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant and the bankruptcy estate of the agent signed an agreement according to which the estate assigned to the applicant the estate \u2019s right to compensation from an insurance company under a third party insurance which had been taken out by the agent to cover possible liabilities incurred in connection with its forwarding business . Subsequently , the applicant instituted proceedings against the insurance company in ORG , claiming that the insurance company should pay the applicant SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL in compensation for damaged or lost goods and SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL for the above - mentioned litigation costs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims against the insurance company and ordered the applicant to pay the insurer \u2019s litigation costs in the amount of SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . The court found that the bankruptcy estate of the forwarding agent had not been a party to the proceedings concluded by the judgment of DATE which had only determined the agent \u2019s liability vis - \u00e0 - vis the applicant \u2013 and that , thus , the estate had not acquired any rights or obligations on account of that judgment . Accordingly , the estate of the agent had not been in a position to assign to the applicant any rights emanating from the third party insurance .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed to ORG ( PERSON hovr\u00e4tt ) and requested that the enforcement of ORG judgment be suspended as it had not acquired legal force . On DATE the appellate court found that there was no legal possibility to suspend the enforcement and thus rejected the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . In order to recover its litigation costs , the insurance company requested ORG ( kronofogdemyndigheten ) to levy execution on the applicant \u2019s assets . ORG found , however , that the applicant had no seizeable assets . The insurance company then filed a bankruptcy petition against the applicant . In a decision of DATE ORG considered that the applicant \u2019s appeal against the judgment of DATE had no prospects of success and that , consequently , its liability to pay the litigation costs in question would remain unchanged . Noting further that the applicant was insolvent as it had no assets to pay the litigation costs , the court declared the applicant bankrupt and ordered it to pay the insurer \u2019s litigation costs in the bankruptcy proceedings .", "CARDINAL . The declaration of bankruptcy was upheld by ORG on DATE . However , the applicant made a further appeal to ORG ( ORG domstolen ) , and on DATE that court quashed the appellate court \u2019s decision , rejected the bankruptcy petition filed against the applicant and ordered the insurance company to pay the applicant \u2019s litigation costs in the bankruptcy proceedings . ORG found that , by declining to enter as a party to the original damage proceedings , the bankruptcy estate of the forwarding agent had not renounced any rights it might have had vis - \u00e0 - vis the insurance company under the third party insurance . Consequently , the transfer of its rights under that insurance to the applicant was in fact valid . In view of this and the complexity of other issues raised by the parties in the compensation proceedings adjudicated by ORG on DATE , there was no basis for concluding that the applicant \u2019s appeal against that judgment lacked prospects of success . As the inventory of the applicant company did not reveal any other important debts , the declaration of bankruptcy was entirely dependent on the applicant \u2019s possible liability to pay the insurance company \u2019s litigation costs in the compensation proceedings . Having found that the outcome of those proceedings was uncertain , ORG concluded that the insurer had failed to show that the applicant was insolvent .", "CARDINAL . Following ORG decision , ORG , on DATE , fixed the fee to be paid to the official receiver who had been in charge of the applicant \u2019s bankruptcy at SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . ORG further recalled that the fee was to be paid by the bankruptcy estate . In so doing , it referred to LAW , LAW of LAW ( PERSON , CARDINAL ) which provides that , following the decision by a superior court to quash a declaration of bankruptcy , the assets of the estate shall be returned to the bankruptcy debtor to the extent they are not required for the defrayal of the bankruptcy costs . The receiver \u2019s fee is considered as a bankruptcy cost , according to LAW , LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . It did not challenge the fee as such but claimed that liability to bear the bankruptcy costs would violate the property rights of the estate and DATE consequently \u2013 the applicant . The applicant invoked LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE , ORG stated that ORG had only recalled that , under the relevant law , the receiver \u2019s fee was to be paid by the bankruptcy estate . It had not ruled on the question whether the receiver \u2019s claim for remuneration had priority over the applicant \u2019s right to the assets . As a consequence , this question could not be examined by ORG which , accordingly , dismissed the appeal .", "CARDINAL . The applicant made a further appeal to ORG . It claimed that , in referring to the above - mentioned provision of LAW , ORG had in fact determined that the bankruptcy estate DATE and not the State \u2013 was to defray the receiver \u2019s fee . The use of the word \u201c recall \u201d rather than \u201c decide \u201d was , in these circumstances , irrelevant . The applicant stated further that there was no other legal remedy available for the determination of the liability to pay the fee in question . Referring to LAW , the applicant therefore claimed that ORG was obliged to determine that liability .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal against ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP The assets of the bankruptcy estate MONEY according to the inventory deed DATE were appropriated to cover part of the receiver \u2019s fee . The remainder of the fee was paid by the insurance company .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG quashed ORG judgment of DATE and referred the compensation case back to the latter court for PERSON . The appellate court found that ORG had not examined the applicant \u2019s claim that the rights under the third party insurance had been transferred from the forwarding agent to its bankruptcy estate at the time when the agent was declared bankrupt , rather than as a consequence of the default judgment of DATE . ORG had also failed to consider the insurance company \u2019s counter - claim that , under the relevant provision of ORG NORP om f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsavtal , CARDINAL ) , it was not liable to pay any compensation as , at the time of the declaration of bankruptcy , the policy - holder , i.e. the forwarding agent , had had no claim for compensation . Thus , ORG had made a procedural error which presumably had affected the outcome of the case and which could not be remedied by ORG .", "CARDINAL . After the case had been referred back to ORG , the insurance company conceded the applicant \u2019s compensation claims . Consequently , on DATE , ORG gave judgment in the applicant \u2019s favour , ordering the insurance company to pay the compensation claimed and the applicant \u2019s litigation costs .", "CARDINAL . References in this section are made to LAW , unless otherwise indicated .", "CARDINAL . NORP By means of bankruptcy , all creditors collectively and compulsorily take the total assets of an insolvent debtor for payment of their claims . During bankruptcy , the bankruptcy estate takes care of the debtor \u2019s assets on behalf of the creditors ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . An insolvent debtor is declared bankrupt by ORG following his own or a creditor \u2019s petition . As a rule , it is for the petitioner to show that the debtor is insolvent . However , if certain requirements are fulfilled , a debtor is considered insolvent unless otherwise shown ( chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . In such cases , the burden of proof is placed on the debtor . Thus , unless otherwise shown , a debtor is deemed to be insolvent when , in the event of enforcement within DATE before the bankruptcy petition , inter alia , it appeared that he or she did not have assets for full payment of the claim . If a creditor \u2019s claim has been confirmed by a court , the creditor may request that the debtor be declared bankrupt even if the court \u2019s decision has not acquired legal force . This does not apply , however , if the court has ordered that the judgment must not be enforced before it has acquired legal force ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The administration of a bankruptcy estate is managed by CARDINAL or more official receivers appointed by ORG and supervised by a section of ORG , ORG in Bankruptcy ( tillsynsmyndigheten i konkurs ) ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , and chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and DATE ) . The receiver must have regard to the common rights and best interests of the creditors and shall take all necessary measures to promote an advantageous and expeditious winding - up of the estate . The receiver is obliged to notify the public prosecutor if he considers that the debtor may be suspected of certain economic crimes ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The bankruptcy costs include , inter alia , the official receiver \u2019s fee for work performed and the reimbursement of any special costs borne by him during the performance of his assignment ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . If ORG considers , after hearing the receiver , that the assets of the bankruptcy estate do not suffice to pay the bankruptcy costs and other debts that the estate has incurred , the court shall decide to terminate the bankruptcy proceedings ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG determines the receiver \u2019s fee after having consulted ORG . The fee should constitute reasonable remuneration for the assignment ( chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The bankruptcy costs are paid out of the bankruptcy estate before other debts ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) . Thus , no distribution to the creditors can take place until , first , the bankruptcy costs and , then , any other debts that the bankruptcy estate may have incurred have been paid . The ORG and the creditor who filed the bankruptcy petition can also be made liable for the bankruptcy costs but their liability is of a secondary nature ( chapter DATE , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . Accordingly , if the bankruptcy proceedings are terminated in accordance with chapter DATE , section CARDINAL , the creditor who filed the petition for bankruptcy is to pay the costs to the extent that they can not be paid out of the estate . However , this liability is limited to CARDINAL of a basic amount geared to the price index ( basbelopp ; this basic amount is regulated in LAW ( NORP om allm\u00e4n f\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) ) . At the time of the declaration of bankruptcy in the present case , CARDINAL of the basic amount corresponded to SEK CARDINAL,CARDINAL . If the amount to be paid out of the estate or by the creditor does not suffice to cover the bankruptcy costs , the remainder of the costs is to be borne by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Bankruptcy decisions are immediately enforceable ( chapter DATE , section CARDINAL ) . Thus , following the declaration of bankruptcy of a debtor , ORG must promptly appoint a receiver who shall start his or her work immediately , regardless of whether an appeal has been lodged against the declaration of bankruptcy . In the event of a higher court quashing the bankruptcy decision , all administrative measures are to be interrupted forthwith and the case referred back to ORG for concluding measures .", "CARDINAL . In such a situation , the assets of the estate are restored to the debtor to the extent that they are not required for the defrayal of the bankruptcy costs and other costs that the estate has incurred ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . Thus , there is no exception to the estate \u2019s liability to pay the bankruptcy costs ( chapter CARDINAL , section DATE , and chapter CARDINAL , sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) . According to the preparatory works to LAW ( see Government PERSON , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) , the creditor who filed the petition for bankruptcy should not be liable for the bankruptcy costs , as it may be difficult for the creditor to make an assessment as to the debtor \u2019s insolvency . Instead , even if a declaration of bankruptcy is later quashed for being factually erroneous , the bankruptcy costs are paid out of the estate . The main reason for this unconditional liability is that the debtor , being aware of the liability , is expected to do the utmost in ORG in order to avoid being declared bankrupt and , thus , not to wait until the bankruptcy case is pending before a higher court .", "CARDINAL . However , as shown by a decision of ORG of DATE ( see FAC DATE , p. CARDINAL et seq . ) , the ORG may be held liable to pay the bankruptcy costs when the declaration of bankruptcy is quashed due to a grave procedural error . In that case , ORG had summoned the debtor to its hearing in an erroneous manner . Following the hearing , at which the debtor did not appear , the debtor was declared bankrupt . After ORG had quashed the declaration of bankruptcy , ORG , in determining the receiver \u2019s fee , recalled that the bankruptcy costs were to be paid out of the estate . ORG upheld the decision . ORG , however , found that the ORG should pay the bankruptcy costs . It considered that the rationale behind the provisions concerning the estate \u2019s liability for bankruptcy costs had no convincing force in that case , as the debtor , on account of the erroneous service of the summons , had been deprived of his right to take part in the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . It follows from chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW ( ORG , CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) that the ORG is liable to pay compensation for , inter alia , financial loss caused by a wrongful act or omission in connection with the exercise of public authority .", "CARDINAL . Anyone who wishes to claim compensation from the ORG for financial loss , which he considers to have been caused by a wrongful decision taken by a court or an administrative ORG authority , can proceed in CARDINAL different ways : He or she may either petition the Chancellor of Justice ( NORP ) in accordance with LAW on ORG against the State ( F\u00f6rordningen om handl\u00e4ggning av skadest\u00e5ndsanspr\u00e5k mot staten , CARDINAL:CARDINAL , or bring a civil action against the ORG in the ordinary courts . No appeal lies against a decision of the Chancellor of ORG . However , if the claim is rejected , the claimant still has the possibility to institute civil proceedings in the courts .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ( see PERSON DATE , p. CARDINAL et seq . ) , ORG examined whether the ORG was liable to pay damages on account of an appellate court \u2019s allegedly incorrect assessment of legal and evidentiary issues in connection with its examination of an application for provisional attachment ( kvarstad ) . ORG made the following general observation :", "\u201c When , as in the present case , legal and evidentiary issues are concerned , it is not sufficient for a liability to damages that a court has made an assessment that may be called into question . Considerations on such issues may vary to such an extent that it is rather rare that one can speak about culpa or , in other words , a wrongful act or omission within the meaning of chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL of LAW . Only manifestly erroneous assessments can be considered as culpable . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
