THE CZECH REPUBLIC", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was represented before the ORG by Mr E. GPE , of ORG . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as presented by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant joined the armed forces : he worked as a warder in the prison service , then in the police ( ORG at the time ) until DATE , ORG , ORG ( ORG bezpe\u010dnostn\u00ed informa\u010dn\u00ed slu\u017eba ) DATE which was dissolved on DATE by Law no . DATE and , from DATE to DATE , in ORG of GPE ORG informa\u010dn\u00ed slu\u017eba \u010cesk\u00e9 republiky \u2013 \u201c the SIS \u201d ) . On DATE he stopped working and applied for a service allowance ( p\u0159\u00edsp\u011bvek za slu\u017ebu ) , as provided for by law .", "On DATE ORG of ORG decided , by virtue of sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on the ORG , and having regard to the fact that the applicant had served in the armed forces for DATE , to grant him a service allowance as of CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE and CARDINAL DATE the Director of the ORG informed the applicant that his allowance had been increased .", "On DATE the Director of the SIS informed the applicant that the increase in his allowance had been wrongfully awarded as it did not apply to allowances awarded under PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and ordered him to refund the surplus . He did , however , confirm the applicant \u2019s entitlement to the service allowance as determined on DATE . The applicant challenged the decision , alleging that the ORG had a duty to pay and adjust his allowance . Having obtained no satisfaction from the ORG , he asked the GPE CARDINAL ORG ( Obvodn\u00ed soud ) to order the ORG to increase his allowance . The court issued a decision of non - jurisdiction , terminating the proceedings . It also noted that it had not been for ORG to take the decision concerning the applicant \u2019s initial application for an allowance when he left the service , and that the decision of DATE was therefore void . The case was referred to the Director of the ORG .", "On DATE the Director of the ORG decided , with immediate effect , that the applicant was not entitled to a service allowance . He noted that the decision of DATE had been taken by an authority that had no power to take such a decision as it was a matter for the Director of the ORG to decide . That being so , he decided that the applicant did not meet the length - of - service requirement as , under LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , only the periods of service after DATE could be taken into account .", "On DATE the applicant appealed , arguing that his right to receive the disputed allowance had been acknowledged by previous acts of the Director of the ORG and that his DATE of service from DATE should also be taken into account .", "In a decision of DATE , the Director of the ORG rejected the appeal and upheld the earlier decision . He maintained , first of all , that his predecessor \u2019s actions , on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , had been merely informative and could not be considered formal decisions ; the first formal decision had been that of DATE . As to the period of service that should be taken into consideration when determining entitlement to the allowance , the Director considered , having examined the relevant provisions of Law no . DATE , that in the present case DATE of service after DATE could be taken into account . He also noted that each PERSON contained its own regulations governing the conditions under which the service allowance should be granted , and that in so far as entitlement to the allowance was linked to the beneficiary \u2019s leaving the armed forces , the obligations transferred by virtue of LAW of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL could not include those concerning the service allowance .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG ( PERSON ) to have the decisions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE reviewed . He complained that he had been deprived of a \u201c welfare \u201d benefit he had been awarded by an allegedly correct final decision ( res judicata ) and challenged the selective and discriminatory interpretation of LAW no . CARDINAL developed in the impugned decisions . Other categories of staff assigned to comparable duties were treated differently in that they received the allowance in issue , he argued .", "On DATE the applicant challenged the same decisions in a constitutional appeal , alleging that they violated the principles of equality and legal certainty , as well as the principles of the rule of law according to which public authority must be exercised within the limits of the law and administrative acts are presumed to be valid . In this appeal he reiterated the objections raised in his DATE appeal concerning the discriminatory interpretation of section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , the different treatment to which he alleged he had been subjected and the fact that he had been deprived of a \u201c welfare \u201d benefit . In supplementary pleadings dated DATE the applicant complained that he had been discriminated against and , to all intents and purposes , penalised for having worked for the ORG , arguing that if he had left the armed forces on DATE he would have been entitled to the disputed allowance ( under PERSON no . MONEY ) .", "On DATE ORG terminated the proceedings , pointing out that under the relevant provisions of LAW and new Law no . CARDINAL on the ORG the courts no longer had jurisdiction to review decisions taken by the ORG .", "On DATE the Second Section of the Constitutional Court ( PERSON ) rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal as manifestly ill - founded . It held that the applicant was merely disputing the findings of the impugned decisions , though these were based on an interpretation which remained within the bounds of the LAW . Given that the decision of DATE ( whereby the applicant was initially granted the disputed allowance ) had been taken by a body without authority to take it , ORG considered it null and void .", "The applicant enclosed a judgment delivered by LAW on DATE in a similar case concerning PERSON ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law and practice \u201d below ) .", "On DATE the applicant submitted a new application for an allowance to ORG of ORG in respect of the time he had served in the armed forces up to DATE , prior to joining the ORG . He alleged that , when he had moved from ORG to ORG ( in keeping with the provisions of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , he had acquired the right to the service allowance by virtue of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , and that the corresponding obligation had been transferred to ORG and subsequently , upon the liquidation of ORG , to GPE ( by virtue of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "The application was forwarded to the ORG , whose Director informed the applicant in a letter dated DATE that he had no right to the allowance as his period of service had not terminated on DATE in such a way as to entitle the applicant to claim the allowance under the provisions of Law no . CARDINAL . As there was no entitlement , the obligation to pay the allowance could not have been transferred to the SIS and there was no reason to take a decision .", "Considering that his request had not been duly processed , the applicant took court action challenging the inactivity of the ORG . He mentioned that there were CARDINAL other people in the same situation and that in CARDINAL of those cases ( V.M. \u2019s ) ORG had found a violation of LAW .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the claim , affirming that when the ORG had ruled on DATE on the applicant \u2019s initial DATE claim it had taken into account the applicant \u2019s service during the period when PERSON no . DATE was in force , and concluded that his right to the impugned allowance did not exist as at DATE . As decisions on the merits of the applicant \u2019s claim had been handed down on DATE and DATE , even though the applicant disagreed with them , there was no reason to order the ORG to reconsider its decision . The court also reiterated that , under PERSON no . DATE , those persons who had taken on new functions in the armed forces were not entitled to the service allowance , that the applicant \u2019s employment in ORG had come to an end with that body \u2019s disappearance on DATE , which had entitled him to severance pay ( but not the service allowance ) , and that since DATE his rights and obligations had been governed by PERSON no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL . That PERSON made it quite clear that only service completed in institutions protecting the principles of democratic government should be taken into account when calculating length of service . As to the difference between the applicant \u2019s situation and that of PERSON , the court pointed out that ORG had not examined whether their respective claims to the allowance were legitimate , but simply whether the decision of ORG had been valid , having regard to the assumption that administrative acts are valid .", "On DATE the applicant challenged this judgment on points of law and that appeal was still pending on DATE , the date of the ORG \u2019s submissions .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) states that members of the aforesaid ORG who apply to terminate their \u201c relation of service \u201d ( slu\u017eebn\u00ed pom\u011br ) or are dismissed for certain specific reasons are entitled to a service allowance .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the allowance is not payable to people who take up ( new ) functions in the armed forces .", "Similar provisions concerning service allowances are to be found in the Laws regulating service in the NORP police ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and regular members of the armed forces ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of this PERSON , members of ORG who occupied posts in ORG became members of ORG as of DATE on which this PERSON came into force ; on that same day the rights and obligations associated with their service were transferred from ORG to ORG .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) stipulated that until laws were passed regulating the relation of service of the members of ORG , that relation was to be regulated by PERSON no . CARDINAL .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the relation of service of members of ORG ended with the ORG \u2019s dissolution on DATE ; the persons concerned were entitled to severance pay .", "Under the terms of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the rights and obligations arising out of the relation of service thus terminated which had not been assumed by ORG were transferred to the ORG .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the service allowance was payable to those members of said service who applied to terminate their service or were dismissed for certain specific reasons .", "Under the terms of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) a person who immediately entered into a relation of service regulated by another law upon termination of his or her service under this PERSON was not entitled to the allowance .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the allowance was payable to members who had been in service for DATE , or had reached DATE by the time they left .", "Section CARDINAL stipulated that when an employee of ORG took up service in accordance with this PERSON after previously occupying a post in ORG or ORG , or being a member of ORG , the service completed therein and the resulting rights were to be considered as being part of the service completed under this PERSON .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) the service allowance is payable to members who served for DATE in the bodies mentioned in section CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL stipulates that the periods served by members of ORG who occupied posts in ORG or ORG , and also the time served in ORG and ORG of GPE are taken into account .", "The applicant , V.M. , was deprived of his service allowance by a decision of the Director of the ORG after receiving it for DATE by virtue of a decision of ORG of ORG .", "ORG held that his application was justified , considering that it was necessary to protect the applicant \u2019s good faith and that ORG had the power to decide to whom the allowance should be awarded , that power having been transferred to it by the ORG in an agreement concluded between them ( which had been in force from DATE ) . ORG accordingly set aside the disputed decisions of the Director of the ORG , considering that they had violated the applicant \u2019s fundamental rights , as well as constitutional principles . While it did not have the authority to decide whether PERSON was entitled to the allowance , ORG noted that when that matter was examined , the criteria specified in ORG judgment in PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) could not be ignored ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
