The prison management confirmed to the ad hoc commission that special measures had indeed been considered , but that it had been unable to introduce any such measures because of the lack of prison staff , the lack of space ( CARDINAL prisoners more than the prison \u2019s official capacity ) , the lack of another maximum - security prison in GPE and the fact that prison transfers between the Entities were not envisaged .

During DATE of activity in the field , the ORG has developed standards relating to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty . The following are its standards concerning inter - prisoner violence ( see the ORG standards , document no . ORG ( DATE ) DATE , p. CARDINAL ) :", "\u201c The duty of care which is owed by custodial staff to those in their charge includes the responsibility to protect them from other inmates who wish to cause them harm . In fact , violent incidents among prisoners are a regular occurrence in all prison systems ; they involve a wide range of phenomena , from subtle forms of harassment to unconcealed intimidation and serious physical attacks .", "Tackling the phenomenon of inter - prisoner violence requires that prison staff be placed in a position , including in terms of staffing levels , to exercise their authority and their supervisory tasks in an appropriate manner . Prison staff must be alert to signs of trouble and be both resolved and properly trained to intervene when necessary . The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners , based on the notions of secure custody and care , is a decisive factor in this context ; this will depend in large measure on staff possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills . Further , management must be prepared fully to support staff in the exercise of their authority . Specific security measures adapted to the particular characteristics of the situation encountered ( including effective search procedures ) may well be required ; however , such measures can never be more than an adjunct to the above - mentioned basic imperatives . In addition , the prison system needs to address the issue of the appropriate classification and distribution of prisoners .", "Prisoners suspected or convicted of sexual offences are at a particularly high risk of being assaulted by other prisoners . Preventing such acts will always pose a difficult challenge . The solution that is often adopted is to separate such prisoners from the rest of the prison population . However , the prisoners concerned may pay a heavy price for their \u2013 relative \u2013 security , in terms of much more limited activities programmes than those available under the normal prison regime . Another approach is to disperse prisoners suspected or convicted of sexual offences throughout the prison concerned . If such an approach is to succeed , the necessary environment for the proper integration of such prisoners into ordinary cell blocks must be guaranteed ; in particular , the prison staff must be sincerely committed to dealing firmly with any signs of hostility or persecution . A third approach can consist of transferring prisoners to another establishment , accompanied by measures aimed at concealing the nature of their offence . Each of these policies has its advantages and disadvantages , and the ORG does not seek to promote a given approach as opposed to another . Indeed , the decision on which policy to apply will mainly depend on the particular circumstances of each case . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Besides its DATE general reports which are always public , the ORG periodically draws up reports on individual GPE , which are strictly confidential . Nevertheless , if a country fails to cooperate or refuses to improve the situation in the light of the ORG \u2019s recommendations , the ORG may decide to make a public statement . Of course , the ORG itself may at any time request publication of the ORG \u2019s report , together with its comments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Report on the visit to GPE and GPE carried out by the ORG from DATE to CARDINAL DATE was published , further to the request of GPE . The following are its relevant parts :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL . Inadequate staffing levels constitute a major problem throughout the prison system of GPE ... Deficiencies were also observed at FAC , where CARDINAL prison officers were present from TIME for a population of CARDINAL prisoners . Consequently , a number of prison officers in different establishments indicated that they frequently felt that their own security was compromised .", "CARDINAL . The ORG recommends that the relevant authorities conduct a review , without delay , of current staffing arrangements in all prison establishments throughout GPE . The objective should be to ensure that the number of prison officers employed is sufficient to guarantee both staff safety and the physical and mental integrity of inmates .", "...", "CARDINAL . Material conditions varied in different parts of FAC ...", "Newly - arrived sentenced male prisoners spent the initial period ( anywhere from DATE ) in a distinct reception section containing CARDINAL dormitories , which were furnished only with bunk beds and imparted a rather austere appearance . Though their occupancy levels were acceptable at the time of the visit , the dormitories would be overcrowded if all of the bunk beds were full .", "After the reception period , prisoners were allocated to Pavilions I or III .", "CARDINAL . Pavilion I was the largest within the prison complex ( official capacity : CARDINAL ; CARDINAL occupants at the time of the visit ) . It was divided into CARDINAL large multi - occupancy units ( \u201c kolektive \u201d ) , each containing from CARDINAL dormitories , which could accommodate anywhere from CARDINAL persons ; in contrast , the dormitories in a renovated unit ( NORP ) were designed for CARDINAL occupants , a far preferable configuration . In addition to dormitories , the units comprised living areas and sanitary facilities . Furnishings were on the whole suitable and included lockers , as well as bunk beds , tables and chairs . However , the unrenovated areas were quite dilapidated , and the damage from the DATE riot was evident on the roofs and in the broken windowpanes . Further , ORG , which was used to accommodate older prisoners ( over DATE ) , was overcrowded , there being CARDINAL occupants ( allocated between CARDINAL dormitories ) for an official capacity of CARDINAL . Its living area / television room , equipped solely with a few rows of benches , imparted a rough , worn impression .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( official capacity : CARDINAL ; CARDINAL occupants at the time of the visit ) comprised CARDINAL dormitories . Its refurbishment had just commenced and the material conditions were similar to those observed in the unrenovated parts of FAC", "CARDINAL . The recently - renovated ORG ( official capacity : CARDINAL ; CARDINAL occupants at the time of the visit ) was separated from the other parts of the prison by a gate ; it comprised CARDINAL units and was in a good state of maintenance and repair . The ORG accommodated prisoners who had demonstrated good behaviour , and one of its units ( capacity : CARDINAL ) was used for placement of minors and young adults as well as older inmates ; though they slept in separate dormitories , those categories of prisoners were invariably associating with each other ( cf . in this regard paragraphs CARDINAL , DATE , and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL Pavilion II offered cell - type accommodation with integral sanitation ; with an official capacity of CARDINAL , it had CARDINAL occupants at the time of the visit . The ground floor was used to accommodate remand prisoners and administrative detainees ; the first floor held the prisoners undergoing segregation ( \u201c usamljenje \u201d ) or increased supervision ( \u201c poja\u010dan tretman \u201d ) , or solitary confinement ( \u201c samica \u201d ) as a disciplinary sanction . Most of the cells on each floor measured CARDINAL ORG and were used for single or double occupancy ( even if its occupants were formally undergoing \u201c solitary \u201d confinement ) . The exception was a multi - occupancy cell located on the first floor , used for \u201c increased supervision \u201d placements . It measured CARDINAL m\u00b2 and was accommodating CARDINAL prisoners at the time of the visit , which is an acceptable occupancy level . However , the cell was equipped with CARDINAL beds ; it is not sufficiently large for such a number of prisoners .", "The delegation observed CARDINAL serious shortcomings in the segregation and disciplinary cells : certain of them had CARDINAL bed for CARDINAL occupants and the toilets were not partitioned ( in contrast with the cells on the ground floor ) . This meant in practice that inmates were sleeping on mattresses placed on the floor , and were obliged to comply with the needs of nature in full view of their cellmates . Such a situation is totally unacceptable .", "CARDINAL . ORG also contained CARDINAL cells ( CARDINAL on the ground floor and CARDINAL on the first floor ) used for placement of inmates in a state of agitation ; CARDINAL of them was a padded cell ( No CARDINAL , on the ground floor ) . Sheets of paper bearing the inscription \u201c Cell under video surveillance \u201d were attached with tape to the doors of CARDINAL of the cells ( No CARDINAL , on the ground floor , and ORG . CARDINAL and DATE , on the first floor ) ; however , given that no monitors had been supplied , there was no operational video surveillance system . Except for an unpartitioned lavatory , the cells were devoid of furnishings or fixtures ; staff indicated that mattresses were provided if persons were placed in the cells . As already indicated , metal panels covering the windows in CARDINAL of the cells had apparently been removed DATE prior to the visit ; however , CARDINAL of the cells ( No CARDINAL ) still had such a panel , blocking access to natural light . Having regard to the other information gathered during the visit concerning these cells ( cf . paragraph CARDINAL ) , the ORG recommends that immediate steps be taken to ensure that prisoners are never placed in a dark cell for any length of time whatsoever ( cf . in this regard Rule CARDINAL of ORG ) ; further , the metal panel covering the window in cell No CARDINAL should be removed forthwith .", "CARDINAL . In the course of a brief visit to the semi - open sections ( Pavilions VI and ORG ) , the delegation observed that the material conditions offered to inmates were of a good standard .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , serious shortcomings in terms of material conditions of detention \u2013 due to an inadequate infrastructure or to a deterioration of the LOC ( often exacerbated by overcrowding ) \u2013 were present in varying degrees in the establishments visited .", "As a priority , the ORG recommends that serious efforts be made to reduce occupancy levels in prisons ; the aim should be to provide a minimum of CARDINAL m\u00b2 of space per person . Further , any cells measuring less then CARDINAL m\u00b2 should be taken out of service as prisoner accommodation . Where necessary , the partitioning of toilet facilities in multi - occupancy cells should also be improved ...", "...", "CARDINAL . At the time of the visit , PERCENT of the sentenced prisoners ( CARDINAL out of CARDINAL ) at FAC worked in industrial ( different types of metalwork , employing up to CARDINAL inmates ) or agricultural settings and in general services ( kitchen , bakery , laundry , canteen , audio / video broadcasting within the prison , maintenance and gardening , car repairs ) . The establishment \u2019s industrial workshops were dusty relics of another era , equipped with crumbling , outdated machinery , and providing a hazardous work environment . In contrast , working conditions in the other facilities were satisfactory .", "A large area with a hard surface was available for sports such as football and basketball ; however , at least at the time of the visit , no such games were organised . Instead , inmates were found to be standing or wandering around the sports area in large groups . Prison management indicated that other sports and recreational activities were also offered to sentenced inmates ( including bowling , boxing , table tennis , karate , chess , painting , woodcarving , and other crafts ) , and that occasional film projections and live musical / variety performances ( staged by prisoners ) were organised in a theatre located in Pavilion I.", "A limited number of inmates took part in educational activities ...", "CARDINAL . The fact that FAC is the only closed prison in the GPE undoubtedly creates obstacles to the delivery of differentiated regimes and treatment programmes tailored to individual inmates and corresponding to variables such as the type of offending behaviour , length of sentence , etc . In this context , the delegation found that there was a lack of differentiation of regimes / treatment programmes for different categories of sentenced prisoners at the establishment or , indeed , a proper system for classification / allocation . As far as the delegation was able to ascertain , a coherent policy for the execution of sentences \u2013 including a policy for early release and the provision of social support to prisoners DATE was absent . Further , the role envisaged for the educators was less than proactive .", "The ORG invites the relevant authorities to develop programmes tailored to the profile of different types of prisoners , in light of the foregoing remarks .", "CARDINAL . To sum up , although sentenced prisoners at FAC did have an appropriate amount of DATE time outside their units , there remained a gap between the aspirations professed by management and staff and the programmes of activities which were actually being delivered to many of them ; CARDINAL did not benefit from a positive regime which might encourage them to address their offending behaviour . The ORG recommends that the relevant authorities take the necessary steps to ensure that all prisoners at FAC have access to an appropriate range of work , educational , sports and recreational activities .", "...", "CARDINAL . The standard of health care facilities varied widely ; they were excellent in GPE and generally very good in PERSON , but were poor in PERSON and [ NORP ] ORG ...", "The ORG recommends that the health care facilities at GPE and [ NORP ] ORG be upgraded .", "... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG published its Preliminary observations made by the delegation of the ORG which visited GPE from DATE , further to the request of GPE . Its relevant part reads as follows :", "\u201c ... [ L]et me stress that co - operation also entails making concerted efforts to comply with the recommendations made by the ORG following its previous visits . In this respect , the delegation was concerned to find that no fundamental measures had been taken to improve the situation in the prisons visited or as regards forensic psychiatric patients . This clear lack of co - operation means that , if there is no prompt reaction by the authorities , the ORG may have no other choice than to consider initiating the procedure for making a public statement under LAW , paragraph CARDINAL , of LAW or Punishment ...", "The delegation is also seriously concerned about the inter - prisoner violence that appears to be prevalent in the prisons visited . In FAC , it heard about a number of incidents of inter - prisoner violence , which in CARDINAL instance included CARDINAL inmate being ordered to kill another prisoner . Not surprisingly , certain prisoners appeared to be fearful for their safety ...", "In all prisons visited , there was a lack of appropriate accommodation both for vulnerable prisoners and for those requiring increased levels of security . In FAC , a unit was under construction for the separate accommodation of vulnerable prisoners and plans to transform the forensic psychiatric annexe into a high security unit were being mooted . In FAC , work was already underway to create a high security unit . Such units are sorely needed ; there are currently no safe and secure facilities in which to hold dangerous prisoners at either ORG or Entity level , as the findings from this visit illustrate all too clearly ...", "Other issues such as activities for prisoners , health care services , staffing , complaints and inspections will be elaborated upon in the visit report ... \u201d", "CARDINAL .
