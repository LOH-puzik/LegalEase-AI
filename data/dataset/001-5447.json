Their son PERSON was born in DATE . The second applicant has another son ( S. ) from another relationship who lives with her and the first applicant . It appears that the first applicant has CARDINAL further sons from a previous relationship .", "In DATE the local ORG ( sosiaalilautakunta , socialn\u00e4mnden ) placed J. in another family as a support measure necessitated , in particular , by the second applicant \u2019s hospitalisation due to her illness diagnosed as schizophrenia typus schizo - affectiva . She was hospitalised DATE and had also required such care earlier .", "J. \u2019s placement in a substitute family was later extended until DATE . On DATE ORG placed him in public care in pursuance of LAW of LAW ( lastensuojelulaki , barnskyddslag CARDINAL/CARDINAL as amended by LAW ) . The applicants had consented to the measure and PERSON was now placed in another substitute family in a municipality not far from ORG noted that the mother remained in hospital . The father , who was studying elsewhere , had considered himself unable to assume ORG care . J. had already been placed with another family for DATE . As none of the parents were able to care for and raise J. , his placement in public care served his best interest . ORG had regard to an opinion of PERSON , specialised in psychiatry , and PERSON", "ORG imposed no restriction on meetings or other forms of contact between J. and the parents . The placement with the substitute parents was to be in force until further notice . Once the GPE conditions had changed the need for public care would be reconsidered .", "", "In DATE the applicants requested ORG to terminate PERSON \u2019s public care and placement in a substitute home . Prior to the ORG \u2019s decision the substitute parents , PERSON himself , the maternal grandparents , and a former social welfare official who had been in charge of preparing and monitoring ORG \u2019s public care were heard by social welfare officials . ORG also obtained opinions from the local ORG ( of DATE ) and a ORG . The medical opinion was issued by a specialist in psychiatry who had been monitoring the second applicant in DATE and as from DATE . In addition , she had at her disposal the second applicant \u2019s medical file going back to DATE .", "According to the substitute parents , who were heard in DATE , PERSON and the applicants had met only once every CARDINAL - CARDINAL weeks for TIME during ORG DATE long placement with the substitute parents . The second applicant had also been maintaining a certain contact by telephone calls . Not until DATE had the first applicant made any contact with J. during meetings . According to the former social welfare official , who was supervising the meetings until DATE , the first applicant had often not been at home during the meetings in the applicants\u2019 home . If at home , he had not spoken to J. or otherwise participated in the meetings .", "", "The applicants were heard by social welfare officials on CARDINAL occasions DATE . The first applicant stated that during meetings with J. he had deliberately remained in the background so as not to confuse him by the presence of CARDINAL mothers and CARDINAL fathers . The applicants having been afforded the opportunity to propose that other persons or institutions be heard prior to the decision , the second applicant proposed that her own parents be heard .", "On DATE ORG refused the ORG request for termination of the public care . It recalled , inter alia , that the mother had been hospitalised while she was expecting PERSON and the parents were experiencing a crisis in the marriage . The mother had tried to care for PERSON with the help of her parents and a municipal carer but had again been hospitalised DATE after having given birth to J. The father , who was studying far away , had then stated that he was not available to assume ORG care . The applicants were now enrolled as students in GPE but continued to live in NORP The mother was receiving early retirement pension . After lengthy reflection the applicants were now ready to assume ORG care and recognised that his transfer into their family would have to be implemented gradually . According to the medical opinion the mother was suffering from a serious mental disturbance . Although her condition had been stable over DATE the illness could re - occur despite regular medication . The mother \u2019s thoughts were influenced by unrealistic optimism and denial of difficulties . Although she could be expected to manage the care of S. , J. \u2019s transfer into that family was not the optimal alternative for his development . ORG had been informed by the then expert at ORG that there was no such fresh information which would warrant a revised opinion on the mother \u2019s state of health . The discussions with the applicants and the others heard had all led to the impression that in the applicants\u2019 family the responsibility for J. would always and principally fall on the mother . The father had stated that should the mother not be able to assume that responsibility , he would only then assume it . ORG had therefore not become convinced that the responsibility for PERSON \u2019s everyday care and upbringing would be shared between the parents , which ORG entry into the family would definitely require . J. had lived with his substitute parents all his life and he was perceiving them as his parents both in practical and psychological terms . As the conditions in J. \u2019s biological family had not changed decisively , the best solution from ORG point of view was to maintain status quo as regards his care . As it was also in his interest to get to know his biological parents the contact to that end would be continued and , if possible , extended , regard being had to ORG development and age .", "The applicant \u2019s requested ORG to reconsider its decision . They submitted , inter alia , that the ORG \u2019s opinion of the first applicant as father was incorrect . He had a good and stable relationship with all of his CARDINAL sons .", "On DATE ORG maintained its decision . The applicants appealed further to the competent ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninoikeus , l\u00e4nsr\u00e4tten ) , maintaining that since the care order had been issued their conditions had changed so as to enable them to assume ORG care . Their opinion had not been properly recorded or had been ignored by ORG .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal after having obtained ORG written opinion and the ORG rejoinder . The court reasoned , in extenso , as follows :", "( translation from NORP )", "\u201c According to the medical opinion in the file , [ the second applicant ] is suffering from a serious mental disturbance which may re - occur despite regular medication . Due to her limited mental strength she would need particularly significant support in raising CARDINAL children on an everyday basis . According to the documentation , the responsibility for the care and upbringing of the children would , in the PERSON family , fall principally on [ the second applicant ] . For these reasons and considering the other elements transpiring from the documents , ORG finds that the need for [ J. \u2019s ] public care and placement with substitute parents within the meaning of LAW of LAW continues to exist and that a termination of the public care would be manifestly contrary to the child \u2019s best interest . ORG has therefore been under an obligation to maintain the public care . \u201d", "", "The applicants appealed further , emphasising that the second applicant had not needed", "hospital care for CARDINAL years , which fact had been ignored by ORG . The applicants submitted an opinion of DATE issued by the doctor at ORG who had been monitoring the second applicant \u2019s medical state since DATE and had acquainted himself with her medical file . Since the previous medical opinion had been issued in DATE the second applicant had been seeing staff at ORG once DATE or once in DATE . Although her mental state had remained stable , it could still not be excluded that her illness might deteriorate . The opinion concluded that the termination of J. \u2019s public care would not be the best solution , considering the need to ensure his healthy development .", "On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) rejected the ORG appeal after hearing ORG in writing and obtaining the ORG rejoinder . ORG reasoned , in extenso , as follows :", "( translation from NORP )", "\u201c Having regard to the requests in this matter , the material received , the reasons stated in ORG decision and the legal provisions applied , there is no reason to amend [ that ] decision . \u201d", "", "In DATE the applicants informed the ORG that they and J. were corresponding once DATE . J. had spent DATE with them in GPE in DATE . He was experiencing certain problems in the substitute home .
