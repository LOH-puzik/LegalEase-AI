SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Corneliu B\u00eersan;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , she entered GPE on DATE and applied for asylum and a residence permit on DATE . Before ORG ( Migrationsverket ) , she stated that she was born and raised in GPE and had lived in GPE since DATE . She had CARDINAL children of her own and one niece for whom she had been responsible . These remained in GPE ( hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) with the applicant \u2019s sister . The applicant claimed that she would risk persecution due to her connections with persons who were fighting against President PERSON . In this respect , she alleged that she had been selling merchandise at a market in GPE which she had purchased in GPE and , for this reason , she had made frequent trips between the CARDINAL cities . On CARDINAL of her trips to GPE , she had met a friend , PERSON , who had asked her to deliver a letter to ORG , the Ambassador for the ORG to GPE . In return , Mr Kanza had started sending money to J. This correspondence , the applicant claimed , had continued , with her as courier , until DATE when Mr Kanza had said that he was leaving for the GPE . He had given the applicant his business card , which she handed over to ORG in DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , the applicant submitted that , on DATE , she had been arrested by a group of soldiers belonging to ORG ( ORG ; hereafter \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . She had been taken to their headquarters and told that they knew that she was working with persons who aimed to overthrow President PERSON and that she knew the whereabouts of a certain arms cache . She was threatened and , during the night , she was raped by CARDINAL of them who also mutilated part of her genitals . Following this , she had not been physically abused again but repeatedly threatened . CARDINAL of the soldiers had informed her family of her detention and they had arranged for a lawyer , Mr Y. , who had come to visit her . He had tried to reach Mr Kanza but had been informed that he had died of a heart attack . On DATE the applicant had suffered an asthma attack and had been taken to hospital from where she had managed to escape when she went to take a shower . She had fled to PERSON and then , on DATE , to GPE . However , due to violence in GPE in DATE , many people had fled to GPE only to be forcibly repatriated . As the applicant had been afraid also to be forced to return to the ORG , she had moved to GPE . Still , through PERSON , she had been informed that the ORG soldiers were looking for her and had questioned her family because a search warrant for her had been issued following her escape . Due to this , she had been so afraid that she had left the country on DATE and travelled to GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant further claimed that , due to her traumatic experiences , she was in very poor mental health and saw a counsellor regularly . She submitted a medical certificate , dated DATE , by PERSON , Chief Physician at ORG at ORG , which stated that the applicant had been the victim of sexual violence and that , in DATE , she had undergone plastic surgery to repair the damage caused to her . The surgery had been successful but the applicant had been depressed as she missed her children and wanted to be reunited with them . From another medical certificate , dated CARDINAL DATE , by PERSON , counsellor at ORG , it appeared that the applicant suffered from ORG ( PTSD ) because of traumatic experiences in her home country . She also suffered from recurring depression due to the stress and uncertainty of her situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the application . It first noted that the situation for women in the ORG was very difficult and that rape and violence against women was common and used by all parties to the conflict as a mean of intimidation and part of warfare . Often the women who had been raped were also mutilated . Thus , having regard to the medical certificate submitted by the applicant and the information above , the ORG accepted that the applicant had been the victim of rape and mutilation . However , the ORG questioned the veracity of the applicant \u2019s claim that she was wanted by the authorities in the ORG and her story of how she had fled . It considered that the violence to which she had been subjected concerned criminal acts carried out by individual persons and not persecution based on suspected political activities . Thus , ORG concluded that the applicant had failed to show that she would risk persecution on the basis of her alleged activity as a courier if she were to be returned to the ORG and , hence , there was no real risk that she would be arrested and tortured . As concerned the applicant \u2019s poor mental health , ORG considered that it was not so serious that she could be granted leave to remain . In this respect , it had regard to reports from ORG which stated that treatment and competent doctors and medication were available in GPE for persons suffering from , inter alia , depression , traumas and PTSD . Lastly , it observed that the applicant\u2019sere not sufficient grounds on which to grant the applicant leave to remain in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG ( Migrationsdomstolen ) , maintaining her claims and adding that the police violence against her had been directly connected to her activity as a courier . Even though she herself had not been politically active , the authorities considered her activities as a political standpoint against the regime . Her first transfer of letters had occurred at DATE and she had only done it for the money . The parties involved had then explained to her that Mr Kanza would be the next President of the country and they had also told her that the letters contained money . She had transferred letters CARDINAL times per week and Mr Kanza \u2019s guards had known her . She had been aware of the risks but had been hoping to get a good job if Mr Kanza took power . When she had been arrested , they had not questioned her but simply assumed that she was guilty and knew where the arms cache was . Moreover , through a letter dated CARDINAL DATE from PERSON , which she submitted to the court , she had been informed that the soldier from whom she had escaped at the hospital had been imprisoned for negligence and had subsequently died . Thus , his relatives were also looking for her to obtain revenge for his death . Mr Y. had further written that the applicant was sought on suspicion of complicity in treason under LAW which prescribed the death penalty and was without a statutory time limit . In support of this , she also submitted a copy of a search warrant ( ORG ) , dated DATE , and issued by ORG at the A.N.R. It stated that the suspect was prosecuted for endangering ORG security ( \u201c L\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9e est poursuivie pour atteinte \u00e0 la suret\u00e9 de l\u2019Etat \u201d ) . The applicant \u2019s name , date of birth , the names of her parents and her address in the ORG were specified in the warrant and it was addressed to all central and provincial directors of the agency .", "CARDINAL . The applicant further alleged that the military had contacted her children about her whereabouts and that the man with whom the applicant \u2019s daughter was staying had been arrested and tortured during questioning . The applicant stressed that she would not be protected in her home country and that she would never have left her children unless forced to .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , in support of her claim that she was in poor mental health , she produced a medical certificate , dated DATE , by PERSON , psychotherapist at ORG . It stated that the therapist was treating the applicant for trauma arising from the sexual violence of which she had been the victim in the ORG . She was afraid of going out alone , had problems sleeping and difficulties concentrating . She was very afraid of having to return to her home country and this fear hindered effective treatment .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after having held an oral hearing , ORG rejected the appeal . It noted first that the applicant had not been able to prove her identity but that a language test showed that she was from the ORG . As concerned the written evidence submitted by the applicant , the court considered that Mr Kanza \u2019s business card in itself did not prove any connection between the applicant and PERSON . Moreover , the search warrant was a copy which had not been presented earlier in the proceedings even though , apparently , it had been issued DATE after the applicant had fled from the hospital , at a point when she had already left the ORG . The letter from Mr Y. mainly contained second - hand information and assumptions and looked more like a plea to allow the applicant to remain in GPE . Therefore , the court found these documents to have a very low evidential value . Furthermore , the court questioned the applicant \u2019s credibility , in particular with regard to Mr Kanza and his plans to take power in the ORG . In this respect , the court noted that Mr Kanza had been the ORG \u2019s Ambassador to GPE from DATE until his death in DATE . He had lived in exile during the presidency of PERSON and had returned after PERSON became president and had even been a minister in PERSON \u2019s government . It was thus highly unlikely that he would be planning an overthrow of PERSON \u2019s government together with members of PERSON \u2019s exiled armed forces ( the ORG ; ORG ) . The court also observed that the applicant had failed to explain how she had been in personal contact with PERSON and how she had come to be a courier of money directly between Mr Kanza and a militia group in GPE , when she lacked both experience and political conviction . She had also failed to explain how she had travelled to GPE and how that trip had been paid for . Hence , despite the violence of which she had been the victim , she had not shown it to be probable that she would be of interest to the authorities and persecuted or arrested and tortured if she returned to the ORG . As concerned her mental health problems , these were not of such a serious nature that she could be granted leave to remain . The ORG further noted that the applicant \u2019s children and sister were in GPE . GPE .", "CARDINAL . Upon further appeal , ORG ( Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen ) refused leave to appeal on DATE . This decision was final and the deportation order therefore became enforceable .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant requested ORG to stop her deportation because she had been informed by PERSON that she was still sought and her children had been questioned by the military about her whereabouts . Her children and those caring for them had also been harassed by the military .", "CARDINAL . NORP On DATE ORG rejected the request . It found that the applicant had not invoked any new evidence but only added to her story , which had already been considered by ORG and the migration courts . Since no new circumstances of importance had been presented , there was no reason to make a new assessment of her case or stay the enforcement of her deportation .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG , maintaining her claims but , on DATE , the court rejected the appeal . It found that she had invoked no new circumstances of importance but only added evidence in support of circumstances already considered by the migration courts .", "CARDINAL . It would appear that the applicant did not appeal to ORG but instead handed in a new request to ORG to stay her deportation and grant her a new assessment of her case . She stated that new circumstances of importance had appeared . Mr Y. had sent her a new search warrant , dated DATE , and issued by ORG From it , it appeared that she was accused of being an activist of NORP dia GPE and prosecuted for threatening State security . Her name , date of birth , the names of her parents and her address in the ORG were specified in the warrant and it was addressed to all central and provincial directors of the agency . The applicant emphasised that she was not a member of ORG but asserted that this had surely been added by the authorities in order to apprehend her . Mr Y. and a friend of hers had seen the original search warrant but , unfortunately , the applicant had lost it on the way to see her lawyer in GPE . However , she did submit a copy of the warrant and CARDINAL more letters from Mr Y. The first of these letters , dated DATE , stated that PERSON had been informed about the second warrant against the applicant which , according to PERSON , had been posted at all airports , ports and train stations . By bribing an official , he had managed to obtain one of the warrants , which he had sent with the letter . He further wrote that the applicant \u2019s children and relatives continued to be harassed by the police . In the second letter , dated DATE , PERSON listed all the information he had about the applicant , inter alia , that she had been sought since DATE throughout the ORG on suspicion of being involved with the ORG , knowing their arms caches and being a courier . These crimes amounted to a threat to the internal security of the country . Mr Y. was convinced that the applicant would be arrested and imprisoned if returned to the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided not to stay the enforcement of the deportation order as it considered that the circumstances invoked by the applicant had already essentially been tried by the NORP authorities and that there were no impediments to her deportation . It further decided not to grant the applicant a new assessment of her case since the new evidence invoked only modified and slightly added to her original claims .", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal with ORG , relying on the same grounds as earlier and submitting a letter from a friend of hers which stated that , during his visit to the ORG in DATE , he had seen and read the search warrant regarding the applicant which the NORP police had issued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision in full . The applicant has lodged a further appeal with ORG which , apparently , is still pending .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested the ORG to indicate to ORG , under LAW , the suspension of her deportation to the ORG . The President of the Section to which the case had been allocated rejected the request on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was deported to her home country on DATE , DATE . However , on DATE , she informed the ORG , through her legal representative in GPE , that she wished to maintain her application before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The basic provisions mainly applicable in the present case , concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in GPE , are laid down in the DATE LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE hereafter referred to as \u201c the DATE LAW ) which replaced , on DATE , the old LAW ( Utl\u00e4nningslagen , DATE ) . Both the old Aliens Act and the DATE Act define the conditions under which an alien can be deported or expelled from the country , as well as the procedures relating to the enforcement of such decisions .", "CARDINAL . LAW , of the CARDINAL Act stipulates that an alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE . According to LAW , LAW , of LAW , the term \u201c refugee \u201d refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race , nationality , religious or political beliefs , or on grounds of gender , sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or , owing to such fear , is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country . This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities can not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals . By \u201c an alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d is meant , inter alia , a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment , or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Moreover , if a residence permit can not be granted on the above grounds , such a permit may be issued to an alien if , after an overall assessment of his or her situation , there are such particularly distressing circumstances ( synnerligen \u00f6mmande omst\u00e4ndigheter ) to allow him or her to remain in GPE ( LAW , section DATE CARDINAL Act ) . During this assessment , special consideration should be given to , inter alia , the alien \u2019s health status . In the preparatory works to this provision ( Government Bill CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL ) , life - threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien \u2019s home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit .", "CARDINAL . As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order , account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) . In addition , an alien must not , in principle , be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution ( LAW , LAW , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under certain conditions , an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has gained legal force . This applies , under LAW , LAW , of LAW , where new circumstances have emerged that mean there are reasonable grounds for believing , inter alia , that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment , torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced . If a residence permit can not be granted under this provision , ORG may instead decide to re - examine the matter . Such a re - examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed , on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien , that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in LAW , Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL , of LAW , and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not doing so . Should the applicable conditions not have been met , ORG shall decide not to grant a re - examination ( LAW , LAW , of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under LAW , matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in GPE are dealt with by CARDINAL instances ; ORG , ORG and ORG ( LAW , LAW , and LAW , LAW , of LAW ) . Hence , upon entry into force on DATE of the DATE Act , ORG ceased to exist ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
