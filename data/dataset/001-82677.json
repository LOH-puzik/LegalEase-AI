Before the ORG the applicants , who were granted legal aid , were represented Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in PERSON .", "ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG affairs .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the NORP authorities refused to issue a visa to the applicant spouses , who wanted to visit the first applicant \u2019s brother in GPE .", "On DATE the applicant spouses entered GPE and applied for asylum . In support thereof they explained that the first applicant risked being killed in a blood feud in GPE . In DATE his father had killed a person in a quarrel over some real estate and in DATE the first applicant and his brother in GPE had been told that vengeance was imminent . The first applicant \u2019s father had stated that he should be the object of the vengeance , but the opposing family had insisted that someone of the same age as the murdered relative should be chosen . Blood feud was an ancient phenomenon , which occurred mainly in the countryside , but in DATE , it had become more frequent as an increasing number of persons were in possession of firearms . The applicants maintained that the police were powerless against blood feuds , and claimed to be aware of other cases of assassination due to blood feud which the police had not been capable of preventing . The first applicant \u2019s brother had fled to the GPE , whereas the first applicant had remained in GPE . Due to the threat , however , he had been forced to stay in his home and had accordingly been prevented from leading a normal life . The applicant spouses submitted a document ( no . CARDINAL ) issued on DATE by the village \u201c chief \u201d in GPE , where the applicant spouses used to live , and a document ( no . CARDINAL ) issued on the same date by the chairman of the GPE , both confirming that the first applicant would be killed in a blood feud . The latter added that so far reconciliation attempts by ORG had failed .", "By decision of DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) refused to grant the applicant spouses asylum . It observed that recently blood feuds had become more frequent in GPE again , particularly in the northern parts of the country where the applicants came from , and that the authorities were not always capable of protecting the citizens . Nevertheless , finding that nothing seemed to prevent the applicants from moving to another part of the country and thereby avoiding any possible actions of vengeance from the opposing family , ORG concluded that they could not be regarded as refugees within the meaning of LAW .", "The applicant spouses appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) and stated that moving to another part of GPE would be to no avail since the country was so small that the opposing family would find them easily . The applicants also stated that they had settled well in GPE and that the first applicant had found a job .", "By decision of DATE ORG upheld the decision , adhering to the reasons set out in ORG decision .", "Thereafter the applicant spouses lodged a total of CARDINAL new applications for a residence permit .", "In the first new application to ORG , the applicant spouses submitted that after DATE of infertility the second applicant had finally become pregnant following in vitro fertilisation in GPE . Due to the deportation decision , however , the second applicant had been very stressed and anxious . Thus , invoking considerations for her life and health , plus the allegedly almost nonexistent maternity care in GPE , the applicants argued that they should be granted residence permits on humanitarian grounds . They added that during pregnancy and following delivery , the possibility of avoiding the blood feud would be practically impossible . Finally , they submitted several documents concerning the second applicant \u2019s pregnancy .", "The application was refused on DATE by ORG , which found that the circumstances invoked by the applicants were not such that they could be considered in need of protection within the meaning of LAW .", "On DATE the applicant spouses lodged their second new application to ORG and submitted inter alia a document ( no . CARDINAL ) issued on DATE by PERSON , Director of ORG , GPE , stating that ORG and ORG could not protect the first applicant \u2019s life as far as the blood feud with the named opposing family was concerned . The applicant spouses submitted a further document ( no . CARDINAL ) , also issued on DATE , by PERSON , President of ORG . The latter indicated that the blood feud between the named families was known to the association , which had informed the authorities , which in response had stated that they would not be able to offer the first applicant protection . Both the association and the village chief had tried to intervene , but to no avail .", "On DATE ORG decided to stay the enforcement of the applicants\u2019 deportation and on DATE it sent documents nos . CARDINAL and DATE to ORG in GPE in order to investigate their authenticity ( as GPE has no representation in GPE , the said ORG handles all matters regarding GPE ) .", "On DATE the third applicant was born . His request of DATE for a residence permit in GPE was immediately transferred to ORG to enable the ORG cases to be considered jointly .", "In an assessment of DATE , submitted to ORG , ORG in GPE found that documents nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL were forged . It specified that there was no authorisation for anyone within the NORP police to issue any certificate about the possibility of offering someone protection . Moreover , it was very odd that a person representing a police department would make any statement on behalf of ORG . ORG and its representatives , they were unknown both to the ORG and its contacts , which indicated that the organisation did not exist or was inactive . The ORG added that according to the information provided , CARDINAL of the better known NORP organisations in the field was called \u201c Committee of Nationwide Reconciliation \u201d .", "Having been confronted with the ORG \u2019s assessment , the first applicant stated that it was his father in GPE who had forwarded the documents . The first applicant had no idea whether the organisation called ORG was active or not . There were a lot of smaller organisations like that , of which the ORG and its contacts could not be aware . Moreover , in his view , the fact that the ORG had referred to the best known organisation indicated that it had been impossible for the ORG to make a further investigation into which smaller organisations actually existed .", "On DATE , before ORG the applicants submitted a document ( no . CARDINAL ) in NORP issued on DATE , allegedly by PERSON , the Chief of Police in GPE , and a document ( no . CARDINAL ) , also in NORP , issued on DATE , allegedly by PERSON , representing ORG . The applicants maintained that the documents proved that neither the police nor the organisation against blood feud could protect them upon return to GPE .", "On DATE , referring among other things to the findings of ORG in GPE , ORG refused anew to grant the applicants a residence permit . It did not find it necessary to undertake any further investigations as to documents FAC . CARDINAL and CARDINAL .", "On DATE , the applicants were reported to have absconded and the police decided to issue a warrant for their detention . The applicants stayed in hiding thereafter .", "A third new application , and a request to stay the deportation order , was submitted to ORG on DATE . In this connection the applicants submitted a so - called certificate of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) signed by PERSON , chairman of ORG , together with a resolution of CARDINAL DATE by the said ORG \u201c of ORG about the prevention of blood feud and observance of legal state \u201d , which concerned the general situation in GPE on blood feuds . ORG had document no . CARDINAL translated , in which PERSON stated that ORG had actively attempted mediation between the CARDINAL named families , but so far unsuccessfully . Thus , and since the police had no possibility of protecting individuals involved in blood feuds , ORG had advised the applicants to leave GPE until the tensions had diminished and a reconciliation was within reach .", "On DATE ORG rejected the application , stating that the grounds invoked by the applicants had already in substance been assessed in the previous decisions and that the new document ( no . CARDINAL ) did not alter the ORG \u2019s position .", "On DATE , a fourth new application was submitted , which was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE , a fifth new application was submitted , which was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "On DATE the applicants lodged their case with the ORG .", "On DATE , a sixth new application was submitted to ORG , which rejected it on DATE .", "On DATE the ORG requested that ORG submit their views on the authenticity of the CARDINAL documents ( nos . CARDINAL and DATE ) allegedly issued by the NORP police stating that they would not be able to protect the first applicant upon return to GPE .", "On DATE , on the basis of an investigation carried out during a meeting on DATE at the police headquarters in GPE , QUANTITY north of GPE , with the participation of a delegation from ORG in GPE and various NORP police officials in high - ranking positions , the ORG maintained that they had every reason to believe that the documents were forged .", "Firstly , having conducted a thorough investigation into whether a blood feud dispute existed between the CARDINAL named families in question , the police in ORG concluded that no such case was registered or known to the police , although normally disputes of this kind were known to the police . The Government added that in a totally different case , the NORP police had actually been able to confirm the existence of a blood feud CARDINAL NORP families , of which a family member had applied for asylum in GPE .", "Secondly , the alleged statements were totally incompatible with the official policy and guidelines applied by the police , according to which police certificates may only refer to purely factual circumstances .", "Thirdly , the documents contained several obvious formal and other errors , when compared with authentic documents from the police archives , for example as to the letter - head and format of letters . The documents seemed to be typed on a traditional typewriter , whereas most NORP authorities were computerised , notably when it came to official documents .", "More specifically as to document no . CARDINAL , there was a Mr Poposhi in the police force in GPE , but he did not hold the position of director . The document contained a number of errors and discrepancies , which indicated that it was false .", "As regards document no CARDINAL , the police in ORG affirmed that Mr PERSON had been Head of Police . He had left his post in DATE . His former colleagues , who were well acquainted with his signature , stated that the document was an obvious forgery . They showed documents from the police archives which undoubtedly had been signed by PERSON . The signatures differed clearly . They also noted that the first name of PERSON PERSON was wrongly spelled in the document in question ; NORP instead of GPE .", "On DATE ORG submitted a letter to ORG ( no . CARDINAL) signed by the aforementioned Gjin Marku , which stated , among other things :", "\u201c ORG has verified the documents , presented by [ the first applicant \u2019s father ] to the NORP authorities and confirms that the certificate released by the police authorities is fake . But the relatives of [ the first applicant ] were obliged to take false documents from the police authorities for the protection of [ the first applicant \u2019s ] life , taking into consideration the very tense situation . ORG is not aware and informed about most of the conflicts for blood feud because denunciation to the police aggravates the conflict and might cause uncontrollable bloodshed at any instant ... \u201d", "On DATE , at the ORG \u2019s request , the ORG adjourned the application following the enactment of an interim amendment to LAW , on the basis of which the ORG case would be tried anew .", "Thus , ORG decided on its own accord to examine whether the applicants could be granted residence permits under the temporary wording of LAW , section CARDINAL b of LAW . The applicants invoked essentially the same grounds as previously and claimed that the certificates and information provided by ORG could not be disputed . They also pointed out that they had settled well in GPE . They submitted various documents , including a copy of a fax of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) from the said ORG to ORG in GPE , in which PERSON confirmed , among other things , that the ORG had a case file concerning the applicants .", "On DATE ORG found against the applicants .", "DATE , on DATE the applicants lodged yet another application with ORG under the temporary legislation , arguing that the documents from ORG and \u201c the statement from the NORP Embassy \u201d had not been assessed together . It appeared that the applicants referred to the assessment of DATE submitted by ORG in GPE to ORG . It also appeared that the applicants or their counsel believed that the assessment contained a statement from ORG \u201c that ORG was an objective , trustful and on absolutely objective grounds , a correct official organization to be respected and believed by the NORP aliens authorities . \u201d", "In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the application . It noted among other things that the relevant documents had been assessed in previous decisions , thus the document from ORG had been included in ORG decision of DATE , and the documents from ORG had been included respectively in ORG decision of DATE and ORG decision of DATE .", "On DATE the first applicant was detained by the police with a view to deportation . Maintaining , inter alia , that he had filed a complaint to the ORG , he requested that ORG stay the deportation order . His request was refused by the latter on DATE .", "On DATE the deportation order against the first applicant was implemented . Since the second and the third applicant did not turn up for a voluntary deportation they were reported as having absconded .", "On DATE , the ORG rejected the ORG request for an application of Rule CARDINAL of ORG .", "The applicants appealed against ORG decision of DATE to ORG , before which they submitted an email of CARDINAL DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) from PERSON , of ORG , stating that the first applicant was in extreme danger . He was hiding in the mountains in LOC but risked his life every moment that passed . ORG submitted its comments to ORG and enclosed a statement of DATE from ORG in GPE , although it concerned a different case . In the statement , the ORG expressed the opinion that the legal value of certificates from Gjin GPE was questionable and that they could not be relied on as sole ground in matters concerning asylum applications .", "On DATE ORG suspended the refusal - of - entry order as to the first applicant and the deportation order as to the second and third applicants .", "An oral hearing was held on DATE . The applicants were not present , but were represented by their counsel . ORG noted that both the first and the second applicant had signed the summons to attend the hearing . The summons signed by the first applicant had been handed over to ORG on DATE of the hearing , but disclosed no date of signature . The second applicant had signed on DATE . Counsel maintained that the aliens authorities had failed to take documents nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL into account . No information was provided as to the applicants\u2019 whereabouts .", "By judgment of CARDINAL DATE , finding that no new circumstances had been invoked and noting that it could not be excluded that the first applicant remained in GPE , ORG found against the applicants .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicants\u2019 request for leave to appeal against ORG judgment .", "On DATE the ORG decided under LAW of ORG to communicate the complaints under Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and under Rule CARDINAL to give the application priority .", "By letter of DATE the ORG counsel informed the ORG that the first applicant had re - entered GPE . He had managed to borrow MONEY ( ORG ) from cousins and friends and to obtain a visa to enter GPE , from where he had joined his wife and child , who were still living in hiding .", "A new Aliens Act ( SFS CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , replacing the DATE LAW , entered into force on DATE . The Act established a new system for examining and determining applications for asylum and residence permits . While ORG continued to carry out the initial examination , an appeal against the ORG \u2019s decision was determined by CARDINAL of the CARDINAL new ORG . ORG was the court of final instance . It examined appeals against the decisions of ORG , provided leave to appeal was granted . Upon the entry into force of LAW , ORG ceased to exist . ORG acted as the alien \u2019s opposing party in proceedings before the courts .", "The provisions mainly applied in the present case were to be found in the DATE LAW , now repealed . In accordance with the LAW , an alien staying in GPE for DATE had to , as a rule , have a residence permit ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . A residence permit could be issued , inter alia , to an alien who , for humanitarian reasons , was to be allowed to settle in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . Serious physical or mental illness could , in exceptional cases , constitute humanitarian reasons for the granting of a residence permit .", "An alien who was considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection was , with certain exceptions , entitled to a residence permit in GPE ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . The term \u201c refugee \u201d referred to an alien who was outside the country of his nationality owing to a well - founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race , nationality , membership of a particular social group , or religious or political opinion , and who was unable or , owing to such fear , unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country . This applied irrespective of whether such persecution was at the hands of the authorities of the country or whether those authorities could not be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . An \u201c alien otherwise in need of protection \u201d denoted , inter alia , a person who had left the country of his nationality because he had a well - founded fear of being sentenced to death or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL , subsection CARDINAL ) . By making that a separate ground for granting a residence permit , the legislature had highlighted the importance of such considerations . The correspondence between national legislation and LAW had been emphasised as a result .", "In enforcing a decision on refusal of entry or expulsion , the risk of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment was taken into account . In accordance with a special provision on impediments to enforcement , an alien could not be sent to a country where there were reasonable grounds for believing that he would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) . In addition , he could not , in principle , be sent to a country where he risked persecution ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ) .", "Until DATE an alien who was to be refused entry or expelled in accordance with a decision that had gained legal force could be granted a residence permit if he filed a so - called \u201c new application \u201d with ORG based on circumstances which had not previously been examined in the case concerning refusal of entry or expulsion . A residence permit could then be granted if the alien was entitled to a residence permit under LAW , section CARDINAL , of the LAW or if it would be contrary to the requirements of humanity to enforce the refusal - of - entry or expulsion decision ( chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , in its wording before DATE ) .", "Amendments to LAW , section CARDINAL b , of the DATE LAW entered into force on DATE , whereby a new legal remedy of a temporary nature was introduced . The new procedure for obtaining a residence permit replaced the rules relating to new applications for a residence permit laid down in chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL b , in its previous wording . Furthermore , the amendments to the DATE Act introduced additional legal grounds for granting a residence permit to aliens against whom a final expulsion order had been made . The object of these temporary amendments was to grant residence permits to aliens who , inter alia , had been in GPE for a very long time or where there existed \u201c urgent humanitarian interests \u201d ( humanit\u00e4rt angel\u00e4get ) . Special consideration was given to the situation of children . The temporary provisions remained in force until the new LAW entered into force on DATE . ORG continued , however , to examine applications which it had received before that date but had not yet determined .", "C. Relevant background material", "GPE became a member of ORG on DATE and ratified LAW on DATE .", "ORG , stated inter alia in its Operational Guidance Note , GPE , of DATE :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL Blood feuds", "ORG Some claimants will apply for asylum or make a human rights claim based on ill - treatment amounting to persecution as a result of a \u2018 blood CARDINAL . The term blood feud can often be used in a very loose sense , which does not always refer to the strict code of honour and shame and related provisions in the Kanun and as such the reasons cited for involvement in a blood feud can include disputes with neighbours over land , accidental death caused by traffic accidents or fights , or resurfaced pre - communist disputes .", "CARDINAL Treatment . GPE continued to experience high levels of violent crime during DATE with many killings occurring as the result of individual or clan vigilante actions connected to traditional \u2018 blood feuds\u2019 or to criminal gang conflicts . According to the interior ministry , CARDINAL persons were killed during DATE in blood feuds based on the medieval Code of Lek Dukagjini ( the kanun ) . In DATE , ORG ( ORG ) , a nongovernmental organisation ( NGO ) that worked on blood feud issues , estimated that there were CARDINAL deaths from feuds nationwide . Corruption also remained a major problem during DATE .", "CARDINAL Under the kanum , only males are acceptable targets in blood feuds ; however , women and children were often killed or injured in attacks in DATE . According to ORG , CARDINAL families were effectively self - imprisoned during DATE due to blood feuds . Property disputes accounted for CARDINAL of formally declared blood feuds during DATE , with the remainder pertaining to issues of honour or violations of the home ( e.g. , theft , trespassing , etc . ) . The ORG estimated that there were CARDINAL additional blood feuds stemming from trafficking , which are typically not formally declared out of shame . Of the CARDINAL families reported effectively self - imprisoned in DATE , CARDINAL left the country , including CARDINAL families that sought formal political asylum in other countries . The ORG claimed that fear of revenge prevented CARDINAL children from attending school in DATE , CARDINAL of whom were permanently confined to their houses .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL Police investigations into the DATE murder of PERSON , head of ORG that worked exclusively on blood feud issues was still on - going in DATE . A suspect was arrested but has not yet been formally charged .", "CARDINAL In DATE , parliament approved a law establishing a co - ordination council , chaired by the president , to develop a national strategy against blood feuds and co - ordinate activities of government agencies . However , the council was inactive during DATE . The court of serious crimes tried blood feud cases in DATE and the law provides for DATE to life imprisonment for killing in a blood feud .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL Sufficiency of protection . In DATE , ORG was transferred to the authority of a new ORG . Local police units report to ORG and are the main force responsible for internal security . ORG ( ORG ) employed CARDINAL officers . As noted above , the law provides for DATE to life imprisonment for killing linked to a blood feud . There is no evidence to indicate that individual NORP fearing the actions of those seeking to carry out a blood feud can not access protection from the NORP police and pursue these through the legal mechanisms that have been set up to deal with blood feuds .", "CARDINAL Internal relocation . The law provides freedom of movement within GPE and in DATE the Government generally respected this right in practice . However , due to significant internal migration , many citizens no longer had local registration and status , leading to a loss of access to services such as education and medical care . Whilst there may be some difficulties accessing local services internal relocation to escape the localised threat of a blood feud will not generally be unduly harsh . Whether internal relocation would enable an individual to avoid a threat in an individual case will depend on the tenacity of those attempting to enforce the blood feud ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
