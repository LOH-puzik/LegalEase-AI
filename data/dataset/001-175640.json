On DATE ORG examined an application by the investigating authorities to extend the applicant \u2019s detention . They relied on the seriousness of the charges , the applicant \u2019s de facto residence not being at his registered address , and the potential risk of intimidation of witnesses or victims , and the risk of obstruction of justice and reoffending .
