The second applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national who was the editor and associate publisher of the newspaper . He was born in DATE and lives in GPE . The third applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national who was born in DATE , is a journalist and lives in the GPE . The fourth applicant , PERSON , is a GPE national who was born in DATE , is a journalist and lives in GPE . The fifth applicant , PERSON GPE , is a GPE national who was born in DATE , is the Managing Director of the newspaper and lives in GPE . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On DATE ORG ( \u201c WSJE \u201d ) published on its front page an article written by the third applicant and headed \u201c NORP officials monitor certain bank accounts \u201d with a smaller sub - heading stating \u201c focus is on those with potential terrorist ties \u201d . The article reported , contrary to various other publications , that ORG was in fact monitoring bank accounts associated with some prominent businessmen so as to prevent the funnelling of funds to terrorist organisations . It also stated that the monitoring had been requested by GPE law enforcement agencies .", "The article attributed the information to GPE officials and NORP . A number of companies and individuals were named , including ORG . The applicants submitted that the story had emerged through investigative journalism in GPE , where access to information was particularly difficult for NORP newspapers . The third applicant was one of the very few LANGUAGE - speaking Western reporters who had been able to obtain a visa for GPE after the attacks in GPE of DATE . The third applicant \u2019s sources had been promised anonymity given that CARDINAL of them were resident in GPE , where the government would carry out brutal reprisals were they identified . The story was approved by senior staff in GPE , who had sought confirmation of it from their sources in ORG .", "PERSON , who was head of a group of companies , and one of the corporate entities forming part of ORG , sued the ORG for libel . The PERSON denied that the article was defamatory . Given the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of its sources and the fact that evidence in support of the publication was inaccessible in GPE , the ORG did not seek to rely on the defence of justification in the proceedings .", "On DATE PERSON made CARDINAL rulings as to the meaning of the words complained of and as to the admissibility and relevance of certain hearsay evidence . He concluded that the words complained of were not capable of bearing a lesser defamatory meaning than that of \u201c reasonable grounds to suspect \u201d the claimants of having terrorist ties and of funnelling funds to terrorist organisations . Moreover , he held that the claimants could submit evidence aiming to prove that the central allegation of the article was wrong . In an interlocutory appeal ORG accepted on DATE that the judge was correct in deciding that the evidence was properly adducible with regard to evaluating the plea of qualified privilege : undermining the correctness of the central allegation would make it more difficult for the jury to believe the journalists when they claimed that they were nevertheless clearly given this information . However , ORG accepted that the article was capable of having lesser defamatory meanings or a non - defamatory meaning .", "The action was tried before a jury DATE . Counsel for each of the parties invited the judge to ask the jury what meaning the words in the article bore . The judge declined to do so . In his direction to the jury , he stated :", "\u201c First , if you decide that it is defamatory of CARDINAL or both claimants , we must all proceed on the basis that any such defamatory allegation is untrue . ... The defendants would be entitled to prove the truth of the allegation they have made ... They have chosen not to do that in this case and , therefore , the claimants are entitled to that presumption of innocence . It is not for them to prove anything ... If it does reflect in any way in a defamatory sense upon either of them , and ... the article does in some way link CARDINAL or other or both of them to the funding of terrorism , then we accept , as an absolute fundamental assumption in this case , that such allegation is untrue . \u201d", "On DATE the jury decided that the article was defamatory and that , subject to the judge \u2019s decision on qualified privilege , the appropriate sums to be awarded by way of damages were MONEY ( GBP ) to PERSON and GBP CARDINAL,CARDINAL to his company . They found that the newspaper had proved that the author had received the information he claimed from a NORP businessman , but had not proved that he had received confirmation from his other CARDINAL sources . The jury further found that the third applicant had telephoned the office of ORG on TIME of CARDINAL DATE and had spoken to a representative of the ORG who asked for publication to be postponed for TIME so that Mr. PERSON , who was in GPE for business , could be contacted but that the third applicant had declined the request .", "On DATE PERSON rejected the ORG plea of qualified privilege . He gave his reasons for that ruling on DATE . He noted that \u201c ( t)here is a presumption that defamatory words are false , unless and until the relevant defendant proves them to be true . Here , because there is no plea of justification , the presumption will prevail . \u201d As to the meaning of the impugned words , the judge had regard to the ruling in the interlocutory proceedings as to the possible range of meanings , the jury \u2019s finding that the words were defamatory and the sums which the jury had specified as appropriate damages . He concluded that the words were defamatory in some sense and that at worst they suggested that there were \u201c reasonable grounds to suspect \u201d involvement in the funnelling of money to terrorists .", "The judge found that the author could not have written the article in reliance on the claims of the NORP businessman alone . Further , there was no urgency that required the publication to be made before PERSON had been given a reasonable opportunity to comment on the matters alleged and it would have been sufficient not to name him and his company since it would be contrary to the public interest to publish the names of those being monitored .", "On DATE ORG upheld the trial judge \u2019s decision but on a more limited ground : that the newspaper had failed to delay publication of the claimants\u2019 names to give them time to comment . The renewed application for leave to appeal concerning the presumption of falsity was rejected . While a defendant who wished to rely on the defence of qualified privilege under PERSON v. ORG ( [ DATE ] CARDINAL AC CARDINAL ) , might have to prove that it was reasonable for him to believe that a defamatory article was true , the applicants had implicitly accepted that if the article proved to have a defamatory meaning , they had no belief that it was true . As to the contention that the common law presumption of falsity infringed Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , the court noted that it was too late for the applicants to raise this point as the parties had conducted the case on the premise that any defamatory meaning that the article bore was presumed to be untrue unless the publishers pleaded and proved justification . Accordingly , permission to advance this ground of appeal was also refused . With regard to the application of the presumption of falsity in the judge \u2019s direction to the jury , the court noted the following :", "\u201c we do not consider that it was appropriate for the jury to apply the presumption of falsity when considering the issues of fact that were relevant to PERSON privilege . When considering whether PERSON privilege attaches to the publication of a potentially defamatory article it is necessary to decide whether the publishers acted as \u2018 responsible PERSON in publishing the article . This question has to be addressed having regard to the position as it should have appeared to those responsible for the publication at the time of publication . Whether or not the article was true is not normally relevant to this question- see PERSON v. PERSON [ DATE ] . What has to be considered is whether it was responsible to publish the article having regard to the risk that the defamatory imputation in the article might prove to be untrue ... It does not seem to us right that the jury should apply a presumption that the article was false \u201d .", "However , counsel for the applicants had not objected to the judge \u2019s direction to the jury and had failed to raise this issue at the trial . In any event , the trial judge found the publishers\u2019 conduct wanting in respect of each of the points of guidance set out in ORG ( cited above ) , and concluded that it was not in the public interest to publish the names of those subjected to monitoring and that the author was at fault in not permitting the claimants to comment . Accordingly , leave to appeal on this ground was also refused .", "Lastly , as to the judge \u2019s failure to obtain from the jury an indication on the meaning they attached to the article , it was noted that :", "\u201c The only issue is whether he should have required the jury to define precisely the gravity of the defamatory meaning of the article . It seems to us that the choice was between \u201c reasonable grounds to suspect \u201d and \u201c grounds for investigating \u201d . The difference between the CARDINAL can be a narrow one . Had the issue of PERSON been likely to turn on whether the words bore the more or the less serious meaning , it might have been necessary to invite the jury to choose between the CARDINAL . But the judge plainly did not consider that the precise nature of the defamatory sting was capable of affecting the outcome . We share that view . \u201d", "On DATE leave to appeal to ORG was granted in respect of the scope of the PERSON defence of qualified privilege and the presumption of damage which allowed recovery of damages by the plaintiff corporation without proof of specific losses . Leave to appeal on the jury reasons issue was refused . On DATE the appeal was unanimously allowed by ORG on the scope of the PERSON privilege and the claimant \u2019s action was dismissed ( Lord PERSON , Lord PERSON , Lord Hope , Lord PERSON and ORG ) . The principal issue for determination by ORG was whether the newspaper had been entitled to the defence of publication in the public interest established in ORG ( cited above ) .", "Lord PERSON of PERSON noted that a publisher is protected by qualified privilege if he has taken such steps as a responsible journalist would take to try and ensure that what was published was accurate and fit for publication . He found that ORG ruling \u201c subverts the liberalising intention of the PERSON decision . \u201d The subject matter of the article was of great public interest , written by an experienced specialist reporter and approved by senior staff who themselves sought to verify its contents . The article was unsensational in tone and factual in content . The PERSON response was sought and the paper \u2019s inability to obtain a comment recorded . It was very unlikely that a comment would have been revealing . Overall , he concluded that \u201c it might be thought that this was the sort of neutral , investigative journalism which PERSON privilege exists to protect . \u201d", "Lord PERSON also considered that the trial judge and ORG had given the PERSON defence \u201c too narrow a scope \u201d . He observed that it was the material which was privileged and not the occasion on which it was published while the burden was upon the defendant to prove that the conditions under which the material was privileged were satisfied . The trial judge had misdirected the jury when he requested them to find whether the author \u2019s sources had indeed confirmed the reported facts bearing in mind that the reported facts had been known to be untrue . He noted that :", "\u201c The fact that the defamatory statement is not established at the trial to have been true is not relevant to the PERSON defence . It is a neutral circumstance . The elements of that defence are the public interest of the material and the conduct of the journalists at the time . In most cases the PERSON defence will not get off the ground unless the journalist honestly and reasonably believed that the statement was true but there are cases ( \u2018 reportage\u2019 ) in which the public interest lies simply in the fact that the statement was made , when it may be clear that the publisher does not subscribe to any belief in its truth . In either case , the defence is not affected by the newspaper \u2019s inability to prove the truth of the statement at the trial . \u201d", "Applying the criteria set out in Lord Nicholls\u2019 speech in PERSON , he concluded that the article \u201c was a serious contribution in measured tone to a subject of very considerable importance \u201d , the inclusion of the defamatory statements \u2013 the names of large and respectable NORP businesses DATE was an important part of the story showing that ORG request extended to the heartland of the NORP business world , and the applicants had behaved \u201c fairly and responsibly in gathering and publishing the information \u201d in compliance with the \u201c responsible journalism \u201d test . As to the applicants\u2019 refusal to delay publication Lord PERSON noted that the delay would not have made a difference to the article : in the circumstances Mr PERSON would have been asked whether he knew of any reason why anyone would want to monitor his account and the answer would most likely have been in the negative . Failure to wait was not enough to deprive the newspaper of the defence that they were reporting on a matter of public interest . Hence , there was no basis for rejecting the newspaper \u2019s PERSON defence .", "ORG of GPE concluded that \u201c if the public interest defence does not succeed on the known facts of this case , it is hard to see it ever succeeding \u201d ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
