In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL , upheld ORG decision .", "CARDINAL . In his opinion , to which CARDINAL other members subscribed , Mr Justice PERSON disagreed with the first applicant 's submission that the case raised an issue at the heart of freedom of expression . The most central aspect of the case was that the legislature had addressed certain issues for the democratic process concerning the limits to be imposed on the use of television for paid communication in the course of a political debate . Thus there was stronger reason to emphasise the legislature 's intention in this area than to dwell on the protection of the content in question . The political bodies were better placed than the courts to assess what measures were suitable for heightening the level of political debate . The rationale for the prohibition of political advertising on television was that it was likely to lead to an inappropriate form of political debate . An advertisement containing a political message could easily give a distorted picture of complex issues . Opening the possibilities for such advertisements would mean that financially powerful groups would have greater opportunities for marketing their opinions than less resourceful parties or interest organisations .", "CARDINAL . Thus , Mr Justice PERSON observed , concerns about quality and pluralism in political debate were central and formed the basis of the national courts ' assessment . It was not the content but the form and medium of the expression that was being regulated and ORG , like other parties , had many other means for addressing the electorate . There was hardly any reason to consider that the prohibition in section QUANTITY ) of LAW was incompatible with freedom of expression as protected by LAW either in its version as applicable at the material time or in its amended version of DATE .", "CARDINAL . As regards the issue of necessity under LAW Broch had particular regard to the ORG 's judgments in PERSON gegen PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALVI ) and PERSON v. PERSON ( no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX ) , concerning restrictions on political broadcasts relating respectively to animal protection and to the rearing of animals ( on television ) and to the promotion of religious gatherings ( on the radio ) . Mr Justice PERSON found , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) In the light of these QUANTITY judgments , how should we assess the NORP prohibition of political advertising on television ? Neither of the cases is completely parallel to the situation now at hand . The main difference from the PERSON case is that the latter concerned a group DATE ORG which focused on a topic of current interest : the protection of animals in connection with the industrial production of meat . The association wished to participate in the debate on this issue by showing a film . In this respect , there is a greater parallel between ORG and the case of PERSON v. GPE in terms of its wish to make its existence and manifesto known to a broad public . What distinguishes the present case from the PERSON case is the fact that religious issues in GPE must be regarded as far more controversial and could presumably cause greater social unrest than political movements in GPE . Having said this , however , I find a considerable degree of parallelism between the ORG 's arguments in PERSON and my own views on the NORP prohibition in relation to LAW .", "( CARDINAL ) A decisive difference in the ORG 's approach between the CARDINAL cases is that in the PERSON case the ORG found that the ORG 's margin of appreciation was narrow , whereas its margin of appreciation in the PERSON case was broad . A factor that was emphasised in the PERSON case , and that also applies in our case , is that there is no NORP consensus on political advertising . There are major differences in the rules currently in force in NORP countries . There is a group of countries , including GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , which have prohibited political advertising to varying degrees . Other countries , such as GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE , basically have no such barrier . This difference has a further dimension in that the rules in many countries now appear to be undergoing revision . But the draft amendments point in different directions , thereby underscoring the diversity of views . In some countries , the rules are being liberalised , while other countries , like GPE , are tightening the prohibitions that already exist . In GPE , the Government has announced its intention to present a PERSON under which political advertising will be accepted within certain limits . At the same time , we have seen that the right to continue to impose a prohibition is being maintained through the amendment to LAW . In other words , the rules governing political advertising are subject to constant change , which should mean that States have considerable freedom to choose their own form of regulation .", "( CARDINAL ) The type of interference concerned in this case also suggests a broad margin of appreciation . The regulation of political advertising is less a question of the individual 's freedom of expression and far more a question of how best to promote political debate and ensure good frameworks for the democratic electoral process . In this light , our political bodies have \u2013 hitherto \u2013 deemed that political advertising on television promotes an unfavourable simplification of political issues , as well as giving financially powerful groups a greater opportunity to put forward their views . These considerations have a direct bearing on the desire to ensure quality in the political process . In this area , it is essential that institutions vested with democratic legitimacy be given a broad margin of appreciation based on their assessment of national conditions . ORG 's evaluation as regards expediency should be applied unless \u2013 as stated in the PERSON case \u2013 it appears to be unfounded or otherwise objectively weak . On the other hand , this limitation is important , and particularly in the present case , which has to do with a majority in ORG determining the general conditions for political debate . This means that the courts should give particularly close consideration to whether the solution has a discriminatory effect . In the present case , the grounds cited by ORG in support of the prohibition of advertising can not be said to be of a discriminatory nature . On the contrary , it is argued that political advertising will give large , affluent parties a further advantage to the detriment of small parties .", "( CARDINAL ) In assessing the specific circumstances of the present case , questions can nevertheless be raised as regards the significance that should be attached to the fact that ORG , far from having the financial strength to abuse the power of advertising , on the contrary and unlike the more established parties , believed that it needed the advertising precisely to be able to establish a channel to a broad public during the period prior to the municipal elections . Even if this point of view is accepted per se , in my opinion no importance can be placed on it in assessing the prohibition of advertising in relation to LAW . The reason for this is that it is not democratically possible to differentiate between the various political parties \u2013 least of all just before an election . And if our basic premise is that all political parties must be treated alike with regard to paid television advertising , the possibility of small parties being overshadowed by large ones can not be excluded .", "( CARDINAL ) I have mentioned that there currently appears to be a majority in ORG in favour of relaxing the prohibition of advertising , that solutions in NORP countries vary and that in many countries the attitude towards political advertising is now being reassessed \u2013 with differing results . I have underscored this very situation as an argument in support of allowing GPE a broad margin of appreciation . Now one might ask whether the change in the ORG majority 's political views on the prohibition of advertising entails that neither the will of the legislature nor the democratic roots of the statute can militate any longer in favour of maintaining the current statutory prohibition on the basis of a broad margin of appreciation . In my opinion , this can not be the case . It would mean that the legislature had renounced its margin of appreciation despite clear statements to the effect that it did not wish to bind future developments to a specific solution .", "( CARDINAL ) In sum , therefore , it is my view that a prohibition or regulation of political advertising on television must primarily be seen as the establishment of limits for political debate . These are decisions that should be taken by a country 's democratic institutions , and consequently an area in which a country 's political bodies must be given great freedom of action in relation to LAW . The fact that there is no NORP consensus , but on the contrary a wide range of national solutions in this field , strengthens this view .", "( CARDINAL ) In view of all the channels that political parties can use to communicate their message to a broad public , the prohibition of political advertising on television appears to be a limited interference that is not disproportionate to the purposes the interference aims to achieve . In this light , the grounds underlying the provision in section QUANTITY ) of LAW are relevant and sufficient . If the special circumstances of the present case are examined more closely , this becomes even clearer . The prohibition of advertising was applied to a political party immediately prior to an election . At such a time , it is particularly important to ensure a ' fair climate of debate ' , and some countries have limited their ban on advertising precisely to this period . The possibility that a broad interpretation of the prohibition of political advertising on television may conflict with LAW , as illustrated by the ORG 's PERSON judgment , is , in my opinion , of no significance for the application of LAW to the facts of our case , which lies within the core area of the prohibition .", "( CARDINAL ) In the light of the foregoing , it is my view that there has been no violation of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The dissenting judge , Mr Justice PERSON , stated :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ... I have concluded that ORG administrative decision to impose a fine on TV Vest is an unlawful interference with the right to freedom of expression under LAW , and that the appeal by ORG must therefore be allowed . ...", "( CARDINAL ) In deciding whether there is a sufficiently pressing need for interference in the right to freedom of expression , the ORG has granted national authorities and courts a certain margin of appreciation . The reason for this is that national authorities and courts will often be in a better position to assess the necessity of an interference and have greater insight into any special circumstances that might apply in the individual countries , and the fact that it is GPE Parties to the Convention that have the primary responsibility for protecting and enforcing human rights ( see PERSON . : ORG med kommentarer [ LAW with comments ] , CARDINALnd edition ( DATE ) , p. CARDINAL , and ORG : PERSON of ORG ( DATE ) , p. CARDINAL ) . The part of the grounds that states that national authorities will often be in a better position to assess the necessity of an interference also applies , by and large , to the relationship between national courts of law and national legislatures , and against this background the principle has been adopted in NORP case - law that when NORP courts examine the question whether NORP legislation breaches international human rights conventions , they should accord the NORP legislature a similar margin of appreciation , see for example PERSON ( \u201c FAC ) DATE - CARDINAL . This is not necessary for the purposes of the Convention ; nor does the LAW preclude it . As mentioned earlier , however , freedom of expression is one of the fundamental pillars of democracy , and it is therefore important that small political groups are also able to make themselves heard . For this reason , strong objections are raised against attaching too much importance to the opinion of the political majority at any given time as regards how far freedom of expression on political issues should go . The ORG 's case - law is also based on the idea that GPE ' margin of appreciation is relatively narrow in cases regarding expressions of political opinion ; see PERSON , \u00a7 DATE , and PERSON , \u00a7 CARDINAL . ....", "( DATE ) The main grounds for LAW prohibition of political advertising on television is that if such advertising were to be permitted , it could result in financially powerful groups having a greater opportunity than others to disseminate their views to the detriment of parties and special - interest organisations with fewer resources , thereby impairing democratic equality , and in the expression of political opinions through advertising easily becoming sloganised and manipulative and leading to an unfavourable form of debate . The prohibition has been limited to television because this medium is presumed to be particularly effective and to have a greater ability to influence the public than other media ( see ORG . DATE ) to the PERSON [ the larger division of ORG ] , p. CARDINAL ) .", "( CARDINAL ) The reasons cited for not allowing political advertising on television are legitimate in relation to LAW ( ' protect the rights ... of others ' ) , but as the appellant has forcefully argued , there are also weighty arguments in favour of permitting such advertising . Editorial television broadcasts can easily become dominated by the most influential political parties . Smaller parties do not have the same possibilities of making themselves seen and heard . Allowing advertising for political parties would also help to promote direct communication with the voters \u2013 without the filtering that takes place through the media 's editorial staff . This is a consideration that is heavily emphasised by ORG on Freedom of Expression in PERSON ( \u201c NOU \u201d Official NORP Report ) CARDINAL:CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL - CARDINAL . It is pointed out in the report that complaints that the media to a certain extent ' set the agenda ' appear to be justified , and that as a result of the filtering that takes place through the media 's editorial processes , the political parties must adopt a strategic approach to the media to ensure that their message is communicated . This situation has been accentuated by the fact that television , which for many reasons must be more ' toughly edited ' than newspapers , has become the dominant vector for the general public .", "( CARDINAL ) With regard to the argument concerning the form of debate , the fact is that the medium of television has contributed towards making political debate more slogan - oriented and agitational , and as ORG points out , it is doubtful whether allowing political television advertising will change the character of political communication to any appreciable degree ( see Official NORP Report PERSON CARDINAL:CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) . The eventuality that financially powerful groups might dominate political debate on television , and that the latter might become overly characterised by slogans and trivialised can be counteracted in other ways , for instance by limiting the extent of , and broadcast time for , political advertising on television . As the Commission pointed out , in a NORP society it is not necessarily illegitimate to appeal to feelings .", "( CARDINAL ) In my opinion , in the light of the above , there can not be deemed to be a sufficiently pressing social need for a total prohibition of political advertising on television . A total ban is not proportionate to the purposes sought to be achieved . Even if the reasons advanced in support of prohibiting such advertising are legitimate , they are not sufficiently weighty to justify a total ban .", "( CARDINAL ) The fact that a total prohibition on political advertising on television is incompatible with LAW is , in my opinion , also evident from the ORG 's judgment in the case of PERSON v. GPE . In paragraph CARDINAL of this judgment the ORG states that it can not exclude that a ban on political advertising may be compatible with LAW in certain situations . However , the ORG pointed out that in order for such a prohibition to be acceptable , it must be based on grounds that meet the requirements set out in paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL . The case in question concerned a ban on political advertising on radio and television . In paragraph CARDINAL the ORG points out that a prohibition of political advertising that is limited to certain media does not appear to be of a particularly pressing nature .", "( CARDINAL ) As the first voting judge has mentioned , the PERSON case concerns a television advertising campaign presented by an animal protection organisation , and the ORG has asserted that the judgment must be deemed to be limited to idealistic advertising , in opposition to commercial advertising , and that the scope of the judgment has in any event been narrowed down by the PERSON judgment . I disagree with these arguments . The grounds in paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment concern political advertising in general , and there are no grounds for contending that it is limited to idealistic counter - advertising against commercial advertising . Nor are there any grounds in the PERSON judgment for arguing that it aims to deviate from or limit the scope of the PERSON judgment . On the contrary , in paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment , it is emphasised that as far as political speech or debate of questions of general interest are concerned , there is little scope for restrictions under paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL . When the ORG concluded in the PERSON judgment that there was no violation of Article CARDINAL , this was based on the explicit grounds that the PERSON case DATE contrary to the case of VgT \u2013 concerned the expression of religious beliefs , and that in such cases national GPE should have a greater margin of appreciation ( see paragraph CARDINAL of the PERSON judgment ) . Reference was made in the specific grounds to the extreme sensitivity of the question of broadcasting of religious advertising in GPE ( paragraph CARDINAL ) . PERSON as the Court in PERSON accentuates the difference between political and religious advertising , and underscores the special considerations that apply in the case of the expression of religious beliefs in GPE , the PERSON judgment in my opinion serves not to weaken , but to strengthen and further underpin the view regarding political advertising on television expressed by the ORG in the PERSON judgment .", "( CARDINAL ) In paragraph CARDINAL of PERSON , the ORG emphasised that the animal protection association , which was the applicant in the case concerned , was not a financially powerful group , and this argument has been invoked by the appellant in respect of ORG . However , as I pointed out earlier , I do not believe that the arguments justifying the legal basis for interference necessarily apply in full to the present case . In my opinion , it would be totally unacceptable if the right of political parties to use television advertising were to depend on the financial situation of the individual parties .", "( DATE ) On the other hand , when assessing whether there is a sufficiently pressing social need for a total prohibition of political advertising on television , great importance must in my opinion be attached to the fact that , in connection with the amendment of LAW in DATE , the majority in ORG 's ORG was in favour of abolishing the current total prohibition and instead introducing regulating restrictions . ...", "( CARDINAL ) ... TV Vest has argued that a total prohibition of televised political advertising will be contrary to LAW , as it reads following the constitutional amendment adopted on DATE . I see no reason to address this question , as it appears to be somewhat unclear whether the majority in ORG considered that the right to political advertising on television derived from the new LAW , or whether such a right had to be enacted first . In relation to the question whether a total prohibition of political advertising on television is compatible with LAW , however , the position taken by the majority in ORG , in connection with the constitutional amendment , is of considerable interest , in any event . Since the majority in ORG found the current total prohibition of televised political advertising to be ' unfortunate from the point of view of freedom of expression ' and in the underlying grounds overruled the main arguments that were adduced in support of the prohibition at the time it was adopted , I can not see that it can be claimed with any particular degree of credibility that there is such a pressing social need for such a prohibition that it can be accepted as compatible with paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL . In this connection , I find it necessary to emphasise that the change in the NORP majority 's attitude was not caused by changes in society , but is solely due to the fact that the majority has realised that there is no sufficiently pressing social need for such interference with the right to freedom of expression .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG administrative decision of DATE to impose a fine on TV Vest was taken under section QUANTITY ) ( see also section CARDINAL ) of LAW . The advertisements concerned in this case were aired during the election campaign for municipal and county elections in DATE . I see no reason to address the question whether prohibiting political advertising on television during election campaigns is compatible with paragraph CARDINAL of LAW . The norm that constitutes the legal basis for the administrative decision of ORG contains a total prohibition of political advertising on television . As PERSON . ( op . cit . p. CARDINAL ) points out , when examining the question whether an interference in the exercise of a human right is compatible with the Convention , it is necessary to ' assess whether the national legal basis meets the human rights requirements as regards quality of law in relation to the powers of interference that derive from the LAW and the ORG 's case - law ' . When examining the question whether the national norm that provides legal authority for interference satisfies the requirements set out in the ORG , the question whether the national legal authority for interference is circumscribed sufficiently narrowly so as to satisfy the requirement of proportionality must also be examined . Since the prohibition of political advertising on television , which constitutes the legal basis for ORG decisions , is not circumscribed sufficiently narrowly so as to satisfy the proportionality requirement set out in paragraph CARDINAL of Article CARDINAL , the decision that was made pursuant to this provision must , in my opinion , be found to conflict with the Convention , even though the LAW might authorise the prohibition of political advertising on television during an election campaign . If the NORP legislature should wish to have such a prohibition , it would in such cases have to be the subject of special consideration , and relevant , sufficiently weighty and convincing grounds would have to be provided . The grounds adduced by the legislature for the existing total prohibition can not justify a limited prohibition of this nature .", "( DATE ) On this basis it is my conclusion that ORG administrative decision to impose a fine on ORG is invalid ( see section CARDINAL and also section CARDINAL , of LAW ) . ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL - CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW DATE reads :", "\u201c Broadcasters shall not transmit advertisements for life philosophy or political opinions through television . This applies also to teletext . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that in DATE ORG had found that an advertisement broadcast by TVCARDINAL for an anti - terrorism group named ORG ( ESAG ) contained a political message which clearly fell within the meaning of LAW ( section LAW ) ) . However , the ORG had concluded that the prohibition could not be enforced because to do so would violate LAW . The ORG distinguished the facts from ORG ruling in the TV Vest case . The ESAG advertisement had to be regarded as a contribution to a general public debate on how to fight terrorism , it had been transmitted outside the election period , and had not been connected to any political party or political organisation , but to a ( social ) interest group . Accordingly , the ORG found more similarities with the ORG 's judgment in the PERSON case and , by applying a narrower margin of appreciation , that the interference could not be said to be necessary for the purposes of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government produced a copy of a survey performed by the ORG of ORG ( \u201c CARDINALrd EPRA Meeting , GPE , GPE , DATE , Background paper - Plenary , Political advertising : case studies and monitoring \u201d ) on the basis of answers to a questionnaire , received from the authorities of CARDINAL countries , i.e. , GPE , GPE ( xCARDINAL ) , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE ( xCARDINAL ) , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , the GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE , GPE and GPE ( xCARDINAL ) .

Several countries from central and LOC such as GPE and GPE , also have a prohibition of paid political advertising .", "The most traditional justification for this prohibition is that rich or well - established parties would be able to afford significantly more advertising time than new or minority parties \u2013 thus amounting to a discriminatory practice .
