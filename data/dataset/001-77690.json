The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He was a member of ORG of a local bank and a director of a private brokerage firm .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG charged the applicant and PERSON ( the \u201c accused \u201d ) with malfeasance .

The preliminary investigation against the accused was concluded in DATE .", "CARDINAL . At DATE an indictment for embezzlement of MONEY was filed against the accused with ORG .", "CARDINAL . The criminal proceedings continued at the trial stage where an undisclosed number of hearings were held before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG found the accused innocent of the charges brought against them . It is unclear whether ORG appealed against this judgment and whether it subsequently entered into force .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the authorities established that the applicant 's coaccused , Mr A. , could not be found and suspected that he had left the country .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered that the applicant be detained on remand despite recognising that he had always punctually and voluntarily attended the investigative procedures conducted during the proceedings . In justifying the detention , ORG referred to intelligence data received from ORG on DATE that the applicant was purportedly planning to abscond . The applicant was detained on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against his detention whereby he challenged the need and justification to amend the measure for securing his appearance in court to detention on remand . In addition , he contested the legal grounds for relying on unverified intelligence data in justifying his detention .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of CARDINAL DATE ORG once again informed ORG that on DATE it had received intelligence data that the applicant was intending to abscond . It also noted that without authorisation from the Minister of ORG it could not provide the intelligence data to ORG .", "CARDINAL . A hearing was held before ORG on DATE at which the prosecutor informed the court that his office did not have access to the intelligence data of DATE , because the police had refused to provide it without the prior approval of the Minister of ORG . The court considered that it was essential for it to obtain the intelligence data as this affected the rights of the detained to challenge it . The court ordered that the intelligence data be obtained from the police . The applicant insisted that the court rule on his appeal and challenged the possibility of using such intelligence data as evidence . The hearing was adjourned without a ruling on the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . In a letter of DATE to ORG the Vice - President of ORG requested that the police provide the court with the facts on which they based their information that the applicant was intending to abscond . In its response of DATE ORG reiterated the statement contained in its letter of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . The hearing of CARDINAL DATE was postponed because ORG considered that it was vital for the police to provide the intelligence data before it ruled on the appeal . The applicant maintained that ORG had failed to prove the applicant 's intention to abscond , challenged the need to postpone the hearing and insisted that the court rule on his appeal on the basis of the facts before it . The hearing was adjourned without a ruling on the applicant 's appeal .", "CARDINAL . NORP In CARDINAL letters to the Minister of ORG and ORG of DATE , the Vice - President of ORG once again requested that the police provide the court with the facts on which they based their information that the applicant was intending to abscond . In its response of CARDINAL DATE ORG reiterated its previous statements and informed the court that it had received intelligence data that in a conversation on DATE the applicant had declared his intention to leave the country because he was worried about the outcome of the criminal proceedings against him and in view of the absconding of his co - accused . The police refused to provide the source of the data .", "CARDINAL . At the next hearing on DATE , ORG examined and dismissed the applicant 's appeal against his detention . It found that , in view of the charges against him , his detention on remand was mandatory and , moreover , that there was evidence that he would abscond .", "CARDINAL . After the preliminary investigation was concluded the applicant filed an appeal on DATE against his detention arguing that this was a change in circumstances which required a reassessment of his detention on remand . At a hearing held on DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal . It considered that there was no change in circumstances and , in any event , that his detention was mandatory in view of the charges against him and the likelihood that he would abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE amendments to LAW entered into force concerning the regime of detention on remand ( see below , Relevant domestic law and practice ) .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL hearings at the trial stage of the proceedings were held on DATE and CARDINAL DATE . On both occasions the applicant appealed against his detention , which ORG dismissed by essentially relying on the intelligence data that he would abscond , that he was charged with a serious intentional offence for which detention on remand was mandatory and that he had another preliminary investigation opened against him . At the hearing of CARDINAL DATE a medical expert 's report was presented to the court concerning the applicant 's deteriorating state of health , but it was found that his treatment could be continued in prison . The applicant appealed against the ruling of CARDINAL DATE for dismissing his appeal , which ORG upheld in a formal decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG found that there was no evidence that the applicant would abscond or re - offend and that he had always cooperated with the investigation . In addition , it noted that the police in its letters to the courts had never indicated that the applicant had undertaken any specific actions to abscond . The court also found that the applicant 's health condition required treatment and a special diet , which could only be provided in a home environment . As a result , it replaced the applicant 's detention on remand with house arrest but without citing any specific reasons for placing the latter restriction on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant appealed against the imposed house arrest .", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicant 's appeal at a hearing on DATE as it found that there were no new circumstances warranting a re - evaluation of the imposed restriction on the applicant . On further appeal , ORG upheld the decision on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date , the applicant filed a second appeal against the imposed house arrest .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the second appeal of the applicant as it found that there were no new circumstances warranting a re - evaluation of the imposed restriction and also because he had another preliminary investigation opened against him .", "CARDINAL . On further appeal , in a decision of DATE ORG quashed the lower court 's decision of CARDINAL DATE and amended the measure for securing the applicant 's appearance in court to bail in the amount of CARDINAL new NORP levs ( approximately ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . The court found that the applicant had always attended court hearings and had never been the cause for any delays or postponements . Thus , it considered that the imposition of house arrest on the applicant had never been justified and that its overall length ( DATE and DATE ) represented a new circumstance warranting a re - evaluation of the imposed restriction . The court also found that ORG had mistakenly relied on the statutory provisions governing detention on remand when dismissing the applicant 's appeal against his house arrest but did not find the imposed house arrest to have been unlawful as such .", "CARDINAL .

It appears that divergent interpretations of the above provisions were observed in the initial period of their application upon their entry into force on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG clarified that the amended LAW excluded any possibility of a mandatory detention . In all cases the existence of a reasonable suspicion against the accused and of a real danger of him absconding or committing an offence had to be established by the authorities .
