The question of when the decision of CARDINAL DATE became final and binding ( pr\u00e1voplatnos\u0165 ) was not subject to full administrative or judicial examination . However , the authorities took the view that it had become final and binding on DATE , by operation of the presumption mentioned in the preceding paragraph . At that time the applicant had no legal representation .", "CARDINAL . Under a legal - assistance contract of DATE , the applicant retained the services of a lawyer to provide him with general legal assistance , including representation in litigation .", "CARDINAL .
