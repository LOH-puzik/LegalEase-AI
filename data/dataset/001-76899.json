FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant , Mr PERSON is a NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in PERSON . He owned and administered a limited liability company named ORG Ab , the second applicant . The company was subsequently declared insolvent and wound up . They were represented before the ORG initially by PERSON and subsequently by PERSON PERSON PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE a bank instituted proceedings against the applicant company , the first applicant and his son with a view to obtaining payment on the basis of promissory notes signed on behalf of the applicant company as a debtor . The first applicant and his son stood surety for the debt . Certain real property owned by the applicant company also served as collateral for the debt . The respondents contested the claim . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) invited their further submissions , urging them to specify on what grounds they contested the claim , failing which the court could render a default judgment . Their submissions were received on DATE .", "On DATE ORG rendered a default judgment ordering the respondents to pay the bank MONEY ( ORG ; corresponding to CARDINAL euros ) in capital . The court delivered a default judgment because it considered that the respondents had failed to answer clearly the questions put to them about their grounds for contesting the claim .", "On DATE the default judgment was served on the respondents . On CARDINAL DATE they filed an application for a re - trial with the court that had delivered the default judgment and requested a stay of execution . On DATE the court stayed the execution .", "Meanwhile , they also lodged a procedural complaint with ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) . On DATE the court stayed the execution of the default judgment . It reasoned :", "\u201c ... [ T]he default judgment , which is currently subject to complaint , does not form the basis for the insolvency application [ see below ] , as alleged by the applicants in their written observations . The application to declare ORG Ab insolvent is based on the request for payment with a risk of insolvency ( konkurssiuhkainen maksukehotus , betalningsuppmaning vid hot om konkurs ) , which was served on the company on DATE . There is therefore no reason to preclude the use of the default judgment as ... a basis for enforcement in the insolvency proceedings . \u201d", "On DATE ORG dismissed the complaint without considering its merits owing to the fact that the case was pending before the lower court . Thus , the provisions relied on did not operate . ORG decision to stay the execution ceased to have effect .", "The applicants appealed . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) dismissed the appeal .", "On DATE the ORG quashed the default judgment insofar as it concerned the first applicant and his son but upheld it as regards the company . At the same time it ordered that execution of the judgment should no longer be stayed .", "All parties appealed . On DATE ORG stayed the execution of the lower court 's judgment . The case is still pending before the national courts .", "The bank presented the applicant company with a request for payment within DATE with a risk of insolvency , which was served on DATE . On DATE the company contested the request .", "On DATE the bank petitioned ORG in order that the company be declared insolvent , arguing that it had failed to pay its debt and also relying on the above default judgment of DATE .", "On DATE the petition was served on the company , which contested it , arguing that the bank 's claim was not clear and undisputed as required by the then LAW no . CARDINAL ; konkurssis\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6 , konkursstadgan ) as the company had lodged an appeal against the default judgment . In its further written submission of CARDINAL DATE the company submitted that neither of the grounds on which the insolvency petition was based , i.e. the request for payment with a risk of insolvency or the default judgment , was sufficient for declaring it insolvent . The company argued that the former could not be used in the proceedings as it had been contested . The claim was not therefore clear and undisputed .", "On DATE ORG held an oral hearing at which the company was represented by counsel . In its decision of DATE the court rejected the insolvency petition . It noted that the court had issued the above default judgment owing to the company 's failure to state clearly its grounds for opposing the bank 's claim even when directly asked by the court to do so . The company had lodged an application to set aside the default judgment , which application did not appear to be clearly groundless . In the circumstances of this particular case , the bank 's claim could not therefore be regarded as clear and undisputed .", "The bank appealed , requesting that the company be declared insolvent on the ground that it had not paid its debt despite the fact that it had been served with a request for payment with a risk of insolvency . In its letter of appeal the bank stated that the company 's counsel had not submitted any grounds for contesting the insolvency petition at ORG hearing . ORG requested the company to produce its written reply to the appeal by DATE . Following the company 's request dated DATE , in which it stated its intention to provide the bank with full security for its claim , the time - limit was extended to CARDINAL DATE . In its reply of CARDINAL DATE the company maintained that the claim was not clear and undisputed as it had appealed against the default judgment . It further maintained that it was not possible to examine in the course of the insolvency proceedings whether the bank had a claim against it . At this stage the company did not request an oral hearing . Nor did it contest the statement in the bank 's appeal to the effect that the company had been represented by counsel at ORG hearing .", "On DATE ORG deliberated and it adopted a judgment . At TIME on DATE it delivered its judgment , quashing the lower court 's decision and declaring the company insolvent based on a promissory note signed on DATE and a request for payment with a risk of insolvency served on the company on DATE . The court held that according to established case - law a claim on the basis of a document liable for an action for debt ( lainhaku , lags\u00f6kning ) was considered clear and undisputed . In the present case , the bank had therefore a clear and undisputed claim against the company even if the default judgment was not taken into account . It sent the case back to the lower court for the execution of the winding - up proceedings .", "According to the applicants and a report printed from their fax machine , at TIME on DATE the company sent a fax to ORG , in which , inter alia , an oral hearing in the matter was requested on the ground that ORG had not heard the company or taken into account documentary evidence submitted by it before it rendered the above default judgment . According to a letter from the judicial secretary of ORG , the above fax was received by the court only after it had rendered judgment . According to a report printed from the court 's fax machine , it had been received at TIME , i.e. only after the court had delivered its judgment , which it had done at TIME .", "The company sought leave to appeal and requested a stay of execution . On DATE ORG refused a request for a stay of execution . On DATE it refused leave to appeal .", "In the subsequent winding - up proceedings there were several creditors . During these proceedings the applicant company instituted various civil proceedings against some of its creditors the outcome of which is not known . In its judgment of DATE ORG accepted most of the claims for payment made against the company and decided the priority order of the debts to be settled . It however found that the question of whether there was any foundation for the bank 's claim and , if so , in what amount would first have to be decided in the re - trial of the default proceedings .", "On DATE ORG upheld this decision and on DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "Under NORP law there are various grounds on which a debtor can be declared insolvent . The petition can be lodged either by the debtor or a creditor .", "Under the law applicable at the material time the court had to summon the debtor without delay to appear before it in order to express his or her opinion of the insolvency petition , either in a hearing or in a written submission . The debtor had to be declared insolvent unless the debtor proved that he or she could satisfy the creditor or provided acceptable security for the payment of the debt . Even if the debtor failed to appear before the court , it could declare him or her insolvent . It follows from the aim of insolvency proceedings that the debtor could always fend off an insolvency petition by paying the creditor applicant 's claim or by producing security for it ( section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the then Insolvency Act ) .", "A creditor , who could prove a clear and undisputed claim against the debtor , could petition to have the debtor declared insolvent if the debtor , having the capacity of a trader , had been urged , through a notary public or in the presence of witnesses , to pay an undisputed and due debt , but he or she had for DATE or longer neglected to satisfy the creditor ( section CARDINAL ( CARDINALd ) of the then Insolvency Act ) .", "ORG has established precedents concerning the notion of \u201c clear and undisputed claim \u201d . The Government Bill ( no . CARDINAL ) to ORG as regards the enactment of the new LAW no . GPE ) , which replaced LAW in force at the material time , explained the case - law as follows . The word undisputed did not mean that the debtor had acknowledged the claim or that he did not dispute it . In case - law a claim was considered clear and undisputed if it was enforceable . A claim was considered clear and undisputed also if it was based on a document , which on its own fully evidenced it , for example a promissory note or a cheque , by the signing of which the debtor had committed himself or herself to paying the claim . However , if the debtor contested the claim with obvious justification , i.e. if he or she relied on circumstances that gave reason to suspect that the claim was ill - founded , it could not form the basis for the decision to declare the debtor insolvent .", "The court was obliged to hold a hearing when the matter required the hearing of witnesses or others in person ( section CARDINAL as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL of ORG in District Courts Act ( laki hakemusasioiden k\u00e4sittelyst\u00e4 yleisess\u00e4 alioikeudessa , lag om behandling av ans\u00f6knings\u00e4renden vid allm\u00e4n underr\u00e4tt ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "Under the law in force at the material time ORG was obliged to hold a hearing if a party so requested unless it was manifestly unnecessary . This provision applied , in relevant part , also when hearing an appeal lodged in a petitionary matter . ORG had to hold a hearing regardless of whether one had been requested , if the case turned on the credibility of the testimony received or the findings made in an inspection in situ held by ORG , or on new testimony to be produced in ORG . In this event , ORG had to receive the same evidence as had been received in the ORG unless there was an impediment to doing so ( LAW , ORG DATE , as amended by Act no . PERSON and as in force at the material time , of the Code of Judicial Procedure ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) ) . The appellate court has to examine an insolvency petition expeditiously .", "Written observations to ORG may be sent by fax . Such a submission is considered to have reached the court at the point when it is available in the court 's fax machine . If there is no clarification of that time , the time it was sent is also considered to be the time of receipt ( section CARDINAL of ORG ( laki s\u00e4hk\u00f6isest\u00e4 viestinn\u00e4st\u00e4 oikeudenk\u00e4yntiasioissa , lag om elektronisk telekommunikation i r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngs\u00e4renden ; Act no .
