On DATE the ORG issued a public opinion in relation to LAW . He gave the opinion that the legal vacuum resulting from the striking down of LAW should have been filled by ORG instead of by the Government , that there had been no detailed study as regards the status of homeless families , that the time - limits fixed by LAW were extremely short , that no stay of execution was allowed and that no public interest justified a breach of the principle of legal certainty . In the end , he concluded that LAW was incompatible with LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG endorsed LAW . According to the hearing record of DATE , the ruling majority members of parliament ( \u201c MPs \u201d ) stated that there were CARDINAL families living as tenants in dwellings returned to former owners , of these CARDINAL had applied for a loan at the ORG , out of whom CARDINAL had already obtained a loan . The programme of granting a CARDINAL - interest loan , meaning that interest payments were to be borne by the ORG , had been in existence since DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to opposition MPs , the passing of LAW was hasty and required specialised and broader discussions . They requested that the ORG \u2019s opinion be circulated to MPs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG , challenging the constitutionality of LAW and GPE DATE endorsing it . The ORG submitted that the solutions provided for by LAW were incompatible with the principle of legal certainty . They were detrimental to tenants by removing the ORG \u2019s obligation to provide housing for this category . They were further discriminated against vis - \u00e0 - vis those tenants who had obtained housing under LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also averred that the situation should have been governed by an Act of ORG instead of a Normative Act introduced by the Government . It further took issue with the lack of a possibility to challenge the stay of the enforcement and the fact that tenants had to voluntarily vacate the flats within a short time - limit , specifically by DATE .", "CARDINAL . In their additional submissions of CARDINAL DATE the ORG stated that LAW did not provide effective solutions on the following grounds : local - government units did not possess the necessary funds and means to provide social housing ; the ORG did not possess sufficient funds to provide loans to every homeless family ; the majority of the applicants , owing to their age , insufficient earnings , previous criminal records and the lack of collateral , would never become eligible for a loan .", "CARDINAL . In their written submissions of DATE to ORG , ORG submitted that since DATE the Government had been implementing a financing scheme of zerointerest loans to homeless families living in housing belonging to former owners . The statistics showed that out of CARDINAL registered homeless families , CARDINAL of them had applied for CARDINAL - interest loans , out of which CARDINAL had concluded contracts for disbursement with the ORG . Even though loans had been approved in respect of the remaining homeless families , they had delayed signing the paperwork for their disbursements . Having regard to the delays by homeless families in applying for CARDINAL - interest loans and in subsequently signing the paperwork for their disbursement , the ORG had introduced LAW as a matter of urgency . LAW had remedied the former ORG property - rights issues in accordance with LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention and avoided making the ORG liable to payment of high reparation claims . In their view , there had been no breach of the principle of legal certainty , since the problem of homeless families had been the subject of discussions for DATE . Moreover , LAW provided for social rental housing provided by local - government units or for accommodation at retirement homes for old people who did not meet the requirements to obtain a loan .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG informed the ORG that it had unanimously dismissed its constitutional complaint . The reasoned decision became available on DATE ( decision no . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG found that the ORG had legal standing having regard to its statute , act of incorporation , the nature of its activity and the nature of LAW which it had challenged . It found that there was a connection between the aim for which the ORG had been established and the constitutional issue brought for examination before ORG .", "CARDINAL . In respect of the merits of the case ORG found that , pursuant to LAW , there was a necessity and urgency to introduce LAW . This was dictated by the fact that former owners had been waiting for DATE to have title to the dwellings returned to them . It had also been conditioned by the implementation of ORG pilot judgment in the case of ORG ( cited above ) as regards the enforcement of final decisions recognising former ORG right of restitution of their properties or compensation in lieu . It further referenced ORG findings in the cases of GPE and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) , PERSON ( cited above ) and PERSON and Others ( cited above ) and noted the systemic failures of the domestic system to respect former ORG right of peaceful enjoyment of possessions . It therefore considered that LAW had struck the right balance between the tenants\u2019 rights and the former ORG right of property .", "CARDINAL . As to the proportionality test , ORG held that LAW provided for a DATE loan at PERCENT interest , as the payments would be borne by the ORG . The interest to be paid would exceed the principal to be taken as a loan by a tenant . Furthermore , the Normative Act laid down other positive obligations for the ORG , such as the provision of social housing to such tenants by local - government units , priority to be given to social rental housing , as well as placement of old people who were not capable of taking care of themselves or had no one else to attend to them in retirement homes . In the court \u2019s view , this showed that the ORG had made sufficient provision for vulnerable groups . Housing these individuals was a shared task between the ORG and the individuals themselves . The proposed measures could not be said to be arbitrary , unfair or based on an unreasonable assessment . Neither could they be considered to be more stringent ; on the contrary , they were more favourable . The obligation for tenants to vacate the dwellings was necessary and the interference was justified by the public interest .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the ORG \u2019s complaint that the courts could not stay the enforcement on the grounds that its powers of constitutional review did not extend to issues concerning the interpretation , implementation and harmonisation of domestic laws .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( ORG ) issued an order ( \u201c the ORG \u2019s order \u201d ) pursuant to which the ORG , before the submission of the request to ORG for the issuing of the enforcement writ , had to check whether the tenants had obtained a loan and/or housing in accordance with domestic law . It was also decided that such a request could not be submitted during DATE . It further provided several safeguards in the event of a family including elderly people , children , disabled persons , or if the housing conditions were outside of normal lifestyle standards . In such a case the family was provided with social rental housing or a housing bonus . The ORG , in implementing section CARDINAL of LAW , had to urgently request that the municipal councils make social rental housing available . It appears that following this order , the ORG suspended the enforcement proceedings in respect of CARDINAL tenant families .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date ORG and PERSON . PERSON , tenants , instituted judicial proceedings under LAW , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the ORG , challenging the ORG \u2019s eviction order , ORG enforcement writ and the ensuing bailiff \u2019s actions carried out following the introduction of LAW DATE . In that case ORG and PERSON . PERSON and the former owners had concluded a lease agreement on the basis of a final court decision which had obliged the tenants to pay a rent , as set out by ORG in favour of the former owners .", "CARDINAL . F.B. and ORG . PERSON claimed before the domestic courts that they were not obliged to vacate the dwelling as the lease agreement was valid and still in force . Furthermore , the eviction order had been issued by the ORG , which had no jurisdiction to decide on the civil dispute at issue . Subsequently , the bailiff actions had been invalid too . Also the enforcement writ as issued by ORG was invalid as the ORG had not been the creditor . Only former owners should have asked the district court to issue an enforcement writ . The tenants further claimed that LAW did not protect in a proportionate manner the right of tenants to respect for their homes . They were further unable to receive a PERCENT loan due to their lack of financial means ( they were unemployed and did not own any immovable property ) and age . They also submitted that the bailiff actions carried out were in breach of LAW as they had not been proportional in that they had not strike a balance between the former ORG and the tenants\u2019 interests . They finally asked ORG to stay the enforcement proceedings and to send the case for trial before ORG on account of the unconstitutionality of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the action reasoning that upon the entry into force of LAW the lease agreement concluded between the tenants and the former owner no longer had any legal binding effect . Subsequently , the eviction had been lawful and the tenants were obliged to vacate the dwelling in favour of the former owners . ORG also noted that the tenants had submitted supporting documents to substantiate their claim that they did not own any immovable property or any other financial mean and they were indeed receiving a retirement and disability pension . However , it reasoned that these were not grounds to challenge an executable decision under LAW of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the appellants\u2019 claim against the enforcement writ on the ground that the ORG was eligible under LAW DATE to ask a district court the issuance of an enforcement writ .", "CARDINAL . ORG also rejected the action under LAW ORG against the bailiff \u2019s actions on the ground that the execution had already taken place , namely the dwelling had already been vacated in favour of the former owner . Furthermore , it reasoned that since the tenants had challenged the bailiff actions on the ground that the executable decision was invalid , as long as that decision was valid , so were the bailiff actions .", "CARDINAL . As regards the tenants\u2019 application to send the case for trial before ORG , ORG dismissed it as manifestly illfounded in that ORG had already examined the constitutionality of that LAW in its decision no . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . As regards the stay of the enforcement proceedings ORG in the first hearing had already rejected the request by way of an interlocutory decision on the grounds that in the meantime the tenants had already been evicted . Moreover , the tenants had not provided any evidence to prove the existence of irreparable harm . In its decision of DATE on the merits of the case ORG reasoned that LAW ORG as regards the stay of enforcement proceedings had prevalence over section CARDINAL of LAW , which barred any stay of enforcement .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision was upheld by ORG on DATE . However , ORG noted that ORG assessment concerning the stay of enforcement had been erroneous since LAW , as lex specialis , had prevalence over the provisions of the ORG . The tenants did not lodge an appeal with ORG on the grounds that the building had in the meantime been demolished .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL other occasions other tenants had instituted judicial proceedings under ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the ORG challenging the ORG \u2019s eviction order , ORG enforcement writ and the ensuing bailiff \u2019s actions . The tenants\u2019 representative had lodged complaints with the ORG about the unreasonable length of the judicial proceedings . However , CARDINAL of the cases was discontinued on the ground that the tenants had not been present at the court hearing without any reason whatsoever . On the other case the tenants had not provided the district court with an adequate address .
