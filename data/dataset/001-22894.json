He was represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , PERSON .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant bought QUANTITY of land situated near FAC in DATE . After consulting specialists in forestry , he decided that the nature of the land made it suitable for a commercial nursery . The applicant submitted that he had fenced the property with posts and planted CARDINAL spruce trees on it . He intended to sell them as DATE trees . The applicant used tree shelters made of woollen fabric and a chemical repellent to prevent damage caused by game . The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to \u201c properly secure \u201d his property from game and hunters .", "During DATE PERCENT of the trees were damaged by game . The applicant estimated his loss at ORG CARDINAL . He replaced destroyed trees but in DATE game again damaged trees . The Government contested the applicant 's estimate .", "Furthermore , the applicant submitted that on numerous occasions he met on his plantation NORP and foreign hunters accompanied by a forest warden ( le\u015bniczy ) . When the applicant asked the forest warden why they hunted on his private property he was told that his land had been leased to the local hunting club ( GPE \u0142owieckie ) . It followed that the hunters could take game on the applicant 's land whether he objected to it or not , whereas the applicant himself had no right to hunt on his property . In addition , the forest warden stated that although he could see damage to the applicant 's property caused by game , according to law nobody was responsible for it .", "Subsequently , the applicant complained to ORG ( ORG w ORG ) , ORG ( PERSON w ORG ) , the ORG and the local hunting club which leased his property .", "In a letter of DATE ORG observed that the applicant 's claim concerned damage caused to a nursery and informed him that according to LAW DATE compensation could be obtained only for damage to harvested crops or crops under cultivation . Moreover , the applicant was advised to approach the local hunting club in order to start co - operation in protecting his property from damage . Finally , he was informed that under LAW DATE he could apply for a subsidy to reimburse the cost of planting new trees if his property was covered by the official zoning map .", "On DATE the applicant received a letter from the ORG which stated :", "\u201c In reply to your letter ( ... ) concerning damage to your nurseries caused over DATE by game \u2013 for which you can not obtain compensation \u2013 unfortunately I do not have good news for you . I should explain the following :", "CARDINAL ) NORP The question whether compensation should be paid is regulated by law ( ... ) . However , the currently binding law \u2013 as before \u2013 is very unfavourable to you and many other individuals .

However , damage caused by other species does not result in such liability . It follows that those who suffered damage [ caused by such species ] do not have legal grounds and possibilities to obtain compensation , as neither ORG , i.e. organs of public administration , nor any other institution is obliged to pay compensation .", "CARDINAL ) NORP The Ombudsman has considered that such a legal situation ( ... ) should be changed since it is unfair and detrimental to citizens . The PERSON and ORG are competent to introduce changes to legislation which would create liability for damage caused by game . ( ... ) In DATE , when LOC was being considered by the PERSON , the ORG pointed out to the Speaker of the PERSON \u2013 not for the first time DATE that the legal regulation of that subject - matter should be changed ( ... ) . Unfortunately , the PERSON adopted PERSON without taking into account the ORG 's submissions and did not extend liability for damage to all kinds of damage caused by game but instead practically repeated old regulations .", "Therefore , the legal regulation of that subject - matter has not been changed . Even if in the future the PERSON changes ( ... ) the regulations ( ... ) , it will not be possible to receive compensation for damage suffered before the change [ of legislation ] because new regulations will not apply retroactively to damage caused before the date on which new regulations enter into force .", "The legislation presently in force does not provide for the liability of either ORG or any other institution for damage caused , inter alia , in crops other than agricultural and therefore there is no legal i.e. judicial avenue to claim effectively compensation precisely because there are no legal grounds for such a claim .
