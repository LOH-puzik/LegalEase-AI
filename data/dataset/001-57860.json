Furthermore , in DATE and CARDINAL eight separate sets of proceedings were brought against him in ORG for insulting a public officer , fraud , defamation , misappropriation , forgery , uttering and causing bodily harm . All these proceedings took place in the applicant \u2019s absence ; CARDINAL sets of them are in issue before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE in a telegram sent to several public figures , including the NORP President and various ministers , and to the press , the applicant described certain members of the public prosecutor \u2019s office and ORG as \" collaborators of the PERSON regime \" , \" chief torturers \" , \" admirers of PERSON \" , \" perjurers \" , \" agents of death \" , \" fabricators of incriminating evidence against NORP \" , \" justicemongers \" and \" trainers of fascists \" .

An investigating judge at ORG summoned Mr PERSON for questioning in connection with an investigation he had started in respect of him . The court bailiff took the summons to CARDINAL Panepistimiou Street and as he did not find the applicant there , gave it to Mr PERSON , a lawyer who had his office at the same address . The applicant confirmed by telegram that he had been informed of the summons , but he failed to appear .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE a police officer served on him a summons to appear before ORG to answer a charge of insulting a public officer . Since he was unable to serve it on the applicant in person , he gave the document to PERSON , CARDINAL of Mr PERSON \u2019s colleagues ( pursuant to LAW ) ; the applicant did not appear at the hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . After ruling that the defendant had been properly summoned , ORG decided to hear the case and to give judgment \" as if [ the defendant ] were present \" ( under LAW para . CARDINAL of LAW ) . After CARDINAL prosecution witnesses and the prosecutor had been heard , Mr PERSON was convicted and sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The judgment ( no . CARDINAL ) was filed at FAC on DATE , as the authorities regarded the applicant as having no known address ( Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW ) .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG decided ( under LAW para . CARDINAL previously cited ) to proceed with the trial notwithstanding the absence of the defendant , who had , it ruled , been properly summoned . It imposed a sentence of CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment , which it converted into a fine . The judgment ( no . CARDINAL ) was lodged on DATE at FAC on the ground that neither the prosecuting authority nor the authority responsible for effecting service knew Mr PERSON \u2019s address .", "CARDINAL . PERSON having made a second complaint , the applicant was charged with forgery and uttering in that he had altered the wording of a cheque he had received from her and had attempted to cash it .", "On DATE a police officer delivered the summons to appear before ORG to CARDINAL Panepistimiou Street . When he found that the applicant was \" unknown \" at that address , had not communicated any other to the public prosecutor \u2019s office and had no relatives on whom service could be effected , he lodged the summons at FAC ( pursuant to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL previously cited ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG proceeded despite Mr PERSON \u2019s absence , and on DATE he was convicted and given an immediate custodial sentence of DATE . The judgment ( no . CARDINAL ) was delivered to FAC ( pursuant to Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL previously cited ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE states that he left GPE in DATE but he does not give the exact date of his departure . He went to GPE and then GPE , where he worked until DATE as a journalist . Following CARDINAL convictions by ORG , he went to GPE and then to GPE , where he was arrested on DATE and extradited to GPE on DATE . He was imprisoned at PERSON and later at GPE and was conditionally released on DATE .", "While he was serving his sentence , he appealed against the CARDINAL judgments of ORG ( see paragraphs DATE and CARDINAL above ) . He complained that he had not been duly summoned and that he had therefore been unable to defend himself against the charges against him ; he also complained that service of the judgments had been irregular .", "CARDINAL .

In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG declared the appeal inadmissible for the following reasons :", "\" ...", "The judgment was served on him on DATE , as appears from the record of service made by the bailiff PERSON . He appealed on DATE , after the statutory time - limit , without indicating in his pleadings any valid reason for appealing out of time ;", "The evidence discloses no circumstance that would justify a late appeal , and the court is not convinced that the defendant was prevented by force majeure from lodging an appeal in time . The appeal must consequently be declared inadmissible since , irrespective of the fact that the defendant has not stated what his known address was at the time of service or why he did not appeal in time , it has not been proved at all that the impugned service was void . It has been established , on the contrary , that it was lawful , as the prosecuting authorities did not know where the defendant lived . The allegation of forgery in respect of the record of service is wholly unfounded and ... an investigation of the point would clearly be devoid of purpose since , at all events , the defendant was aware of his conviction from DATE , when he was extradited to GPE .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law , which ORG dismissed on CARDINAL DATE , holding that ORG had provided sufficient reasons for its decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON made an application for a retrial ( aitissi epanalipseos tis diadikassias ) under LAW to ORG of ORG . He relied on DATE para . CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) to the LAW and asked for judgment no . DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to be set aside .", "ORG dismissed the application on DATE . It noted that the impugned summons had been taken to Mr PERSON \u2019s professional address , which was known to the authorities at the time , and handed to CARDINAL of his colleagues . The trial in absentia which followed was therefore in no way contrary to LAW judgment of CARDINAL DATE in the NORP v. GPE case ( Series A no . CARDINAL ) .", "The applicant appealed on points of law against that decision on CARDINAL DATE , but ORG dismissed the appeal on DATE for failure to comply with the DATE time - limit laid down in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declared an appeal by the applicant against judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) inadmissible . It said , inter alia :", "\" ...", "No evidence has been adduced that justifies appealing out of time and the ORG is not persuaded that the defendant was prevented by force majeure from appealing before the statutory time - limit . More particularly , he alleged that on DATE his address was not unknown and that service of the judgment appealed against , effected according to the rules applicable to persons whose address is unknown , was not valid ; in the alternative , he submitted that it was not valid because it was lodged at FAC and not at the town hall of NORP PERSON . As to this contention , the court notes the following : from the record of service of DATE it appears that the officer responsible for service went to the defendant \u2019s last known address , namely CARDINAL FAC , GPE , and that finding neither the defendant nor his wife nor any of his relatives , he lodged the document to be served with the mayor of GPE , who displayed it on DATE in the appropriate place ... . It should be emphasised that the fact that the defendant formerly lived at CARDINAL Panepistimiou Street ... had been certified at the investigation stage and that this was why - as was disclosed in the record of service of the summons of CARDINAL DATE to appear before the investigating judge - service was effected at that address and on the person who shared that address with the defendant . It should furthermore be noted that the offices of the newspaper ORG were at that address , its headquarters - according to its issue of DATE - being in GPE , where the defendant was its correspondent ... . On DATE [ the defendant ] , in a complaint to the GPE public prosecutor \u2019s office , confirmed that he lived in GPE ( without giving any address ) and that he was temporarily living in GPE , at CARDINAL Summer Place , GPE SWCARDINAL , GPE . DATE before the impugned service ... , i.e. on DATE , ORG had drawn up a document giving the defendant \u2019s address ( evidently supplied by him ) as CARDINAL FAC , ORG SWCARDINAL . No other evidence was adduced concerning the defendant \u2019s permanent or temporary address ... during the period from DATE ... to CARDINAL DATE . Evidence was , on the other hand , brought from the period after [ this latter date ] ( such as the documents from FAC in GPE ... , which give the defendant \u2019s address as CARDINAL PERSON , GPE , ORG CARDINALTF , GPE , and an envelope from ORG date - stamped DATE and addressed to the applicant at CARDINAL , FAC , PERSON ) ; however , since this evidence refers to a period well after DATE , it does not suffice to establish that the defendant had a known address , in particular one known to the authorities responsible for service and for the prosecution . All the aforementioned evidence shows ... that on DATE the defendant \u2019s address really was unknown : he had left CARDINAL Panepistimiou Street in GPE , his known address until then , and was travelling between his ( unknown ) address in GPE and his temporary addresses in GPE , the nearest of which in time to DATE FAC , ORG SWCARDINAL - was known neither to the NORP prosecuting authority nor to the authority responsible for service .", "The defendant \u2019s submission must therefore be rejected as being ill - founded .", "Since nothing proves that the appeal was brought out of time owing to force majeure ( which the notice of appeal does not even claim ) ... , the appeal must be declared inadmissible .", "... \"", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE brought an appeal on points of law , which ORG dismissed on DATE . Having been summoned to appear while he was serving his sentence , he did not attend .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he made an application for a retrial to ORG of ORG . He relied on DATE para . CARDINAL of Protocol No . CARDINAL ( PCARDINAL - CARDINAL - CARDINAL ) to the LAW and asked for judgment no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) to be set aside .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the application on the ground that the file disclosed no procedural defect and that the trial in absentia had not in any way been contrary to LAW . It noted that the summons to appear before ORG , which had been delivered to the address at which the applicant submitted that it should have been served on him at the time , had been given to PERSON pursuant to LAW para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure . Furthermore , NORP national law did not oblige the court to assign counsel officially to defend a person accused of a criminal offence . Lastly , Mr PERSON had not pleaded any impediment such as would have justified adjourning the hearing ( LAW ) .", "On DATE the applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment , but on DATE ORG dismissed the appeal for failure to comply with the DATE time - limit laid down in Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of the Code of Criminal Procedure .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against judgment no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and made an application ( under LAW ) to have the judgment set aside . He withdrew the appeal on DATE . On DATE ORG ruled that the application was admissible but dismissed it as the applicant had not adduced any evidence to prove that he had a known address at the material time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG held that an appeal on points of law brought by the applicant was barred by Article CARDINAL para . CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON applied to ORG of ORG for a retrial in respect of judgment no . CARDINAL .", "On DATE , after considering the file forwarded by ORG , ORG noted that the applicant had properly been summoned as a person whose address was unknown ; that it had proved impossible to reach him at the address at which , by his own account , he was to be found ; that he had not notified the authorities of any change of address and the file did not disclose the existence of any relatives who could accept service ; and that after leaving his known address , he travelled from place to place , which made it impossible to pinpoint his whereabouts . Accordingly , the proceedings ending in his conviction were not in any way defective and the trial in absentia was contrary neither to LAW nor to the PERSON judgment . As to the new facts relied on by Mr PERSON in support of his application for a retrial , ORG concluded that , far from undermining the lower court \u2019s judgment , they confirmed its soundness .", "On DATE Mr PERSON appealed on points of law against that judgment , but the appeal was dismissed by ORG on DATE for failure to comply with the DATE time - limit laid down in Article CARDINAL para .
