The applicant is a GPE who was born in DATE in northern GPE . He arrived in GPE on DATE and on that date claimed asylum on the ground that he feared persecution by the GPE army on account of his involvement with ORG ( \u201c the NORP \u201d ) . He submitted that he had been arrested in DATE , after he had left the ORG , in a round - up and identified as an NORP member by a masked man . He was severely tortured during DATE of his detention . He was released after the village headman and his mother intervened , but as a condition of his release he was required to sign on regularly at an army camp .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Secretary of ORG for ORG refused the applicant \u2019s asylum claim . He did not accept that the applicant had been arrested and tortured in DATE or that he genuinely feared that he would be arrested by the army .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently obtained a medical report which confirmed that he had a number of scars on his scalp , his elbows and his legs caused by shell fragments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s appeal against the Secretary of ORG \u2019s decision was dismissed by an Adjudicator . With no ORG representative present at the hearing to cross - examine the applicant , his evidence was unchallenged . The Adjudicator therefore accepted that the applicant had been a member of the ORG and that he had been detained and ill - treated by the army in DATE . The Adjudicator also accepted that the scars were caused by shell fragments as the applicant claimed . She noted , however , that the applicant \u2019s scars were not readily visible and would not cause the applicant to stand out ; this was evidenced by the fact that the applicant was able to leave GPE without difficulty , despite having to travel across the country and through checkpoints , which indicated that he was of no interest to the authorities . With regard to the applicant \u2019s LAW , the Adjudicator noted that although the applicant had a brother and sister in GPE , he had been separated from them for DATE respectively ; neither had been present at the hearing ; and they could visit the applicant in GPE should they so wish .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was refused permission to appeal to the then ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant subsequently made further representations to ORG , which , in a decision dated DATE , the Secretary of ORG refused to treat as a fresh asylum claim . On DATE permission to apply for judicial review was refused . Permission was again refused on DATE following an oral hearing . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant once again submitted further representations . On DATE the Secretary of ORG decided not to treat those representations as a fresh asylum claim . On DATE a further application for permission to apply for judicial review was refused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant submitted fresh representations requesting that his case be reconsidered in light of the country guidance determination of ORG ( ORG area DATE Colombo \u2013 risk ? ) GPE [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The Secretary of ORG responded in a letter dated DATE stating that :", "\u201c It is accepted that your client is of NORP ethnicity as claimed . It is not believed that your client was tortured and as such it is doubtful he was a member of the NORP as claimed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . This reasoning led to the conclusion that the applicant \u2019s only risk factors were his NORP ethnicity and scarring , which the Secretary of ORG pointed out only had significance if combined with other factors likely to bring the applicant to the attention of the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In ORG ( ORG area DATE Colombo \u2013 risk ? ) GPE [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE ( \u201c LP \u201d ) , ORG considered the case of a GPE , ORG , from GPE in the north of GPE . He had experienced problems with the NORP and the Sri NORP authorities and had fled GPE on DATE but had been refused asylum in GPE by the Secretary of ORG . In dismissing ORG \u2019s appeal on asylum grounds but allowing it on the basis of LAW , the ORG gave the following guidance in the headnote to its determination :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) NORP are not per se at risk of serious harm from the GPE authorities in GPE . A number of factors may increase the risk , including but not limited to : a previous record as a suspected or actual ORG member ; a previous criminal record and/or outstanding arrest warrant ; bail jumping and/or escaping from custody ; having signed a confession or similar document ; having been asked by the security forces to become an informer ; the presence of scarring ; return from GPE or other centre of NORP fundraising ; illegal departure from GPE ; lack of an ORG card or other documentation ; having made an asylum claim abroad ; having relatives in the ORG . In every case , those factors and the weight to be ascribed to them , individually and cumulatively , must be considered in the light of the facts of each case but they are not intended to be a check list .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If a person is actively wanted by the police and/or named on a Watched or Wanted list held at FAC , they may be at risk of detention at the airport .", "( CARDINAL ) Otherwise , the majority of returning failed asylum seekers are processed relatively quickly and with no difficulty beyond some possible harassment .", "( CARDINAL ) NORP in GPE are at increased risk of being stopped at checkpoints , in a cordon and search operation , or of being the subject of a raid on a ORG where they are staying . In general , the risk again is no more than harassment and should not cause any lasting difficulty , but NORP who have recently returned to GPE and have not yet renewed their GPE identity documents will be subject to more investigation and the factors listed above may then come into play .", "( CARDINAL ) Returning NORP should be able to establish the fact of their recent return during the short period necessary for new identity documents to be procured .", "( CARDINAL ) A person who can not establish that he is at real risk of persecution in his home area is not a refugee ; but his appeal may succeed under LAW ORG , or he may be entitled to humanitarian protection if he can establish he would be at risk in the part of the country to which he will be returned .", "( CARDINAL ) The weight to be given to expert evidence ( individual or country ) and country background evidence is dependent upon the quality of the raw data from which it is drawn and the quality of the filtering process to which that data has been subjected . Sources should be given whenever possible .", "( CARDINAL) The determinations about GPE listed in para CARDINAL [ of the determination \u2013 see below ] are replaced as country guidance by this determination .

The first , ORG ( NORP \u2013 Colombo \u2013 risk ? ) GPE [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE ( \u201c AN & SS \u201d ) , was published shortly after ORG . and the ORG did not have the benefit of the ORG \u2019s decision in reaching its conclusions . The ORG gave the following guidance in the head note to the determination :", "\u201c Since the breakdown of the ceasefire , heightened security in the capital has restricted the operations there of the NORP , who are focusing on \u2018 high - profile\u2019 targets . The background evidence does not show that NORP in GPE who have stopped supporting the ORG , or who support parties opposed to them , are at real risk of reprisals , absent some feature bringing them to prominence . The conclusion to that effect in ORG internal flight \u2013 sufficiency of protection ) GPE [ DATE ] CARDINAL , which this determination updates and supersedes , is thus affirmed .", "There is no good evidence that the ORG maintain a computerized database of their opponents , such that new arrivals in GPE can be checked against it . Checks are , on the other hand , run on a computerized database by immigration officers when passengers arrive at FAC , or by members of the security forces when people are detained , but there is no good evidence to show that everyone who has in the past been detained and questioned about possible involvement with the NORP is on that database . On the contrary , it is likely to contain the names only of those who are of serious interest to the authorities .", "The CARDINAL \u2018 risk ORG listed in ORG ( ORG area DATE Colombo \u2013 risk ? ) GPE [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE can usefully be divided into risk factors per se , CARDINAL or more of which are likely to make a person of adverse interest to the authorities , and \u2018 background ORG , which neither singly nor in combination are likely to create a real risk , but which in conjunction with risk factors per se will intensify the risk .", "A failed asylum seeker who hails from the north or east of GPE and who has no relatives or friends to turn to in GPE will generally be able to relocate there in safety and without undue harshness . Those arriving without their ORG should be able to get a replacement without too much difficulty , while the great majority of those detained at checkpoints and in cordon - and - search operations are released within a short time . A generous support package is available for DATE from ORG to those who return voluntarily . Those who refuse to do so can not pray in aid the prospect of being destitute in GPE .", "PR ( medical facilities ) GPE [ DATE ] UKIAT CARDINAL is , owing to its antiquity , no longer to be treated as country guidance on the availability of medical treatment for returnees . The guidance in ORG , however , has been considered and approved by ORG in ORG v GPE , handed down on DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the case of GPE v Secretary of ORG for ORG [ DATE ] EWHC CARDINAL ( Admin ) , however , the High Court Judge noted that :", "\u201c Without seeking to throw any doubt on the decision in AN on its own facts , I reject the defendant \u2019s submission that it forms a general assessment of the factual background dispositive of the outcome in this case , or that a future tribunal would be bound to apply that case as opposed to the assessment of ORG . The tribunal in AN did not have the benefit of the GPE court \u2019s assessment of risk in such circumstances and the continuity of risk properly assessed in the light of the criteria used in adjudicating LAW claims . I am unaware of any tribunal decision that has done so since the AN decision . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the second , ORG ( NORP \u2013 LP updated ) GPE [ DATE ] UKAIT DATE ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , the ORG found that the risk factors identified in ORG and AN and ORG ( both cited above ) were still relevant but that a subsequent country guidance case was necessary to take account of the recent major changes to the country situation in GPE .

In the GPE , nearly the entire population from the territory formerly held by the NORP in the LOC ( CARDINAL NORP ) has been confined to heavily militarized camps in the LOC region . Although the government has gradually reduced the military presence in the camps and has pledged to start the progressive return to their villages of origin of the majority of those in the camps , it is clear that this may take a considerable amount of time .

For this reason , NORP from the LOC and the LOC are at heightened risk of human rights violations related to the implementation of anti - terrorism and anti - insurgency measures . While this risk exists in all parts of GPE , it is greatest in areas in which the ORG remains active , and where security measures are heaviest , in particular the LOC and parts of the LOC , and in and around GPE . \u201d", "\u201c The country of origin information that ORG has considered indicates that NORP from LOC continue to face a significant risk of suffering serious human rights violations in the region ( and elsewhere in the country ) because of their race ( ethnicity ) or ( imputed ) political opinion .

ORG paramilitary elements also continue to operate with impunity against NORP in the LOC . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG from GPE of DATE ( \u201c the DATE Guidelines \u201d ) , which superseded the April CARDINAL Guidelines , contained information on the particular profiles for which international protection needs may arise in the current context . It was stated that :", "\u201c Given the cessation of hostilities , NORP originating from the north of the country are no longer in need of international protection under broader refugee criteria or complementary forms of protection solely on the basis of risk of indiscriminate harm . In light of the improved human rights and security situation in GPE , there is no longer a need for group - based protection mechanisms or for a presumption of eligibility for NORP of NORP ethnicity originating from the north of the country . It is important to bear in mind that the situation is still evolving , which has made the drafting of these LAW particularly complex . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In summary , the following were ORG \u2019s recommendations : all claims by asylum seekers from GPE", "( i ) persons suspected of having links with ORG ( NORP ) ; ( ii ) journalists and other media professionals ; ( iii ) civil society and human rights activists ; ( iv ) women and children with certain profiles ; and ( v ) lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( NORP ) individuals .", "CARDINAL . A report commissioned by the applicant \u2019s representatives from Dr PERSON ( \u201c PERSON report \u201d ) and dated DATE , includes the following relevant paragraphs :", "\u201c Given the treatment of NORP , the authorities would question as to why any GPE would want to come back and a significant exodus from the LOC is anticipated . The authorities may well conclude that , given their second class status , the only reason to return would be to lend support to the ORG or whatever comes in its place . As such , returnees are likely to face a difficult time , especially at the airport .", "The applicant was held for DATE and the severity of his ill - treatment indicates that he was of adverse interest to the authorities who detained him . As such , his record will most likely have been included on the central database , particularly since he was released on reporting conditions which he subsequently violated . He has visible scars which could trigger adverse interest at the airport and , furthermore , the fact that he left GPE using false documentation will further contribute to risk and vulnerability at the airport . As such , it is very likely that the applicant will be detained on arrival and this will place him at considerable risk of ill - treatment , torture and , even , sexual abuse . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
