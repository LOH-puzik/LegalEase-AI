On DATE GPE transferred all its business relating to the publishing of GPE , including court cases , to the applicant company . The newspaper has a circulation of CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , during the presidential election campaign , the applicant company published a short article , written by the first applicant and approved by the second applicant , entitled \u201c The ex - husband of [ GPE ] and the person in charge of communications for the PERSON campaign have found each other \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The article stated that ORG , who had separated from his wife , had found a new partner , PERSON wife was known as a political reporter in the election - related TV debates and previously as a news reader . It was mentioned in the article that ORG was in charge of communications for the PERSON campaign and that , in her civilian life , PERSON was the communications manager in a specified pension insurance company and a mother .", "CARDINAL . The article went on to state that , before joining the campaign , ORG had been active in the same political party as ORG and that she had been involved in some \u201c insider committees \u201d . The article continued to note that PERSON worked as a director for ORG , the company promoting NORP exports , and that in DATE he had been posted in GPE , where his wife had followed him , taking leave from her own job . The article stated that PERSON and his wife had CARDINAL children and that they had separated in DATE . Pictures of ORG and ORG 's wife were included in the article .", "CARDINAL . On DATE O.T. asked the police to investigate the matter . She requested compensation for suffering and distress and for financial losses .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicants for having violated ORG 's private life . The first applicant was sentenced to a fine of QUANTITY ( ORG ) and the second applicant to a fine of LAW . The applicants were jointly ordered to pay damages to O.T. for suffering amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL and her legal fees and witness costs amounting to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL , both sums with interest .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court found that O.T. , despite her position in the presidential campaign , was not a public figure and that her relationship with ORG was not such that the applicants would have been allowed to write about it without her consent . The information published , however accurate , was not necessary for examining any matter of interest to society .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) claiming that , due to her position in the presidential campaign and as a local politician , PERSON was a so - called public figure , that the facts in the article were true and that the issue was important for public discussion since one of the main focuses of the presidential campaign was family values . PERSON worked for a candidate who was a married father of CARDINAL children , in contrast to the other candidate , who was a single mother cohabiting without being married . Hence , PERSON 's extramarital affair was of importance to the public . The affair had been public , thus information about it could not be private . The information was connected to ORG 's public function and was necessary in order to discuss an important matter for society .", "CARDINAL . Following an oral hearing on DATE , ORG upheld ORG judgment on DATE . It found that the information published had had no importance for society but only served the general curiosity of the public .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants appealed to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG granted the applicants leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG judgment as far as the applicants were concerned and ordered them jointly to pay ORG 's legal fees amounting to ORG interest . It found , inter alia , the following :", "\u201c ... ORG states that information concerning emotional relationships , dating and family life undoubtedly fall within the scope of private life and even its core areas .", "...", "Evaluation of the content of the article", "ORG states that the contents of the article do not support the defendants ' allegation that the purpose of the article was to describe the political co - operation between PERSON and PERSON The expressions used in the article , according to which ORG and ORG \u201c found each other \u201d and \u201c ORG has found a new partner \u201d , together with the disclosure in the same connection of ORG 's divorce and that O.T. was a mother , are not conducive to creating a conception of political co - operation , but it is obvious that the intention was to refer to a personal love affair . Even though the article does mention PERSON 's and ORG 's political affiliations and ORG 's function in the presidential election campaign , there is nothing else political in the article . Nor when viewed as a whole , the article does not give an impression that it aimed to tell about a relationship that was politically important . Its crucial aim had clearly been to spread information about an intimate relationship of public persons .", "Significance of ORG 's function", "...", "ORG states that ORG has served at the relevant time a politically important function which involved publicity and because of which her person as an official in the presidential candidate 's inner circle has attracted justified interest . Another question is , however , whether ORG 's position has been such that also issues relating to her private life could have been revealed in public without her consent .", "...", "O.T has served the campaign as a hired expert without herself pursuing political office or other public function . As put forward by the defendants , ORG 's appointment as the person in charge of communications had probably been affected , in addition to her professional merits , by considerations of a political nature . This does not , however , change the fact that in spite of some other former political positions of trust occupied by her , PERSON was not known as a politician prior to being employed in the electoral campaign nor has she , after having become a temporary campaign assistant , stood as a candidate for any political office . ..... PERSON was not a civil servant but an assistant to a political candidate . Nor does it follow from the political considerations of her recruitment that , considering the nature of the campaign , the protection of her private life would for this reason have become similarly restricted as in respect of the politician she was assisting .", "ORG 's function as an official of the presidential campaign was not , either , the kind that would have made her obliged in her private life to stand for or become committed to the values advanced by the candidate . Even if the communication between ORG and ORG could also have had professional content and significance as to ORG 's function , the intimate nature of the relationship had nothing to do with that aspect of the matter . The extra - marital relationship was not , at any rate , a consideration that would have had an impact on ORG 's capacities to perform her function as a communications expert hired for the election campaign . .... The consideration mentioned by O.T. that the reason behind the publication of the article would have been to affect the campaign , has no relevance to whether the defendants have been guilty of violating ORG 's private life . The offender 's possible political motivation or PERSON 's assumption about it have no relevance to the justification of the act in case there were no legal grounds for disclosing information concerning private life .", "On the above - mentioned grounds ORG considers that the disclosure in the media of an extra - marital relationship of a person in PERSON 's position or exposure in public of the morals of her private life was not justified by the public 's need to receive information nor by the important interests of society . There was thus no legal right to disclose information about ORG 's private life in the article on the basis of her functions .", "Significance of the position of other persons mentioned in the article", "...", "As mentioned in the preparatory works for LAW , section CARDINAL , of LAW , the restrictions on the protection of private life on the basis of a person 's position or function only applies to that person him or herself . Even though it would be permissible to write about the private life of a politician or a performing artist , this can not be extended to such person 's relatives , acquaintances or other outsiders ( HE CARDINAL vp , p. CARDINAL ) . ORG states that ORG 's position and the fact that his ex - spouse was known from the television are not issues that could change the above - mentioned conclusion and justify such publication of information about ORG 's private life like in the present case .", "Nor has the fact that ORG 's ex - spouse had conducted election debates on television prior to the publishing of the article had any relevance . Even though it is possible that such personal scenario , which is completely irrelevant vis - \u00e0 - vis the presidential candidates , interests certain public circles more than the content of the election debates and the candidates ' own performance , such satisfying of curiosity is not a fact that would have justified the publishing of information about ORG 's private life . There was thus no legal right to disclose information about ORG 's private life on this ground either .", "Claim that the relationship was known of by outsiders", "The defendants have also claimed that ORG 's and ORG 's close relationship had been open and visible to outsiders , and that it was known among politicians . ORG states that the protection of private life is not only limited to facts or events that take place in private or in closed events . The fact that an issue of private life is noticeable in a certain event or in public places does not mean as such that it would be left outside the protection of private life ( see for example ORG judgment in the case PERSON v. GPE , judgment of DATE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ; and the judgment in the case PERSON , in which the pictures found to violate private life were mostly taken in public places ) . The contrary can also be true if the persons involved clearly show by their behaviour that they want to make the issue public .", "Moreover , ORG states that the fact that a piece of information about private life has come to the knowledge of a certain group of persons through their own observations or private gossiping is not a ground that would permit distribution of that information through the media to a wider public without the consent of the person concerned . Publication of such an article in the media is conducive to causing harm and suffering to the person concerned and to his or her close ones , just as ORG has described .", "... In the present case it has not been shown that ORG , by being with PERSON at the same events or in public places , would have meant their relationship to be public or that information about it should be freely distributable . PERSON can not be regarded as having performed in a manner that could lead to the conclusion that she , even implicitly , would have given her consent to the distribution of the information written in the article .", "Conclusions", "On the basis of the above - mentioned , ORG , like the lower instances , has come to the conclusion that the publication of the article violated ORG 's private life . The act was intentional , a fact which has not even been contested before ORG . [ The first and second applicants ] have thus been guilty of invasion of private life , as already held by the lower courts . ..... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The outcome of ORG judgment was not unanimous , one of the Justices gave a dissenting opinion . According to him , and taking into account the direct effect of ORG judgments , the exceptions to LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , of LAW had to be interpreted extensively , both regarding the extent of the political activity and the scope of a matter of interest to society . ORG 's recruitment to the presidential election campaign had attracted political interest due to the fact that her party political background was different from that of the candidate she was assisting . There had been public speculation that , by her appointment , her candidate had tried to attract voters from her party and especially female voters . Even though it could not be said that ORG had , by taking part in the election campaign , become a public figure , she must have understood that , as an important figure in the inner circle of CARDINAL of the CARDINAL candidates , she would also attract public interest . ORG had thus been politically active and this activity had been public . As to the article , the ORG noted that the information about ORG 's private life , even if not strictly relevant to her functions as the communications official , was conducive to contributing to public debate through the fact that family values had been at the centre of the political value debate in the presidential campaign . The article did not only satisfy the curiosity of certain readers but it also contributed to an important matter of public interest as political background information . One could rely on criminal law sanctions in a case of political journalism only exceptionally , namely if freedom of expression was clearly abused . As this was not so in the present case , the ORG did not consider the publication of the article as a punishable act and would have annulled the previous judgments .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW of Finland ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag , Act no . MONEY ) provides the following :", "\u201c Everyone has the freedom of expression . Freedom of expression entails the right to express , disseminate and receive information , opinions and other communications without prior prevention by anyone . More detailed provisions on the exercise of the freedom of expression are laid down by an Act . Provisions on restrictions relating to pictorial programmes that are necessary for the protection of children may be laid down by an Act .

In addition , provisions concerning limitations of the secrecy of communications which are necessary in the investigation of crimes that jeopardise the security of the individual or society or the sanctity of the home , at trials and security checks , as well as during the deprivation of liberty may be laid down by an LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Chapter DATE ( as amended by Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , section CARDINAL(a ) , of LAW ( rikoslaki , strafflagen ) read , at the relevant time , as follows :", "\u201c A person who unlawfully , through the use of the mass media or in another similar manner , publicly disseminates information , an insinuation or an image depicting the private life of another person , such as to cause him or her damage or suffering , shall be convicted of invasion of privacy and sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment of DATE or to a fine . A publication that deals with a person 's behaviour in a public office or function , in professional life , in a political activity or in another comparable activity , shall not be considered an invasion of privacy if the reporting was necessary for the purpose of dealing with a matter of importance to society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of the above - mentioned provision ( see government bill HE CARDINAL ) there was no precise definition of private life but matters such as , inter alia , family life , spare time activities , health and relationships and such conduct in socially significant positions that had no significance to the relevant exercise of power , were considered as a part of private life . It was further required that the act might have caused damage or suffering . Such damage might have also been \u201c immaterial damage , which might have manifested itself in problems with social interaction or respect \u201d . An ordinary person enjoyed the strongest protection of private life . His or her involvement in an incident of importance to society might have warranted an exception to the protection . In any case , if an offence was of such a kind that it could not be regarded as having social significance , information about that offence was a matter to be protected as belonging to the sphere of private life , otherwise the protection of private life did not restrict publishing . Moreover , the publishing could not be to a greater extent than was necessary . Thus , the necessity of mentioning a person 's name or other description of a person enabling identification was always subject to careful consideration .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , of LAW was replaced by LAW , section CARDINAL , ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , which entered into force on DATE ) . Under the new provision on injury to personal reputation ( yksityisel\u00e4m\u00e4\u00e4 loukkaavan tiedon levitt\u00e4minen , spridande av information som kr\u00e4nker privatlivet ) a person who unlawfully , through the use of the mass media or in another manner , publicly spreads information , an insinuation or an image of the private life of another person in such a way that the act is conducive to causing that person damage or suffering or subjecting that person to contempt , shall be convicted of injuring personal reputation . However , an act shall not constitute an injury to personal reputation if it concerns the evaluation of that person 's activities in a professional or public capacity and if it is necessary for the purpose of addressing a matter of importance to society .", "CARDINAL . According to the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires ( see government bill HE CARDINAL ) , the content of the new provision corresponds to the old LAW , section CARDINAL(a ) , of LAW . The amendments and clarifications made to the existing provision were mainly technical . The provision thus still restricts the protection of the private life of persons having important political or economic powers . This restriction , however , applies only to the persons referred to , not to their close friends and family . According to ORG ( lakivaliokunnan mietint\u00f6 , lagutskottets bet\u00e4nkande PERSON CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , the purpose of that provision is to permit the dissemination of information on the private life of such persons if the information may be relevant in assessing the performance of their functions .", "CARDINAL . NORP The government bill HE CARDINAL further provides that in the assessment of interferences with private life , the lawfulness of the interference and the concept of private life are taken into account . A person 's consent to the provision of information has relevance in the assessment of the lawfulness of the interference . Without explicit consent , there is usually no reason to believe that the person in question would have consented to the publication of information relating to private life ( see ORG Report LaVM CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . With regard to the concept of private life , a reference is made to the explanatory works concerning the LAW 's provisions on fundamental rights and to the government bill HE CARDINAL . Moreover , private life is , in particular , protected against dissemination of information which may be correct as such . In order for the act to be punishable , it is necessary that the information concerns the private life of the person in question ( see government bill HE CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the Freedom of LAW ( painovapauslaki , tryckfrihetslagen ; Act no .

Under LAW , section CARDINAL , of the said Act , damages shall constitute compensation for personal injury and damage to property . LAW provides that a person who has suffered personal injury shall be entitled to damages to cover medical costs and other costs arising from the injury , as well as loss of income and maintenance and pain and suffering .", "CARDINAL . According to the government bill to amend LAW ( HE CARDINAL ) , the maximum amount of compensation for pain and suffering from , inter alia , bodily injuries had in the recent past been MONEY ( EUR CARDINAL,CARDINAL ) . In the subsequent government bill to amend LAW ( HE CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , it is stated that no changes to the prevailing level of compensation for suffering are proposed .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL ) concerned the publication in a magazine of an article which had described a pending criminal case in which the accused had been charged with , inter alia , aggravated fraud . The article had been illustrated , without the accused 's permission , with another article published previously in another magazine and with a picture of the accused published in that connection . The accused 's name had been given in the text of the article and she could be recognised from the picture . ORG found that the criminal case had no such social significance that would justify its publication without the accused 's permission and , consequently , her private life had been invaded .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( ORG ) concerned an incident following which A. , a public figure , and B. , his female friend , had been convicted . When interviewing A. , PERSON 's name was mentioned in the television broadcast in DATE , that is , after they had been convicted . The court found that the facts discussed in the television programme with regard to B. were part of her private life and enjoyed the protection of privacy . The fines imposed on her as punishment for the assault did not constitute a criminal - law sanction justifying publication of her name . The interviewer and the television company were ordered to pay B. damages in the amount of LAW for disclosing her identity in the television programme .", "CARDINAL . The decision of DATE ( ORG ) concerned the present case . An article had been written about a relationship between A. , who worked as a press officer for a candidate in the presidential elections , and B. , the ex - spouse of a TV journalist . A. 's photo was included in the article . ORG , having assessed the provision on the invasion of privacy in LAW in the light of this ORG 's case - law , found that A. did not hold a position that meant that such details of her private life were of public importance . The article had thus invaded ORG 's privacy .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) , ORG noted that an offence was not a private matter for the offender . In principle , however , a person convicted of and sentenced for having committed an offence also enjoyed the right inherent in private life to live in peace . According to LAW , any information about the commission of an offence and the resulting sentence qualified as \u201c sensitive \u201d personal data . The publicity per se of criminal proceedings and of related documents did not mean that information made public during the proceedings could be freely published as such by the media . ORG concluded that publishing the name of a person convicted of , inter alia , assault and deprivation of liberty did not invade his privacy as the person concerned had been convicted of offences of violence which had also degraded the victim 's human dignity . Furthermore , the article in question did not include his photo .", "CARDINAL . ORG decision of DATE ( ORG ) concerned the scope of the private life of a leading public prosecutor whose name or identify had not been revealed in an article which mainly concerned his wife , who had been suspected of having committed a crime . ORG concluded that the issue had had social significance as the person under suspicion was the public prosecutor 's wife . Even though the public prosecutor could have been identified from the article , this was justified by the fact that his own impartiality as a prosecutor was at stake .", "CARDINAL . In ORG decision of DATE ( ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL ) A. had been convicted of incest with his children and the case file was declared secret . Later PERSON revealed certain details of the case in a television programme . The court found that , even though the children had remained anonymous in the programme , they could still be identified because PERSON had appeared in the programme undisguised and his first name had been given . The privacy of the children and their mother had thus been invaded .", "CARDINAL . The latest ORG decision of DATE ( PERSON ) concerned invasion of privacy of the Prime Minister by his ex - companion . ORG found that the ex - companion had had no right to disclose intimate details about the Prime Minister 's private life and their dating in her book .", "CARDINAL . The Union of Journalists in GPE ( ORG , PERSON ) publishes Guidelines for Journalists ( NORP ohjeet , PERSON ) for the purposes of self - regulation . The DATE Guidelines were in force at the material time and provided , inter alia , that matters falling in the sphere of private life , being detrimental to the relevant party or his or her near relative , should not be published unless the matters are of general significance ( Article CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . New Guidelines came into force in DATE , which noted that when publishing public material regard must be had to the protection of private life . Highly delicate information relating to one 's personal life may only be published with the consent of the person in question , or if such matters are of considerable public interest ( DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Also ORG ( GPE sanan neuvosto , PERSON f\u00f6r massmedier ) , which is a self - regulating body established in DATE by publishers and journalists in the field of mass communication and whose task it is to interpret good professional practice and defend the freedom of speech and publication , has issued a number of resolutions and statements , inter alia , in DATE and DATE . The former concerned the content of private life and the latter disclosure of names in crime news coverage .", "CARDINAL . In its statement of DATE , ORG stated , inter alia , that the protection of private life applies , in principle , to all citizens . The greater and more profound social implications a matter has , the more important it is to be able to publish information thereon . The ORG divided persons into CARDINAL groups as to the protection of identity : ( CARDINAL ) persons exercising political , economic or administrative power ; ( CARDINAL ) other public persons , for example in the sectors of entertainment , sports , arts or science ; and ( CARDINAL ) ordinary citizens . The ORG noted that the protection of identity is narrowest for group CARDINAL and most extensive for group CARDINAL . However , this scale was not to be used formally , but the extent of protection should be interpreted on a case by case basis . A person 's position had a great significance in determining the protection of private life but that alone could not be considered as a decisive factor . The significance of a matter also had an important impact . The conduct of a well - known person appearing in public in connection with his or her professional tasks or public role does not as such belong to such person 's protected private life . On the contrary , information concerning lifestyle does normally belong to such person 's sphere of private life even though his or her sphere of protection is narrower than that of an ordinary citizen . In some cases information concerning one 's lifestyle can be closely connected to his or her professional tasks in a way that its publishing is justified . It is required , however , that the matter in question does have considerable general significance . Also , the publishing should not extend further than is necessary for the consideration of the matter . Finally , it is in accordance with good journalistic practice to see to it that the publishing does not cause undue suffering for the person in question or for his or her relatives .", "CARDINAL .
