SWEDEN", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "David Th\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rgvinsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national of NORP origin who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE the applicant arrived in GPE from GPE . On DATE he was granted a permanent residence permit . He was not considered to be a refugee but a person \u201c otherwise in need of protection \u201d . He was granted NORP citizenship on DATE .", "On DATE , PERSON , a woman born in DATE , and CARDINAL children , allegedly born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively , applied for residence permits at ORG in GPE , on the grounds that they were the wife and children of the applicant .", "PERSON was interviewed at ORG on DATE and DATE . She could not give a precise date of her alleged marriage with the applicant , only that it had been in DATE . No marriage certificate was submitted . She claimed that they had never thought that it was important to have their marriage registered . At the request of the interviewer , PERSON agreed to a bone age test of the CARDINAL eldest children . This test , which was performed by a radiologist at ORG . CARDINAL on DATE , showed that all the children tested were DATE .", "In a letter to ORG of DATE , the applicant claimed that his marriage to PERSON had not been registered as the war between GPE and GPE had made it impossible to visit the relevant authorities .", "On DATE ORG ( Migrationsverket ) rejected the applications for residence permits . It found that the marriage between the applicant and the woman had not been registered in GPE and considered that the CARDINAL eldest children had to be considerably DATE . Moreover , falsified documents and incorrect statements had been submitted by the woman and the children . ORG referred , inter alia , to their identity cards , all with the same registration and page numbers and containing information which was inconsistent with the claim that the marriage had not been registered . It stated that it could not be ascertained from the information submitted whether the applicant and the woman belonged to the same family , to different families or were in any way related . Noting that it was up to the persons requesting a residence permit to submit full and correct information , ORG concluded that the woman and the children had failed to show that they were related to the applicant .", "PERSON and the children appealed to ORG ( Utl\u00e4nningsn\u00e4mnden ) . They submitted a marriage certificate , according to which the applicant and the woman had been married on DATE . They argued that there had been a misunderstanding regarding the question whether the marriage had been registered or not ; the applicant and PERSON had only meant that the marriage certificate was missing . Furthermore , the applicant requested that a new bone age test be performed .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant that the NORP authorities would not perform a new bone age test . However , he was invited to pay for a test himself and submit the test results . The applicant subsequently replied that he did not intend to have a new medical investigation performed .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . It noted that the applicant and PERSON , during the investigation at ORG , had stated that they had not been able to register their marriage with the NORP authorities due to the war between GPE and GPE . However , in their appeal , they had stated that the marriage had in fact been registered but that they had misunderstood the question put to them and had had the impression that the fact that they did not have a certificate meant that no registration had been made . ORG found their statements contradictory and concluded that the explanation given in the appeal was no more credible than the information given at first instance . It further stated that NORP identity documents had a low value as evidence and , as such , did not prove the identity of the holder . In conclusion , the ORG considered that the documents submitted did not prove the alleged identities and family ties . Moreover , the age of the CARDINAL eldest children had not been confirmed .", "On DATE PERSON and the children filed new applications with ORG in GPE . On DATE the ORG held a third interview with her and also briefly interviewed the children . She stated that the marriage certificate had been obtained in DATE but had not been available at the time of her second interview at the ORG . She had not obtained it earlier as the applicant had told her that it was not necessary for the first interview .", "On DATE the new applications for residence permits were rejected by ORG , which found that no new circumstances had emerged .", "In an appeal to ORG , new documents were submitted , including a certificate issued by ORG in GPE on DATE . The certificate stated that , according to a marital contract issued by ORG , the applicant and PERSON had been married on DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal . Notwithstanding the certificate from ORG , it found no reason to change its previous decision .", "On DATE the applicant submitted yet another application to ORG on behalf of his alleged family members . In a letter of DATE , the ORG requested that the applicant contact the family in order to make an appointment at a NORP embassy abroad for an interview and to prove their identities . On DATE the application was dismissed as the requested information had not been provided within the prescribed DATE period and the application had not been pursued ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
