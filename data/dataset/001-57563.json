DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "No violation of Art. 14+6;No violation of Art. 14+8", "JUDGES": "C. Russo", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant , Mr. PERSON , is a NORP citizen , born in DATE . He currently works as a clerk and resides in PERSON .", "He was married in DATE . During the marriage , CARDINAL children were born , a boy in DATE and a girl , GPE , on DATE . The applicant had grounds , even before the latter 's birth , for assuming that another man might be the father ; however , in order to save the marriage , he took no steps to have paternity determined .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , Mr. PERSON and his wife applied for a separation ( separation ved bevilling ) , which they obtained on DATE . In accordance with their agreement , Mrs. PERSON retained custody of the children and the competent authority issued a decision to the effect that Mr. PERSON should pay maintenance for them from DATE . He in fact did so from that date until DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant , who had previously still nurtured hopes of preserving the marriage , took some steps to institute proceedings to challenge his paternity of GPE . To this end , he applied for legal aid . However , he did not pursue the matter since , on DATE , he and his wife signed an agreement whereby she waived all claims for maintenance for the child and he undertook to refrain from bringing any such proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , the applicant and his wife applied for a divorce ( skilmisse ved bevilling ) , which was granted on DATE . On this occasion , he reaffirmed before the authorities that the mother should have sole custody of the children and was once more ordered to pay maintenance for them . He did not raise any objection .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , DATE before GPE 's fifth birthday , the applicant 's former wife wrote to him asserting that she was not bound by the agreement of CARDINAL DATE . She later lodged with the public authorities a renewed petition for maintenance , which was granted by order effective from DATE . Since then , Mr. PERSON has regularly paid the maintenance .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON sought leave from ORG ( PERSON ) to institute proceedings out of time to determine the paternity of the girl ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "In accordance with the normal procedure , the police , at ORG request , interviewed Mr. PERSON and his former wife in DATE and recorded their statements in a report .", "CARDINAL . ORG refused the application on DATE , for the reason that the statutory conditions for granting leave at that time were not satisfied ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "The applicant did not appeal against the decision within the statutory time - limit . However , on DATE , he petitioned ORG for leave to appeal out of time to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) , but this was refused on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , Mr. PERSON applied again to ORG for leave to institute paternity proceedings . His former wife opposed the application , on the ground that such proceedings would have a detrimental effect on the child .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG refused the application for the reason that the applicant had not brought the action contesting paternity within the time - limits provided for in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW on the Legal Status of Children ( \" LAW \" - Lov nr . CARDINAL af CARDINAL om b\u00f8rns retsstilling ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and that there was no cause to grant him any exemption since the conditions laid down in section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) were not met . A similar decision was given by ORG on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Prior to the enactment of LAW , which applied in Mr. PERSON 's case , the status of children was regulated in LAW of DATE and LAW . LAW of the latter provided that proceedings to contest paternity of a legitimate child could be instituted by the mother , the husband , the child or a person appointed guardian of the child . No time - limit was laid down for the institution of such proceedings .", "CARDINAL . According to NORP case - law and legal writing , however , a husband could be estopped from contesting paternity of a child born in wedlock if , knowing that his wife had had sexual intercourse with another man during the relevant period , he had expressly or tacitly acknowledged after the child 's birth that he was the father . The \" doctrine of acknowledgement \" ( anerkendelseslaeren ) was first established in DATE by a judgment of ORG , reported in GPE for Retsvaesen ( ORG . NORP ) DATE , p. CARDINAL . Although there was no case - law on the point , legal writers expressed the view that this doctrine applied also to mothers ( see , for instance , ORG , ORG I , DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG set up a committee , called ORG , to consider , inter alia , certain aspects of the status of children born in wedlock . In DATE , the ORG submitted its report ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) on the amendment of the rules regarding determination of paternity .", "As to the husband 's right to institute proceedings to challenge paternity of a child born in wedlock , ORG recommended the institution of a double time - limit of DATE from the time when the husband became aware of the facts affording grounds for contesting his paternity and not DATE from the birth of the child ; but that ORG should be empowered to grant exemption from these time - limits in special circumstances . The ORG took the view that the welfare of the child ( and of the marriage ) required that his status should be established as soon as possible and that the husband 's interests should yield to these considerations ( page CARDINAL of the report ) . CARDINAL of the reasons given by ORG for this recommendation was that a paternity suit instituted by the husband DATE after the child 's birth would place the child in a worse position than if proceedings had been instituted earlier : the court would possibly have to give judgment in the husband 's favour on the basis of the blood - group determination , while it would be difficult to obtain a paternity and a maintenance order against another man .", "On the other hand , the ORG found that the child 's right to institute proceedings should not be subject to any time - limit , since the views which might lead to restricting the husband 's right to institute proceedings were not of relevance in the case of an action brought by the child . For the same reasons , there should likewise be no time - limit with regard to actions brought by the child 's guardian or the mother ( page CARDINAL of the report ) .", "ORG also discussed the question whether the doctrine of acknowledgement should be embodied in legislation . However , it considered that this was a matter which was better left to the courts to decide on a case - by - case basis .", "CARDINAL . The Government subsequently introduced a PERSON which incorporated in part the recommendations of ORG but increased the time - limits to DATE and DATE respectively and conferred competence to grant exemption on ORG . This legislation entered into force , as LAW , on DATE . It provided in section CARDINAL ) that proceedings to challenge paternity of a child could be brought by the husband , the mother , the child or a guardian of the child . Sub - sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of section CARDINAL read as follows :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) Paternity proceedings must be instituted by the husband within DATE after he becomes cognizant of the circumstances which may give grounds for his renunciation of paternity , and not DATE after the birth of the child .", "( CARDINAL ) However , a ORG may , on the conditions set out in section CARDINALr , sub - section CARDINAL , of ORG , grant leave to institute proceedings after the expiry of the time - limits set out in sub - section CARDINAL above . \"", "Section CARDINALr , sub - section CARDINAL , of ORG concerns re - opening of a paternity case after the expiry of the applicable time - limit or time - limits .", "LAW did not impose any restriction on the mother 's right to institute paternity proceedings , nor did it refer to the doctrine of acknowledgement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . In case - law , however , the \" doctrine of acknowledgement \" continued to be applied and there were ORG and ORG decisions confirming the earlier view that the doctrine also applied to mothers .", "CARDINAL . The circumstances which , under the doctrine of acknowledgement , estop the husband from contesting paternity will , as a general rule , also militate against granting him leave to institute proceedings out of time . However , a decision to grant leave is without prejudice to the outcome of the subsequent procedure ( see ORG judgment of DATE , ORG . DATE , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , ORG set up a committee , called ORG \" , to consider whether the evolution of social conditions , and notably the changes in the social status of women and the resultant changes in the conception of the institution of marriage since the introduction of LAW , called for amendment of , inter alia , the provisions governing the legal status , during marriage and after separation or divorce , of children born in wedlock . In fact , the proportion of women working outside their homes has increased to MONEY . As a result , men are , to a much higher degree than before , looking after the children and are more frequently granted their custody in the event of separation or divorce . Mothers are therefore now more likely to challenge paternity in order to prevent custody being given to the husband . In a report on cohabitation without marriage ( samliv uden aegteskab I - no CARDINAL/CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL ) , published in DATE , ORG stated :", "\" There is consensus in the ORG that also the mother 's right to institute paternity proceedings and request re - opening should be subject to a relatively short time - limit , for example corresponding to the time - limits which DATE apply to the father . Furthermore , the ORG is to some degree in favour of an absolute time - limit , applicable to all , for instituting and re - opening paternity proceedings . \"", "CARDINAL . On the basis of the recommendations of ORG , the ORG tabled a PERSON before ORG in DATE , proposing certain amendments to LAW .", "The explanatory memorandum to this PERSON referred to the PERSON case , then pending before ORG . On DATE , it mentioned that the Agent of the Government had declared in evidence before the ORG that new legislation on the matter would be introduced , establishing uniform time - limits within which both men and women could contest the husband 's paternity ; the memorandum added that ORG considered such legislation \" desirable in the interest of the child 's needs \" ( af hensyn til barnets tarv ) .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE , the NORP legislature passed an LAW amending LAW , which entered into force on DATE .", "Following this amendment , sub - sections CARDINAL of section CARDINAL of LAW now provide :", "\" ( CARDINAL ) Paternity proceedings must be instituted not DATE after the birth of the child . This provision shall not apply , however , where proceedings are instituted by the child after having attained DATE .", "( CARDINAL ) A Court of Appeal may grant leave to institute proceedings after the expiry of the time - limit set out in the first sentence of sub - section CARDINAL of this section where quite exceptional grounds are given as to why proceedings were not instituted at an earlier stage , in circumstances where institution of proceedings is especially warranted , and where it can be presumed that the proceedings will not cause the child any great inconvenience . \"", "The \" doctrine of acknowledgement \" is still applied by the NORP courts to estop spouses from contesting paternity of a child ( see ORG judgment of DATE ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "6", "8"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
