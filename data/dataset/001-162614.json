That the defendant suffers from a pathological disturbance , in particular a very limited development of his mental faculties ... Considering this , the defendant should be regarded as having diminished criminal responsibility ( verminderd toerekeningsvatbaar ) , but nevertheless should mainly be held criminally liable for his actions . It is noted in particular that the defendant can not be considered to have been mentally insane before , during or after the commission of the crime ... Even though the defendant is capable of committing a similar offence in the future , it is not necessary to commit him to a regular mental hospital ( krankzinnigengesticht ) , but instead he should be placed in a custodial clinic for psychopaths ( psychopatenasiel ) to undergo a rather lengthy treatment under very strict surveillance . In GPE there is a choice only between prison and the national ( regular ) mental hospital ( PERSON ) . Taking into consideration that the risk of recidivism is for the time being very high , even if treatment would possibly start immediately , and that , consequently , intensive surveillance is of primordial importance ( such surveillance being impossible in the national mental hospital ) , and the fact that the defendant is not to be considered criminally insane within the meaning of the law , admission to the national mental hospital is wholly contra - indicated . The sole option remaining is for him to undergo his punishment in prison ( transfer to a custodial clinic in the GPE is impossible on account of the defendant \u2019s limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally ) . It is strongly advised that , where possible in the prison setting , an attempt should be made to attain a stronger personality structure in the defendant in order to avoid recidivism in the future . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The First Instance Court considered that a life sentence , the imposition of which had been sought by ORG , would only be condign punishment if it was established from the outset that the applicant \u2019s condition was not amenable to improvement .

Our society can not afford to take any risks with such a murderous psychopath . In order for our community \u2019s interests to be adequately protected , the return of the petitioner to that community is to be prevented . In my opinion it can not be excluded that this solidly built CARDINAL-year - old man , with his serious criminal behaviour ... , and currently in the prime of his life , will once again reoffend .", "The above - mentioned interview as well as the fact that he ( even though he is entitled to do so ) has once again seen fit to lodge a request for a pardon for the umpteenth time has caused great commotion in our society .

Neither had it become plausible that the execution of the trial court \u2019s decision or its continuation did not reasonably serve any of the aims pursued through the application of the criminal law .", "The petition for pardon to which this advice of ORG of ORG related was rejected by the Governor , on the grounds set out in that advice , on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

By a decision of DATE the Governor of GPE acceded to this request and granted the applicant a pardon ( see also paragraph CARDINAL above ) , entailing the remission of his prison sentence , as in the circumstances the further execution of that sentence was no longer deemed to serve a useful purpose .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , having submitted the applicant \u2019s life sentence to the periodic review prescribed by Article TIME of LAW , which had entered into force on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , decided that the applicant \u2019s custodial sentence still served a reasonable purpose after DATE .", "CARDINAL . The decision of ORG of Justice firstly sets out the proceedings which took place before that court : hearings had taken place on DATE and DATE , at which the applicant , who was represented by counsel , was heard . A member of staff of the prison in GPE was also heard , as were the psychologist PERSON , the psychiatrist PERSON and relatives of the victim and their representative . The decision cites relevant parts of the sentencing court \u2019s judgment of CARDINAL DATE and summarises the findings contained in the reports drawn up about the applicant for the purpose of the periodic review ( see paragraphs DATE below ) . A section entitled \u201c The position of the relatives of the victim \u201d reads as follows :", "\u201c The relatives indicated at the hearing that they did not agree with a possible release of the convicted person . They stated that news of a possible release had reopened old wounds , that they were experiencing the psychological consequences of this , and that they were afraid of the convicted person . He has threatened them in the past and they have not observed any feelings of remorse or regret in him .", "The relatives\u2019 representative submitted that the risk of recidivism was unacceptable for them .", "In a report drawn up by ORG for Probation and ORG of CARDINAL DATE the Rapporteur addresses the position of the relatives . The ORG notes in the first place that the relatives have so far barely been provided with psychological help or with support in coming to terms with their bereavement . He concludes that the victim \u2019s mother still appears to struggle with issues she has not dealt with and about which she barely speaks , and that the father requires professional help in order to cope with his feelings . The relatives have told the Rapporteur that they feel insecure at the mere thought of the convicted person being released . They have further indicated that ever since the arrest of the convicted person and until the present time they have been \u2018 living in a prison\u2019 and that this has also had adverse repercussions on their other children . ORG concludes that a possible conditional release of the convicted person would at this stage have far - reaching psychological consequences for the relatives . \u201d", "The decision goes on to observe that , in the acting Procurator General \u2019s submission , there was not a single objective indication from which it could be inferred that the risk of the applicant \u2019s committing an offence had disappeared or diminished , that an early release would seriously shock the surviving relatives , and that it would also shock society to such an extent that this would hinder the applicant \u2019s possible reintegration . After describing the position put forward on behalf of the applicant , ORG then came to its assessment , which , in so far as relevant , reads as follows :", "\u201c ...", "CARDINAL NORP The convicted person \u2019s deprivation of liberty has at present lasted considerably more than twenty years , namely QUANTITY years . The court must therefore assess whether the further unconditional execution of the life sentence no longer serves a reasonable purpose .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL It follows from the reasons given by the [ sentencing ] court for the imposition of the life sentence ... that the aim of this sentence was to protect society against recidivism by the convicted person . The risk of recidivism was deemed by the [ sentencing ] court to be particularly high , while treatment was not considered possible .", "CARDINAL LOC court will therefore first and foremost have to assess to what extent the risk of recidivism existing at the time is still present DATE . In this connection it is firstly to be noted that at the time that risk was deemed to be particularly high in view of the personality of the convicted person , and that since then no treatment in any shape or form has taken place .", "CARDINAL NORP After the court had commissioned CARDINAL experts at its hearing of CARDINAL DATE , psychologist PERSON and psychiatrist PERSON reported on the convicted person \u2019s personality and the risk of recidivism . Unlike the defence , the court is of the view that both the examination carried out and the report drawn up by the psychologist are of adequate quality and expertise . ...", "CARDINAL It appears from the ... findings of both experts that the convicted person is still suffering from a disorder , namely an antisocial personality disorder . The court deduces from the findings that this disorder has a negative bearing on the risk of recidivism and hampers possible reintegration into society . The court further considers that the nature of the offence committed by the convicted person \u2013 the killing of a DATE girl for the sole purpose of hurting her aunt , his former girlfriend DATE is bizarre and , as was concluded at the time , must be attributed to the psychopathically disturbed personality of the convicted person . The court notes that important aspects of that disturbed personality , such as the antisocial personality , the limited development of his conscience and the lack of empathy , are currently still present . No treatment has taken place during the period of detention . It is furthermore not the case , as would be customary within the framework of treatment , that the circumstances which led him to his deed have been discussed with him so that he might subsequently have acquired an insight into how to avoid or defy such circumstances . In the case of the convicted person it would have been expected that in the course of such discussions his relationship with women and the question of dealing with rejection would have been addressed . As already mentioned , no such discussions or treatment have taken place . Also , at the hearing the convicted person did not demonstrate that he was capable of holding himself to account for the seriousness and absurdity of the murder or of understanding how he was able to commit it .", "CARDINAL NORP The foregoing leads the court to conclude that the risk of the convicted person \u2019s reoffending if he were released is such that the protection of society should prevail . This is not altered by the fact that the convicted person has been functioning well and without problems in prison in DATE . After all , and just as the experts have pointed out , prison life is very structured and circumstances such as those under which the convicted person committed his crime are absent there . Such circumstances may occur outside the prison and \u2013 having regard to the aforementioned personality and the fact that no treatment has taken place \u2013 the court considers the risk of the convicted person \u2019s reoffending if confronted with such circumstances to be too great .", "CARDINAL LOC court further takes the position of the victim \u2019s relatives into account . It has been sufficiently established that conditional release would at the present time entail adverse psychological consequences for them . The court observes in this connection that over DATE the relatives have also not been provided with adequate support to help them come to terms with their grief or , if necessary , with treatment for their psychological problems . It is therefore easily understandable that they are very shocked now that the possibility of the convicted person \u2019s conditional release is being considered for the first time . In this context the court attaches relevance to the fact that after he committed his crime the convicted person threatened to harm the relatives and in this way contributed to their sense of insecurity . The convicted person has not demonstrated that he has any insight into the consequences of his deed or his subsequent actions .", "CARDINAL On the basis of the foregoing , the court is of the opinion that the continued execution of the life sentence still serves a reasonable purpose . The court will accordingly not proceed to order the conditional release of the convicted person .", "CARDINAL Having regard to the foregoing the court also perceives no cause to adjourn its examination pending further investigations , as requested by the defence as an alternative course of action .", "CARDINAL NORP The court adds that it is aware of the fact that its considerations as set out under points CARDINAL and CARDINAL would appear to offer little prospect of release in the future , as this would imperatively require that in DATE some form of treatment should take place in which , in any event , aspects such as crime analysis , relationships and rejection would need to be addressed . Perhaps such treatment can be organised in some way in the [ prison in GPE ] . The court further considers that the position of the relatives may also be different at the time of a subsequent review if they continue to receive the necessary support in dealing with their feelings of mourning , anger and fear .", "CARDINAL NORP The court finally notes that it has also had regard to the commotion which the possibility of a conditional release has caused in society and which has appeared from the submitted newspaper articles and the considerable public interest . A large part of the community perhaps thinks that the perpetrator of a crime such as the murder of [ the victim ] should never be allowed to regain his liberty . In the court \u2019s examination this has not , however , played a decisive role . After all , society \u2019s need for retribution should be considered to have been sufficiently assuaged after a period of detention of CARDINAL three years . As noted above , the aim of the continuation of that sentence is currently no longer retribution but the protection of society against possible recidivism .", "CARDINAL . The decision", "The court :", "does not proceed to order the convicted person \u2019s DATE conditional \u2013 release . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In the course of the criminal proceedings against him and at the request of the public prosecutor , the applicant was examined by psychiatrist J.N.S. in order to assess whether he could be held criminally responsible for the offence with which he was charged . The psychiatrist produced a CARDINAL report on DATE . ORG judgment of CARDINAL DATE includes a summary of the conclusion and advice contained in that report ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The conclusion and advice as set out in the psychiatrist \u2019s report , reads , in so far as relevant , as follows :", "\u201c Conclusion : In view of the above the Rapporteur reaches the following structure diagnosis : Serious criminal behaviour in the shape of a murder committed as a result of a primitive and primary outburst of emotions , by a retarded , infantile and narcissistic young man whose character structure has a serious disturbance of a psychopathiform nature .", "Advice : The Rapporteur should wish to present his advice on the basis of the following questions :", "CARDINAL .

If so , was this the case to such an extent that the accused , were he to be found guilty of the offences , should generally be considered , in the current state of ORG society , as not responsible for them or only to a greater or lesser extent ?", "Reply : The Rapporteur would wish to conclude that the accused , having regard to the replies under CARDINAL . and CARDINAL . , should be considered as having diminished criminal responsibility , but he nevertheless still considers that the accused is for the most part responsible for the acts , if they are found proven , which he has committed . The Rapporteur should especially wish to conclude that he would not call the accused insane , either before , during or after the offence ; ... the accused has never withdrawn into a bizarre and mad world of his own but has always lived in a primitive , primary sensory world and he has succeeded , whenever his existence was not under stress , to participate in society to a reasonable extent .", "CARDINAL . At the time of the offences , did he have the insight to realise that committing them was morally reprehensible and would not be tolerated by society ?", "Reply : According to the Rapporteur he must have had such insight , but he subsequently completely suppressed and replaced it by a fantasy in view of the threat of destruction of his own personality structure .", "CARDINAL . If he did have such insight , would he have been capable of determining his will and his actions accordingly ?", "Reply : See the reply to question CARDINAL . Also partly because of that , the Rapporteur has reached a conclusion of diminished criminal responsibility .", "CARDINAL . Can it be expected that the accused might commit the same offence again or disrupt public order in a different manner ?", "Reply : Having regard to what has been written and concluded above , the accused is certainly capable of committing a similar act or of causing a different disruption of public order .", "CARDINAL . Does his mental state require that the accused be committed to a lunatic asylum ?", "Reply : In view of the reply to question CARDINAL it may be said that this is not necessary .", "CARDINAL . What practical guidelines can you give and/or what proposals that are feasible in DATE society can you make in order to improve or bring about a recovery and/or a better development of the accused ?", "Reply : In view of the replies under CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and CARDINAL my advice would be that the accused should be committed to a mental asylum where , certainly , during a fairly long period institutional treatment under very strict surveillance ought to take place . On GPE we have the choice only between prison and the national psychiatric hospital .

The sole option remaining is for the accused , should he be found guilty of the offences with which he has been charged , to undergo his sentence in prison ( a transfer to , for example , a mental asylum in the GPE is in my opinion not possible because of the accused \u2019s limited intelligence and insufficient ability to express himself verbally ) .

His social skills have similarly deteriorated and he has given up hope of his situation undergoing any change , which has resulted in [ the applicant ] having to cope with very negative and depressive feelings about himself and others .", "[ The applicant ] requires support as regards his bottled - up negative and depressive feelings and in order to improve his general well - being .", "My advice as regards a pardon is not to give [ the applicant ] false hope and to be clear about the aspects of his case .", "If a pardon is applicable , it is recommended that [ the applicant ] follow a rehabilitation and social skills programme and that he be provided with support both inside and outside the ORG in order to promote his independence and functioning in society . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG and ORG ( PERSON en GPE ) issued a report , in which it was noted that the applicant could live with his mother on GPE and could work in an upholstery shop . The person who drew up the report found it difficult to estimate the risk of recidivism , but considered that with appropriate support following release his prospects of successfully integrating in society were good .", "CARDINAL . At the request of ORG of Justice CARDINAL reports were issued .", "CARDINAL . The first of these reports , which was issued by the ORG on CARDINAL DATE , included the following :", "\u201c [ The applicant ] is a calm , quiet man of DATE who has never been given a disciplinary punishment during his detention . ... He carries out his duties adequately and to the satisfaction of prison staff . In principle he works alone , but is occasionally willing to train other inmates in upholstery work . ... He is always polite and respectful towards prison staff ; none of them have complaints about him . He rarely has any contact with the social worker and if he does , he always asks the same questions . It is as if he forgets matters which have already been discussed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The second report was drawn up on DATE by psychiatrist PERSON , who concluded as follows :", "\u201c The personality test showed that the subject has an antisocial personality disorder with mild psychopathic features . There are also signs of narcissistic features . The character structure is rigid , but is not strongly displayed , perhaps because of his age . The risk that he will reoffend or get into trouble in some other way upon return to society is considered to be present ( moderate risk in comparison with the forensic population ) . ... In general the subject can be described as having an antisocial personality whose more unpleasant manifestations have been mitigated . ... It is reasonably certain that his personality will not change . Personality is formed up to DATE , after which only small changes take place . The examination shows that the subject \u2019s personality profile is fairly rigid . He will therefore always be a fairly unpleasant person in his relations with others and will always have difficulty in establishing and maintaining social contacts . Given his personality , I estimate the chances of successful integration in society to be small . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The third report requested by ORG was compiled by psychiatrist PERSON on DATE , in which the following was concluded :", "\u201c The subject is , however , suffering from a severe antisocial personality disorder , characterised by a highly undifferentiated , fairly primitive emotional awareness , an underdeveloped conscience , rudimentary social skills , a lack of empathy . ... Although the subject displayed problematic and aggressive behaviour during DATE of his detention , even including an attempt at poisoning , he has practically been a model prisoner over DATE . ... This change in behaviour is largely attributable to the structure provided by the prison setting and the fact that he is much older now ( CARDINAL ) and is likely to become more and more moderate as the years go by . ... [ ORG to the risk of recidivism : I am in CARDINAL minds . Whereas the subject is almost a model prisoner , his character traits have not in essence changed . He continues to be a person with a serious disability . It remains in doubt how he will react and to what extent he can survive once the structure offered by the prison is no longer in place . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following up the decision of CARDINAL DATE given by ORG , ORG in GPE concluded that more structured contact with a psychiatrist would be desirable . For this reason , the Procurator General of ORG asked his counterpart in GPE to ensure that the applicant received regular visits from a psychiatrist who would counsel him on the basis of a treatment plan , in so far as this could be done within the constraints of the enforcement of his life sentence .", "CARDINAL . A document entitled \u201c ORG \u201d was drawn up by the GPE prison \u2019s psychologist J.S.M. ( who had reported on the applicant for the purposes of the periodic review ; see paragraph CARDINAL above ) on DATE , apparently at the request of the applicant \u2019s representative . The psychologist stated that she had conducted a psychological test and an interview with the applicant , at a time ( DATE ) when she had only been working at the prison for DATE . She had no knowledge of what had been offered to the applicant prior to that . The short time during which she had had experience of the applicant was insufficient for her to produce a support plan or to execute such a plan .", "CARDINAL . A second document entitled \u201c Psychological Report \u201d was drawn up by the same psychologist on DATE , at the request of the Government . Apart from CARDINAL sentence , this report is identical to the report of DATE .
