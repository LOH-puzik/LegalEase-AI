The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE the applicant , aged DATE at the time , was called up to undertake compulsory military service . For the purposes of his conscription he had a combined psychological evaluation and physical examination on DATE , as a result of which he was found to be fit for military service . The detailed report , which was not disclosed to the applicant ( until DATE in the course of pension proceedings ) , considered that the applicant was slow in understanding and executing a task but logical in its exercise , although prone to giving up . In an evaluation covering language and cultural skills , motivation , mental performance and behaviour , he obtained a grade of CARDINAL out of CARDINAL in each area .", "CARDINAL . Upon his conscription , the applicant underwent another medical examination on DATE , as a result of which he was again found to be fit for military service on the basis that he was not suffering from any illness . He was assigned to Battalion no . CARDINAL in ORG , where he was subject to intensive physical and mental training , including in the use of firearms .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the provincial command unit in GPE , where he remained until DATE . During this time , from DATE to CARDINAL DATE he temporarily formed part of its logistical battalion . While in GPE the applicant was subjected to multiple punishments . According to the documentation presented , he was subjected to CARDINAL punishments DATE , amounting to DATE of confinement , including periods of solitary confinement , for reasons ranging from negligent care of his camp - bed area to failure to report to his supervisor , or informal behaviour towards his superior . During the time he spent with the logistical battalion he was hospitalised CARDINAL times for medical care unrelated to his mental problems ( see below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to GPE , where a commander noted that the applicant suffered from nervous tics and twitches , difficulty in socialising and learning , and absent - minded behaviour . The commander ordered the applicant to undergo a specialised medical assessment to test his fitness to perform military service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he was admitted to hospital , where he was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and considered to be in a fragile state of mind .", "A medical report by the ORG of ORG of DATE considered that in his youth the applicant had suffered from affection - relational problems and learning difficulties . He was physically weak and insecure , had a low aptitude for learning and was prone to isolation , was dysfunctional and incapable of taking up responsibilities . Tests revealed that he was unable to perform assigned tasks , had difficulty orienting himself and impaired cognitive functions ( a deficit in logic and memory ) . He was considered to have a slight intellectual deficit ( an IQ of CARDINAL ) and to be incapable of creating positive relationships with people . This inadequacy caused him to live military life with anxiety and fear of his fellow soldiers , who he considered were aggressive towards him , even if they had only been joking . The report considered that the longer he remained in military service , the more severe his anxiety would become , and his defensive attitude arising from his fears would intensify .", "CARDINAL . The applicant remained on medical leave for recovery purposes until DATE , when , following a specialised assessment to determine his suitability for military service , on DATE the applicant was found to suffer from \u201c dysphoria and borderline personality [ disorder ] \u201d and was discharged due to unfitness .", "CARDINAL . NORP Following his discharge , the applicant underwent further medical examinations . A report by the NHS of Tricase of DATE considered that the applicant no longer had a defensive attitude , nor was he suffering from dysphoria and nervous tics . He was still , however , insecure , prone to isolation , unstable and unwilling to take up responsibilities . Following the tests performed , the report concluded that the stressful situation , namely his military service , having ended , the applicant had slightly improved . However , he still displayed signs of intellectual deficit .", "CARDINAL . At the time a report by the applicant \u2019s doctor ( PERSON ) considered that the applicant had fallen sick because of military service or that there was at least a causal link between the CARDINAL . In consequence , on DATE the applicant asked ORG to pay damages under PERSON no . CARDINAL of DATE and presidential decree no . CARDINAL of DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the examination of his request for damages , on DATE ORG of ORG diagnosed the applicant with \u201c obsessive - compulsive disorder \u201d ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , which it considered was not a result of his military service . It opined that the mental infirmity at issue was a pre - existing condition . It did not appear that during his military service the applicant had been involved in any events or had to carry out any duties which , given their importance , duration and nature , could have seriously influenced the onset or progression of this mental health problem . It further considered the request to have been made out of time .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime the applicant had repeatedly asked the relevant authorities to provide him with a copy of the pertinent documents regarding the period in which he had served in the military to enable him to substantiate his claims . On DATE he further asked ORG to provide him with the administrative and health documents related to his case together with TIME of ORG meeting in his respect . This request was repeated CARDINAL times in DATE and remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the second instance ORG of ORG confirmed the findings of ORG dated DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s request for damages , noting that ORG ( second instance ) of the Command of ORG had , on DATE , determined that the ORG from which the applicant suffered had not been caused by his military service .", "CARDINAL . According to a medical certificate submitted by the applicant to this ORG , issued by ORG ( mental health department ) on DATE , the applicant , who had been treated by the department since DATE for a fragile state of mind , a low IQ , and ORG which had become chronic , had developed behavioural problems to the extent of violent outbursts towards his family following his military service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant instituted proceedings before ORG ( \u201c TAR \u201d ) for the recognition of the causal link between his mental health problems and his compulsory military service , and in the event that the court considered his condition to be preexisting he asked it to ascertain the military \u2019s liability for recruiting him and in consequence to make an award of damages in his favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an urgent request with the relevant authorities to access medical documents relating to the fitness - for - service examination prior to conscription , details about his time in the military \u2013 training , work , and so on , his disciplinary record , i.e. of the punishments endured , and a record of his hospital stays , an assessment by his commander of his personality and professionalism and all other relevant material held by ORG . On DATE he was informed that the unit in GPE had been disbanded . He was further informed that he had spent DATE in \u201c consegna semplice \u201d ( a punishment prohibiting an individual from leaving the base ) and DATE of \u201c consegna di rigore \u201d ( a punishment confining the individual to a specified area on the base ) and that any further information had to be requested from ORG . The applicant lodged a request with ORG on DATE and on DATE the office replied , sending the applicant an excerpt containing his disciplinary record and noting that he had spent CARDINAL , rather than QUANTITY , days in \u201c consegna semplice \u201d . No other documentation was sent to the applicant . Following further requests on DATE , ORG sent the applicant the psycho - physical training file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the TAR appointed PERSON as a court expert to ascertain the nature of the applicant \u2019s infirmity and submit a report within DATE .", "CARDINAL . Following an examination of the applicant , PERSON failed to deliver the requisite report . Thus , on DATE , the applicant asked the TAR to replace the expert .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment filed in the relevant registry on DATE the TAR , considering the applicant \u2019s interlocutory request as an application for renewal ( \u201c rinnovo \u201d ) , rejected the request , noting that for DATE the applicant had failed to solicit any action whatsoever . Considering that no more evidence was necessary , it proceeded to give judgment . It held that the CARDINAL ORG had agreed about the source of the applicant \u2019s infirmity and that it had resulted from a pre - existing condition . Indeed the first - instance ORG had referred to a diagnosis of the applicant made in DATE ( when he had been admitted to hospital ) which evidenced a fragile and vulnerable mental state . The court went on to note that it transpired that the medical examination of DATE to determine the applicant \u2019s fitness for service had not been accurate , since it should already have transpired that the applicant was not entirely fit to take up military service .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( \u201c FAC \u201d ) . He complained , inter alia , that : the outcome of the case had been illogical \u2013 even though the TAR had considered that his fitness - for - service examination had not been accurate it had failed to pronounce itself on any liability and to award damages ; the TAR had considered the applicant \u2019s interlocutory request for the replacement of the expert as an application for renewal , even though replacement of the expert was clearly due given the delay in performing his functions , leading to the court taking a decision to dismiss the action without the relevant information .", "CARDINAL . By a partial judgment of DATE , the ORG considered that a specialised medical examination was indeed necessary to determine the connection , if any , between the applicant \u2019s infirmity and his military service . It ordered that such an examination be carried out by ORG ( Collegio Medico Legale della PERSON \u2013 the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , by means of a medical assessment in the presence of the applicant \u2019s general practitioner , and that a report be submitted within DATE . It appears from the documents that ORG appointed for the applicant \u2019s case was made up of CARDINAL full members , CARDINAL from the military and CARDINAL from ORG , and an external expert in neurology .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG report was filed . Its findings took into consideration a report produced DATE by an expert engaged by the applicant which he had been allowed to submit to ORG ( before being submitted to the ORG ) . ORG report noted that when the applicant was discharged he had been suffering from dysphoria , anxiety disorder and borderline personality disorder and had been considered to suffer from slight intellectual disability . It confirmed the reports submitted by ORG and highlighted the relevance of the preexisting nature of the applicant \u2019s condition , also noting that upon examination by ORG on DATE and at the date of the report in DATE the applicant had been suffering from \u201c chronic ORG , a slight degree of intellectual disability , displayed personality changes and was prone to have marginal traits \u201d . It concluded that at the date of review , according to the information available , the infirmity could not be considered to have been the direct result of or aggravated by ordinary military service .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the report of CARDINAL DATE prepared by the applicant \u2019s expert ( PERSON ) was filed with the court . It noted that the applicant , a mentally healthy subject upon undergoing medical assessments prior to being drafted , had never shown any symptoms of mental illness before conscription into the military service and it was only after repeated punishment that such traits had emerged . Therefore , even assuming that he was predisposed to mental health problems , it was evident that it was the treatment he had been subjected to during military service that had caused the emergence of the illness . The implications of military service were generally of great emotional impact and a source of stress , which for a person who was in a fragile state of mental health or predisposed to mental health problems , unlike in the case of a healthy person , could trigger mental illness . The applicant \u2019s being away from his family and his inability to relate to colleagues and superiors , in the absence of the necessary psychological support and in view of the repeated punishments imposed on him , had caused him to develop dysphoria which had later evolved into chronic ORG . Thus , in the applicant \u2019s case there had been a causal link between his mental health problems and his military service , or the latter had at least contributed to the development of his condition .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed pleadings contesting the findings of ORG and arguing that its report could not be considered objective and impartial given its nature and composition , as it was an organ of the opposing party in the proceedings . He argued that there had been a lack of transparency in the production of the report , which was highlighted by the fact that he had recently become aware of other documents related to the case which had never been disclosed to him by the authorities , the substance of which had been reflected in the report . On DATE the applicant made further oral pleadings .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment filed in the relevant registry on CARDINAL DATE the ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal , holding that the applicant \u2019s infirmity was antecedent to his military service and that it had not been detectible during the examination in DATE , as had been established by ORG . As to the failure to disclose documentation , it considered that such documentation did not relate to the period during which the applicant had carried out military service . In any event the crux of the applicant \u2019s complaint had concerned the conclusions of ORG report which did not accord with his claim . However , the ORG considered that the report was not contradictory or illogical in itself and it had not ignored relevant facts . It followed that given that the ORG ( in its limited powers of judicial review of administrative acts ) ( in sede di legittimit\u00e0 ) was not allowed to assess the merits of that report , the applicant \u2019s challenge could not be upheld . In respect of the original medical examination to determine the applicant \u2019s fitness for military service , the ORG again adopted the findings of ORG , which had considered that it was possible that the applicant \u2019s health problems had not manifested themselves in the absence of particular stimuli ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["3", "6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
