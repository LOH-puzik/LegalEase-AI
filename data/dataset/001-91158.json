THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "2", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall", "TEXT": ["The applicant , ORG , is a NORP national who was born in DATE and lives in Vlijmen . She was represented before the ORG by Ms T. Spronken , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant was arrested , held in custody and subsequently in pre - trial detention ( voorlopige hechtenis ) on suspicion of murder . She was subsequently summoned to appear before the \u2018 sHertogenbosch ORG ( rechtbank ) in order to stand trial . The order for her pre - trial detention was duly prolonged , for the last time on DATE when the \u2018 s - ORG sitting in chambers ( raadkamer ) extended by DATE the order for the applicant \u2019s further detention on remand ( gevangenhouding ) .", "The applicant \u2019s trial started on DATE before the \u2018 s - ORG , which decided to adjourn the examination in court until DATE . On DATE , ORG fully recommenced its examination as its composition had changed in the meantime . It further decided to adjourn for an unspecified period its examination in court of the applicant \u2019s case .", "By letter of CARDINAL DATE , the Acting President of the \u2018 sHertogenbosch ORG informed the applicant that , due to a misunderstanding , CARDINAL member of the threejudge section of ORG having considered the applicant \u2019s case on DATE was a judge in training , assigned temporarily to the \u2018 s - ORG and who apparently had not yet been officially appointed and sworn in as a deputy judge ( rechter - plaatsvervanger ) before taking up her position in \u2018 s - Hertogenbosch . The applicant was further informed that a fresh hearing would be scheduled as soon as practically possible .", "On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed a request to lift the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention with immediate effect .", "On DATE , the \u2018 s - ORG sitting in chambers lifted the order for the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention and ordered her immediate release . It considered that , although it lacked competence to pronounce the nullity of the trial proceedings conducted on DATE and could only determine the validity of the legal basis for the applicant \u2019s ongoing pre - trial detention , it was rather obvious that the competent forum would pronounce that nullity . In this light , it concluded that article CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of LAW found no application and that the delay referred to in article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON ; \u201c ORG \u201d ) had expired . As this thus risked giving rise to uncertainty about the applicant \u2019s legal position , ORG \u2013 for the sake of clarity DATE lifted the order for the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention and ordered her immediate release . On DATE , the public prosecutor filed an appeal against the decision to lift the pre - trial order .", "On DATE , the \u2018 s - ORG ( gerechtshof ) accepted the prosecutor \u2019s appeal , quashed the decision of CARDINAL DATE and rejected a request filed during the hearing before ORG to lift the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention . It rejected the applicant \u2019s argument that , pursuant to article CARDINAL of the ORG , her pre - trial detention should be regarded as having become unlawful on DATE as the court hearing of CARDINAL DATE was ipso iure null and void . ORG considered that such ipso iure nullity would only arise if that hearing had been held before a non - judicial body , which was not the situation in the case at hand . The hearing of DATE was one in a series of hearings before and decisions taken by the \u2018 s - ORG in the applicant \u2019s case under the provisions of the ORG . This was not altered by the fact that the hearing of DATE was flawed as CARDINAL member of the threejudge section of ORG did not have the status of judge . As the hearing of DATE was not ipso iure null and void , it could not be concluded that the legal basis for the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention had become extinct DATE after DATE . This legal basis remained article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG . ORG acknowledged that the composition of the CARDINAL - judge section at issue was very seriously flawed and that this raised the question whether this flaw had a bearing on the legal basis for the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention . After an examination of the statutory system concerning the rules on pre - trial detention , it concluded that there remained a legal basis for the applicant \u2019s pre - trial detention , namely article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the ORG , given that DATE had not yet elapsed since DATE . It further decided , after having noted that it was intended to hold a fresh trial hearing on DATE before ORG , that the applicant \u2019s interest in being released from pre - trial detention was outweighed by general interest considerations . No further appeal lay against this decision , of which the applicant was notified on DATE .", "A pre - trial detention order issued by ORG remains in force until DATE after the final judgment ( einduitspraak ) at that instance has been given ( article CARDINAL \u00a7 QUANTITY of the ORG \u201d ) . For the purposes of limiting the application and duration of pre - trial detention , article CARDINAL of the ORG regulates the duration of suspensions of trial proceedings . This provision reads in its relevant part :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the defendant is being held in pre - trial detention , the following paragraphs shall apply [ in relation to suspensions of trial proceedings ] .", "CARDINAL . If ORG suspends the examination in court ( onderzoek op de terechtzitting ) for a specific period , the period of suspension shall as a rule not exceed DATE . However , if there are compelling grounds , it may set a longer period but in no case DATE .", "CARDINAL . If ORG suspends examination in court sine die , it shall determine by analogous application of the second paragraph a maximum period within which the examination in court must be resumed .... \u201d", "An overview with further details of the relevant domestic law and practice in respect of pre - trial detention can be found in the ORG \u2019s decision on admissibility in the case of ORG v. the GPE ( no .
