The details concerning the applicants may be found in the LOC .", "CARDINAL . In DATE these CARDINAL applicants , who were in a committed stable relationship with each other , declared their intention to marry , and requested ORG of ORG to issue the relevant marriage banns .", "CARDINAL . On DATE their request was rejected .", "CARDINAL . NORP The CARDINAL applicants challenged the decision before ORG ( in accordance with LAW ) . They argued that NORP law did not explicitly prohibit marriage between persons of the same sex , and that , even if that were the case , such a position would be unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . By a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected their claim . It noted that the LAW did not establish the requirements to contract marriage , but LAW did and it precisely provided that CARDINAL such requirement was that spouses be of the opposite sex . Thus , a marriage between persons of the same sex lacked one of the most essential requirements to render it a valid legal act , namely a difference in sex between the parties . In any event there was no fundamental right to marry , neither could the limited law provisions constitute discrimination , since the limitations suffered by the applicants were the same as those applied to everyone . Furthermore , it noted that ORG ( \u201c GPE \u201d ) law left such rights to be regulated within the national order .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG . While the court reiterated the unanimous interpretation given to NORP law in the field , namely to the effect that ordinary law , particularly LAW , did not allow marriage between people of the same sex , it considered it relevant to make a referral to ORG in connection with the claims of unconstitutionality of the law in force .", "CARDINAL . ORG in judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE declared inadmissible the applicants\u2019 constitutional challenge to Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL , DATE , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL , CARDINAL bis and CARDINAL of the NORP Civil Code , as it was directed to the obtainment of additional norms not provided for by LAW ( diretta ad ottenere una pronunzia additiva non costituzionalmente obbligata ) .", "CARDINAL . The Constitutional Court considered Article CARDINAL of LAW , which provided that the GPE recognises and guarantees the inviolable rights of the person , as an individual and in social groups where personality is expressed , as well as the duties of political , economic and social solidarity against which there was no derogation . It noted that by social group one had to understand any form of community , simple or complex , intended to enable and encourage the free development of any individual by means of relationships . Such a notion included homosexual unions , understood as a stable cohabitation of CARDINAL people of the same sex , who have a fundamental right to freely express their personality in a couple , obtaining DATE in time and by the means and limits to be set by law \u2013 juridical recognition of the relevant rights and duties . However , this recognition , which necessarily requires general legal regulation aimed at setting out the rights and duties of the partners in a couple , could be achieved in other ways apart from the institution of marriage between homosexuals . As shown by the different systems in LOC , the question of the type of recognition was left to regulation by ORG , in the exercise of its full discretion . Nevertheless , ORG clarified that without prejudice to ORG \u2019s discretion , it could however intervene according to the principle of equality in specific situations related to a homosexual couple \u2019s fundamental rights , where the same treatment of married couples and homosexual couples was called for . The court would in such cases assess the reasonableness of the measures .", "CARDINAL . It went on to consider that it was true that the concepts of family and marriage could not be considered \u201c crystallised \u201d in reference to the moment when the LAW came into effect , given that constitutional principles must be interpreted bearing in mind changes in the legal order and the evolution of society and its customs . Nevertheless , such an interpretation could not be extended to the point where it affected the very essence of legal norms , modifying them in such a way as to include phenomena and problems which had not been considered in any way when it was enacted . In fact it appeared from the preparatory work to LAW that the question of homosexual unions had not been debated by the assembly , despite the fact that homosexuality was not unknown . In drafting LAW of the LAW , the assembly had discussed an institution with a precise form and an articulate discipline provided for by LAW . Thus , in the absence of any such reference , it was inevitable to conclude that what had been considered was the notion of marriage as defined in LAW , which came into effect in DATE and which at the time , and still DATE , established that spouses had to be of the opposite sex . Therefore , the meaning of this constitutional precept could not be altered by a creative interpretation . In consequence , the constitutional norm did not extend to homosexual unions , and was intended to refer to marriage in its traditional sense .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the court considered that , in respect of LAW regarding the principle of equality , the relevant legislation did not create unreasonable discrimination , given that homosexual unions could not be considered equivalent to marriage . Even Article CARDINAL of LAW and LAW did not require full equality between homosexual unions and marriages between a man and a woman , as this was a matter of NORP discretion to be regulated by national law , as evidenced by the different approaches existing in LOC .", "CARDINAL . In consequence of the above judgment , by a decision ( ordinanza ) lodged in the relevant registry on DATE ORG rejected the ORG claims in full .", "CARDINAL .
