THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-3-d - Examination of witnesses)", "JUDGES": "Corneliu B\u00eersan;Egbert Myjer;J\u00e1n \u0160ikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Nona Tsotsoria", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and , as far as the ORG is aware , lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( rechtbank ) found the applicant guilty of being a co - perpetrator of the offence of transporting a shipment of tablets containing a psychotropic substance the trade of which is illegal in all countries concerned , namely CARDINAL,CARDINAL-methylenedioxy - N - methylamphetamine ( \u201c MDMA \u201d for short , known in its street pill form as \u201c ecstasy \u201d or \u201c XTC \u201d \u2013 the latter designation will be used in this judgment hereafter ) from the GPE to GPE with the intention of ultimately shipping it to GPE . According to the judgment , the ORG was to be hidden in the cylinders and crankcases of motor car engines that would then be shipped to a business , PERSON , in GPE , GPE , which company had been set up by the applicant with a view to importing engine parts from LOC . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings against the applicant were held separately from the proceedings against his co - accused , amongst whom were PERSON and the applicant \u2019s father , PERSON . The suspects PERSON and PERSON were in fact put on trial in GPE . On DATE they were convicted and given prison sentences by ORG ( Landgericht ) of GPE in GPE for their part in the crimes . They had both made full confessions and given detailed statements to the NORP prosecutors , a fact that was taken into account in sentencing .", "CARDINAL . At no point throughout the criminal proceedings against him did the applicant deny that he had been involved in shipping motor car engines to his business in GPE . However , he denied all knowledge of the use of those engines to smuggle ORG and hence any criminal intent directed towards that end . His defence was focused on this point .", "CARDINAL . Virtually all the evidence presented before ORG to prove the applicant \u2019s intent and participation in committing the offence was taken from the statements given by PERSON to the NORP prosecutors and later on to GPE police investigators during the pre - trial stage of the proceedings against the applicant . Particular weight was given to statements PERSON had made with regard to a handwritten note , found in his dwelling , which contained the address of PERSON in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant had repeatedly requested to be allowed to question PERSON since neither he nor his counsel had been present when PERSON had given these statements . At a hearing on DATE ORG noted that both parties had , in the meantime , been to GPE to question the witnesses PERSON and NORP The applicant however specified that the NORP investigating judge had done all the questioning and that he himself had not been able to put any questions to the witnesses . It also appeared that PERSON had refused to answer questions or repeat the statements he had made previously . Furthermore , the prosecutor stated that there had appeared to be a problem with the interpreter assisting the witness PERSON The applicant requested further questioning of the witnesses so that he would actually be able to put his own questions to them .", "CARDINAL . At the same hearing ORG decided that the statements given to the NORP prosecutor by PERSON and PERSON would be added to the case file together with the records of their NORP trial .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , ORG , finding that the applicant had been able to put questions to PERSON twice ( though without specifying when or where ) , considered that the use in evidence of the statements given by PERSON in GPE did not violate the provisions of LAW . The fact that PERSON had chosen to avail himself of his right not to testify did not alter this situation . ORG also found that PERSON \u2019s statements were sufficiently supported by other evidence to be allowed to serve as the basis for the applicant \u2019s conviction .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment of ORG with ORG ( gerechtshof ) . At a hearing on DATE , ORG granted the applicant \u2019s request for PERSON to be summoned to appear before the court so that they could be heard , given the importance of their statements .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and PERSON were both questioned as witnesses at a hearing before ORG . A. stated that he knew the applicant but in general denied ever having talked to him about the XTC . On more specific questions he invoked his right not to testify ( verschoningsrecht ) . A. also declared that everything PERSON had stated was a lie .", "CARDINAL . M. acknowledged that he had been questioned by GPE police investigators and admitted that he had been convicted of perjury DATE . He refused however to answer any substantive questions , invoking his right not to testify in connection with pending proceedings for his extradition to the GPE to stand trial on a charge of participation in a criminal organisation .", "CARDINAL . In his closing argument the applicant \u2019s counsel submitted that none of the evidence presented disclosed the applicant \u2019s intention to commit or participate in the commission of the criminal offence , save only the statement made by PERSON The applicant \u2019s counsel argued , with reference to the ORG \u2019s case - law ( including PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL ) , that ORG had based its judgment solely or to a decisive extent on statements made by a witness whom the applicant had not been able to question , thus violating his right to a fair trial under LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal . It considered that the mere fact of PERSON \u2019s refusal at the hearing to answer any substantive questions did not constitute a violation of the applicant \u2019s right to have witnesses against him examined . The court noted that PERSON had initially made a confession to the GPE police investigators and had given a full account of events , including about the involvement and extent of participation of his fellow perpetrators . In the course of interviews held at a later stage and at the hearing before ORG on DATE , PERSON had invoked his right not to testify . The court noted , however , that PERSON had not invoked this right in respect of all questions put to him . Thus , he had in any event confirmed that he had indeed said what had been noted down by the GPE police investigators . The question nevertheless arose whether in these circumstances PERSON \u2019s confessions could be used as evidence in the criminal proceedings against the applicant . For that to be the case , it was required that these statements be largely corroborated by other items of evidence relating to elements which were disputed by the applicant and in respect of which he had wanted to put questions to the witness M.", "CARDINAL . ORG reasoning included the following :", "\u201c The defence has argued \u2013 in substance \u2013 that PERSON \u2019s initial statements to the police can not be admitted as evidence because he subsequently withdrew them and because the defence has had insufficient opportunity to question PERSON as a witness because DATE in connection with criminal proceedings pending against him in the GPE ... he had , at the hearing of DATE , repeatedly invoked the right not to testify .", "The court finds as follows as regards the reliability of the witness and fellow suspect PERSON and the right of the defence to question him . Initially , PERSON made a confession and gave a complete description of the facts , also relating to the involvement and participation of his fellow suspects . Later , questioned under letters rogatory and at the hearing of this court on DATE , PERSON invoked his right not to testify . PERSON \u2019s refusal to testify at the hearing does not , in itself , violate the right of the defence to question him . In any case , PERSON has not invoked his right not to testify in response to all the questions put and he has at least confirmed that he has made to the GPE investigators the statement which they set down on paper . The question remains , however , to what extent in these circumstances the earlier confessions made by PERSON can and may be admitted as evidence in the present criminal case . For that , it will be required that these statements be largely corroborated ( in belangrijke mate worden bevestigd ) by other evidence on those aspects which [ the applicant ] contests and about which he would have wished to question the witness .", "The court notes that the suspects PERSON and PERSON were sentenced to imprisonment for DATE and DATE , respectively , for the illegal import and the illegal trade in psychotropic substances by the Landgericht of GPE . In arriving at a conviction , the NORP court has , in its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ... , held as follows concerning A. :", "\u2018 ... In this connection ... it has to be noted in the suspect \u2019s favour that he made a complete confession at the trial , which made it easier especially for the suspect PERSON to repeat at the hearing the confession which he had already made already following his arrest , which moreover was thus confirmed . This chamber holds in favour of the suspect A. that he has made his confession in spite of a concrete threat to his person and his family by the people in the background of this drugs deal . A. \u2019s confession additionally has the effect of LAW of the [ NORP ] GPE , ... The statement of the suspect PERSON , which has already led to considerable success in clearing up this case and also in the GPE investigation , is strengthened ( bekrachtigd ) by the additional and confirming statement of the suspect A. ... \u2019", "In sentencing PERSON , the NORP court has held as follows :", "\u2018 Because , as in the case of the suspect A. , the primary standard sentence of DATE imprisonment ... must be mitigated ... pursuant to section CARDINAL of the [ NORP ] Narcotics Act . It must , however , be counted considerably in favour of the suspect PERSON that he has made a complete confession at an early stage of the investigation , although his family and he himself have received specific threats . This confession is also inspired by contrition and insight ... \u201d", "At this court \u2019s hearing of DATE M. first stated that there had been a deal in his case and afterwards that there had never been any mention of a deal . On this ground , the court finds \u2013 contrary to what the defence has argued DATE that it is not established that there was a deal agreed between PERSON as suspect and the NORP prosecution service to make statements incriminating ( also ) his fellow suspects in exchange for a reduction of sentence . Conversely , the NORP court gave reasons for applying the mitigating factor contained in DATE of the [ NORP ] GPE . PERSON \u2019s confessions are also corroborated by the statement of ORG and even extended despite threats to his person and family . This reinforces the credibility of PERSON \u2019s confessions . The court does not give credence to the suggestion that A. had no choice , in view of the procedural attitude adopted by PERSON , but to make a confession of his own , the less so since in so doing he has broadened PERSON \u2019s statements .", "At the court \u2019s hearing of DATE , PERSON stated that he had not felt at liberty to make [ his own ] statements before the NORP court and that the statements which he had made before the GPE investigators had been put into his mouth after they had driven him crazy by raising the case of PERSON , whom he had known well . The court does not , however , consider it likely that PERSON did not make his confessions in complete freedom and in so doing takes into account what the NORP court found in its criminal judgment concerning the way in which PERSON had made his statements at the hearing in GPE and the fact that this statement confirmed what PERSON had earlier stated before the GPE investigators . In contrast , this court \u2019s own observation at the hearing has given it the impression that PERSON did not feel at liberty to make a true statement or in any case to confirm what he had earlier stated before the GPE investigators and the NORP criminal judge without further incriminating himself in view of the prosecution for which the GPE public prosecutor has requested his extradition . The court sees no circumstances on the basis of which it should be doubted that the statements initially taken from PERSON by the GPE investigators had lawfully come about ; nor has the defence asked for the GPE investigators concerned who questioned PERSON to be called as witnesses . Finally , the statements of both PERSON are supported in various stake - outs and the recordings of private communication ( opnemen van vertrouwelijke communicatie , \u2018 OVC\u2019s\u2019 ) .", "Considering the connection with ORG \u2019s confession before the NORP court and the other items of evidence the court concludes that PERSON \u2019s statement about the involvement of [ the applicant ] in the facts charged ... is sufficiently corroborated by other evidence and can therefore be admitted as evidence by the court . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
