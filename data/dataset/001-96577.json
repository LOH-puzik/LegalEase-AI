On DATE she filed a request with ORG to be granted a legal - aid lawyer for the purpose of lodging a cassation appeal . Her request was subsequently forwarded to ORG as the PERSON court lacked jurisdiction to deal with it . The request was allowed by a decision of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the decision of CARDINAL DATE was served on ORG . At the same time ORG informed the Bar about the date on which the applicant had been served with the second - instance judgment .", "On DATE ORG informed the applicant that a legal - aid lawyer had been assigned to her case .

The letter read :", "\u201c Having examined the file in detail , I have not found grounds for lodging a cassation appeal . The judgment given on DATE by ORG did not breach any provisions of substantive law . Nor were any provisions of procedural laws violated during the proceedings .", "The findings of fact made by the courts show without any ambiguity that the applicant had never had the right to a co - operative apartment which could be assimilated to ownership . She had admitted , both before the first - instance and the appellate court , that at the time of the exchange of apartments she had been aware that her right was only assimilable to the rights arising out of a rental contract . ( ... ) It had been open to her to take steps in order to have her right transformed into an ownership - like right , but she had not done so . Hence , the first instance court was right in finding that the defendant housing co - operative was not obliged to pay compensation to the applicant . The appellate court accepted these findings . In these circumstances , a cassation appeal would not offer any prospects of success . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested ORG to assign a new legal - aid lawyer to her case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the court informed the applicant that she should file a request with ORG for a new lawyer to be appointed . On DATE the applicant accordingly submitted her request to the local ORG .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of DATE ORG dismissed the request , having found that the applicant 's previous legalaid lawyer had been entitled to refuse to draft a cassation complaint .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant again requested the court to assign a legalaid lawyer to the case . On DATE the ORG informed the applicant that the refusal to lodge a cassation appeal could not justify assigning a new lawyer for the same purpose .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a court should give all necessary procedural instructions to a party acting without a lawyer and , in particular , should indicate the consequences of that party 's acts or failures to act .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a party to the proceedings may ask the court competent to deal with the case to grant him or her an exemption from court fees provided that he submits a declaration to the effect that the fees required would entail a substantial reduction in his and his family 's standard of living .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to Article CARDINAL of the Code , persons exempted from court fees may request that legal aid be granted to them . The court will then request the relevant ORG or ORG to assign an advocate or a legal adviser to the claimant 's case .", "CARDINAL . At the material time a party to civil proceedings could lodge a cassation appeal with ORG against a final judicial decision of a secondinstance court which terminated the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Under Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure a cassation appeal had to be lodged with the court that had given the relevant decision within DATE from the date on which the decision with its written grounds was served on the party concerned . Cassation appeals which were not lodged by an advocate or a legal adviser would be rejected .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW of DATE , as amended , reads , insofar as relevant :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The Bar is established to provide legal assistance , co - operate in protecting a person 's rights and freedoms as well as to formulate and apply the law .", "CARDINAL . The Bar is organized as a self - governing association .", "CARDINAL . An advocate whilst executing his / her professional duties is accountable only to the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW provides as follows :", "\u201c The general tasks of the professional ORG are as follows :", "CARDINAL ) creation of conditions for the statutory performance of the Bar 's tasks ,", "CARDINAL ) representation of the LOC and protection of its rights ,", "CARDINAL ) supervision over the observance of the rules regulating the practice of the profession ,", "CARDINAL ) development of professional skills and training of advocates ,", "CARDINAL ) determination and promotion of professional ethics and ensuring their observance ,", "CARDINAL ) management ( ... ) of the Bar 's assets . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the LAW reads :", "\u201c CARDINAL . An advocate may only refuse to provide legal assistance for important reasons of which he must notify the interested party . Any doubts as to whether to provide legal assistance or refuse to do so shall be resolved by the local ORG , and in situations where time is of the essence , by the PERSON of that ORG .", "CARDINAL . In cases where legal assistance is granted on the basis legal regulations concerning legal aid , only the entity appointing the advocate to represent the client may decide to relieve him or her from providing legal assistance . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of the LAW , an advocate shall provide legal aid services in the jurisdiction of a court where he or she has their office .", "CARDINAL . Lawyers are bound to act in accordance with rules of professional and ethical conduct enacted by ORG . They may be held accountable for professional misconduct or a breach of ethical principles in the proceedings before the bar disciplinary court .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW adopted by ORG on DATE , when an advocate , either privately hired by the client or appointed under the legalaid scheme , considers that submission of an appeal in a case offers no reasonable prospect of success and the client disagrees with his or her view , the lawyer shall give notice of termination of the power of attorney , terminate the representation , or notify the refusal to the body which appointed him or her .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG issued a resolution in reply to a legal question whether a legalaid lawyer could refuse to lodge a cassation appeal . It replied to the question in the positive .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that issues involved in the grant of legal aid concerned not only the proper administration of justice , but also touched on human rights , and the right of access to a court in particular . Nevertheless , there was no comprehensive and coherent regulation of legal aid available under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . The mere fact that it was necessary for a cassation appeal to be lodged by a qualified representative was not open to criticism . However , a certain conceptual confusion was to be noted in the provisions governing legal aid as a whole , mostly because the legislator had failed to harmonise the relevant provisions of civil and criminal procedure . In particular , the scope of legalaid lawyers ' obligations when legal representation was mandatory was not directly addressed by provisions of civil procedure .", "CARDINAL . As a result , the scope of legalaid lawyers ' obligations to provide a party to the proceedings with \u201c legal aid \u201d in civil proceedings was unclear . In particular , the provisions on lawyers ' legalaid obligations in connection with cassation proceedings before ORG lacked clarity . The application of the relevant provisions had given rise to serious difficulties of interpretation and discrepancies in the case - law of the NORP courts .", "CARDINAL . The court observed that the issue of the possible conflict between the opinion of a party granted legal aid and a lawyer assigned to represent him or her for the purpose of cassation proceedings had not been directly addressed by the applicable law . The notion of legal assistance could not be identified with a simple obligation of a lawyer to act in accordance with the client 's wishes . The role of a legalaid lawyer had rather to be understood as obliging him or her to provide legal advice to the party , including as to the prospects of success offered by a cassation appeal against a given judgment .", "CARDINAL . The constitutional role of ORG , the highest judicial authority , was also an argument in favour of the conclusion that a legalaid lawyer was not compelled by the will of the party to have a cassation appeal lodged if such an appeal was bound to fail . In case of a disagreement between the party and the lawyer , it was open to the party to complain to the local Bar under LAW . The Bar could then appoint a new lawyer who could lodge a cassation appeal , requesting at the same time to be granted leave to appeal out of time under LAW . It was true that the practice of ORG was not coherent in that in some cases it had rejected such requests and in others it had accepted them . However , it did not prevent the parties from having recourse to this course of action .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , a party to the proceedings may ask for retrospective leave to perform a procedural measure outside the prescribed time - limit ; this measure shall be performed simultaneously with the lodging of the request .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Code of Civil Procedure reads , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c If a legal representative ... has been appointed in a case , the court correspondence shall be served on [ him or her ] .", "CARDINAL . However , in a number of decisions the civil courts have held that the running of the time - limit for lodging a cassation appeal is not affected in any way by a request for legal aid submitted by a hitherto non - represented party and its subsequent grant or refusal . That time - limit starts to run on the date when the party was served with the judgment of the appellate court together with its written grounds , also where the request for legal aid has subsequently been granted ( ORG decisions of DATE , II CZ CARDINAL ; DATE , I PKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , NORP UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , II UKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , I CKN CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE ; II UZ CARDINAL ; DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , II UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ; DATE , ORG , DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG has repeatedly held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the timelimit could be admitted for examination ( DATE , PERSON ; DATE , II UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In a further series of decisions ORG considered that it would be unfair for the legally - aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within DATE counted from DATE of service of the judgment on the party . A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within DATE from the date on which the lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal ( DATE , II UZ CARDINAL ; DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by the local bar association ( DATE , PERSON ; CARDINAL DATE , II UZ DATE ; CARDINAL DATE , PERSON ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
