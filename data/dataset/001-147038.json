They hit her on the head and threatened to rape her , and then handcuffed her and pushed her to the floor . They put a hat on her head and pulled it down over her eyes . They also threw a coat over her . They punched her in the solar plexus and the stomach , and pulled her by the legs .

In addition , the medical examination conducted revealed that they had sustained injuries . However , in the course of the investigation ... the [ defendants\u2019 ] statements were obtained in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure . The [ defendants\u2019 ] allegations should be considered with criticism . They are charged with serious offences . They have not pleaded guilty and wish to evade criminal liability .

He further relied on statements made by the police officers involved in the applicant \u2019s arrest and questioning , who denied having beaten or tortured her . He summarised his findings as follows :", "\u201c The analysis of the collected material shows that the [ applicant \u2019s ] allegations of illtreatment are not confirmed by objective information and are refuted by the explanations provided by the police officers and investigators from the town prosecutor \u2019s office . [ The applicant ] complained of ill - treatment after a considerable length of time , and only when she was charged with serious offences , even though nothing had precluded her from communicating her complaint to the investigator who had questioned her in the presence of a lawyer or during the inspection of the crime scene or subsequent questionings , etc . Furthermore , when admitted to the temporary detention facility , [ the applicant ] did not complain of her injuries allegedly inflicted by police officers . In the absence of a forensic medical examination , it is impossible to determine that [ the applicant ] sustained the injuries , the degree of their severity , the time of their infliction , or their cause . Regard being had to the above , it should be concluded that the [ applicant \u2019s ] allegations of ill - treatment should be considered with criticism and viewed as an attempt by [ the applicant ] to avoid criminal liability for the serious crimes committed . Such a conclusion is substantiated by the [ applicant \u2019s ] conviction by ORG ... [ Her ] allegations of ill - treatment were subject to verification by the court , which ruled [ that there was ] no case to answer against the police officers and investigators from the prosecutor \u2019s office , who had not abused their powers or infringed the [ applicant \u2019s ] rights in contravention of the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL .
