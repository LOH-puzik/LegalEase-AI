It considered that the evidence furnished in support of the request for the applicant 's extradition was sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion and that in the absence of any exceptional circumstances it was not necessary to examine this question more in depth . ORG held that it was not for it to determine the question of the applicant 's guilt in respect of the charges brought against him in GPE , but only to examine whether the formal extradition requirements had been fulfilled . It noted that the applicant was charged with offences which were punishable under the laws of both Contracting Parties by deprivation of liberty for a maximum period exceeding DATE .
