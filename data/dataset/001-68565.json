ORG ( PERSON s\u00fad ) upheld the decision on appeal .", "On numerous subsequent occasions applicants again turned to the ORG claiming repayment of the withheld salary plus penalty interests . Invoking the above judicial decisions the applicants demanded that the Director determine the matter by a formal decision and insisted that the repayment be made directly to them .", "In DATE the ORG transferred an amount of money equal to the withheld salary to the ORG . In substance this amount was identical to the paid allowance . In DATE the ORG returned to the applicants the part of the paid allowance which they had already repaid in the meantime .", "The ORG also later paid to the applicants PERSON and PERSON the costs of the enforcement of their debt to the ORG .", "LAW CARDINAL governs the administrative judiciary .
