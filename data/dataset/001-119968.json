ORG recommended , in particular , that member States should penalise serious violence against women such as sexual violence and rape , abuse of the vulnerability of pregnant , defenceless , ill , disabled or dependent victims , as well as penalising abuse of position by the perpetrator . The Recommendation also stated that member States should ensure that all victims of violence are able to institute proceedings , make provisions to ensure that criminal proceedings can be initiated by the public prosecutor , encourage prosecutors to regard violence against women as an aggravating or decisive factor in deciding whether or not to prosecute in the public interest , ensure where necessary that measures are taken to protect victims effectively against threats and possible acts of revenge and take specific measures to ensure that children \u2019s rights are protected during proceedings .", "CARDINAL .

In her report concerning the visit to GPE from DATE ( document ORG , CARDINAL DATE ) , ORG on violence against women , its causes and consequences noted , inter alia :", "\u201c ... patriarchal and discriminatory attitudes are increasing women \u2019s vulnerability to violence and abuse . In this context , domestic violence in particular is widespread , largely condoned by society and does not receive appropriate recognition among officials , society and women themselves , thus resulting in insufficient protective infrastructure for victims of violence . ...", "... CARDINAL . Moldovan women suffer from all forms of violence . However , domestic violence and trafficking are major areas of concern . The CARDINAL are intimately connected and are linked to women \u2019s overall subordinate position in society . ...", "CARDINAL . While reliable data and a systematic registering of cases on the nature and extent of the phenomenon is lacking , domestic violence is said to be widespread . According to a Ministry of Labour , ORG and Family report : \u201c [ ... ] At present , the frequency of domestic violence , whose victims are women and children , is acquiring alarming proportions . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for the ORG to control domestic violence since in most of the cases it is reported only when there are severe consequences of the violence , the other cases being considered just family conflicts .", "CARDINAL . NORP Despite this acknowledgement , unless it results in serious injury , domestic violence is not perceived as a problem warranting legal intervention . As a result , it is experienced in silence and receives little recognition among officials , society and women themselves .", "CARDINAL . According to a survey conducted in DATE , CARDINAL per cent of women interviewed reported encountering some form of violence within the family at least once during their lifetime . The survey revealed that psychological violence , followed by physical violence , is the most widely reported form of abuse in the family . CARDINAL of the women interviewed indicated having been subjected to multiple forms of violence . The study notes that domestic violence runs across lines of class and education ; however , women with a higher level of education or economic status may tend not to disclose incidents of violence . Sexual violence remains the least reported form of violence . This may be due to lack of recognition of sexual abuse within the family as a wrongdoing or the fear among victims that they will be held responsible and become outcasts .", "CARDINAL . The perpetrators of violence against women are often family members , overwhelmingly husbands or former husbands ( CARDINAL per cent ) , followed by fathers or stepfathers ( MONEY ) and mothers or stepmothers ( MONEY ) . Staff at the shelter in GPE indicated that husbands of many of the women who seek help at the shelter are either police officers or from the military , which makes it far more difficult for these women to escape the violent environment and seek divorce . ...", "CARDINAL . There are also a number of widely held misconceptions about violence against women which treat the problem as isolated cases concerning a particular group . These misconceptions are : ( a ) violence against women is a phenomenon that takes place in poor and broken homes ; ( b ) victims of violence are inherently vulnerable women needing special protection ; ( c ) violent men are deviants who use alcohol and drugs or have personality disorders ; ( d ) domestic violence involves all members of the household , including men . It has been my experience that such misunderstandings often result in misguided and partial solutions , such as rehabilitation programmes for abusers , restrictions over women in order to protect them or gender neutral solutions that overlook the causes of gender - based violence . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["14", "3", "8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
