SLOVAKIA", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression-{general} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression)", "JUDGES": "Alena Pol\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1;Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Helen Keller;Helena J\u00e4derblom;Luis L\u00f3pez Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant company was established in DATE and has its registered office in GPE . It is the operator of CARDINAL private television channels and the broadcaster of a television programme , ORG . The present case concerns a commentary ( glosa ) delivered during a television programme broadcast on DATE after the crash of the plane in which the late President of GPE , PERSON , had been travelling .", "CARDINAL . The commentary \u2019s title was \u201c Compassion in Accordance with LAW \u201d ; the commentary contained the following :", "\u201c The crash of a NORP plane carrying the presidential couple on board is a true human tragedy . The whole of GPE is in mourning and politicians are more or less expressing their condolences . That is required by diplomatic protocol . Thus , NORP russophile politicians too shed a tear , albeit a forced one , over the death of the russophobe , PERSON . Even ordinary citizens , not bound by any protocol , are expressing their sorrow . NORP , homosexuals , liberals , feminists and leftoriented intellectuals are bitterly sorry for the death of a man who represented an extreme NORP conservativism , and who was a symbol of a country where people who are not white heterosexual NORP were born as a punishment . I am sorry , but I do not pity NORP . I envy them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Following the broadcast of the above - mentioned commentary , ORG ( Rada pre vysielanie a retransmisiu ) commenced administrative proceedings against the applicant company , pursuant to section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of ORG no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL Coll . , as amended - \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found that the applicant company had breached its obligations under LAW in that the manner of processing and presenting the content of the commentary had interfered with the dignity of the late NORP President , PERSON . It fined the applicant company MONEY ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG assessed the conflict between the applicant company \u2019s freedom of expression and the protection of the human dignity of the late President . On the one hand , it acknowledged the aim of the commentator to express his opinion and his subjective stance on the social and political event through criticism , sarcasm and irony , which were inherent to journalistic expression . On the other hand , where ORG found difficulties was in particular the content of the last CARDINAL sentences of the commentary ( \u201c I am sorry , but I do not pity the NORP . I envy them \u201d ) . ORG concluded that the manner in which the commentator had presented his opinion \u2013 that is to say his lack of regret for the NORP President \u2019s death DATE had contravened the duty to respect his human dignity . According to ORG , the degree of sarcasm and irony in the broadcast commentary had been so high that its content and the manner in which the author \u2019s opinion had been presented had been substandard and had dishonoured the late President .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that Mr PERSON , as President , was sufficiently recognisable as an \u201c individual \u201d , which was a prerequisite for the applicability of the protection of the dignity , human rights and fundamental freedoms of \u201c others \u201d under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(a ) of LAW . It concluded that by broadcasting the aforesaid commentary the applicant company had committed an administrative offence ( spr\u00e1vny delikt ) \u2013 in particular a breach of its duties under the said provision \u2013 and that imposing a fine on it in that respect was in order . It considered such a measure to be necessary in a NORP society , as it served a legitimate aim \u2013 that is to say the protection of the right to human dignity .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . It rejected the applicant company \u2019s argument that ORG had sanctioned it for voicing its political opinion . Rather , ORG confirmed ORG conclusion about the defamatory character of the commentary in question and the interference with the late President \u2019s human dignity .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company lodged a complaint before the Constitutional Court challenging the decisions of ORG and ORG under Articles CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the Convention and Articles CARDINAL ( freedom of expression ) and CARDINAL ( right to judicial protection ) of the LAW .", "It alleged that the decisions in question had been arbitrary , unfair and insufficiently reasoned and that their respective authors had breached its freedom of expression by sanctioning it for voicing its opinion regarding the late President as a politician .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant company \u2019s complaint . It considered , inter alia , that the above - mentioned authorities had duly explained their conclusions , without having overly strayed from a reasonable interpretation of the applicable rules and established practice . ORG noted that the impugned commentary had expressed not only sarcasm and criticism of the late President \u2019s policy but also a positive attitude towards his death . This very fact had interfered with his right to respect for his human dignity , which led ORG to conclude that the domestic authorities\u2019 decisions had not been arbitrary .", "As to the applicant company \u2019s complaint under LAW ( and LAW ) , ORG held that a general court could not bear \u201c secondary liability \u201d for a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms of a substantive nature unless there had been a constitutionally relevant violation of procedural rules . Given that it had rejected the complaint concerning the alleged violation of procedural rules , it also had to reject the complaint relating to an alleged violation of a substantive provision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["10"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["10-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
