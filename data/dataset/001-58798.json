Both applicants are admitted heroin addicts . Prior to their being convicted and sentenced for drug offences they lived at CARDINAL ORG , a large block of council flats in GPE . Adjacent to their flat , at no . CARDINAL , lived a Mr PERSON . Mr PERSON was also charged with the same offences as the applicants , namely being concerned with the supply of heroin and possession of heroin with intent to supply , but was acquitted .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution case was that the applicants would prepare wraps ( individual sachets ) of heroin for sale and pass them to Mr PERSON when he knocked on the back window of their flat whenever he had a purchaser . The prosecution alleged that wraps would be handed from the balcony at flat DATE to someone leaning out of the back window of flat CARDINAL . Mr PERSON would then sell the wraps to visitors to his flat .", "CARDINAL . The applicants and Mr PERSON were observed from CARDINAL to DATE by police and recorded on video from DATE . The applicants were seen to pass various items to Mr PERSON including a plastic bottle for smoking crack cocaine and silver foil for smoking heroin . The prosecution stated that on DATE a man was seen at the back window of flat CARDINAL handing an object which looked like a cigarette packet to the second applicant who was on her balcony . She went into her flat , then re - emerged and returned the packet to the man .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were arrested at TIME on DATE . In the flat were found CARDINAL wraps of heroin weighing CARDINAL and a further quantity of heroin weighing QUANTITY The prosecution also alleged that a polythene sheet in the flat had been used to make wraps .", "CARDINAL . At TIME on DATE the applicants ' solicitor , Mr PERSON , noted that the first applicant , who seemed to be in the early stages of withdrawal , was unfit to be interviewed . However , after a CARDINAL- to CARDINAL-minute examination , ORG , PERSON , stated that the applicant was fit for interview . The doctor 's report notes that the first applicant was an opiates addict with symptoms and signs of withdrawal but that he was thinking clearly and able to answer questions . The second applicant was also seen to have withdrawal symptoms but again was stated by ORG to be thinking clearly and able to answer questions .", "CARDINAL . The transcript of the interviews with the first applicant reveals that Mr PERSON was concerned that his clients were unfit to be interviewed and in some distress . In particular , he had found it difficult to get the second applicant to concentrate on what he was saying to her .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were interviewed separately in the presence of their solicitor . Both applicants were told by the police :", "\u201c You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court . Anything you say may be given in evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants stated that they understood the warning . They were advised by the police that if during the interview they felt unwell they should say so and the interview would be stopped . At no stage during interview did either of the applicants request this , even though at CARDINAL point the first applicant 's solicitor specifically suggested that this might happen . However , the first applicant expressly stated that he did not want the interview to stop .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were asked to explain their actions in apparently passing to , and being passed items from , flat CARDINAL . Both simply responded to these questions with the words \u201c no comment \u201d .", "CARDINAL . From DATE to CARDINAL DATE the applicants were tried before a jury at ORG . Both applicants were legally aided and represented by counsel . In a pre - trial hearing counsel for the applicants argued that the interviews should not be put before the jury as they had been carried out whilst the applicants were suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms . Their solicitor , Mr PERSON , testified that he had been of the firm view that neither should embark upon what might prove to be a very lengthy interview given their condition . However , the judge noted that the doctor had considered them fit to be interviewed , that they were thinking clearly and able to answer questions , and that both applicants had stated in response to direct questions that they understood the charges against them and the possible repercussions of failing to answer questions . He therefore considered that Mr PERSON had been wrong in his analysis that the applicants had been unfit to be questioned and allowed their interviews to stand as evidence . The judge further observed that the interviews had been short and were not conducted in an oppressive manner . He noted that in any event the application to exclude the evidence was premature since the defendants had not given evidence , so that it was not clear what facts were going to be relied on in their defence which might reasonably have been expected to have been mentioned . Moreover , it was a matter for the jury , properly directed , to determine the issues .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants gave evidence at the trial and said that the heroin found in the flat had been for their own personal use and had been purchased in bulk by the first applicant the TIME before their arrest . They stated that the polythene sheet had been planted there by the police after they had been brought to the police station . When asked about the incident recorded on DATE in which the second applicant was seen receiving and then returning a packet to the occupant of flat DATE , the applicants gave explanations which they had not mentioned to the police in their interviews . The first applicant stated that no drugs had ever passed between the flats and that the packet contained either cigarettes or money ; whilst the second applicant stated that it was simply an exchange of a packet of cigarettes . Other items had been passed this way since it was easier than having to go along the walkway of the front of each flat .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' co - accused , Mr PERSON , testified at the trial that the applicants had never given him heroin . He confirmed the applicants ' account of their friendship with him and his frequent borrowing , with communication being by the balcony . When he was arrested he was told that he would not get bail which made him angry and \u201c bloody - minded \u201d so he decided not to help the police by answering their questions .", "CARDINAL . When asked why they had made no comment to police questions during interview , both applicants stated that their solicitor 's advice that they were not in a condition to do so , given their withdrawal from heroin , had been conclusive .", "CARDINAL . In his summing - up the judge made reference to the jury 's ability to draw inferences from the applicants ' silence :", "\u201c I turn to a new topic in our law ... It is the law that these defendants did not mention certain facts when questioned about them in interview by the police . In the past that would not have been evidence that could in any way be held against them but now it is possible that it can be though it is for you to judge whether in fact you do hold it against them .", "[ The first applicant ] has relied in evidence on an explanation as to the passing of that cigarette packet , which is the subject of count CARDINAL . ... Firstly , it could have been cigarettes or it could have been money . He also said in evidence to you , ' There were no drugs ever passed through our hands to PERSON ' . He admits that he did not mention that when questioned under caution before being charged ...", "I turn now to [ the second applicant ] because she has relied in her own evidence on the fact that she had asked for cigarettes and was passed a packet , took a couple , and handed the packet back . She admits that she did not mention that when she was questioned under caution before being charged . ... Also in [ the second applicant 's ] interview she was asked about another matter , and I deal with this because in her evidence she relied on the fact that on DATE at TIME , a little before the incident with the cigarette packet , she handed PERSON some ' sticky chewing gum ' ... so the chewing gum is again not mentioned . ... She also in the course of her evidence relies on her telling you that there were only innocent , neighbourly exchanges of commonplace items from her balcony and she admits that she never mentioned those matters to the police ...", "The prosecution case , members of the jury , is that ( and it is for you to judge whether this assists you in your judgment to reach a verdict ) in the circumstances when each of these defendants were questioned on these topics , he or she could reasonably be expected to have mentioned what they said in court . The defendants explained that their ' no comment ' answers , speaking generally because of course they put it in more detail , the [ applicants ] said they were suffering from withdrawal symptoms and relied on PERSON , their solicitor 's advice that he could see they were suffering from withdrawal symptoms and should not answer questions because in his judgment of their appearance they were unfit for interview despite the known and expressed view of the ORG , which means ORG and is in fact a doctor , who comes along to police stations to deal with problems of this sort ...", "The law is ... that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from a defendant 's failure to mention the points I have referred to in their respective interviews . In each case it is relevant only to the case against the defendant concerned . You do not have to hold it against him or her . It is for you to decide whether it is proper to do so . Failure to mention the points in interview can not on its own prove guilt but depending on the circumstances you may hold it against him or her when deciding whether he or she is guilty . You should decide whether in the circumstances which existed at the time of the interview the matters were ones which the defendant concerned could reasonably be expected then to mention . Members of the jury that is all I have to say at this stage about the law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants were each convicted by a majority of CARDINAL of being concerned in supplying heroin and possessing heroin with intent to supply . The first applicant was sentenced to a total of DATE imprisonment . The second applicant was sentenced to a total of DATE imprisonment . PERSON , the co - accused , was acquitted on both charges .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed to ORG on CARDINAL primary grounds : the inclusion of the police interviews and the contents of the judge 's direction .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' counsel contended before ORG that the trial judge should have excluded the \u201c no comment \u201d interviews as they were a direct result of following their solicitor 's honest advice . ORG pointed to problems with that argument in situations where solicitors advised their clients tactically or dishonestly to refuse to answer questions ; the key question was the subjective reason why the applicants had not answered the questions . ORG went on to find that the judge , as the fact - finding tribunal in the voir dire ( submissions on a point of law in the absence of the jury ) , had been correct in his decision to include the notes of interviews in evidence .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the submission that the trial judge had been wrong to allow the jury to draw adverse inferences from the applicants ' failure to answer questions at the interview . Lord Justice Stuart - Smith stated on this point :", "\u201c ... both [ applicants ] knew that ORG certified that they were fit to be interviewed and therefore that medical opinion differed from that of their solicitor . Both were clearly advised by their solicitor that if they failed to mention material facts at the proposed interview , they could be criticised if the matter came to trial . That advice was understood ; he also made it plain that this was entirely their choice . At the beginning of the interview both were given the caution in its current form . ... Both indicated that they understood that caution . Both were told that if they felt unwell during the interview , they could let the interviewer know and it could be stopped . In these circumstances the fact - finding tribunal might well consider that if the [ applicants ] had an innocent explanation of the incriminating evidence about which they were specifically questioned , they would have mentioned it . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG then considered the applicants ' criticism of the trial judge 's summing - up in so far as he omitted to remind the jury that \u201c they could only draw an adverse inference if , in spite of any evidence relied upon to explain the failure to mention the relevant matters ( or indeed in the absence of such evidence ) they ORG ] that such failure [ could ] only sensibly be attributed to the fact that the appellants must have fabricated the evidence subsequently \u201d . ORG , with reference to the dicta of Lord PERSON in NORP v. PERSON ( [ DATE ] Queen 's Bench Reports CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) considered that it would have been desirable if the trial judge had directed the jury along the following lines :", "\u201c If despite any evidence relied upon to explain his silence or in the absence of any such evidence , the jury conclude the silence can only sensibly be attributed to the defendant 's having no answer or none that would stand up to cross - examination , they may draw an adverse inference . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP However , ORG did not find that this lacuna in the summing - up meant that the convictions were unsafe , having regard to the weight of the other evidence . Lord Justice PERSON explained in this connection :", "\u201c We have already referred to the substantial , almost overwhelming evidence of drug supply from what was found in the [ applicants ' ] house . Although there were no scales , all of the other paraphernalia of supply was present . All but CARDINAL of the jury must have rejected the [ applicants ' ] explanation of the police observations , much of which was recorded on video , the presence of the matching wraps in PERSON ' flat and the elaborate security arrangements at the applicants ' own flat . The acquittal of PERSON shows that the jury regarded the evidence of the interviews as insignificant . PERSON also failed to answer questions in interview . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG dismissed the applicants ' appeal in its judgment delivered on DATE .", "CARDINAL .

Therefore , the jury must be satisfied that the prosecution have established a case to answer before drawing any inferences from silence .

The time referred to is the time of questioning , and account must be taken of all the relevant circumstances existing at the time . The courts should not construe the expression ' in the circumstances ' restrictively : matters such as DATE , the defendant 's age , experience , mental capacity , state of health , sobriety , tiredness , knowledge , personality and legal advice are all part of the relevant circumstances ; and those are only examples of things which may be relevant ...", "Like so many other questions in criminal trials this is a question to be resolved by the jury in the exercise of their collective common - sense , experience and understanding of human nature .
