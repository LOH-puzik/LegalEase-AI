FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The first applicant is Mr PERSON , a NORP national , who was born in DATE and was serving a prison sentence at the time of the application . The second applicant is Mr PERSON , a NORP national who was born in DATE and was serving a prison sentence at the time of the application . They are represented before the ORG by Mr Jaakko Tuutti , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicants , may be summarised as follows .", "The first applicant had been detained pending a criminal trial concerning DATE amongst others \u2013 CARDINAL serious drug offences . On DATE , at the end of the hearing , ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) of ORG informed the parties that it had decided to reserve the judgment until DATE . The public prosecutor demanded a sentence of DATE imprisonment and that the first applicant should remain in detention pending the delivery of the judgment . ORG ordered that the first applicant be detained pending the delivery of the judgment , basing the detention on Sections CARDINAL and FAC of LAW ( pakkokeinolaki , tv\u00e5ngsmedelslag ; PERSON ) . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c Because ORG has in its decision after the end of the principal hearing notified the date of the reserved judgment , the grounds for PERSON \u2019s [ the first applicant \u2019s ] detention are based on the principles supporting section CARDINAL of LAW .", "PERSON , who has been detained throughout from CARDINAL DATE , has been charged with offences for which , if proven guilty as charged , he will clearly , according to normal case law , be sentenced to imprisonment for DATE .", "Without prejudice to the length of the final imprisonment sentence and taking into consideration that the reserved judgment will be given in DATE time , the arguments presented in favour of PERSON do not disclose that his detention is excessive . \u201d", "On DATE ( DATE ) the first applicant applied to ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) of GPE , claiming that his detention was unlawful and demanding ORG decision to be quashed as well as his immediate release . He claimed that ORG could not have based its decision on LAW , because he had not yet been sentenced as required by that provision . He also maintained that NORP legislation did not contain any basis for detention of a defendant in a case where the hearing had been closed and the judgment reserved and invoked LAW .", "On DATE ORG of GPE quashed ORG decision to detain the first applicant and ordered his immediate release . ORG reasoned its decision , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c Because PERSON had not been sentenced at the end of the principal hearing on DATE , he could not have been ordered to remain detained pursuant to LAW . \u201d", "On DATE ORG sentenced the first applicant to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . It also ordered the arrest of the first applicant , who had gone missing after his release on DATE .", "On DATE the first applicant meanwhile applied to ORG of GPE , claiming compensation under LAW by ORG . ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s claims on DATE , referring to section CARDINAL of that Act . It held , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c It is undisputed in the case that PERSON was detained during the time mentioned in his application for summons . It is also undisputed that ORG of GPE released PERSON because it was not possible to keep PERSON detained on the grounds that the public prosecutor put forward and on which ORG had made the decision , i.e. pursuant to LAW .", "Therefore , the detention was not based on the grounds on which the public prosecutor and ORG justified the detention .", "...", "Taking into account the seriousness of the offences that underlie the detention of PERSON , his guilt as stated in the judgment and the length of the imposed penalty , it would be excessive to oblige the ORG to pay PERSON compensation for the deprivation of his liberty . Compensation would be excessive also because he was deprived of his liberty for DATE and because this time has been subtracted from the sentenced imprisonment according to LAW . Because of PERSON \u2019s guilt the deprivation period can not be deemed to cause him such mental suffering as would be the case if an innocent person had been detained . \u201d", "ORG of GPE upheld ORG judgment on DATE . ORG reasoned its judgment , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c As ORG has maintained , there were no legal grounds for PERSON \u2019s detention during DATE . However , on DATE PERSON was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment for the crimes that initially led to his detention , and ordered to be taken into custody . PERSON has subsequently been avoiding the implementation of the sentence and a warrant for his arrest has been issued . Therefore it would be excessive to oblige the ORG to pay him compensation for his short term detention . Further , because it can not be maintained that PERSON \u2019s liberty has been restricted in an arbitrary fashion or without justification , he is not entitled to compensation on the basis of ORG either . \u201d", "In a letter dated DATE the first applicant asked the police to investigate whether the judge and laymen of ORG had committed a crime when they ordered his detention .", "On DATE the police sent a report to the Chancellor of ORG and informed him that a criminal investigation would not commence before the Chancellor of ORG had examined the matter .", "On DATE the Deputy Chancellor of ORG noted in his decision that there was no directly applicable statute in the law concerning detention of an accused by a court when reserving a judgment to a later date . He concluded however that both ORG and ORG had erred as the defendant could , and should have , been detained , under LAW on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation . According to the Deputy Chancellor of ORG , that interpretation of law had been accepted by ORG in similar cases . He did not find any grounds for prosecution in the case .", "The second applicant was serving a term of imprisonment in an open prison when on DATE he was taken in police custody to a police station as suspected of another crime . Some time later he was transferred to FAC , from which he was transferred to a prison in GPE on DATE . On DATE a public prosecutor decided not to press further charges against the second applicant .", "On DATE the second applicant filed a suit against the ORG under LAW by the State for the Deprivation of the Liberty of Detained or Convicted Innocent Persons . He demanded , inter alia , compensation for non - pecuniary damages caused by his detention from DATE to CARDINAL DATE . On DATE ORG rejected the second applicant \u2019s claims . It reasoned its decision , inter alia , as follows :", "\u201c Even though [ the second applicant \u2019s ] liberty and possibilities to act were de facto restricted to a greater degree due to his transferral to the police jail compared to the conditions in an open prison establishment , [ the second applicant ] was also nevertheless a prisoner in the open prison .", "As [ the second applicant ] was already imprisoned and as transferral to a different kind of prison does not require compensation pursuant to LAW by the State for the Deprivation of the Liberty of Detained or Convicted Innocent Persons , and as [ the second applicant ] can not be considered as equivalent to a detained or convicted innocent person or to a person subject to an injunction order , ORG holds that the ORG is not obliged to pay [ the second applicant ] compensation for any possible non - pecuniary damage caused by the transferral to a police jail . \u201d", "The second applicant complained to ORG which , on DATE , upheld ORG judgment . ORG refused the second applicant leave to appeal on DATE .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , as in force at the time of the events , provided :", "\u201c When the court cancels or defers the principal hearing in a case where the defendant has been detained , the court has to examine and assess whether there are reasons to keep the defendant detained . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of LAW on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation was amended on DATE ( CARDINAL ) . The new section entered into force on DATE and it provides :", "\u201c When the court cancels or defers the principal hearing or orders a new principal hearing in a case where the defendant has been detained , the court has to examine and assess whether there are reasons to keep the defendant detained . However , the question of detention does not have to be re - examined or reassessed during the time when the principal hearing has been deferred due to a mental examination of CARDINAL of the defendants in the case . The court must also rule on the question of detaining the defendant , if the court does not deliver its judgment directly after the principal hearing . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) states :", "\u201c The court may detain a person convicted and sentenced to imprisonment , or order the continuation such a person \u2019s detention , if :", "( CARDINAL ) the defendant has been sentenced to DATE imprisonment . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c Nobody may be detained or ordered to continue to be detained if the detention would be excessive due to the nature of the case , the suspect \u2019s or sentenced person \u2019s age or due to other personal circumstances of the person in question . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Act on Compensation by the State for the Deprivation of the Liberty of Detained or Convicted Innocent Persons ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides :", "\u201c A person who has been arrested or detained as a suspect for a crime has a right to compensation from the ORG , if :", "( CARDINAL ) a criminal investigation has ended without a criminal charge being brought ;", "( CARDINAL ) a criminal charge is withdrawn or dismissed ;", "( CARDINAL ) he or she has been found guilty of an offence which did not justify arrest or detention , or ;", "( CARDINAL ) there was no legal basis for the arrest or detention .", "There is no right to compensation if the deprivation of liberty has not exceeded TIME . \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the above - mentioned LAW ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) states :"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
