On CARDINAL and DATE ORG resumed its hearing in the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the lower court \u2019s judgment and remitted the case to the preliminary investigation stage .", "CARDINAL . ORG , considering that ORG judgment was unclear or erroneous , sought to appeal against it or request its interpretation .

On DATE ORG dismissed the application on the ground that the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional crime , in which case the law provided for pretrial detention .

ORG also found a likelihood that the applicant would try to hide important documents relating to the facts of the crime of which he was accused .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He argued that there was no danger of him absconding , as he had a permanent address , nor of him impeding the investigation .", "CARDINAL . The appeal was dismissed on DATE . ORG held that since the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional crime , he had to be detained by virtue of paragraph CARDINAL of LAW ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) . He could only be released if the exception of paragraph CARDINAL of that Article was applicable . However , this was not the case , because there was a risk that if released he might impede the investigation by suborning witnesses and hiding documents , regard being had to the complexity of the case , the high number of witnesses to be questioned and the need to organise confrontations between the applicant and certain witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . He argued that there was no evidence of him having committed a crime and that ORG had not relied on any specific facts justifying the conclusion that the applicant might abscond or tamper with evidence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeal . It subscribed to the reasoning of the lower prosecutor \u2019s offices , but also relied on the fact that there was another investigation pending against the applicant which , pursuant to LAW ORG , barred any possibility for release .

On DATE the applicant applied for release , arguing , inter alia , that his state of health was such that detention could be dangerous for him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was sent to a hospital for a medical examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for release on the ground of ill health but ordered his transfer to hospital .

The application was referred to ORG .", "CARDINAL . After examining the application , on DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s release on bail . It relied on the conclusions of the medical experts , noting that the applicant would not be able to maintain the required dietary regime and undergo the necessary medical supervision if he were returned from hospital to the detention facility . In addition , the supervising prosecutor and the investigator had come to the opinion that all documentary evidence had been gathered and the facts of the case had been clarified . Therefore , there was no risk of the applicant tampering with evidence . The investigation was continuing only in view of the fact that there were difficulties in summoning certain witnesses . Finally , there was no indication that the applicant would abscond . As to the fact that another investigation was pending against him , ORG found that this should not be used to the applicant \u2019s detriment as the investigation in question had already been pending for DATE .", "CARDINAL .
