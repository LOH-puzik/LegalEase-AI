At the material time Mr PERSON , a journalist and writer , born in DATE , was the editor of the DATE periodical ORG ( \u201c The ORG ' Voice \u201d ) , which appears in GPE . In issue no . CARDINAL of DATE , the periodical published an article written by a reader and entitled \u201c PERSON LOC ( \u201c the NORP problem is a NORP problem \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor ( \u201c the prosecutor \u201d ) at ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) instituted criminal proceedings against A.E.A. and the applicant in their respective capacities as publisher and editor of the periodical .", "The prosecutor noted that , in the article in question , \u201c acts of separatist terrorism perpetrated in the south - east of the country were described as NORP ORG ; part of the country , [ thus ] of ORG , was called GPE [ and ] an appeal was made for support for acts described as being of LAW \u201d . He charged the defendants with disseminating propaganda , through the medium of a periodical , against the territorial integrity of the ORG and the indivisible unity of the NORP nation , contrary to section CARDINAL , paragraphs QUANTITY and CARDINAL , of LAW ( Law no . ORG ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Having regard to the context from which the public prosecutor appears to have drawn his grounds for pressing charges ( see paragraph CARDINAL above and paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the relevant passages of the article in question can be summarised as follows :", "\u201c ... The confrontations between NORP and NORP in the various provinces are seen as foreseeable incidents ; moreover , they are sometimes provoked by the security forces , sometimes by fascist civilians and from time to time by the ' fundamentalists ' . Consequently , the policy of favouring ' a military solution ' , which until now was implemented by means of a dirty war against [ the guerrillas ] has taken on a new dimension and has begun to be coupled with a destructive social policy leading to ethnic conflict in all regions of GPE . It is very clear from this that the NORP problem is a general problem for NORP society and not a problem experienced in GPE and confined to within GPE 's borders ... DATE , the NORP problem is a NORP problem ... GPE [ \u201c RT \u201d ] , which is confronted with a NORP national movement within its own borders , clings firmly onto [ the branch ] of the ' NORP problem ' and , in doing so , is rapidly sucked into the complex developments in LOC ... Will the DATE repositioning of the pawns in LOC , the changes of alliance and the long - term imperialist plans ensure the success of those policies of the ORG ? Besides that , ... will the proportions reached by the NORP national movement allow it to be destroyed as a result of suffocation by a series of massacres ? Clearly , nobody DATE can foresee answers to these questions ... Given the proposals for a ' political solution ' , expressed recently by the various spokespersons of the sovereign powers , the latter do not appear to have renounced the ' military solution ' . Since the ' political solution ' referred to is merely a sham political solution which denies the people of GPE their free will ... In addition to that , the ' referendum ' discussions , which have also been on the agenda for some time , are engaged in by the sovereign classes not in such a way as to achieve a solution to the problem , but to push it into a dead end . The envisaged ' referendum ' does not in any way take as its basis the self - determination of the people of GPE , but , on the contrary , outlines a ' solution ' which is likely to unleash a rise in hostilities between the peoples ... Many of those on the left in GPE have confined their perspective to preventing ORG terror and violations of human rights in GPE , whereas another section are attempting to find their raison d'\u00eatre in the shadow of the NORP national movement with a point of view which is far from likely to offer a democratic solution for all . It is clear that neither of those approaches can provide society with a credible means of solving the NORP problem . The revolutionary democratic powers must offer society as a whole a programme setting out the path necessary to achieve a democratic and liberal solution to the NORP problem . In order to make such a solution acceptable to the many different sectors of society , it is also necessary to implement an appropriate practice . Otherwise , the ORG 's warring policies will reach a point at which they can only engender circumstances condemning the whole country to chauvinism , ORG terror and darkness . Since the NORP problem is also a NORP problem ... Moreover , in the ranks of ORG in GPE , the current war is generally perceived as an ' international war ' . Irrespective of what has been said in official declarations , the policy of favouring a military solution resembles , in practice , open warfare against the NORP people ... The sovereign powers , in their deliberate distortion [ of things ] , make every effort to present this war as that of the NORP against the NORP . And , alas ! , the fact that the NORP people have adopted a passive attitude towards the NORP problem renders that distortion credible . To perceive the war in GPE as an ' international war ' reinforces , among NORP workers , chauvinistic and exclusive tendencies against the NORP , while among the NORP youth in the West the same social atmosphere very spontaneously sparks off feelings of hostility towards NORP society ... In actual fact , if one were to react in accordance with the requirements of an ' international war ' , what would affect NORP and NORP workers would not be an ' international war ' , but a generalised social collapse . Faced with this increasingly marked tendency , even the leader of ORG is failing to show himself to be sufficiently sensitive and prefers to keep silent . Clearly , such a dispute will benefit neither the NORP people nor the NORP people . A dispute of this kind will merely be a confrontation between fundamentalists , lacking in any revolutionary dynamic , and will make the NORP and NORP people vulnerable to attacks by the sovereign classes and imperialists . In order to curb this negative tendency , there is surely nothing more foolish than to suggest that the NORP people give up national resistance . On the contrary , defeating NORP national resistance will not in any way serve to eliminate the ethnic tensions beginning to appear in the West and will only set off a trend towards the establishment of lasting hostilities between the peoples . If there really is something to be achieved , it must be achieved in the West within the NORP population . The only key to resolving the problem is for the NORP people to perceive NORP national resistance as part of their [ own ] struggle for freedom and democracy ... activities designed to establish fraternity between peoples in the West constitute , in themselves , one of the most important means of the struggle against the current bonds of sovereignty ... ORG in the LOC should henceforth ' intervene ' in the NORP problem . \u201d", "CARDINAL . At a hearing on DATE in ORG , the applicant denied the charges against him . He submitted , among other things , that the article in question had been written by a reader residing in GPE , GPE , and that he had published it because he had considered that it did not contain anything justifying censorship or anything revealing any criminal intention . The applicant argued that the article , considered as a whole , intended only to put forward the different approaches to the NORP problem , with the aim of suggesting democratic solutions to it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG found the applicant and A.E.A. guilty of the offence as charged . It also ordered the copies of the issue of the review in which the impugned article had been published to be seized .", "In its judgment , considering that it was not necessary to reproduce the passages judged to be in breach of the law , the ORG agreed with the prosecutor that the article in question referred to a part of NORP territory which it called GPE and condoned acts of violence by the ORG ( ORG of Kurdistan ) , which it portrayed as a national resistance movement against the ORG . Considering that the expressions and phrases used by ORG , the author of the impugned article , undoubtedly showed an intention to transgress section CARDINAL of Law no . ORG , the court concluded that , in publishing the article , the applicant and his co - defendant should be deemed to have knowingly conveyed propaganda designed to obtain support for the aim of destroying the territorial integrity of GPE and the unity of the NORP nation .", "ORG accordingly sentenced PERSON , in his capacity as editor , to DATE imprisonment and a fine of MONEY ( TRL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed to ORG . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , delivered after holding a hearing , the court dismissed his appeal , upholding ORG assessment of the evidence and its reasons for dismissing Mr ORG 's defence .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant began paying the fine , which had been divided into DATE instalments of TRL CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , before the custodial sentence imposed on the applicant was enforced , Law no . CARDINAL came into force amending , inter alia , section CARDINAL of PERSON no . ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . It modified the mens rea laid down by the former text of section CARDINAL as to the commission of the act of propaganda in question . It also imposed a lighter custodial sentence for that offence , but increased the fines . In a transitional provision , PERSON no . ORG also provided for an ex officio re - examination of earlier convictions imposed under section CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr Erdo\u011fdu applied to ORG for a reexamination of his case on the merits . In his pleadings , his lawyer submitted :", "\u201c As you know , section CARDINAL of the Prevention of Terrorism Act has been amended by PERSON no . CARDINAL ... However , since the words ' irrespective of the methods used and the intention ' ... have been repealed , the mens rea of the offence has been completely done away with , so as to fully alter the nature of the offence . The court is therefore legally obliged ... to set aside on grounds of nullity the sentence imposed on our client ... under former section CARDINAL ... there will have to be a re - trial on the basis of the new definition of the offence . \u201d", "He continued as follows :", "\u201c Freedom of opinion must allow individuals unrestricted access to ideas and knowledge , to not be criticised for the opinions and convictions they hold , to express them freely , either alone or with others , through various media , such as speech , the press , drawings , cinema , theatre , etc . , [ and ] to defend them , disseminate them to others and broadcast them . ... To put acts of terrorism and concepts of expression and statement of opinions in the same category is to restrict ' the free circulation of ideas ' and the right and freedom ' of people to inform themselves ' . ... What has been punished in our case is merely the ' risk of legitimising the ideas and acts of the ORG ' . No one is obliged to think in accordance with official points of view and to produce ideas which conform to them . An idea which conflicts with the concept of nation can not be considered as ' propaganda destroying the unity of the country or that of the nation ' . Furthermore , criticisms of leaders for their acts contrary to democracy and freedoms resulting from erroneous policies or proposing solutions are not acts destructive of national unity ... Proposing economic , cultural and social solutions ... and a discussion of those solutions is a natural sequitur of the most basic right of persons to think and express their opinions ... LAW expresses that fact by stipulating that the public has a right to receive and impart information . Free political debate constitutes the essence of the concept of a democratic society fully implementing the Convention . A balance has to be struck between the aims of ensuring the national security and integrity of the country and the benefit brought by the free debate of political issues . The important role of the freedom of expression in a NORP society and above all the publication by the press of information and ideas of public interest can only be secured by means of a pluralistic society underwritten by the ORG . The least satisfactory method of achieving this is by a ORG monopoly imposing a maximum restriction on the freedom of speech . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of DATE , the wording of which turned out to be based on the judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , ORG finally sentenced Mr ORG to a fine of TRL CARDINAL , which it decided to defer in accordance with section CARDINAL of Law no . CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . The court stipulated that a new judgment had thus been delivered , and ordered that execution of the previous sentence be stopped .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG .
