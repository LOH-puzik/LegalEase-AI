He recounted in his statement of CARDINAL DATE that , at TIME on DATE , with the use of thermal cameras , he had seen CARDINAL persons in the area and informed the battalion commander . The battalion commander had ordered him to continue to observe and record the QUANTITY people by thermal camera . As the QUANTITY persons had been behaving suspiciously , he and the soldiers under his command had thought that they were terrorists .", "CARDINAL . The military unit on Elmal\u0131 had then been deployed to ambush the CARDINAL people . He had been able to see that mortars and flares were fired . He had also heard Lieutenant PERSON asking the CARDINAL to surrender and to lie on the asphalt road . At that moment the QUANTITY persons , who were standing next to the road , had attempted to escape and the soldiers from his military unit had fired towards them . He thought that CARDINAL of the QUANTITY persons had been shot and , in his opinion , there were blood stains on an adjacent rock .

He had ordered the QUANTITY persons to stop and lie on the asphalt road ; had they complied with his orders , they could have been caught alive . However , it was possible that they had not heard him as they were QUANTITY away at the time . The CARDINAL people had then started running towards PERSON where he and his soldiers were positioned . When the distance was QUANTITY he had fired in the air . He had also seen , using TIME vision binoculars , that the CARDINAL were not armed . Nevertheless , CARDINAL of them was wearing a military style vest in which ammunition could be carried and the other was wearing thick clothing . It was possible that they had strapped their bodies with bombs . The QUANTITY persons continued to approach the soldiers and , when at a distance of QUANTITY , he had radioed the battalion commander for permission to open fire . After receiving authorisation from his commander , he had asked the QUANTITY men , both in NORP and NORP , to surrender . After having fired at the men he had thrown CARDINAL hand grenades at them in order to destroy any explosives which might have been strapped to their bodies . It was not until TIME that they had realised that the CARDINAL people were in fact the CARDINAL village guards .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , an expert - sergeant who took part in the operation , recounted in his statement of CARDINAL DATE that , when the distance between the QUANTITY persons and the soldiers was QUANTITY , he and a number of soldiers had ordered the CARDINAL people to stop . He had been unable to see the QUANTITY persons but could hear them . He and the soldiers next to him had then fired warning shots , after which they had fired directly at the QUANTITY men . Noting that the CARDINAL were still alive , they had thrown hand grenades in order to \u201c neutralise them \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE PERSON , another expert - sergeant who had also participated in the incident , gave a similar statement to that of Mr ORG and added that he had been able to see , using TIME vision binoculars , that the CARDINAL persons were not armed but were wearing thick clothing .

He had also heard a hand grenade explosion ; he did not know the distance from which the hand grenade had been thrown or whether or not the QUANTITY persons had been alive when the hand grenade was thrown .", "CARDINAL . PERSON had also been serving as a private soldier under the command of Lieutenant PERSON and was positioned on PERSON at the relevant time . Private PERSON recounted in his statement of CARDINAL DATE that CARDINAL of the CARDINAL people had been wearing thick clothing . The soldiers , thinking that the QUANTITY men might be suicide bombers , had not wanted them to approach . When the distance between the QUANTITY persons and the soldiers was QUANTITY , the soldiers had started firing . A bomb had also been thrown at the CARDINAL men . The CARDINAL had not fired at the soldiers .", "CARDINAL . Both the first applicant PERSON and the ninth applicant PERSON were questioned by the prosecutor on DATE . They asked the prosecutor to find and prosecute those responsible for the deaths of their relatives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the prosecutor decided that he lacked jurisdiction to investigate the killings and forwarded his decision and the above mentioned statements to the military prosecutor 's office at ORG in ORG . In his decision the prosecutor summed up the information he had been given by the above mentioned members of the military and concluded that the CARDINAL village guards had been mistaken for terrorists and had thus been killed . According to the prosecutor , the killings had been carried out in the performance of military duties and , as such , had to be investigated by a military prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . In this decision the battalion commander ORG , Lieutenant PERSON , sub - Lieutenant PERSON and expert - sergeants PERSON and PERSON were named as defendants in respect of the offence of \u201c causing death by negligence and carelessness \u201d . The first and the ninth applicants , i.e. PERSON and PERSON , were referred to in the decision as the complainants .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants ' lawyer asked the military prosecutor for information about the investigation and asked to be contacted if his presence was required .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor asked the commander of the gendarmerie in the city of GPE to appoint CARDINAL high ranking officers as experts to assist him in the investigation . The military prosecutor specified that those CARDINAL officers should not be chosen from among members of the military teams to which the defendants belonged .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor visited the area where the CARDINAL village guards had been killed . CARDINAL majors and a lieutenant - colonel who had been appointed as experts , the defendants and other eye - witnesses were also present during the military prosecutor 's visit .", "CARDINAL . The military prosecutor observed that , at the time of the shooting , the distance between the CARDINAL village guards and the soldiers was QUANTITY . Furthermore , the place where the CARDINAL village guards were killed was QUANTITY away from the river bed which was often used by terrorists as an escape route .", "CARDINAL . During his visit , the military prosecutor also questioned Lieutenant PERSON , expert - sergeant PERSON and the battalion commander Captain PERSON , i.e. CARDINAL of the CARDINAL defendants .", "CARDINAL . Lieutenant PERSON stated that the CARDINAL village guards had been trying to reach the river bed to escape . When fire was opened , the CARDINAL village guards had been QUANTITY away from the river bed ; had they been able to proceed any further , it would have been impossible to find them again . He had not known at the time that the CARDINAL persons were in fact the village guards . He had been informed at the time that the QUANTITY men had been crouching frequently , thereby giving the impression that they were planting land mines . Lieutenant PERSON added that the CARDINAL people had been \u201c exterminated \u201d by the soldiers after having obtained permission from the battalion commander . Although the CARDINAL village guards had been unarmed , they were wearing thick clothing , thereby giving the impression that they had explosives on them . Thus , the reason for the soldiers to continue firing even after the CARDINAL men had fallen to the ground was to destroy any explosives . It had been his duty to stop terrorists from using the area as an escape route and to exterminate them ; on DATE of the events he had carried out that duty .", "CARDINAL . Expert - sergeant PERSON repeated the contents of his previous statement ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and added that the reason for the presence of the military in that area at the time had been to prevent terrorists from using the area as a transport route . On DATE of the events , they had exterminated CARDINAL terrorists . He had not thought at the time that they could be village guards . Their priority was to catch terrorists alive so that they could obtain information from them , but that had not been possible on this particular occasion because the QUANTITY persons had refused to surrender .", "CARDINAL . Battalion commander Captain PERSON stated that he had been informed in a fax message , sent to him from the regimental headquarters some time before the incident took place , that a group of CARDINAL terrorists had used the area DATE previously . He had been warned to be on high alert in case more terrorists tried to use the area . He knew that the locals helped terrorists by providing guidance around the area . Furthermore , land mines were being planted thereabouts . He confirmed that PERSON had kept him informed about the movements of the CARDINAL persons and about the operation . He added that Lieutenant PERSON had told him that the CARDINAL men were escaping and that it would have been impossible to find them again if they were allowed to do so . Furthermore , Lieutenant PERSON had also said that the QUANTITY persons might have explosives on them and that it would be dangerous for the soldiers if they came close . He had thus authorised the firing . In his opinion the CARDINAL village guards had been in the area in order to plant land mines or to help a group of terrorists .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first applicant PERSON and the ninth applicant PERSON applied to the military prosecutor for permission to intervene in the proceedings . In their statements taken by the military prosecutor DATE , the CARDINAL applicants stated that their relatives had been killed intentionally or negligently . They asked the military prosecutor to establish the circumstances surrounding the killings and prosecute those responsible .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the CARDINAL experts submitted their opinions to the military prosecutor . They stated that , in reaching their conclusion , they had taken note of the above mentioned statements taken from members of the military and had watched the video footage of the operation recorded by Captain PERSON using the thermal camera ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . According to the experts , during TIME of darkness the area in question was out of bounds for all persons , with the exception of members of the military , because it was a transport route for terrorists to reach LOC . The village guards knew this well and their presence in that area could only be explained by their having ulterior motives . In fact , one and a half months before the killing of the CARDINAL village guards , a military vehicle had been damaged by a land mine . On account of the heavy military presence in the area , it could not have been possible for terrorists to plant land mines themselves . In the experts ' opinion , the deceased village guards had been responsible for planting the mines . Furthermore , they had intelligence suggesting that the deceased village guards had been assisting terrorists by providing guidance around the area .", "CARDINAL . According to the CARDINAL experts , although the CARDINAL village guards had been unarmed , their heavy clothing could reasonably have been mistaken for explosives . In fact , it was possible to see in the footage recorded by thermal cameras that the soldiers had continued to fire at the QUANTITY persons after they had fallen to the ground . This was done in order to destroy any explosives . The military units which had taken part in this incident had been deployed in that particular area to ambush terrorists . It was \u201c completely natural \u201d , therefore , that the \u201c village guards were exterminated on the assumption that they were terrorists \u201d . The experts concluded by stating their opinion that \u201c none of the defendants had been at fault ; in fact , they had carried out their duties effectively and successfully \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor took a statement from PERSON . PERSON had performed his military service in the area in question at the relevant time but had since completed his service and been discharged from the army . He had taken part in the operation under PERSON command . PERSON stated that on the night in question he had been using TIME vision binoculars and had thus been able to see the CARDINAL persons . The soldiers had then started firing to the left and right of the QUANTITY men , upon which the CARDINAL had started running towards the river bed . When the soldiers opened fire in that direction , the CARDINAL people had put their hands up and said \u201c Stop firing ; we surrender \u201d . Lieutenant PERSON had then ordered the CARDINAL men to lie on the road but they refused to do so , instead advancing towards the soldiers on PERSON . CARDINAL of the CARDINAL persons had one hand up in the air , but the other hand was behind his back as if he was reaching for something . Although Mr GPE had been able to see that because he was wearing night vision binoculars , some of the soldiers who were closer to the CARDINAL persons had also been able to see it with the naked eye . When the QUANTITY persons continued advancing towards the soldiers , Lieutenant PERSON had ordered the soldiers to open fire . The firing had continued after the CARDINAL had fallen to the ground in order to eliminate the risk of a booby - trap .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor questioned ORG and PERSON who , like Mr GPE , had been performing their military services and had taken part in the operation under the command of Lieutenant PERSON . Mr PERSON stated that he had been the sniper of the military team . Mr Dilmen and PERSON both stated that the QUANTITY persons had been given ample opportunity to surrender but had failed to do so . When the distance between the QUANTITY persons and the soldiers was down to QUANTITY , the soldiers had opened fire . They had not seen any weapons on the QUANTITY people , but the clothes they were wearing had been very thick , which had led the soldiers to think that they were laden with explosives .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the military prosecutor decided not to prosecute the defendants for the offence of \u201c causing death by negligence and carelessness \u201d . The military prosecutor concluded in his decision that the soldiers had \u201c shown more than necessary sensitivity in apprehending the CARDINAL persons alive , but had been unable to do so because of the QUANTITY person 's refusal to surrender \u201d . According to the military prosecutor , \u201c following the CARDINAL person 's refusal to surrender , killing them had become a duty for the soldiers \u201d and that the soldiers had carried out that duty .", "CARDINAL . The decision not to prosecute was communicated to the applicants ' lawyer on DATE . The lawyer contacted the military prosecutor DATE and asked to be provided with the documents from the investigation file . The military prosecutor authorised the release of the statements taken from the applicants only .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged an objection against the decision not to prosecute . In their petition submitted to ORG , the applicants argued that , due to the secret nature of the investigation , they had not been given access to the documents in the investigation file . Neither had they been able to participate in the investigation , notwithstanding their submission of petitions to intervene in the proceedings ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The applicants argued , in particular , that their CARDINAL deceased relatives had been unarmed and that it thus should have been possible to apprehend them alive . They submitted that everyone had the right to life ; the killing of their CARDINAL relatives and the military prosecutor 's decision to discontinue the proceedings was a violation of their relatives ' right to life , which was protected by the LAW and by international conventions .", "CARDINAL . The applicants ' objection was rejected on DATE by ORG , which concluded that the decision not to prosecute was compatible with the legislation in force and the applicable procedure , and that there was no need to widen the scope of the investigation . The decision rejecting the objection was communicated to the applicants ' lawyer on DATE .", "CARDINAL .
