The first applicant , PERSON , is the widow of PERSON PERSON , who was killed on DATE , while serving in ORG , as a result of an explosion at the ORG naval base near the village of GPE . The second and third applicants , PERSON and PERSON , are their sons . The applicants are NORP nationals and were born in DATE and DATE respectively . They all live in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The applicants were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE at around TIME an explosion occurred on the ORG naval base . This was caused when CARDINAL containers of explosives , mainly gunpowder , burst into flames . These had been stored out in the open on the base since DATE , after being confiscated from a GPE - flagged NORP - owned vessel \u2013 the Monchegorsk , heading from GPE to GPE \u2013 for violation of ORG weapons sanctions . CARDINAL people were killed by the explosion and CARDINAL people were injured . Substantial damage to property was caused and there was significant financial damage and loss .", "CARDINAL . By an order dated DATE , and pursuant to ORG PERSON . DATE , as amended at the time by LAW . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , ORG appointed a lawyer in private practice , Mr P.G.P , as a CARDINAL - member commission of inquiry ( \u201c the investigator \u201d ) , to look into the explosion and the circumstances which had led to it , as well as potential responsibility for the explosion .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator submitted an extensive report of CARDINAL pages to the then President of the Republic ( \u201c the President \u201d ) , the President of ORG and the Attorney - General . In this , he stressed that , as an investigator appointed under the relevant law , he did not constitute a disciplinary or judicial authority , nor did he act as a coroner . His duties were purely investigative , and his findings and recommendations were not binding . He could not determine or establish legal or criminal responsibility . Any decisions in respect of possible criminal responsibility leading to a prosecution lay exclusively within the competence of the Attorney - General under LAW , following a police investigation in accordance with his instructions ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Decisions as to actual criminal responsibility lay exclusively with the courts . He observed that , in his investigation , he had mainly dealt with possible State and/or political responsibility ( \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9/\u03ae \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 ) . He was of the opinion , however , that although he could not determine or establish criminal responsibility , he had the right and obligation to express general views on the matter .", "CARDINAL . NORP The investigator , giving detailed reasons for his decision , concluded that both the Minister of Defence and the Minister for ORG had very serious responsibilities , both statutory ( \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 ) and personal . However , he found that the main responsibility lay with the President , who was the head of the State and the Government . The President bore the greatest responsibility for the inadequacy ( \u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 ) , negligence and remissness ( \u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 ) that had been shown , and had failed to take care of or at least take basic measures to ensure the security of the citizens of GPE , and in particular that of the soldiers and firemen in question . The fate of the cargo had been decided by the executive , which , headed by the President , had completely failed to take the necessary measures to handle the matter , including keeping the cargo safe in GPE . The investigator pointed out that the President , over and above his state office and his institutional capacity ( \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 ) , had undertaken to deal with the dangerous cargo himself , had had ultimate control over it and had been responsible for taking important decisions on the subject . The investigator also emphasised and explained that he referred not only to the President \u2019s statutory and ex officio ( \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03be\u2019\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 ) political responsibility , but also his significant personal responsibility for the tragic event and its consequences .", "CARDINAL . His comments concerning criminal aspects were general and did not attribute criminal responsibility to any particular person . He expressed the view that the Attorney - General had a duty to examine the possibility that a number of criminal offences might have been committed , including the offences of manslaughter and causing death by reason of a rash , reckless or dangerous act ( \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03c9 \u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 , \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ae \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 ) under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that the Attorney - General had publicly stated that the report would be taken into consideration in the relevant police investigations , and that such investigations had in fact been initiated in accordance with his instructions . According to the applicants , the relevant police reports were handed to the Attorney - General towards DATE or DATE , but they contained no reference to the President .", "CARDINAL . By a letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicants\u2019 lawyer requested that the Attorney - General seek leave from ORG to lift the President \u2019s immunity from criminal prosecution . It appears that a similar request had already been made to the Attorney - General by the families of some of the other victims . In the above letter , the applicants\u2019 lawyer expressed the view that the relevant acts and omissions of the President had constituted the offence of manslaughter and had been committed during his term of office and in the exercise of his functions , and not in his private capacity , as alleged in the request made by the other families . It appears that both requests remained unanswered .", "CARDINAL . As the Attorney - General did not take the steps requested , on DATE separate applications were filed by the applicants ( application no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and the relatives of other victims ( applications nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) under the relevant procedural rules ( Rule CARDINAL of ORG of DATE ; see paragraph CARDINAL below ) for leave to commence proceedings in ORG for the interpretation under Article CARDINAL(b ) of the LAW of certain alleged ambiguities in LAW . In the applicants\u2019 application and in application no . CARDINAL , those ambiguities concerned the interpretation of the allegedly vague and imprecise terms \u201c offence involving dishonesty \u201d and \u201c offence involving moral turpitude \u201d in LAW , as well as \u201c any offence committed by him [ the President of the Republic ] in the execution of his functions \u201d in LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL below ) , and the conflicting interpretation by the applicants and the Attorney - General concerning the possibility of the President being criminally prosecuted before the end of his mandate for his acts and omissions in his handling in general of the matter of the dangerous explosives . As regards the remaining application ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , this focused on a number of disagreements with the Attorney - General as to the provisions of DATE and its alleged vagueness .", "CARDINAL . The applications were heard together by ORG ( Full Bench ) , which rejected them on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its decision , ORG observed that the applicants maintained that the terms \u201c offence involving dishonesty \u201d and \u201c offence involving moral turpitude \u201d included manslaughter , and that they relied on alleged statements by the Attorney - General that the above terms did not cover this offence . The Attorney - General , however , denied that such statements had any legal consequence , even if they had been made . He could not remember making them . It was also admitted that the letters to him on this point from the plaintiffs had never been answered . The question which arose was whether , even if the Attorney - General had made such statements , this disagreement would constitute a \u201c difference of opinion \u201d within the meaning given to this term by the relevant jurisprudence ( such a difference being a prerequisite for ORG jurisdiction under Article CARDINAL(b ) of the LAW ) . ORG considered that this was not the case . It stated that it was not possible for any citizen who disagreed with another person or an authority , by means of CARDINAL simple disagreement , to create a \u201c difference of opinion \u201d which would satisfy the relevant provisions of the jurisprudence . Accepting such a position , as proposed by the applicants in the applications before it , would amount to recognising in every case an actio popularis . Moreover , accepting to undertake to interpret the LAW in the case would simply and solely be a decision on a difference of opinion which constituted a theoretical question , since it could not lead to any consequence . If and when the Attorney - General decided to prosecute the President , only then would it be possible to raise the question of interpretation , and it would then be the duty of ORG , within the framework of the appropriate procedure , to judge and decide on the content , meaning and legal consequences and effects of the relevant LAW provisions . Otherwise , it was not the duty of ORG to solve theoretical problems and questions which would not themselves have legal consequences . In view of its conclusion about the non - existence of a \u201c difference of opinion \u201d , ORG stated that there was no need to rule on the other preconditions which needed to be satisfied in order for the leave sought to be given .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE the Attorney - General had brought criminal proceedings ( case no . CARDINAL ) against CARDINAL high - ranking officials before ORG : the former Minister for ORG , the former Minister of Defence , the former Deputy Commander of ORG , the Commander of ORG , the Deputy Commander of ORG ( ORG \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ORG \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 ORG \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 ORG ) , and the Chief of ORG ( \u0395.\u039c.\u0391.\u039a.-\u0395\u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae PERSON ) ( \u201c the first , second , third , fourth , fifth and sixth defendants \u201d ) . They were charged with manslaughter and causing death by reason of a rash , reckless or dangerous act under sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW . They each faced separate charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG gave judgment . The first and third defendants were acquitted ; the second defendant was found guilty of both offences and was sentenced to DATE imprisonment ; the remaining defendants were found guilty of the second offence pursuant to section CARDINAL of PERSON . CARDINAL , but were acquitted of the remaining charges . They received a DATE sentence of imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The second , fourth , fifth and CARDINAL defendants lodged appeals against their conviction and sentence before ORG ( appeal nos . CARDINAL , DATE ) . The Attorney - General also filed appeals in so far as the first - instance judgment concerned the first , second , and DATE defendants ( appeal nos . DATE ) . On DATE ORG dismissed the appeals lodged by the second , fifth and sixth defendants and the corresponding appeals of the Attorney - General , as well as an appeal lodged by the Attorney - General concerning the acquittal of the first defendant . Further , it upheld the appeal of the fourth defendant against his conviction , acquitting him of all charges . Consequently , it dismissed the appeals against his conviction and sentence .", "CARDINAL . Under the LAW , the Attorney - General is an independent officer of GPE ) .
