On DATE , CARDINAL suicide bombs exploded on CARDINAL underground trains and CARDINAL bus in central GPE , killing CARDINAL people and injuring CARDINAL more .", "CARDINAL . DATE , on DATE , the first CARDINAL applicants , Mr PERSON , Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON , and a fourth man , PERSON PERSON , detonated CARDINAL bombs contained in rucksacks at separate points on the GPE public transport system . On DATE , a fifth bomb was discovered abandoned and undetonated in a bin . Mr Manfo Asiedu was identified as the fifth conspirator .", "CARDINAL . Although the CARDINAL bombs were detonated , in each case the main charge , liquid hydrogen peroxide , failed to explode . Subsequent testing revealed that this was most likely the result of an inadequate concentration of the hydrogen peroxide : the hydrogen peroxide found in the bombs had a lower concentration than that which would have been necessary for it to explode .", "CARDINAL . The first CARDINAL applicants and PERSON all fled the scenes of their attempted explosions . Images of the QUANTITY men were , however , captured by closed - circuit television ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) cameras . A national police manhunt began , in which photographs and the ORG images of the men were broadcast on national television . The following day , DATE , a young man was shot and killed on the GPE underground by police after being mistaken for CARDINAL of the men . The CARDINAL men were arrested , the first CARDINAL applicants in GPE DATE and PERSON in GPE , GPE , on DATE . They were tried and convicted for conspiracy to murder .", "CARDINAL . The fourth applicant , PERSON , gave PERSON shelter at his home in GPE , during the period when PERSON was on the run from the police and before he fled to GPE . In separate proceedings , Mr PERSON was tried and convicted of assisting PERSON and failing to disclose information after the event .", "CARDINAL . The details of the applicants\u2019 arrests and initial police questioning are set out more fully below .", "CARDINAL . The first of the bombers to be arrested was Mr PERSON . He was arrested on DATE at TIME in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Upon arrest , he was cautioned by the police using the \u201c new - style \u201d caution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely that he did not have to answer questions but that anything he did say might be given in evidence , and that adverse inferences might be drawn from his silence if he failed to mention matters later relied on by him at trial . The police officers who accompanied him to the police station later gave evidence that Mr PERSON had said that he had not known what he was doing , had not known that the bomb would go off and had not wanted to hurt anyone .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON arrived at FAC , GPE , at TIME At TIME he requested the attendance of a solicitor . He was told that he was entitled to consult a solicitor but that this right could be delayed for up to TIME if authorised by a police officer of the rank of superintendent or above . At TIME a superintendent ordered that Mr PERSON be held incommunicado under Schedule CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . Shortly afterwards , a different superintendent directed that a safety interview be conducted with Mr PERSON . A \u201c safety interview \u201d is an interview conducted urgently for the purpose of protecting life and preventing serious damage to property . The detainee is questioned in order to secure information that may help avert harm to the public , by preventing a further terrorist attack , for example . The interview may occur in the absence of a solicitor and before the detainee has had the opportunity to seek legal advice ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) .", "CARDINAL . At TIME a brief safety interview took place . It lasted TIME and focused on whether there was anything unsafe in a bag which Mr PERSON had discarded when he was arrested .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the custody officer at ORG contacted the duty solicitor on behalf of Mr PERSON .", "CARDINAL . At TIME and TIME Mr PERSON again requested access to a solicitor . He was told that this would be arranged as soon as the booking - in process had been completed .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the custody officer was told that a further safety interview had been authorised . It was recorded in writing that Mr PERSON had not been given access to legal advice on the grounds that delaying the interview would involve an immediate risk of harm to persons or damage to property and that legal advice would lead to the alerting of other people suspected of having committed offences but not yet arrested , which would in turn make it more difficult to prevent an act of terrorism or to secure the arrest , prosecution or conviction of persons in connection with terrorism offences . The reason for these beliefs , which was also recorded , was that Mr PERSON was suspected of participating in the attacks of DATE together with CARDINAL as yet unidentified accomplices . There then followed CARDINAL safety interviews .", "CARDINAL . Safety interview A commenced at TIME and concluded at CARDINAL a.m. At the beginning of the interview , Mr PERSON was given the old - style caution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , namely that he did not need to say anything but that anything he did say might be given in evidence .", "CARDINAL . Safety interview B commenced at TIME and concluded at CARDINAL a.m. Again , Mr PERSON was given the old - style caution at the start of the interview .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the duty solicitor was contacted and was told that safety interviews were taking place .", "CARDINAL . At TIME safety interview C commenced . This time , Mr PERSON was given the new - style caution . It finished at TIME", "CARDINAL . At TIME safety interview D commenced , following the administration of the old - style caution . It was completed at TIME", "CARDINAL . During the safety interviews , Mr PERSON either claimed that he did not recognise the other suspects from the photos in the media or he gave an incorrect account of how he knew some of them . He deliberately incorrectly described their involvement in the events of DATE .", "CARDINAL . Meanwhile , at TIME , the custody officer contacted the duty solicitor . At TIME the duty solicitor arrived at the custody suite and was permitted to read the custody record .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Mr PERSON was placed in a room for consultation with the duty solicitor . That consultation was interrupted at TIME for a further safety interview , which began at TIME and concluded at CARDINAL p.m. and was conducted in the presence of the solicitor .", "CARDINAL . The next suspect to be arrested was PERSON . He was arrested on DATE at TIME in a flat in LOC . He was cautioned and asked whether there was any material on the LOC which might cause danger . He replied that there was not . He was also asked whether there was any material anywhere which the police should know about and he replied that the police already knew about \u201c QUANTITY \u201d ( the LOC where the explosive devices were believed to have been manufactured ) because they had been there already . He identified the other man that the police had seen at the GPE flat DATE as Mr PERSON and was asked whether Mr PERSON had control of any materials likely to cause danger . He replied , \u201c No , listen , I \u2019ve seen my photo and I was on the bus but I did n\u2019t do anything , I was just on the bus \u201d . He was told that he would be interviewed about that later and that all the police wanted to know was whether there was anything at another location that was likely to cause danger . Mr PERSON indicated that he was aware that the police were trying to \u201c link us to QUANTITY \u201d ( referring to the events of DATE ) and then said that he did \u201c do the bus \u201d but that he had had nothing to do with the events of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Ibrahim arrived at FAC at TIME He requested the assistance of the duty solicitor .", "CARDINAL . At TIME he was reminded of his right to free legal advice and replied that he understood what had been said to him . The duty solicitor was contacted at TIME At TIME he called the police station and asked to speak to PERSON . He was told that PERSON was unavailable . The solicitor called again at TIME and was told that his details would be passed to the officer in charge of the investigation , but that telephone contact was impractical because the appropriate consultation rooms were unavailable .", "CARDINAL . At TIME a superintendent ordered an urgent safety interview and directed that Mr Ibrahim be held incommunicado . The custody record explained that his right to access to legal advice had been delayed because there were reasonable grounds for believing that delaying an interview would involve immediate risk of harm to persons or serious loss of , or damage to , property ; and that it would lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of committing a terrorist offence but not yet arrested , which would make it more difficult to prevent an act of terrorism or secure the apprehension , prosecution or conviction of a person in connection with terrorism offences . The record referred to the suspicion that PERSON had detonated an explosive device on DATE as part of an organised attack intended to kill and injure members of the public .", "CARDINAL . At TIME a different solicitor called the police station and asked to speak to PERSON . She was told that CARDINAL of that name was held at the police station . At TIME , when it was established that Mr PERSON was at the police station , she was told that he was already represented by the duty solicitor .", "CARDINAL . At TIME Mr Ibrahim was taken from his cell for a safety interview . At TIME the second solicitor contacted the custody officer . At TIME , while Mr PERSON was being interviewed , the second solicitor called again seeking to speak to him .", "CARDINAL . At the beginning of the safety interview Mr PERSON was told :", "\u201c ... [ I ] am going to ask you some questions , you do n\u2019t have to say anything if you do n\u2019t want to but the court can draw what \u2019s called an inference from that and that just means that they can look upon your silence as perhaps a sign of guilt . And then what is being said here , it is being tape - recorded and it can be used in court . \u201d", "This was , in effect , the new - style caution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . During the safety interview , PERSON was asked whether he had any materials such as explosives or chemicals stored anywhere . He denied knowing where any such materials might be stored or having any knowledge of planned attacks which might endanger the public . He told the police that he did not know anything about explosives and that he had no links with any terrorist groups . He added that he did not know anyone who dealt with explosives , was a danger to society or was planning terrorist activities . He accepted that he knew Mr PERSON , but denied knowing other men connected with the events of DATE whose pictures had been shown on television . He was unaware of anyone he knew having been involved in these events . He said that Mr PERSON was not someone who would be prepared to do anything like that . The safety interview ended at TIME", "CARDINAL . At TIME the duty solicitor arrived at the police station . Mr PERSON was sleeping and saw the solicitor at TIME", "CARDINAL . During subsequent interviews while PERSON was in detention , which were conducted in the presence of a solicitor , he made no comment .", "CARDINAL . The last of the CARDINAL suspects to be arrested was Mr PERSON . He was arrested and cautioned on DATE at TIME at the same LOC flat as PERSON .", "CARDINAL . He arrived at FAC at TIME At CARDINAL p.m. he requested the assistance of the duty solicitor . At TIME the custody officer asked the relevant officers to inform him whether PERSON PERSON was to be held incommunicado and at TIME this was authorised .", "CARDINAL . Simultaneously , a superintendent authorised a safety interview . The reasons for delaying access to legal advice were recorded . The superintendent indicated that he believed that delaying an interview would involve immediate risk of harm to persons or serious loss of , or damage to , property ; that it would lead to others suspected of having committed offences but not yet arrested being alerted ; and that by alerting any other person it would be more difficult to prevent an act of terrorism or to secure the apprehension , prosecution or conviction of a person in connection with the commission , preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the custody officer called the duty solicitor scheme . At TIME Mr PERSON signed the custody record indicating that he wished to speak to a solicitor as soon as practicable . At TIME he was told that he was being held incommunicado .", "CARDINAL . At TIME duty solicitors arrived at the front desk of ORG .", "CARDINAL . At TIME the safety interview of Mr PERSON commenced without the presence of a solicitor . He was given the new - style caution ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He was told that he was suspected of involvement in the attacks of DATE and was asked if he had any knowledge of further explosives , and those who had them , which could cause harm to the public in the near future . He maintained that he had nothing to do with the events of DATE and that he knew nothing about them . He did not recognise the photographs of the alleged perpetrators which he had seen in the media . The safety interview finished at TIME", "CARDINAL . The duty solicitors arrived at the custody suite at TIME and saw Mr PERSON at TIME The delay was partly caused by PERSON PERSON \u2019s request for time to pray and the provision of a meal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Mr PERSON was interviewed for the second time , this time in the presence of a solicitor . Early in the interview , the solicitor read out the following statement by Mr PERSON :", "\u201c I am not a terrorist and I \u2019m not in any way connected to any acts of terrorism and have not been connected to any acts of terrorism ... particularly on DATE or DATE . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Thereafter Mr PERSON exercised his right to silence .", "CARDINAL . The trial of the first CARDINAL applicants for conspiracy to murder commenced in ORG at GPE on DATE before Mr Justice PERSON and a jury . It was to DATE . The applicants stood trial alongside PERSON , PERSON ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) and PERSON PERSON ( accused of taking part in the essential preparation for the attacks ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicants\u2019 defence was that although they had been involved in the events of DATE and had detonated the explosive devices , their actions were not intended to kill but were merely an elaborate hoax designed as a protest against the war in GPE . The bombs had been designed to look realistic and to cause a bang when they went off but had deliberately been constructed with flaws to ensure that the main charge would not detonate .", "CARDINAL . At the start of the trial , the applicants argued that the admission of the statements they had given during their safety interviews would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that they ought to be excluded pursuant to section CARDINAL of ORG DATE ( \u201c PACE \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . They contended that their right of access to a solicitor before and during the safety interviews had been violated and that their right against selfincrimination had been breached as a result of the use of the new - style caution , when the old - style caution , ( which made it clear that no adverse inferences could be drawn from their silence because they had not had access to solicitors ) ought to have been used instead . They also argued that the statements should be excluded on grounds of public policy as , if such statements were routinely admitted , there was a greater likelihood that suspects would refuse to answer questions about public safety .", "CARDINAL . A voir dire ( i.e. a hearing to determine the admissibility of evidence ) was conducted . At its conclusion , and after hearing ORG submissions , the trial judge concluded that the statements made during the safety interviews could be admitted . His written ruling ran to CARDINAL paragraphs and may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The judge referred at the outset to the explanation given by the police superintendent in charge of the investigation of the situation which he had faced . The superintendent had pointed in particular to the discovery of a quantity of chemicals , which appeared to be far in excess of that required to construct the devices used during the attacks of DATE , and to evidence that the suspects had been in receipt of considerable post - event assistance .", "CARDINAL . The judge also considered the facilities available in the custody area at FAC , where the applicants had been taken after their arrest and where the safety interviews had taken place . The entire custody facilities had been given over to the investigation into the attempted bombings . There were CARDINAL cells , rooms for medical and forensic testing purposes and CARDINAL rooms for consultations between suspects and their solicitors . However , at the time of PERSON and Mr PERSON \u2019s safety interviews , CARDINAL individuals suspected of terrorism offences were detained at the police station . The imperative was to prevent communication between the suspects and to avoid cross - contamination in the course of searches and other forensic processes .", "CARDINAL . The trial judge next referred to the relevant statutory framework governing access to legal advice for those held under terrorism legislation ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) , which made it clear that where a suspect was interviewed without legal assistance , the old - style caution should be administered , because section CARDINAL(CARDINALA ) of ORG LAW DATE prohibited the drawing of adverse inferences from silence where the suspect had not had access to legal advice ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . However , he considered that this did not extend to preventing the court from admitting evidence of things said by a suspect during questioning , including any lies that he told . The judge indicated that the jury would be told that , contrary to the terms of the new - style caution that had been on occasion administered , no adverse inferences could be drawn from the applicants\u2019 failure to mention during questioning facts later relied on at trial .", "CARDINAL . He then turned to review this ORG \u2019s case - law on access to legal advice and the right to silence , explaining :", "\u201c In my view , the following conclusions are to be drawn from those decisions of the ORG . First , legal advice can be withheld for good cause during the early stages of interviews , so long as the conditions in which the interviews occur are not significantly coercive ( PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL VI ) and so long as access is not delayed for an excessive period ( PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL-I ) . Moreover , interviewing a suspect having withheld legal advice and following a newstyle caution is not decisive in the assessment of whether there has been a breach of LAW PERSON v. GPE , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINALVI ) . Rather , the court must look at the circumstances overall and the use to which evidence is put ( and including whether adverse inferences are drawn ) . Accordingly , so long as the overall circumstances have not caused irretrievable prejudice to the rights of the defendant , much will depend on the directions a jury receives as to how they should approach the silence or the statement of a suspect in these circumstances . As the ORG made clear in GPE , considerable caution is required when attaching weight to the fact that a person arrested in connection with a serious criminal offence and having been denied access to a lawyer during the early stages of his interrogation responds in a particular way DATE or as in that case , does not respond \u2013 to the questions put to him . The need for caution is not removed simply because an accused is eventually allowed to see his solicitor and then refuses to answer questions . A jury must be given a strong and careful warning that they must take into account all of the relevant circumstances ; they must have discounted all reasonable ( \u2018 innocent\u2019 ) explanations for the accused \u2019s silence or statements before they consider using this material against him ; and the jury must be told to be careful not to accord disproportionate weight to this evidence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The trial judge considered that the applicable code of practice ( see paragraphs CARDINAL - CARDINAL below ) and the caution were primarily designed to protect an accused from self - incrimination and to warn him of the consequences if he chose to answer questions and the harm that could be done to his case if he failed to reveal elements of his defence on which he later relied at trial . Neither the code nor the caution was intended to protect defendants from telling lies . The judge explained :", "\u201c Whilst I recognise that an accused may benefit from having a solicitor remind him of his moral duty to tell the truth , in my view it is an invalid argument to suggest that an interview is necessarily inadmissible because the suspect did not have the advantage of a consultation with a solicitor , who had been excluded for good cause , in order to tell him that he should not deceive the police . \u201d", "CARDINAL . He concluded that , despite the absence of a solicitor during the safety interviews and the use of the wrong caution , there was no significant unfairness or material infringement of the applicants\u2019 right to a fair trial .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the submission that the applicants were confronted with irreconcilable propositions when asked to participate in the safety interviews , the judge found that they were not . He noted :", "\u201c ... The defendants were confronted with a stark but clear choice : either they could help the police in the knowledge that what they said may be utilised against them , or they could protect themselves and remain silent ... What is clear beyond doubt is that the defendants were not misled or deceived as to the underlying purpose of the interviews , the possible consequences of answering questions or the potential risks of not revealing elements of their defence ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . He further observed that the defence that the applicants chose not to reveal at that stage was directly relevant to the public safety issues and was easy to describe . It did not require any detailed understanding of the criminal law or a complicated factual explanation . It could have been summed up by the single word \u201c hoax \u201d . The judge accepted that it was sometimes necessary to have the assistance of a lawyer before a suspect could understand and describe a complicated defence , but said that this was not the case here .", "CARDINAL . The judge considered that the defendants might have had a more credible position if they had answered the questions posed in ways which were at least arguably designed to assist the public and which , as a result , incriminated them . However , it was common ground that they had either lied or failed to reveal what they knew in the safety interviews : rather than incriminate themselves , they had offered false , exculpatory explanations . The judge further found that the invitation to cooperate in the process of protecting the public was not an impermissible inducement . Finally , he concluded that the administration of the new - style caution did not pressure the defendants into providing any element of their various defences .", "CARDINAL . The judge set out in detail the approach he had adopted to the exercise of his discretion whether to exclude the evidence . In particular , he had given full weight to the principle that access to legal advice before and during questioning was one of the most fundamental rights that should only be denied on reasonable grounds in particular cases ; and he had taken into consideration the fact that the environment in which the applicants were held was not in any true sense coercive and that the questioning was neither oppressive nor unfair . While he accepted that the erroneous administration of the new - style caution involved a level of indirect compulsion , this was not , in his view , decisive : the choice for the applicants was an easy one and they had not been \u201c induced \u201d by the caution to incriminate themselves but had instead told deliberate , exculpatory lies . He also noted that the evidence of the safety interviews was potentially of high relevance to the central question raised in the trial , namely whether the defences now advanced were possibly true .", "CARDINAL . As regards Mr PERSON \u2019s safety interviews , the judge observed that , in answering the questions designed to protect the public , Mr PERSON had volunteered a very large amount of misleading information . He had not incriminated himself at any stage , but had instead told extensive exculpatory lies . The judge considered it clear that the police officers had concentrated throughout on issues that might have revealed information relevant to assisting them to locate people or items that could pose a danger to the public . He noted that there was no suggestion that the police had exceeded the requirements of what was necessary and that it was acknowledged that the lines of questioning were relevant to public safety issues .", "CARDINAL . The judge found that Mr PERSON had been denied access to a solicitor for TIME . The safety interviews had been conducted expeditiously and as soon as they were completed PERSON had been given access to a solicitor . The interviews were neither coercive nor oppressive , as accepted by PERSON counsel . Although a breach of the applicable code of practice had occurred when the new - style caution was administered at the beginning of safety interview C , that had not affected his attitude to the questioning . He had continued telling lies consistent with what he had said in safety interviews A and B.", "CARDINAL . As regards PERSON , having reviewed the evidence showing the times and locations of the various interviews and consultations taking place at the police station , the judge accepted \u201c unhesitatingly \u201d that it would have been impractical for a telephone conversation between the solicitor and PERSON Ibrahim to have been arranged at the time of her telephone calls ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) . He observed that at the relevant time there had been CARDINAL detainees at the police station , all arrested for suspected involvement in the events of DATE . The police station had been exceptionally busy and the conference rooms had been prioritised for face - to - face consultations ; it would not have been a realistic option to leave a room free with a telephone socket for telephone conversations with lawyers . The judge noted that the police had accepted that there had been a breakdown in communication in that the interviewing officers had not been told that PERSON solicitor was trying to speak with him on the telephone .", "CARDINAL . The judge further held that it would have been impractical for Mr Ibrahim to have spoken to a solicitor before the booking - in procedures were completed at TIME Although there was , in theory , time for a faceto - face conference TIME , when the safety interview was authorised , and TIME , when it commenced , the judge considered that , in light of the pressure under which the police were working , it was wholly understandable that no officer had appreciated that there was time to ask the duty solicitor to attend for a meeting with PERSON before the safety interview commenced . However , the judge was of the view that it should have been possible , TIME and TIME , to ensure that the duty solicitor was given access to PERSON by telephone and accordingly concluded that , to this limited extent , he was incorrectly denied access to legal advice by telephone . However , he considered that this error did not involve a material infringement of his defence rights , noting :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ T]his infringement of his rights was of low significance : it would have been impossible for [ the duty solicitor ] , in speaking to PERSON for the first time over the telephone , to give detailed and informed advice in those circumstances , and she would have been unable to provide material assistance on the decision which he had to take . Although for this defendant the choice was a straightforward one , [ the duty solicitor ] would have needed to understand the entirety of the main background circumstances before she could give advice that would have been useful to PERSON as regards the options confronting him . She could have advised him of his rights , but save for any issues arising out of the misuse of the new - style caution , his core rights had already been made clear to him : he was entitled to legal advice ( which had been delayed for public safety reasons ) ; he was entitled to remain silent ; and anything he did say may be given in evidence against him . There is no suggestion that he did not understand these straightforward matters . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge considered that the erroneous use of the new - style caution was a straightforward and wholly understandable oversight on the part of the officers conducting the interview , given the pressure under which they were operating . He noted that the safety interview was short ; that it was not suggested that it had been conducted coercively ; and that the questions did not go beyond legitimate questioning for safety purposes . The judge examined the transcript of the safety interview conducted and noted that Mr PERSON had consistently denied having knowledge of any planned future attacks or hidden explosives . PERSON had seen a lawyer around DATE after his first request to see one .", "DATE . In respect of Mr PERSON , the judge found that legal advice had been delayed for TIME , during which time TIME of questioning had taken place . There was no suggestion that the interview had been held in coercive circumstances . Aside from the administration of the new - style caution , there was no evidence of any pressure having been applied . The judge was sure that the interview had not exceeded the legitimate bounds or purpose of a safety interview and had been , on the contrary , focused and appropriate .", "CARDINAL . The judge therefore concluded that there had been no material infringement of the right of any of the applicants to exercise their defence rights and that the interviews were admissible in their entirety .", "CARDINAL . NORP The main issue at trial was whether the failure of the devices to explode was an intentional design flaw ( in which case the applicants could not be guilty of conspiracy to murder ) or a mistake in the construction of the devices . The prosecution relied heavily on the applicants\u2019 answers in their safety interviews to undermine their defence that the events of DATE were intended as a hoax .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution also led evidence that the men had extremist views . They relied on extremist material found at the residences of Mr PERSON and Mr PERSON ( of beheadings and other atrocities ) ; evidence that the first CARDINAL applicants and PERSON had attended a training camp in LOC and that PERSON had travelled abroad on jihad ; and evidence that PERSON PERSON had tried to convince an outsider to the group of the legitimacy of suicide bombings and other terrorist activity and , on another occasion , had shouted at an imam who had condemned suicide bombings . Also introduced as evidence were jottings referring to martyrdom on the same pad of paper that had been used to note the amount of materials supposed to go into each bomb .", "CARDINAL . The prosecution further relied on evidence as to the purchase of the material for the bombs and their preparation . They established that , DATE and DATE , QUANTITY of liquid hydrogen peroxide at a low concentration had been purchased from CARDINAL shops in north GPE in a total of CARDINAL containers by PERSON , PERSON and Mr PERSON . There was evidence that they had initially requested liquid hydrogen peroxide at a much higher strength at or near the strength necessary to enable explosion and that they had boiled the hydrogen peroxide to increase its concentration . A number of the empty bottles later recovered had handwritten numerical markings on them , which the prosecution contended was proof that the defendants believed that the requisite concentration for explosion had been reached . A rota showed over QUANTITY FAC work boiling the hydrogen peroxide .", "CARDINAL . Scientific evidence was also led as to the construction of the bombs , which had been put in rucksacks adapted for the purpose . The detonator was encased in paper from an ACARDINAL pad . Shrapnel had been added to the devices , which would have increased fragmentation upon explosion and maximised the possibility of injury . Both prosecution and defence experts agreed that the bombs were not viable . The prosecution \u2019s expert explained that this was because the hydrogen peroxide had not reached the necessary concentration required for explosion . He noted that it would have been difficult for those constructing the bombs to have measured the strength of the hydrogen peroxide but pointed out that , if the purpose had only been an hoax , no increase in hydrogen peroxide concentration would have been necessary : at the initial low concentration or with a banger inserted into the mix , the same impression of noise would have been produced . In response to the defence claim that the hydrogen peroxide had been concentrated and then diluted again with tap water ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , analysis of the isotope composition of GPE tap water showed that this was not possible .", "CARDINAL . NORP The prosecution also referred to telephone and ORG evidence of extensive contacts between the men primarily before , but also after , DATE .", "CARDINAL . A farewell letter written by PERSON , which the prosecution alleged was a suicide note , was also admitted in evidence . It was alleged to have come from the same pad of paper as had been used for encasing the detonator in the bombs . A witness gave evidence that he had received the letter on DATE from Mr PERSON \u2019s brother and had been asked to pass it on to Mr PERSON \u2019s partner .", "DATE . The jury also heard evidence from passengers on the trains where CARDINAL of the bombs had been detonated . CARDINAL gave evidence of Mr PERSON mumbling nervously to himself on the platform , another of him shouting \u201c this is wrong , this is wrong \u201d after the detonation of his bomb , still others of his look of surprise , confusion and panic afterwards . In respect of PERSON , passengers gave evidence of his surprise and fear . CARDINAL witnesses he encountered during his escape gave evidence that he had asked them for help and had told them he had been injured in a bomb attack or explosion . In respect of PERSON , the bus driver who had been in charge of the bus on which PERSON detonation took place gave evidence of PERSON nervousness in boarding the bus .", "CARDINAL . The applicants gave evidence to the effect that their actions were intended as a hoax . They had initially planned to leave the bombs unattended in public to make a point about the Iraq war . After the events of DATE , the plan changed to detonating the bombs but not the main charge of hydrogen peroxide . To this end , they maintained that , although they had tried to concentrate the hydrogen peroxide by boiling it , they had then watered it down so that it would no longer be at the necessary concentration for an explosion . Mr PERSON gave evidence that he had not intended to detonate his bomb on the bus ; it had gone off accidentally as he felt for the battery in order to try and remove it . Mr PERSON explained his farewell letter saying that it had in fact been written on DATE after the shooting of the man mistaken for CARDINAL of the suspects ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) because he thought that he too would be shot by the police . It was pure coincidence that it was written on the same pad as that used for the detonator .", "CARDINAL . Like the first CARDINAL applicants , PERSON case prior to trial was that the events of DATE were a hoax . However , after PERSON had given evidence , PERSON gave oral evidence and changed his previous position . He claimed to have learned on TIME of DATE that the devices were real bombs . He was too confused and frightened to refuse the device that was handed to him but , in accepting it , he did not intend to join or play any part in the conspiracy .", "CARDINAL . During his summing up to the jury , the judge gave the following direction in respect of the statements made in the safety interviews :", "\u201c What about the lies , members of the jury , told by some defendants to the police ? It is admitted that the defendants PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON lied to the police in different ways during their interviews . ... [ B]efore you even begin to take any lies into consideration , you must pay careful attention to the circumstances in which the lies were told and those circumstances vary between the defendants .", "First , you will recall that because of the exceptional circumstances that existed in DATE safety interviews were authorised in the cases of PERSON and PERSON . That meant that those defendants were questioned in an attempt to preserve the safety of the public before they had the opportunity of consulting with a solicitor . It is not alleged by anyone that legal advice was denied by the officers as a result of bad faith or dishonesty . However , access to legal advice prior to interview is a right that is usually afforded to a suspect and you should take into consideration that this did not happen . For instance , a solicitor may have advised the defendant in question to remain silent or they may have reminded the defendant that he should tell the truth and that there may be consequences if he lied . Therefore , when considering whether to hold any lie told by those CARDINAL defendants during a safety interview against them , remember that this safeguard with these safety interviews was withheld . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The judge also directed the jury to bear in mind that incorrect cautions had been used . He explained :", "\u201c As a result , it was confused and potentially confusing for all CARDINAL defendants . The new - style caution that was administered may have put inappropriate pressure on them to speak . When considering whether or not to hold any lie told by a defendant during a safety interview against him , take into account , therefore , that unsatisfactory history as regards the use of the caution .", "However , as regards the use of the new - style caution , you are also entitled to bear in mind that none of these CARDINAL defendants were in fact pressurised into revealing anything that they have later relied on in this trial . To the contrary , on all or most material issues they lied . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of those lies , the judge observed :", "\u201c In addition , for PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON when assessing lies they told whilst in police custody , whether in a safety interview or otherwise , you should consider CARDINAL further questions : on the particular issue you are considering , you must decide whether the defendant you are considering did in fact deliberately tell lies . If you are not sure he did , ignore this matter on that issue . If you are sure , consider why did the defendant lie on that issue . The mere fact that a defendant tells a lie is not in itself evidence of guilt . A defendant may lie for many reasons and they may possibly be innocent ones in the sense that they do not denote guilt . It is suggested here that lies were told for a variety of reasons : out of fear of admitting a degree of involvement or knowledge but which the defendant says falls short of his being a conspirator , that is PERSON ; to protect others who they feared would be falsely accused and might be killed or injured as a result ; out of fear of admitting involvement , as they claim , in a hoax attack , or out of panic , distress , confusion , or from fear of being assaulted .", "If you think that there is , or may be , an innocent explanation for the lies told by the defendant you are considering , then you should take no notice of them . It is only if you are sure that he did not lie for an innocent reason that his lies can be regarded by you as evidence supporting the prosecution case , subject to the other directions I have just given you on this issue relating to the safety interviews . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Concerning the failure of the applicants to mention the defence led at trial during the safety interviews , the judge directed as follows :", "\u201c Let us turn then to the failure of the defendants to answer questions in interview . The first matter to stress is that you must not hold it against PERSON , PERSON and PERSON that they failed to mention during the safety interviews matters which they later relied on in court . That is because , as I have just explained to you , access to a lawyer had been denied at that stage and the law is that in those circumstances a defendant is not to be criticised for failing to mention matters that later form part of his defence . Of course it follows from the direction I have just given you about lies that if instead of remaining silent they told lies , you are entitled to take those untruths into account , subject always to the matters I have just directed you to take into account .", "...", "[ M]y clear direction to you is that you must not hold it against PERSON , PERSON and PERSON that they failed to mention during the safety interviews matters which they later have relied on in this court . \u201d", "CARDINAL . For the later interviews that took place after the applicants had seen their legal representatives and had received the new - style caution , the trial judge directed the jury that the applicants had failed to give an account of CARDINAL matters that they relied on at trial , even though they had been asked questions about them in interview : ( i ) the true events leading up to DATE ; ( ii ) their knowledge individually of and association with their coaccused ; and ( iii ) their true state of mind , purpose and intention in relation to the deployment of the bombs . He explained that the failure to mention these matters during the interviews which took place after they had received legal advice could be held against them .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the jury convicted the first CARDINAL applicants and Mr PERSON of conspiracy to murder . The jury were unable to reach verdicts in respect of the other CARDINAL defendants and a re - trial in their cases was ordered . They subsequently pleaded guilty to lesser charges .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the first CARDINAL applicants were sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of DATE imprisonment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants sought leave to appeal against their convictions . They argued inter alia that the trial judge had erred in his ruling admitting the evidence of the safety interviews .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal against conviction .", "CARDINAL . Setting out the background to the ORG arrest and questing , the court observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... It is virtually impossible to imagine the pressure and concerns which must have been felt by the police investigating teams . DATE CARDINAL bombs had been successfully detonated with the dreadful consequences with which we are familiar , and they were now faced with CARDINAL more bombs , again in the transport system , which had been detonated , but failed to explode . The bombers involved on DATE had perished , but the perpetrators of the second intended atrocity were at large , free to repeat their murderous plans , and to do so more effectively . They had to be found and detained , and the immediate objective of the investigation , including interviews of those arrested in connection with these incidents , was directed to public safety . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG expressed , at the outset of its judgment , the following , general conclusion as to the nature and conduct of the trial :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It is axiomatic that every defendant , even a defendant alleged to be involved in direct and dangerous violence on the citizens and institutions of this country , is entitled to a fair trial at which his guilt must be proved . This trial was marked with conspicuous fairness and commanding judicial control by PERSON Justice PERSON . The defendants were represented at public expense by leading counsel of distinction and experience , with absolute clarity about their professional responsibilities both to their clients , and to the court . The jury \u2019s difficulty in agreeing verdicts in relation to PERSON and PERSON demonstrates that they approached the issues with the open - minded fairness and lack of prejudice which is CARDINAL of the customary characteristics of the jury system . Now that the applicants have been convicted after a fair trial before an impartial tribunal , we are entitled to record , after a lengthy examination of the evidence , that their defences to the charge of conspiracy to murder were ludicrous . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In respect of the applicants\u2019 defence , ORG made the following observation :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If these were hoax bombs we find it hard to conceive why it was necessary for the peroxide to be boiled in order to increase its concentration , or why both PERSON and PERSON , independently , when buying hydrogen peroxide asked for it to be supplied at [ a much higher ] strength , or the highest available percentage . Equally , it is astonishing to imagine why QUANTITY of hydrogen peroxide was needed unless its purpose was to increase its strength . The handwritten figures ... on DATE bottles made devastating evidence . Each one demonstrated that the manufacturers of the bombs believed that they had in fact achieved the critical concentration necessary to ensure that the bombs exploded . Indeed a significant part of the trial was taken up by the efforts by applicants to explain away this crucial evidence . In very brief summary it was contended that after the concentration in the hydrogen peroxide had been increased , it was then watered down . Moreover it is difficult to understand how any political point , if that was all that was sought to be made , could be improved by the incorporation of shrapnel within the bomb . The shrapnel was intended to cause death and maiming . There could be no other purpose . And if this expedition were intended as a hoax or a political demonstration , there was a remarkable silence from the applicants themselves after they had made their escapes . If their objective was a hoax , CARDINAL a moment \u2019s attention to the outpouring of the news about the unsuccessful bombings would have demonstrated that their objective had been achieved . Yet no such assertion or claim or explanation was given or offered to the police or the media or the public before any of the applicants was arrested . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the impact of the admission of the safety interviews , the court observed :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... At this stage we simply record that if the records of the police interviews were properly admitted , they were sufficient , on their own , utterly to undermine the \u2018 hoax\u2019 defence . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The court was of the view that an interview process which , so far as possible , enabled the police to protect the public was a necessary imperative . It considered that the question whether the results of such interviews should be used as evidence against the suspects was delicate . However , it emphasised that none of the applicants had said anything which directly incriminated them , or involved any confession to participation in , or even remote knowledge of , the conspiracy to murder on DATE . It also found that there was a risk of attaching disproportionate importance to this particular feature of the evidence in the case . Nevertheless , it noted , the interviews provided important evidence against the applicants , not because they told the truth and revealed knowledge of or involvement in terrorist activity , but because they had made a number of demonstrably untrue assertions without suggesting the defences that they later advanced at trial .", "CARDINAL . The court accepted that , owing to police error , incorrect cautions had been administered to the applicants before they told the lies in question . However , it emphasised that each of the men had been warned that the answers given in the safety interviews might be used in evidence against him . The court continued :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... So they were under no illusions . They did not purport to incriminate themselves at all . They chose to lie . On any view that was an important consideration in the exercise of ORG discretion . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court was satisfied that the exercise of discretion by the trial judge was fully informed and that he had approached the relevant issues with care .", "CARDINAL . As regards Mr PERSON , the court noted that he was the first of the defendants to be arrested and that , as a consequence , what he might have to say was of absolutely crucial importance to the stark public safety issues which confronted the police at the time . It observed that during the voir dire , it was expressly accepted that the decision to hold a safety interview before Mr PERSON was granted access to a lawyer was a valid decision under Schedule CARDINAL of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL et seq . below ) . It was further conceded that the interviews were conducted fairly and moderately , and that they were neither coercive nor oppressive . However , during the appeal , counsel for PERSON had sought to argue that the police action to delay Mr PERSON \u2019s access to legal advice was not lawful . The ORG noted :", "\u201c First , breaches of the relevant Code do not make subsequent police actions unlawful , at any rate in the sense that they are or would be sufficient of themselves to lead to the exclusion of the results of the subsequent interviews . When , as the judge found , the police were not seeking deliberately to manipulate the system in bad faith , he was required to address the exclusionary powers provided by section CARDINAL of PACE : no more , no less . This leads to the second consideration , that it is always open to the defendant \u2019s advocates at trial to make a deliberate forensic decision to waive or ignore , and therefore choose not to rely on the breaches of the relevant Code , if the effect of inviting attention to them may increase rather than diminish the defendant \u2019s difficulties . In short , the trial advocate must make his own judgment whether to advance argument based on breaches of the relevant Code , or to argue some , or one , but not all of them . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The court could see nothing to support the conclusion that the decision to admit the evidence of the safety interviews in Mr PERSON \u2019s case was flawed .", "CARDINAL . In respect of PERSON , the court noted that QUANTITY submissions had been advanced by his counsel . First , it had been argued that the superintendent \u2019s conclusion that a pre - interview consultation between Mr PERSON and the duty solicitor would cause unnecessary delay was a serious error of judgment because the safety interview had not taken place until TIME . Second , it had been contended that the continued questioning of PERSON after he had denied knowing anything constituted a breach of the applicable code , paragraph CARDINAL.CARDINAL ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Finally , it had been submitted that the administration of the new - style caution had contributed to the unfairness by introducing an element of coercion . ORG explained in detail how the trial judge had approached these matters and concluded that it saw no basis for interfering with his decision that the statements made during safety interviews should be admitted .", "CARDINAL . As regards Mr PERSON , the court noted that the trial judge had accepted that the wrong caution had been given and that access to legal advice had been delayed for TIME .

It expressed some concern about events at the police station but considered that the trial judge had not erred in admitting the impugned witness statement . Concerning the fact that the statement had been made in breach of the applicable code , the court said :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The way the police behaved is undoubtedly troubling . The decision not to arrest and caution [ the fourth applicant ] when the officers interviewing him believed that they had material which gave them reasonable grounds for suspecting that he had committed an offence was a clear and deliberate instruction to ignore the LAW . But at that stage the police dilemma is understandable . [ The fourth applicant ] was providing information about PERSON which could have been of critical importance in securing his arrest , which was the priority at that time . It seems to us that the judge was entitled to come to the conclusion that the prosecution had established that nothing was said or done which could undermine the reliability of the witness statement . He was entitled to take into account the fact that in the prepared statement he made after caution he asserted that he was seeking to give assistance to the police . That was repeated in the later interviews . He said nothing therefore to suggest that the circumstances were such as to render it likely that what he said was not reliable . It seems to us , therefore , that the judge was also entitled to conclude from all material that [ the fourth applicant ] with the help of legal advice , was repeating , subject as we have said to some corrections , what was in the witness statement as his account of the part such as it was , that he played in relation to PERSON in DATE after DATE . Further , given the [ fourth applicant \u2019s ] adoption of that witness statement , we do not consider that the judge \u2019s decision to permit the statement to go before the jury in the exercise of his discretion under s. CARDINAL of the LAW can be said to be perverse or affected by any error of law . \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to the refusal of the trial judge to stay the trial on grounds of abuse of process , ORG explained :", "\u201c DATE . ... The main thrust of the argument on [ the fourth applicant \u2019s ] behalf is that to prosecute on the basis of a statement that he gave when being treated as a witness is quite simply unfair . He was , it is said , effectively being told that he would not be prosecuted and gave assistance accordingly . The judge in our view rightly rejected this argument . There was no evidence that [ the fourth applicant ] made his statement because he believed he was not going to be prosecuted . He gave no evidence to that effect ; and there is nothing in the interviews after he was arrested to suggest that that was the reason for his having made the witness statement . On the contrary , he made the witness statement because he wanted to assist the police . In this type of case , the court is only likely to conclude there has been an abuse of process if a defendant can establish that there has been an unequivocal representation by those responsible for the conduct of the prosecution and that the defendant has acted to his detriment : see R v PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL Cr App R DATE , [ DATE ] PERSON , in particular at paragraph DATE . That was not the situation here . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Describing the general relevance of an appellant \u2019s personal circumstances to the sentence imposed , the court acknowledged that youth or vulnerability might be pertinent , but emphasised that this was not the case in respect of most of the appellants before it , including the fourth applicant . The court noted that the appellants had acted without any regard whatsoever to their public duty , and continued :", "\u201c None except [ the fourth applicant ] made any disclosure at all until they were arrested ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , ORG partly allowed the fourth applicant \u2019s appeal against sentence , on account of the help he had given to the police :", "\u201c CARDINAL . The assistance that [ the fourth applicant ] gave to PERSON was of the utmost significance .
