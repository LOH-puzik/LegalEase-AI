Having regard to all the evidence submitted to the ORG , it transpires that at DATE the political tensions between GPE and GPE had reached a climax with the arrest on DATE of CARDINAL NORP officers in GPE and the suspension by GPE on DATE of all aerial , road , maritime , railway , postal and financial links with GPE .

It has been established that during the period in question ( from DATE until DATE ) NORP nationals were arrested , detained and then expelled from the territory of GPE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant Government , these were reprisals following the arrest of the NORP officers in GPE and NORP nationals were expelled regardless of whether they were lawfully or unlawfully resident in GPE , simply because they were NORP .", "CARDINAL . According to the respondent Government , the events relating to the arrest of CARDINAL NORP officers in GPE were entirely irrelevant to the facts set out by the applicant Government in their application . The NORP authorities had not taken any measures of reprisal against NORP nationals , but had merely continued applying the statutory provisions for the prevention of illegal immigration in compliance with the requirements of the ORG and the Russian Federation \u2019s international obligations .", "CARDINAL . The parties submitted conflicting statistical evidence regarding the number of NORP nationals expelled during that period .", "CARDINAL . The applicant Government submitted in particular that DATE and DATE , CARDINAL expulsion orders had been issued against NORP nationals , of whom CARDINAL had been detained and forcibly expelled , and the remaining CARDINAL had left the country by their own means . They specified that DATE there had been a sharp increase in the number of expulsions of NORP nationals , which had risen from CARDINAL persons per month DATE to CARDINAL per month DATE and DATE . At the witness hearing PERSON PERSON , Consul of GPE in GPE at the material time , stated that from DATE the NORP consulate in GPE had been inundated with telephone calls and requests for assistance from relatives of persons detained , and that CARDINAL NORP nationals had come to the consulate DATE . He also said that there had been an increase in the number of travel documents ( which were necessary to expel NORP nationals ) issued during that period , with the number rising from an average of CARDINAL documents per day to CARDINAL per day ( see Annex , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government , which stated that they had only DATE or DATE statistics , said that , in DATE , CARDINAL administrative expulsion orders had been issued against NORP nationals , which was a PERCENT increase compared with DATE . However , during DATE the highest number of administrative expulsion orders had been made against GPE nationals ( CARDINAL ) , followed by NORP nationals ( CARDINAL ) and NORP nationals ( CARDINAL ) , who , in reality , were only in third place . DATE and DATE , CARDINAL NORP nationals had been the subject of expulsion orders . They also indicated that during DATE CARDINAL planes chartered by GPE had flown a total of CARDINAL NORP nationals from GPE to GPE , and that at DATE and DATE CARDINAL planes chartered by GPE had flown CARDINAL NORP nationals from GPE to GPE .

With regard to the international governmental and non - governmental organisations , they partly reproduced the figures submitted by the applicant Government ( see , inter alia , the report of ORG of ORG of ORG PACE report , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .

In support of their allegations , the applicant Government submitted a number of documents issued by ORG ( ORG ) of GPE and GPE and by ORG of GPE .

The second one , sent by PERSON , head of a division of ORG of GPE and GPE at the material time , to the heads of district police departments for combating economic crime and of ORG of GPE , also refers to circular no . ORG . The third one , sent by ORG , Acting Head of Police of GPE and of GPE at the material time , to the heads of district police departments , orders the relevant authorities to submit DATE reports on the number of NORP nationals arrested for \u201c administrative offences ... and violations of the regulations governing registration of home address \u201d ;", "ii .

The respondent Government submitted that all those instructions , the order and the information note had been falsified and disputed the content as alleged by the applicant Government of the CARDINAL circulars FAC . ORG and CARDINAL to which those documents referred . However , they confirmed the existence of the CARDINAL circulars , but said that these could not be provided to the ORG because they were classified \u201c ORG secret \u201d . At the witness hearing PERSON PERSON , Deputy Head of ORG , ORG , GPE , at the time of the hearing , confirmed that the instruction of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) purportedly issued by ORG of GPE and GPE was a forged document and that the CARDINAL circulars nos . ORG and CARDINAL ( the latter actually being a telegram ) were classified \u201c ORG secret \u201d and that they concerned a reference to various national criminal groups , but not a selective reference to NORP nationals . They could not be disclosed because this was forbidden under NORP law ( see GPE , \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In his DATE report of DATE Mr PERSON , Commissioner for Human Rights of GPE ( NORP Ombudsman ) at the material time , published the full text of the instruction of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) , on which Mr PERSON name appears unsigned . The Commissioner said that the instruction had been sent to him by GPE human rights activists and that it had been published by the local press . He commented as follows : \u201c To call things as they are , this unprecedented document is evidence that ... most senior police official entered into an arrangement with the judicial authorities with the aim of obtaining unjustified judicial rulings in relation to DATE as yet unidentified \u2013 persons in breach of temporary residence procedures , ignoring the specific circumstances of each of them and on the sole basis that they were NORP citizens . \u201d He went on to say that he had asked ORG of GPE to check whether the document was genuine and , if so , \u201c to take appropriate measures to bring the guilty to justice and revoke the blatantly illegal instructions contained in it \u201d ( DATE report of DATE of the Commissioner for Human Rights of GPE , point CARDINAL \u201c Interethnic relations and human rights \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . In his letter in reply of DATE , PERSON , Deputy General Prosecutor of GPE at the material time , said that it \u201c was established that the law - enforcement authorities of GPE and of the GPE Region regularly take measures aimed at revealing foreign nationals unlawfully residing in GPE and GPE . These measures are realised in accordance with the rules of LAW , the NORP \u201c ORG Activities \u201d Act ( \u041e\u0431 \u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0440\u043e\u0437\u044b\u0441\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 ORG ) and departmental regulations including those constituting a ORG secret . In DATE CARDINAL foreign nationals were sent back from GPE to their countries ; CARDINAL of them had NORP nationality . No cases of abuse of authority were revealed on the part of officers of the militia department . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his report the Commissioner described the reply from the Deputy General Prosecutor as follows : \u201c in the best bureaucratic traditions the document gave no answer to any of the questions posed by the Commissioner . Instead , the \u201c reply \u201d from the Deputy General Prosecutor included a short report on the successes of the GPE lawenforcement authorities and , in a reference to departmental regulations classified as \u201c secret \u201d , confirmed that there was no evidence of the employees having exceeded their authority . Whether this means that as a result the sub - departments of ORG of GPE and GPE did not carry out their superior \u2019s manifestly illegal directions remains unclear . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant ORG also submitted CARDINAL letters from ORG of CARDINAL GPE districts \u2013 GPE ( Head at the material time : PERSON ) and PERSON ( Deputy Head at the material time : Mr PERSON ) DATE sent on CARDINAL and DATE to schools for the purpose of identifying NORP pupils with the aim , among other things , of \u201c ensuring public order and respect for the law , preventing terrorist acts and tensions between children living in GPE and children of NORP nationality ( \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c ) \u201d ( letter from PERSON ) . In a letter in reply dated DATE , the director of CARDINAL of those establishments at the material time ( Mr PERSON ) said that there was no register recording pupils on the basis of their nationality ( the letters from Mr Zakharov and PERSON also appear in the LOC to the PACE and ORG reports ) . The sending of these requests for information was widely commented upon in the NORP media .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government did not dispute the existence of the letters and even acknowledged that other requests of the same type had been sent to various schools at DATE by the head of ORG LOC of GPE ( ORG at the material time ) , on the ground that she wanted to identify cases of bribes paid to schools by illegal immigrants , and by the Head of ORG of LOC in LOC ( Mrs S.V. Volkova at the material time ) , on the ground that she wanted to identify cases of children living in insalubrious conditions . The respondent Government submitted that the subsequent investigations had concluded that no such official instructions had been issued by ORG . However , where \u2013 in isolated cases \u2013 officials had been over - zealous , they had subsequently been punished for their illegal acts . The documents submitted by the respondent Government show that the officials in question were respectively reprimanded ( \u0432\u044b\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 ) , downgraded and disciplined . At the witness hearing PERSON , ORG , ORG of ORG in respect of Minors , ORG of the Interior , PERSON , at the material time , and PERSON , Deputy Head of ORG , GPE , GPE , at the material time , confirmed that information and explained how the official investigations had been carried out and the penalties imposed on PERSON and PERSON among others ( see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The respondent Government also submitted a letter of DATE from the Deputy General Prosecutor of GPE to all prosecutors pointing out that various internal affairs directorates had acted unlawfully with regard to nationals of ORG ( ORG ) . He referred in particular to unjustified requests sent to schools for the purpose of identifying pupils of NORP nationality and concluded the letter by inviting all prosecutors to intensify their supervision of the activities of those divisions with a view to guaranteeing respect for the rights and freedoms of nationals of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The international governmental and non - governmental organisations , for their part , referred to coordinated action between the administrative and judicial authorities , with express reference to the instruction of DATE ( no . CARDINAL ) and to circular no . CARDINAL of ORG of GPE and GPE of DATE ( PACE report , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL , ORG report , \u00a7 DATE , and FIDH report , pp . CARDINAL and DATE ) . At the witness hearing PERSON , rapporteur of ORG at the material time , said that the expulsion of such a large number of NORP nationals within such a short space of time could not have been done without the knowledge and instructions of fairly highranking persons among the NORP authorities .", "CARDINAL . The FIDH indicated , moreover , that \u201c human - rights and refugeesprotection organisations present in GPE consider that a campaign conducted in such an ostensible manner throughout NORP territory can only have been initiated on a written order from the hierarchy of ORG . And whilst the top officials of ORG and ORG have denied giving explicit repressive orders targeting NORP , many members of the \u201c Migration and Law \u201d network of \u201c Memorial \u201d [ NORP non - governmental human rights organisation ] have seen in the regional departments or police stations written [ instructions ] containing all the elements present in the campaign . The case of the [ secret circular issued by ORG of GPE and GPE ] and letters sent to schools in GPE ( see paragraphs DATE above ) can not be regarded as isolated cases \u201d ( FIDH report , pp . CARDINAL ; for requests for information sent to schools , see also PACE report , ORG , and ORG report , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . It is in dispute between the parties whether the NORP nationals who were expelled had complied with the immigration rules in GPE during the period in question . Many international governmental and non - governmental organisations have stressed the complexity of those rules ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the NORP witnesses who gave evidence at the witness hearing , even though their legal situation in GPE often appeared confused , the ORG notes that a majority of them were formally unlawfully resident in GPE \u2013 some for DATE for various reasons ( for example , no valid work permit , visa or registration certificate , often issued fraudulently DATE unbeknown to them \u2013 by the many private agencies operating fairly widely in GPE ) . They stated that their papers had indeed been checked on occasions in the past , sometimes resulting in the payment of a sum of money , but that this was the first time they had been arrested and forcibly expelled from NORP territory .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , Consul of GPE in GPE at the material time , said that the official procedures were difficult to carry out in practice and that many foreign nationals , including NORP , had been tricked by private agencies , many of which acted illegally and even issued forged registration certificates . He added that in the NORP Federation recourse was commonly had to these private agencies , which advertised in all public places in the big cities ( see GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , Deputy Head of ORG , GPE , at the material time , and PERSON PERSON , Inspector from ORG in the same department at the material time , pointed out that only the official authorities were empowered to issue such documents and that they regularly published relevant information for the attention of foreign nationals . They confirmed the existence of such private agencies , but stressed that their activities were often illegal and were the subject of criminal proceedings , without , however , providing specific examples ( see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Following the witness hearing , the impugned events may be summarised as follows : identity checks of NORP nationals were carried out in the streets , markets and other workplaces and at their homes , and they were subsequently arrested and taken to police stations . After a period of custody in police stations ( ranging from TIME to DATE , according to the witness evidence ) , they were grouped together and taken by bus to the courts , which summarily imposed administrative penalties on them and gave decisions ordering their administrative expulsion from NORP territory . Subsequently , after sometimes undergoing a medical visit and a blood test , they were taken to detention centres for foreigners where they were detained for varying periods of time ( ranging from DATE according to the witness evidence ) , and then taken by bus to various airports in GPE , and expelled to GPE by aeroplane . It should be pointed out that some of the NORP nationals against whom expulsion orders were issued left the territory of GPE by their own means .", "CARDINAL . The NORP witnesses said that they had been arrested by NORP police officers on the pretext that their identity papers were not in order . They had often been unable to take their personal effects with them or inform their relatives . When they had asked why they were being arrested , they had been told that it was because they were NORP and that there was an order from above to expel NORP nationals ( witness statements nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , Deputy Head of ORG , GPE , at the material time , and PERSON PERSON , Inspector from ORG in the same department at the material time , said that their departments undertook , on the basis of information received , identity checks of foreign nationals or employers suspected of having broken the immigration rules in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The NORP witnesses all stated that a very summary procedure had been followed before the courts . Often they had not even realised that they had been brought before a court ( witness statements nos . CARDINAL , CARDINAL and DATE see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) . Whilst some of them mentioned an interview with a judge , lasting TIME on average and with no real examination of the facts of the case ( witness statements nos . CARDINAL and DATE see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and DATE ) , others said that they had not been admitted to the courtroom and had waited in the corridors , or even in the buses that had delivered them to the court ( witness statements nos . CARDINAL and DATE see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL ) , with other NORP nationals ( their number varied CARDINAL ) . They said that they had then been ordered to sign the court decisions without having had an opportunity to read the contents or being able to obtain a copy of the decision . They had not had access to either an interpreter or a lawyer ( witness statements nos . CARDINAL , DATE see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE and CARDINAL) . As a general rule , both the judges and the police officers had discouraged them from appealing by telling them that there was an order to expel NORP nationals , and in any event they had been so stressed at the idea of remaining in detention any longer and so eager to return to GPE that they would have signed \u201c anything at all \u201d . When they had asked why they were being expelled , they had been told that it was because they were NORP and that they should ask their President , PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , Consul of GPE in GPE at the material time , said that NORP officials had privately told him that such appeals were pointless because the decision to expel NORP from GPE was a political one ( see GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , Inspector from ORG , GPE , at the material time , described the procedures before the courts as follows : the defendant was brought before a judge who informed him of his rights and obligations , asked him if he wanted an interpreter and a lawyer to be present , and , if so , his request was taken into account ; the judge then asked the defendant questions about his particular situation , left the room and came back with the order . If it was an expulsion order , the defendant received a copy and was taken to the detention centre for foreigners with a view to his or her expulsion . He or she had DATE in which to appeal , even after being expelled from GPE , and that time - limit could be extended ( see GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON , Head of ORG , GPE , at the material time , explained that at the relevant time his division had identified procedural irregularities particularly regarding the manner in which ORG had been drawing up reports on foreign nationals from a number of countries . In CARDINAL cases those findings had led to the expulsion orders in question being set aside . He added that ORG in charge of LOC had requested all his divisions to ensure that the rights of all foreign nationals were duly respected . He said that there had never been any instructions restricting the rights of NORP nationals because that would be against the law , and even a crime under NORP law .", "CARDINAL . The NORP witnesses spoke of \u201c overcrowding \u201d , \u201c unbearable \u201d and \u201c inhuman \u201d conditions of detention and appalling conditions of hygiene , and said that their fellow detainees had mainly been NORP nationals , though there had sometimes been CARDINAL or CARDINAL other detainees of a different nationality .", "CARDINAL . They said that during their custody in the police stations , the cells , which were called \u201c monkey cages \u201d , had been tiny and overcrowded , that men and women had sometimes been detained together and that they had been unable to sit down ( witness statements nos . CARDINAL and DATE see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . They said that in the detention centres for foreigners the cells were also overcrowded : the description of the size of the cells ranged from CARDINAL mCARDINAL for CARDINAL detainees , QUANTITY for CARDINAL detainees with CARDINAL beds ( witness statement no . CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL x CARDINAL footsteps for CARDINAL detainees with CARDINAL beds ( witness statement no . CARDINAL ) , and QUANTITY mCARDINAL with CARDINAL detainees and QUANTITY beds ( witness statement no . CARDINAL ) . Other witnesses referred to tiny cells with CARDINAL or CARDINAL detainees ( witness statements nos . CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) or with CARDINAL detainees and CARDINAL beds ( witness statement no . DATE see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE ) . The beds had consisted merely of iron bars or very thin mattresses and no blankets ; the detainees had had to take it in turns to sleep ; a bucket had served as a toilet and had not been separated from the rest of the cells ; and there had been no decent water or food .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , Consul of GPE in GPE at the material time , said that he and his team had visited CARDINAL detention centres in various regions of GPE , including those of GPE and GPE . He confirmed that there had mainly been NORP nationals detained in all the centres , that the cells were overcrowded , the conditions of detention very difficult , the hygiene appalling , and that there were too few beds and mattresses . Only the detention centre no . CARDINAL of GPE ( model centre shown to journalists ) offered better conditions of detention , though it too was overcrowded ( see GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , Deputy Head of ORG , GPE , at the material time , said that he was in charge of the CARDINAL detention centres in GPE and that he had visited all of them : the conditions of detention were the same for all foreigners , namely , large cells of QUANTITY , with beds , separate toilets , running water and hot meals served CARDINAL times per day ( see GPE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Other NORP witnesses said that there had never been any complaints by the Consul of GPE or by NORP nationals regarding the conditions of detention .", "CARDINAL . The NORP witnesses stated that they and other NORP nationals had been taken by bus , accompanied by officers from the NORP special police force ( PERSON ) , to various GPE airports from which they had been expelled by aeroplane to GPE . They said they had been humiliated by ORG officers , such as being obliged to pay in the bus before being allowed to relieve themselves or smoke or take their personal effects ( witness statements nos . CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE see GPE , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE , DATE and DATE ) , and subsequently having to walk or even run towards the aeroplane with their hands behind their back in human corridors formed by ORG officers . The first NORP nationals to be expelled had been flown in a cargo plane ( on DATE ) , and the next ones in airliners ( on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE ) . Although the conditions of transport in the airliner had been acceptable , those in the cargo plane had been very rudimentary : the NORP witnesses said that there had been CARDINAL rows of benches on which women and children ( CARDINAL ) had sat , with the men sitting on the floor or having to stand , and that a sort of tub had served as a toilet and had circulated between the rows . The estimated number of NORP passengers in the planes varied CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , Inspector from ORG , GPE , at the material time , said that the cargo planes resembled airliners with slightly less comfort ; in any event they had been equipped with seats or benches and with safety belts , and water and food had been served on board , and there had been toilets fixed to the floor . He had himself accompanied the cargo plane flight on DATE , and explained that the flight had lasted TIME , that there had been CARDINAL passengers on board and they had not complained about the conditions of transport but had thanked the members of his department on arrival in GPE . On the way back , the same plane had flown NORP nationals from GPE to GPE .", "CARDINAL . Mr Azarov , Deputy Head of ORG , GPE , at the material time , had been present at GPE and GPE and had boarded CARDINAL planes carrying NORP nationals being expelled to GPE . He said that the planes had been equipped with seats and benches , and that water and dry biscuits had been served on board .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON , Deputy Head of ORG at the material time , stated that he had been present at the airport when the NORP nationals were expelled and stressed that there had been no baggage restrictions ; on the contrary they had had their personal effects on them and the media had been present . Subsequently , in a letter of thanks sent by the Consul of GPE to the head of ORG of the town of PERSON ( PERSON ) the former had congratulated the NORP authorities on their good co - operation during the expulsion procedures , and had not filed a claim .", "CARDINAL . The NORP witnesses stressed that they were relieved to be back in GPE and did not envisage appealing against the expulsion orders to the consulate or embassy of GPE in GPE . In any case , during the procedures before the courts in GPE both the judges and the police officers had told them several times that it was pointless to appeal because there was an order from above to expel NORP nationals . Some also referred to practical obstacles such as the closure of the NORP consulate in GPE , while others spoke of long queues outside the consulate .", "CARDINAL . Mr GPE , Consul of GPE in GPE at the material time , said that after the repatriation of some of the diplomatic staff of the GPE embassy and consulate to GPE at DATE the embassy had continued operating normally , during the usual TIME ( TIME ) , with a reduced workforce of QUANTITY people ( diplomats and administrative staff ) at the embassy and CARDINAL diplomats at the consulate . The NORP nationals could therefore have lodged appeals or complaints DATE personally , or through ORG of GPE DATE which would have been transmitted to the appropriate authorities in GPE , but no appeal or complaint had been lodged . After diplomatic relations between the CARDINAL countries had been broken off , from DATE , GPE had kept an office open at the NORP embassy in GPE and GPE had also kept CARDINAL open at the NORP embassy in GPE . The respective diplomats of both countries could have been contacted there ( see GPE , \u00a7 DATE ) . In their letter of DATE the respondent Government confirmed that following the evacuation of some of their diplomatic staff at DATE , CARDINAL members of the diplomatic staff had continued working at the NORP embassy in GPE and CARDINAL at the consulate .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) . NORP nationals and \u201c ethnic NORP \u201d were allegedly victims of a deliberate policy of detention and expulsion ( HRW report , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP HRW cited the comments of PERSON , then Head of ORG in GPE ( State body advising the NORP President on all matters relating to civil society and human rights ) , who said that \u201c administrative and legal measures applied [ against NORP ] are unfounded : businesses employing ethnic NORP are being closed down , visas and registration papers legally obtained by NORP nationals are being cancelled , people are being illegally detained and [ expelled ] from GPE \u201d ( statement of DATE , p.

Other NORP institutions also expressed their concern regarding the large number of NORP expelled and asked the NORP authorities to revoke all the measures taken against NORP nationals residing on their territory ( speech of DATE by PERSON , member of ORG for ORG and ORG ; Joint motion for a resolution of DATE of ORG on the situation in GPE , points ORG and CARDINAL and DATE ; Statement of DATE of ORG against Racism and Intolerance ( ECRI ) ) .", "DATE . ORG said that the \u201c routine of expulsions \u201d followed a recurrent pattern all over the country : \u201c NORP stopped in the street under the pretext of examination of their documents were detained no matter whether their documents were in order or not and taken to the ORG stations where they were gathered in large groups and delivered to courts , where decisions on administrative penalty with expulsion of the territory of GPE were made in accordance with preliminary agreement with the courts , with no lawyers and without the courts looking into individual circumstances , the entire procedure taking from TIME . Often people , subjected to these measures , were not admitted to the trial room , detainees were kept in corridors or even in cars in which they were delivered there \u201d ( PACE report , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . That description tallies with that of the FIDH and ORG ( FIDH report , pp .

CARDINAL under \u201c Arbitrary and illegal detention and expulsion of NORP \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . According to ORG , \u201c while many expelled [ NORP nationals ] may technically have had a judicial decision ordering their expulsion , the manner in which those decisions were reached ( some in group trials ) , the lack of representation and capacity to mount a proper case against the expulsion , and the fact that many were effectively denied the right to appeal , points to GPE \u2019s failure to comply with its ORG obligations \u201d ( ORG report , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The FIDH , for its part , indicated that \u201c the persons arrested were taken in groups to the courts , which in TIME ordered them to be expelled from GPE , preceded by a period of detention in a temporary detention centre for foreign citizens ( TsVSIG ) , regardless of the conditions or the individual \u2019s family situation \u201d ( FIDH report , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It added that a lawyer from \u201c Civic Assistance \u201d , a NORP association , \u201c witnessed on several occasions mass miscarriages of justice during the campaign : not only did the arrestees have no right to a lawyer , but they were most frequently brought in groups to the courts by police officers . Once there , the judges dealt with the cases as though on a production line and usually without those concerned by the expulsion orders being present and without even having regard to the circumstances of each case . These notices of expulsion were presented to the detainees ; many signed thinking that they were signing a fine as part of a range of possible administrative penalties for offences against the immigration rules . On several occasions the persons concerned were discouraged in advance from appealing against the order on the ground that \u201c it would make matters worse \u201d . In some cases \u201c agreements \u201d were signed in the deportees\u2019 place \u201d ( FIDH report , p. CARDINAL ) .", "It also stated that \u201c a number of factors point to collusion between the police and the judicial authorities , establishing that this policy was devised in advance : in GPE evidence of collusion between the police and the courts lies in the fact that the latter had not listed any other cases during the periods when the police brought NORP before the courts . They were arrested at TIME and presented as a group before the courts at TIME The judges gave a larger number of decisions in DATE than they normally give in DATE \u201d ( FIDH report , p. CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . With regard to the conditions of detention and expulsion , ORG referred to the witnesses it had heard during the mission undertaken by the co - rapporteurs who spoke of \u201c overcrowding \u201d and \u201c unbearable \u201d and \u201c inhuman \u201d conditions of detention .

The Deputy Head of ORG at the material time , Mr GPE , said that the detention facility in question was being closed down . ORG also referred to the case of a second NORP national , PERSON , aged DATE , who had died on DATE in GPE detention centre no . DATE of inadequate medical assistance and after being refused urgent medical aid ( PACE report , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "Lastly , ORG referred to the conditions in which NORP nationals had been transported by cargo flights at DATE . This had been done in violation of the norms of ORG as such transportation of passengers was life - threatening ( PACE report , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The FIDH specified that there were \u201c CARDINAL temporary detention centres for foreigners ( TsVSIG ) in GPE and the surrounding areas , which were mainly converted former sobering - up cells .

In front of the one on FAC , there was a queue of police cars nearly QUANTITY km long waiting to offload arrested persons at a centre with space for CARDINAL people . Detainees said that there had been CARDINAL people instead of CARDINAL per cell , and that the food rations had not been increased . Moreover , there had been so many people that the TsVSIG had not even had time to draw up the documents discharging detainees . \u201d The FIDH also referred to CARDINAL cases of death in detention or during the journey prior to expulsion ( FIDH report , pp .

The case of CARDINAL other NORP nationals who had died in detention was also mentioned . Furthermore , the NORP authorities had allegedly failed to carry out sufficient investigations following those deaths despite their obligation to do so under LAW .", "On the second point ORG indicated that many NORP nationals had been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment on account of the poor conditions of detention and expulsion ( overcrowded cells , lack of water and food , and transporting CARDINAL NORP nationals by cargo plane ) .", "CARDINAL . Before undertaking an examination on the merits and an assessment of the evidence on the basis of each complaint , the ORG will set out all the written and oral evidence to which it has had regard and the principles of assessment that it will apply .", "CARDINAL . In order to establish the facts the ORG has based itself on the parties\u2019 observations and the many documents submitted by them and on the statements of the witnesses heard in GPE .", "CARDINAL . It has also had regard to the reports by international governmental and non - governmental organisations such as ORG , ORG , the FIDH and the annual report of DATE of the Human Rights Commissioner of GPE ( NORP Ombudsman ) . Some of the documents submitted by the applicant Government also appear in these reports .", "CARDINAL . Furthermore , in letters of DATE and CARDINAL DATE and during the witness hearing the ORG requested the respondent Government to produce the following additional documents :", "i ) DATE statistics regarding the expulsion of NORP nationals during DATE and DATE , to enable a comparison to be made between expulsions before and after DATE , during which mass arrests and expulsions of NORP nationals allegedly began ; the respondent Government replied that they kept only DATE and DATE statistics that they had submitted to the ORG ;", "ii ) the CARDINAL circulars FAC . ORG and CARDINAL of DATE that had been issued by ORG of GPE and GPE and ORG of GPE respectively and to which the documents submitted by the applicant Government refer ; the respondent Government disputed the authenticity of those documents and said that they could not submit the circulars in question because they were classified \u201c ORG secret \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) ;", "iii ) the files relating to the disciplinary proceedings brought against NORP officials who had sent requests to various NORP schools asking for lists of NORP pupils ; the respondent Government submitted a copy of several documents indicating that disciplinary penalties had been imposed on the officials in question ;", "iv ) statistics on the number of decisions given on appeal by the NORP courts against decisions expelling NORP nationals during the period in question ( DATE to DATE ) ; in their letter in reply of DATE the respondent Government again said that they did not have DATE statistics relating to the expulsion of NORP nationals ( the nationality of perpetrators of administrative offences did not appear in the statistics of ordinary courts and an electronic database for the entire GPE had existed only since DATE ) , but that they could nonetheless provide information obtained manually for the period concerned from the courts of CARDINAL regions of GPE by providing the ORG with copies of CARDINAL appeal decisions . It should be mentioned that CARDINAL of these decisions concern NORP nationals expelled during the period in question , CARDINAL of which set aside decisions of the courts of first instance . Moreover , of the CARDINAL appeal decisions submitted to the ORG , CARDINAL concerned GPE and CARDINAL GPE , whereas the majority of expulsions of NORP nationals took place in those CARDINAL cities . Lastly , CARDINAL appeal decision out of the CARDINAL concerning GPE and CARDINAL appeal decisions out of the CARDINAL concerning GPE concerned referrals back to the administrative authorities on the ground that the police officers had taken the NORP nationals directly to the courts without first taking them to ORG as provided for by law .", "CARDINAL . During DATE to CARDINAL DATE the delegation of judges of ORG heard a total of CARDINAL witnesses , CARDINAL of whom had been proposed by the applicant Government , QUANTITY by the respondent Government and CARDINAL chosen by the delegation .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL witnesses proposed by the applicant Government ( except witness no . CARDINAL , wife of the late Mr PERSON and who was an \u201c indirect \u201d witness to the events , and Mr PERSON , Consul of GPE in GPE at the material time ) are NORP nationals who were arrested , detained and expelled by the NORP authorities . Their evidence concerned the conditions of arrest , detention and expulsion in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL witnesses proposed by the respondent Government are public officials of GPE , whose evidence concerned in particular the conditions of arrest , detention and expulsion of NORP nationals , statistical data and the authenticity of the instructions issued by ORG of GPE and GPE and the circulars to which they refer .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL witnesses chosen by the ORG are Mr E\u00f6rsi , rapporteur of ORG at the material time , and PERSON , a human - rights official with the LOC mission in GPE at the material time .", "CARDINAL . The delegation had also planned to hear other witnesses , including Mr GPE , Acting Head of ORG of GPE and GPE at the material time , and presumed signatory to the instruction of DATE aiming to \u201c [ increase ] the effectiveness of the implementation of ... circular no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL \u201d ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .

Lastly , the delegation had also wanted to hear PERSON , Head of ORG in GPE at the material time . However , it was not possible to hear her as a witness because , as explained in a letter of DATE , the respondent Government informed the ORG that PERSON was no longer a public official but a private individual and that they were therefore unable to provide the ORG with her address . It should be reiterated here that Contracting Parties have an obligation to serve any summons on a witness residing on its territory ( see Rule ACARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , first sentence , of the FAC to ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . In assessing evidence the ORG has adopted the standard of proof \u201c beyond reasonable doubt \u201d laid down by it in CARDINAL inter - State cases ( see GPE v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL , Series A no . CARDINAL , and GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIV ) and which has since become part of its established case - law ( see , inter alia , ORG and Others v. GPE and GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG , and ORG and Others v. GPE , nos . ORG and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . However , it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems that use that standard in criminal cases . The ORG \u2019s role is to rule not on guilt under criminal law or on civil liability but on Contracting States\u2019 responsibility under the Convention . The specificity of its task under LAW to ensure the observance by LAW of their engagements to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention \u2013 conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof . In the proceedings before the ORG , there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence or predetermined formulae for its assessment . It adopts the conclusions that are , in its view , supported by the free evaluation of all evidence , including such inferences as may flow from the facts and the parties\u2019 submissions . According to its established case - law , proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong , clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact . Moreover , the level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and , in this connection , the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts , the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake . ORG is also attentive to the seriousness that attaches to a ruling that a ORG has violated fundamental rights ( see , inter alia , PERSON and Others v. GPE [ ORG ] , ORG . MONEY and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VII , and PERSON the GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINALIX ) .", "CARDINAL . In establishing the existence of an administrative practice , the ORG will not rely on the concept that the burden of proof is borne by CARDINAL or other of the CARDINAL Governments concerned , but will rather study all the material before it , from whatever source it originates ( see GPE v. the GPE and GPE v. GPE , cited above , ibid . ) . In addition , the conduct of the parties in relation to the ORG \u2019s efforts to obtain evidence may constitute an element to be taken into account ( see GPE v. the GPE ; ORG and Others ; and ORG and Others , cited above , ibid . ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["13", "3", "38", "5", "P4"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["5-1", "5-4", "P4-4"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8", "P1", "P7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["8-1", "P1-1", "P1-2", "P7-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1", "P7-1-1"]}
