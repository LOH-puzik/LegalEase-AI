It appears that the court instructed GPE to provide proof of registration , which it did not produce . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the court declared the application for judicial review inadmissible . It noted that on DATE Ilinden had been refused registration as a non - profit association ( see ORG and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) . In view of this and of the fact that the application concerned a rally which was due to take place on DATE of the court \u2019s decision DATE it was obvious that the court \u2019s instructions could not be complied with . The application was therefore defective and could not be examined .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE PERSON objected , saying that they could not change the date and the time because according to NORP cultural tradition the dead had to be commemorated either on DATE of their death or on the closest DATE , and that , moreover , the grave had to be accessible to everyone .

In a decision of DATE LOC found that the application for judicial review was inadmissible . Only bans on rallies were subject to judicial review , whereas the Mayor \u2019s letter did not amount to such a ban .

After the pupils left the scene , the participants in the rally were allowed to put the posters back up .

However , the holding of a school holiday prevented the parallel holding of GPE \u2019s rally . In the court \u2019s view , it was inopportune to allow adults and children to gather at the same time and place , to concurrently stage a school event and a political one , as \u201c the children \u2019s fragile minds should not be subjected to the political interventions and influences which would inevitably occur if the CARDINAL events [ were ] allowed to proceed together .

In a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG refused to open a criminal investigation , as the acts alleged in the complaint did not constitute publicly prosecutable offences . The bodily injuries suffered by the first ORG member were minor and therefore gave cause for a private prosecution , the destroyed property was not of great value , which made its destruction a trivial occurrence which should not be criminally prosecuted , and the proffering of insults also gave cause for a private prosecution only .", "CARDINAL .

On DATE ORG filed an application for judicial review with ORG . It argued that the Mayor \u2019s refusals to allow the rally as planned were unlawful , as PERSON was willing to shift the timing of the event , but could not shrink it into the short timeframe allowed by the Mayor .

Ilinden therefore asked the court to set aside the Mayor \u2019s decisions and allow the rally to be staged TIME on DATE .", "DATE . In a decision of DATE LOC declared the application inadmissible . It held that the Mayor had not banned the rally , but merely proposed a change in its timing , as was his duty under section CARDINAL ) of the DATE Meetings and Marches Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Only bans on rallies were reviewable by the courts , and only after such bans had been appealed against to the municipal council . Moreover , the Act did not give the courts jurisdiction to allow the holding of rallies .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ilinden appealed to ORG , relying , inter alia , on the ORG \u2019s judgment in the case of PERSON and Others v. PERSON ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , DATE ) . It is unclear what the outcome of the proceedings was .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Regional Governor of ORG , acting of his own motion , annulled the Mayor \u2019s letter of CARDINAL DATE allowing the rally . He reasoned that it amounted to an administrative decision , creating legal rights for ORG , and that it was unlawful . Firstly , the organisation was not registered ; on the contrary , in DATE ORG had upheld ORG judgment turning down a request by ORG PIRIN to be registered as a political party ( see ORG PIRIN and Others v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL , DATE ) . Since it was accordingly unlawful under NORP law , it had no standing to give notice of its intention to hold a rally . Secondly , the proposed rally would put public order at risk . ORG was a place visited by many tourists , especially at DATE . It was therefore inappropriate to allow the staging of a rally there . Moreover , rallies and meetings were being organised at those locations at the same time by the local authorities and non - governmental organisations . As clashes between supporters of ORG and others had taken place in the past , it was necessary to ban its rally . Finally , the activities of the organisation were contrary to NORP law , as they consisted in propaganda against the country \u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and aroused national and ethnic hatred .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicants , on DATE many bus companies hired to transport participants in the rally to ORG desisted , under pressure from the police . CARDINAL cars carrying materials for a stage to be erected at the site of the rally were stopped by the police and not allowed to continue . A bus transporting a group of singers was also diverted by the police . A number of other cars with participants were stopped and searched by the police while en route to GPE . The grave of PERSON was surrounded by CARDINAL uniformed police officers and a number of plainclothes ones , who did not allow the participants in the rally to approach it . No other organisations were present .", "CARDINAL . According to the Government , ORG was able to hold the rally , in the presence of many NORP journalists and representatives of ORG of the \u201c former GPE \u201d . The alleged difficulties with the transportation of the participants were overblown ; the police had done nothing more than to ensure the smooth commemoration by various organisations of the anniversary of PERSON death . It was not true that participants in the rally had been stopped and searched .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Ilinden notified the Mayor of ORG of its intention to stage a rally on FAC , in front of PERSON monument , at TIME on CARDINAL DATE .

It would TIME .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Mayor replied that the notification could not be examined as ORG had not produced documents proving its official registration . It was thus impossible to identify the \u201c managing bodies of [ the ] event \u201d . Moreover , on CARDINAL DATE the municipality was organising children \u2019s games on FAC , so that the staging of ORG \u2019s event could not be allowed .", "CARDINAL . Ilinden filed an application for judicial review with ORG . It argued , inter alia , that there was no risk that breaches of public order or traffic disturbances would occur .
