THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Violation of Art. 5-1;Not necessary to examine Art. 5-4;Not necessary to examine Art. 13+5-4;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings", "JUDGES": "R. Pekkanen", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant is an NORP national born in DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was convicted on CARDINAL counts of manslaughter by ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) on DATE . He had broken into the homes of CARDINAL elderly ladies whom he had strangled to death , both these incidents taking place within the space of DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was sentenced to DATE imprisonment ( with deduction of the period spent in detention on remand ) and placement at the disposal of the government ( terbeschikkingstelling ) with committal to a psychiatric institution . Although the period of placement at such an institution does not usually begin until the date on which the person concerned is eligible for DATE which in the present case would have been DATE due to his disturbed mental state the authorities decided to commence the applicant \u2019s treatment prior to DATE ( LAW CARDINAL of the Prisons Ordinance \u2013 Gevangenismaatregel \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . Accordingly , the applicant was placed at the disposal of the government in a psychiatric institution for a DATE period commencing DATE ( see paragraph DATE below ) .", "CARDINAL . According to Article CARDINALo \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW ( PERSON , hereinafter referred to as \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a request for the extension of a placement order must be made by the public prosecutor not DATE before the expiry of the previous period of placement ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . DATE for making such a request in the present case was therefore DATE . A letter to this effect was sent by the ORG Secretary of ORG to the public prosecutor on CARDINAL DATE , the latter having received on CARDINAL DATE the recommendations of the psychiatric institution where the applicant was being treated regarding the prolongation of his period of placement ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the public prosecutor prepared a request for a DATE extension of the applicant 's placement . The applicant was informed of this fact by letter of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , which he received in person on DATE . The applicant was also informed that during the judicial examination of the request he could be represented by counsel . The request prepared by the public prosecutor , however , did not arrive at that time at the registry of ORG of Groningen but was , apparently by mistake , placed in the archives of the court .", "CARDINAL . DATE after receiving the letter of the public prosecutor , the applicant alerted the staff in the psychiatric institution to the fact that he had not received any further information regarding the extension of his placement . The request of the public prosecutor was found in the archives of the court on DATE , and was received at the court 's registry on DATE . On DATE the psychiatric institution submitted additional observations concerning its recommendation to extend the hospital order .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings regarding the extension of his placement , the applicant asked ORG to declare the public prosecutor 's request inadmissible on the ground that both LAW of the ORG and LAW had been violated . The public prosecutor submitted an explanation in writing as to the reasons why the request had not been lodged in time arguing that the request should not be declared inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . ORG examined the application on DATE . In its decision of DATE , the court rejected the applicant 's objections and extended his placement at the government \u2019s disposal for DATE . Pursuant to LAW ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) no appeal lay against this decision , as it concerned a first extension not exceeding DATE .", "CARDINAL . In its decision ORG stated as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL . It appears from the contents of the relevant documents that the request for an extension of the placement at the disposal of the government should have been submitted not DATE . According to the stamp indicating the receipt , the request was not received and registered at the registry of ORG until DATE .", "CARDINAL . The Code of Criminal Procedure does not indicate any consequences of a failure to observe the time - limit contained in LAW . However , in view of the wording of the provision and its legal history , the ORG is of the opinion that failure to observe the said time - limit should in principle result in the inadmissibility of the public prosecutor 's application . This conclusion can be drawn from the fact that failure to respect this procedural provision is not in conformity with the proper administration of justice .", "CARDINAL . However , in some cases special circumstances might exist which would justify a departure from that principle . The ORG considers that such special circumstances are present in this case .", "CARDINAL . The provision referred to has a specific procedural significance and aims at letting the judge examine periodically whether an extension of the judicial measure is necessary . Indirectly the provision also protects the interests of the person placed at the government 's disposal since it ensures that this person will know in good time whether or not there will be a request for an extension . In the present case the interests of that person were not prejudiced since the request was notified to him in person on DATE . He has therefore been able to obtain legal assistance in time and he has not been left in any doubt as to the intentions of the public prosecutor for an unnecessarily protracted period .", "CARDINAL . It remains to be examined whether the failure to comply with the time - limit has been prejudicial to the fairness of the proceedings . In considering this question , the ORG must have regard , inter alia , to the fact that the placement at the disposal of the government remains in force as long as there is no final decision on the request . Although there has been a failure to comply with the time - limit for requesting the extension , it does not follow that the deprivation of liberty is unlawful .", "CARDINAL . In substance , there has not been a failure to respect the time - limit within which the request must be made . The public prosecutor prepared a request for an extension in time and he communicated it DATE to the person placed at the government 's disposal .", "Because of circumstances , which have been further explained in the written memorial of the public prosecutor , it was not possible , however , for the ORG to decide earlier on this request , which had been prepared in time . It is not possible to consider this a flagrant violation of the procedural provisions . The public prosecutor may only be reproached for the fact that the request did not arrive at the registry of this ORG in time , which means that the request was only formally submitted too late .", "CARDINAL . Moreover an evaluation must be made of the various interests involved in the sense that the interest of the person placed at the government 's disposal in having the violated legal provision respected must be weighed against the general interest which might be harmed by a decision which would lead to the termination of the placement at the disposal of the government .", "CARDINAL . The Court considers that , in view of the circumstances set out below , the latter interest must prevail .", "The measure was originally imposed because of CARDINAL acts of manslaughter . The above - mentioned opinions of the institution quite clearly refer to the necessity of prolonging this coercive measure . The risk of further criminal behaviour is considered still to be present to the same degree , since the person concerned can still not appreciate the vulnerability of his personality . The supplementary opinion regarding the extension repeats this conclusion and also mentions an incident in which violence took place between the person concerned and another person held in the institution . On this occasion he lost his senses for a short while and it was necessary to isolate him for some time in his room . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG has since extended the applicant \u2019s placement twice .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the Criminal Code makes manslaughter a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding DATE or a fine not exceeding MONEY ( NLG ) .", "CARDINAL . A person who has been found guilty of certain serious crimes and who , at the time of committing an offence , suffered from a mental deficiency or derangement may be placed at the government \u2019s disposal if required in the interests of the safety of others or more generally in the interests of the safety of persons or goods . Such a measure , which is not considered a punishment , may be imposed instead of or together with a prison sentence ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW ) . The sentencing court may further decide that the person concerned shall receive psychiatric treatment at the government \u2019s expense ( Article CARDINALb ) .", "CARDINAL . A person sentenced to a term of imprisonment may , by order of the Minister of ORG , be made to serve his sentence in an institution for the treatment of persons placed at the disposal of the government if such a course is indicated by his or her impaired mental development or a mental disturbance ( LAW and LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . According to Article PERSON of LAW a person shall be placed at the disposal of the government for an initial period of DATE which may be extended , at the request of the public prosecutor , for a further period of CARDINAL or DATE . The period of placement can not be extended beyond a total of DATE unless the crime committed by the person concerned was a crime of violence committed against , or causing danger to , CARDINAL or more persons or such further extension is necessary for the protection of other persons ( Article PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . The provisions relating to the extension of the placement at the disposal of the government are laid down in ORG CARDINALo to CARDINAL of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINALo \u00a7 CARDINAL provides :", "\u201c The public prosecutor \u2019s office ( openbaar ministerie ) may submit a request ( vordering ) for the prolongation of the placement at the government \u2019s disposal no sooner than DATE and DATE before the time at which the placement order is due to expire . \u201d", "The request must be accompanied by a recent recommendation prepared by the institution in which the patient is being treated ( LAW ) . In accordance with the provisions of LAW , the person concerned must be given a copy of the request as soon as possible .", "CARDINAL . NORP The court competent to decide on such a request is ORG that tried the person concerned at first instance for the crime that gave rise to the placement ( Article CARDINALp ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to LAW , if a request for the extension of the placement is submitted to ORG , the initial placement order shall remain in force until the decision of the court is rendered . If the request is granted after the date on which the placement would have expired had no request for prolongation been submitted , the new period of placement is nonetheless considered to have commenced as from DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG must immediately set a date for the examination of the case , and the person concerned must be informed promptly of this date ( Article LAW . The decision of ORG must be rendered as soon as possible , but DATE from the date on which the request was lodged ( LAW ) . The court may , however , exceed this time - limit if it wishes to consider refusing the request \u2013 thus terminating the measure \u2013 and if it needs more information as to the way in which the person concerned might be released back into society . In such a case , the court has DATE to render its decision ( Article CARDINAL t \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . ORG decision shall be reasoned . If it decides to prolong the placement order , the decision must be pronounced publicly ( LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Both the public prosecutor and the person concerned may lodge an appeal with ORG ( Gerechtshof ) of GPE within DATE of the service of the judgment given by ORG . However , this provision rules out an appeal in regard to the first decision to extend the placement for DATE ( Article CARDINALv ) .", "CARDINAL . There is no express provision requiring the release of the person concerned if the time - limits laid down by ORG CARDINALo \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL t \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL and CARDINAL are not complied with , nor does the ORG impose any sanctions on exceeding these time - limits .", "CARDINAL . According to GPE case - law summary civil proceedings ( kort geding ) may be instituted in cases where a person placed at the disposal of the government wishes to obtain a court judgment on the lawfulness of his detention . However , in a case which was brought before the President of ORG of the Hague , a request for the termination of the applicant \u2019s placement was rejected , inter alia , in view of the fact that the court competent to decide on the extension of the placement would be dealing with the matter DATE ( decision of CARDINAL DATE , published in GPE DATE , pp . CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL .

CARDINAL ) , ORG ) held that only in certain circumstances would the ORG be obliged to terminate a placement order after its statutory period had expired and no decision as to its extension had been taken . In order to determine whether such an obligation existed , the court should have regard to the extent to which the statutory time - limit had been exceeded , the reasons for which the time - limit had not been complied with and the personal and societal interests involved .", "CARDINAL .
