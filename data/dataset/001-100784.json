The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE . She was married to a NORP national , Mr PERSON , who died in DATE . In DATE they had a son , Mr PERSON , who died on DATE after being shot by the police on DATE .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL sets of criminal proceedings were opened against Mr Karandja on unspecified dates in DATE . In the first set he was charged , together with CARDINAL others , with breaking into a car on DATE and stealing CARDINAL pairs of stockings with a total value of MONEY ( equivalent at the material time to MONEY ) . In the second set he was charged with driving a car without a valid licence on DATE . He has not been convicted of other offences and there is no indication that other charges have ever been lodged against him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG revoked Mr PERSON 's earlier release on bail and ordered his pretrial detention . As a result , he was put on the list of persons wanted by the police .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON was arrested on DATE . He was placed in a cell in the Third FAC in GPE . After TIME the police tried to transfer him to FAC . However , the escort brigade refused to take him in their custody because it was late and at TIME he was returned to the police station . The onduty officers \u2013 Chief PERSON and Captain V.S. \u2013 placed Mr PERSON in a cell on the third floor of the station . The Chief Sergeant searched him , but did not handcuff him because he looked \u201c calm and was not boisterous \u201d . Mr PERSON 's shoe laces were removed and the door of the cell was closed .", "CARDINAL . At TIME to open the door of the cell , apparently by forcing CARDINAL the chains which was keeping it closed , rammed Chief PERSON with it , and ran down the stairs and out of the building . Once outside , he continued to run down the streets adjacent to the police station . The Chief Sergeant chased after him .", "CARDINAL . The escape from the police station was witnessed by ORG and Captain PERSON However , neither they nor any other officers assisted Chief PERSON in the chase .", "CARDINAL . The chase continued down FAC . When Mr PERSON reached the intersection with FAC , where he attempted to cross , Chief PERSON , according to his later statement , drew out his handgun and fired a warning shot in the air . Mr Karandja did not stop , dodged the traffic , crossed the boulevard and continued to run towards the city centre . Chief PERSON continued the chase and ran down FAC . According to his later statement , he carried on shouting at Mr Karandja to stop and fired CARDINAL more warning shots in the air . Mr PERSON then turned down FAC , followed by Chief PERSON who ran after him in the middle of the street .", "CARDINAL . NORP Before turning into FAC , Mr Karandja was spotted by QUANTITY officers , Chief PERSON and GPE , who were in a patrol car travelling from the opposite direction . The officers later stated that they had seen Mr PERSON running towards them and then turning into FAC . They also stated that they had seen Chief PERSON running after him , shouting at him to stop , and firing CARDINAL or CARDINAL times in the air . The patrol car followed the CARDINAL of them down FAC .", "CARDINAL . Somewhere around that time , the chase was witnessed by Chief Sergeant A.V. who was going to the police station to take up his night patrol duty and by Lieutenant PERSON who was on his way to take up TIME duty in another police department . Neither of them joined in the chase and the CARDINAL men instead headed to police station to report the event .", "CARDINAL . NORP The chase continued down FAC with Mr Karandja being pursued by Chief PERSON and the patrol car . It is unclear whether Chief PERSON was aware that a patrol car was behind him because it had apparently not switched on its siren and flashing light .", "CARDINAL . When Mr Karandja reached the intersection with PERSON Street , where excavation works for the city 's future underground had begun , Chief PERSON fired in his direction . The bullet hit the back of Mr PERSON 's head and he fell to the ground . Chief PERSON went over to him , closely followed by Captain PERSON and Chief PERSON , who then returned to the patrol car to report the event , before going back to preserve the scene . Several passersby also gathered around Mr PERSON 's body .", "CARDINAL . Within TIME of the shooting a police car arrived and Mr PERSON was taken to the emergency ward of ORG . He arrived there , unconscious , at TIME Despite an emergency brain operation , he died DATE at TIME on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Having been notified about the incident , TIME and TIME on DATE an onduty investigator from ORG inspected the scene of the shooting and the cell in which Mr PERSON had been kept . He drew a sketch and took photographs , but did not try to identify the distance between Mr PERSON and Chief PERSON at the time of the shooting . He seized : ( a ) a spent cartridge found at an unspecified location in FAC by Captain PERSON who had been sitting with his son in a caf\u00e9 close to the scene ; ( b ) acetonedrenched swabs of Chief PERSON 's hands ; ( c ) handcuffs from the cell ; and ( d ) the broken chain of the cell door . He then interviewed Captain PERSON and ordered an expert examination of Chief PERSON 's handgun . The Sergeant made a written statement in which he said that he had been aiming for Mr PERSON 's legs .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a blood sample was taken from Chief PERSON A subsequent test found no presence of alcohol or other intoxicating substances in his blood .", "CARDINAL . On DATE a forensic expert performed an autopsy on Mr PERSON 's body . He found that the cause of death was \u201c a gunshot wound to the head and damage to the brain \u201d . The report also noted that there were bruises on his face and knees , which were attributed to his fall , face first , after being shot .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused to open a preliminary investigation into the incident , finding that Chief PERSON had acted in line with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) . He had used his firearm after giving a warning in order to prevent a detainee from escaping . His act was therefore not criminal .", "CARDINAL . On an appeal by the applicant , on DATE the Chief Military Prosecutor 's Office set that decision aside , finding that the opening of a preliminary investigation in such circumstances was mandatory . Accordingly , on DATE the ORG opened an investigation and on DATE sent the case file to a military investigator .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , CARDINAL , DATE and DATE , CARDINAL May and CARDINAL DATE the investigator interviewed PERSON and GPE , ORG , CARDINAL other officers from the police station , Chief PERSON , GPE , and GPE , CARDINAL civilians who lived on FAC who had not witnessed the chase or the shooting , Lieutenant PERSON , and Chief PERSON who said that when he had fired the fatal shot his intention had been to aim low and possibly hit PERSON PERSON 's knees .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE the investigator asked a forensic expert to determine the cause of Mr PERSON 's death , the presence of any injuries on his body , the distance from which the shot had been fired and the presence of any handcuff marks . In his report the expert said that PERSON PERSON had died from a gunshot wound in the back of his head which had fatally injured his brain . The rest of his injuries were bruises which could have occurred when he had fallen to the ground . It was impossible to determine the distance from which the shot had been fired because the surgical operation had obliterated any marks on his head . However , the fact that the medical doctors had not noted any gunpowder residue near the wound could be interpreted as meaning that the shot had not been fired from a close distance . There were no clear handcuff marks .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator asked experts to say whether the swabs of Chief PERSON 's palms contained gunpowder residue , and whether the spent cartridge submitted by Captain PERSON had come from the Chief PERSON 's handgun . The swab test , conducted on DATE , found no gunpowder residue in the swabs . The handgun test , conducted on CARDINAL DATE , found that the cartridge had come from the Chief Sergeant 's handgun .", "CARDINAL . Having finished his work on the case , on DATE the investigator proposed discontinuing the investigation . In his view , Chief PERSON , by using his firearm , had strictly complied with his duties . His decision to do so had been in line with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the DATE LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , as he had simply had no other means of stopping Mr Karandja from fleeing . The Sergeant 's earlier decision not to handcuff Mr PERSON had also been in line with the relevant instructions .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sofia Regional Military Prosecutor 's Office found that the investigator had not sought to identify Mr PERSON 's nextofkin with a view to allowing them to acquaint themselves with the case file and to bring , if they so wished , civil claims . It referred the case back to the investigator , instructing him to rectify that omission .", "CARDINAL . Although the investigator did not comply with those instructions , on DATE the ORG decided to discontinue the investigation , repeating the reasons given by the investigator on DATE almost verbatim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG . She said that the investigation had failed to gather evidence about the breaking of the chain of the cell door and the way in which that door had been opened . She complained that the only witnesses interviewed were police officers and that no medical expert report had been obtained to assess the various injuries sustained by Mr Karandja . She also claimed that there were inconsistencies in the investigation 's findings because it had concluded that Mr PERSON had escaped from the cell without the assistance of any tools . Lastly , she complained that she had not been allowed to consult the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld the discontinuance . It noted that the investigator had carried out a reconstruction of Mr PERSON 's escape and had found that it was possible to loosen the chain and open the door in the way he had specified . The expert medical report had clarified the injuries which had led to Mr PERSON 's death and the distance from which the shot had been fired . The applicant did not specify which other eyewitness she wished to have interviewed . It was true that she was not given an opportunity to consult the case file , but in the event that was not problematic because she was informed of the discontinuance and was able to appeal against it .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed to ORG , reiterating the arguments raised in her previous appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG set the discontinuance aside , citing the investigator 's failure to comply with the instructions to identify Mr PERSON 's nextofkin \u2013 the applicant \u2013 and give her the opportunity to acquaint herself with the case file and to bring , if she so wished , a civil claim .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the case was assigned to another investigator . On DATE he interviewed the applicant in her home and allowed her to acquaint herself with the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator proposed discontinuing the investigation , giving the same reasons as those given by the previous investigator on CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sofia Regional Military Prosecutor 's Office referred the case back to the investigator . It noted that he had interviewed the applicant in the absence of her counsel .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator interviewed the applicant in her home , in the presence of her newly - retained counsel , and allowed the CARDINAL of them to acquaint themselves with the case file .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator proposed discontinuing the investigation , giving the exact same reasons as previously ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG referred the case back to the investigator . It noted that he had not given the applicant and her counsel a proper opportunity to acquaint themselves with the case file and make any objections .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's counsel was allowed to consult the case file on DATE . On DATE he filed an objection , pointing out that vital investigative steps \u2013 such as witness interviews and the commissioning of an expert medical report DATE had been taken DATE after the incident . It was also striking that despite the small area in which the chase had taken place and the number of shots fired , CARDINAL cartridge had been found . The positions of other officers present near the scene were not elucidated , which made it impossible to determine whether it had been possible to apprehend Mr Karandja without using firearms . Since under the applicable law , firearms could be used only \u201c as a means of last resort \u201d , it was essential to clarify those facts . There were also discrepancies in the investigation 's findings , the chief CARDINAL being the assumption that Chief PERSON had fired several warning shots and the fatal shot , and the fact that the swab test had come out negative .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator overruled the objection , saying that the delay had not been the fault of the investigating authorities ; they had started to work on the case shortly after the prosecuting authorities had instituted the proceedings , had accepted all previous investigative actions , had conducted interviews , and had taken further investigative steps to elucidate the facts . Firearms had been used as a means of last resort to arrest Mr Karandja .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the investigator again proposed discontinuing the investigation , giving the exact same reasons as previously ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Sofia Regional Military Prosecutor 's Office decided to discontinue the investigation , repeating the reasons given by the investigator almost verbatim and adding that the situation fell within the ambit of Article CARDINALa of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG confirmed the discontinuance , repeating almost verbatim the reasons given by GPE .", "CARDINAL . In a final decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG also confirmed the discontinuance . It fully agreed with the prosecuting authorities ' conclusion that Chief PERSON 's actions had been in line with section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) of the DATE Act and fell within the ambit of LAW ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and DATE below ) . It also noted that the Sergeant had aimed at Mr PERSON 's legs and had shot him in the back of the head only because of the increasing distance between them and speed of the chase .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of the DATE LAW , as in force at the material time , provided , in so far as relevant :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The police may use firearms as a means of last resort :", "...", "CARDINAL . after giving a warning , to prevent the escape of a person duly detained for having committed a publicly prosecutable offence .", "( CARDINAL ) When using firearms the police are under a duty to protect , as far as possible , the life of the person against whom they use force ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . The wording of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE ORG , which superseded the above provision in DATE , was identical . The wording of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of the DATE Ministry of Internal Affairs Act , currently in force , repeats verbatim that of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL)(CARDINAL ) and ( QUANTITY ) of LAW .", "CARDINAL . Article DATE \u00a7 CARDINAL of the DATE LAW , added in DATE , provides that causing harm to a person while arresting him or her for an offence is not punishable where no other means of effecting the arrest exist and the force used is necessary and lawful . According to LAW , the force used is not necessary where it is manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the offence committed by the person to be arrested or the resulting harm is in itself excessive and unnecessary .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , as in force until DATE , the discontinuance of a preliminary investigation could be challenged before a more senior prosecutor .", "CARDINAL . On DATE that Article was amended to provide for a system of automatic control of the discontinuance : after the discontinuance the prosecutor had to send the file and his decision to the immediately superior prosecutor 's office , which could confirm , modify or quash it . If it confirmed the decision , it had to forward the file to the appropriate court , which had to review the matter in private . The court 's decision was final . No provision was made for those concerned to be notified of the discontinuance .", "CARDINAL . Following a further amendment of that Article in DATE , the discontinuance of preliminary investigations became subject to judicial review . DATE Code of Criminal Procedure maintained that position in Article CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["2"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
