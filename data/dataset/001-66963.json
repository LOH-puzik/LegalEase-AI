On that occasion CARDINAL police officers and the ambulance assistant were heard as witnesses .", "At the next hearing on DATE the forensic medical expert and the weapons expert were heard . The parties presented their closing arguments . The public prosecutor proposed that PERSON be acquitted by virtue of section CARDINAL ) of LAW . He argued that the defendant should not be punished because he had been acting lawfully in self - defence even though he had exceeded the necessary force ( elh\u00e1r\u00edt\u00e1s sz\u00fcks\u00e9ges m\u00e9rt\u00e9k\u00e9nek t\u00fall\u00e9p\u00e9se ) in the circumstances . According to the public prosecutor , PERSON could not have assessed properly the situation with which he was confronted on account of his fear and , given the circumstances , his over - reaction was justified . The public prosecutor however observed that the lawfulness of the use of a firearm in itself did not preclude the commission of a crime and referred to sections CARDINAL ) and PERSON ) of LAW in this connection .", "Counsel for the defence pleaded that ORG should be acquitted primarily on the ground of the absence of any danger to society and hence the absence of a crime or , alternatively , by reason of lawful self - defence .", "On DATE ORG acquitted PERSON , applying section ORG ) of LAW . The court found it impossible to determine whether Mr GPE had been armed at the time of the incident . In particular , it remained unclear whether Mr GPE or his accomplice had had an object in their hands and , if so , whether that object had been a knife , the stolen radio or an object which the offenders had been using to smash the car window . The court observed that the knife apparently found during the inspection of the scene had been lost and could no longer be located in police storage .", "Moreover , the court , relying on the opinions of the weapons expert and the CARDINAL forensic pathologists , considered it proven that Mr GPE had been shot while leaning or moving forward , rather than standing or hiding . Given that it was almost completely dark at the time of the incident , the court accepted that PERSON could not properly decipher Mr PERSON 's intention when the latter moved towards him .", "ORG was satisfied that the defendant 's action did not constitute a crime . Under sections CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL ) of LAW , he had been free to use his gun to avert an attack directed against his life or bodily integrity . His action had therefore not been \u201c materially illegal \u201d ( materi\u00e1lis jogelleness\u00e9g ) , that is , dangerous to society . In these circumstances , no criminal act had been committed \u2013 a conclusion which allowed the court to dispense with the examination of the question of self - defence , in particular whether it was lawful self - defence or excessive .", "The public prosecutor appealed against this judgment , requesting that the defendant be acquitted under section CARDINAL ) of LAW . Subsequently , the public prosecutor withdrew the appeal . Consequently , on DATE ORG judgment became final .", "On DATE Mr ORG requested a copy of ORG judgment . On DATE Mr ORG , submitting a power of attorney signed by the applicant on DATE , requested a copy of the case file from ORG .
