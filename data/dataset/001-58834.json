ITALY", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction reserved", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . NORP The applicant company , owner of FAC at GPE , also owned CARDINAL sq . m. of land that gave patrons of the hotel direct access to the sea .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the GPE municipality passed a resolution approving a road - building scheme . The road was to pass over the applicant company 's land .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the mayor of PERSON issued an order , under an expedited procedure , for the possession of the applicant company 's land . On an unspecified date the authorities took physical possession of the land and began the road - building works .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed to ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , contesting , inter alia , the lawfulness of the municipality 's resolution of CARDINAL DATE and of its occupation of the land .", "CARDINAL . By a judgment delivered on DATE , ORG allowed the applicant company 's appeal ; it quashed the municipality 's resolution of CARDINAL DATE and ruled that all subsequent action taken by it was invalid . The ORG found that the municipality had approved the road - building scheme without carrying out sufficient technical surveys beforehand . As a result , the approved scheme was unlawful and could not be considered as being in the public interest ( non atto a realizzare un interesse pubblico ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP That decision was lodged at the registry on CARDINAL DATE and became final on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By letters of CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE , the applicant company asked the GPE municipality to reinstate and return the land , pursuant to the judgment of the ORG . However , the municipality took no action .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company issued enforcement proceedings ( giudizio di ottemperanza ) in ORG for the reinstatement and return of the land in accordance with the judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG dismissed those proceedings on the ground that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE could not be enforced as there had been a constructive expropriation .", "CARDINAL . The ORG observed that although the judgment of CARDINAL DATE had quashed the resolution of the municipality of PERSON for procedural defects during the planning inquiry , that did not prevent the municipality from subsequently restarting the procedure and passing a fresh resolution \u2013 though it had not in any event done so . The ORG went on to say that as a result of the constructive - expropriation rule ( occupazione acquisitiva ) , the applicant company was no longer the owner of the land , which had become the property of the municipality of PERSON following completion of the road - building works . Despite its earlier judgment and the fact that the works carried out by the authorities were dangerous and contrary to the public interest , the fact that the authorities had completed the works meant that title to the land had been transferred . Consequently , restitution was impossible . However , as the transfer of property had been unlawful , the applicant company was entitled to claim damages in the civil courts .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company appealed against that decision to the Consiglio di Stato , its main contention being that , although the ORG had ruled that the authorities ' conduct was unlawful before they had completed the works , the authorities had ignored the judgment . The fact that the constructive - expropriation rule had been applied in the instant case rendered the judgment devoid of purpose , since the authorities were free to act unlawfully with the sole aim of acquiring title to the land .", "CARDINAL . By an order of CARDINAL DATE , Section V of the PERSON , before whom the appeal was pending , decided to refer the appeal to the full court . The order indicates that the section concerned considered that in the instant case the loss of title to the land as a result of the public works being carried out amounted to a denial of justice . If a decision of an administrative court favourable to the owner of the land , such as the decision of CARDINAL DATE , could not prevent the authorities taking possession of the land , the owner would be at their mercy . Furthermore , Section V of the PERSON noted that the municipality of PERSON had not reopened the planning inquiry or passed any further resolutions following the quashing of its resolution by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a decision of CARDINAL DATE the PERSON , sitting as a full court , dismissed the applicant company 's appeal . It held that the application of the constructive - expropriation rule had not entailed a denial of justice in the instant case . It said that the road - building works had been largely completed by DATE when the ORG had given its judgment . Thereafter , only additional work of minor importance had been carried out , such as the installation of lighting and the completion of the road surfacing . Consequently , CARDINAL DATE had to be considered the date when title to the land was transferred because it was at that point that the change of user of the land had become irreversible , as a result of the completion of the works . The land could no longer be returned owing to the constructive expropriation . That date was also the starting - point of the statutory limitation period for claiming damages .", "CARDINAL . This statute governs the expedited expropriation procedure , which permits authorities to start building before expropriation . Once a scheme has been declared to be in the public interest and the plans adopted , the authorities may make an expedited possession order , for a limited period not exceeding DATE , in respect of the land to be expropriated . The order will lapse if physical possession of the land is not taken within DATE after its issue . After the land has been possessed , a formal expropriation order must be made and compensation paid .", "CARDINAL . During DATE , a number of local authorities took possession of land using the expedited procedure but failed subsequently to issue an expropriation order . The NORP courts were confronted with cases in which the landowner had de facto lost use of the land as it had been possessed and building works in the public interest had been undertaken . The question arose whether the mere fact that works had been carried out meant that the owner had also lost title to the land .", "CARDINAL . There was a substantial divergence in the decisions of ORG over the effects of carrying out building works in the public interest on land where possession had been taken unlawfully . Unlawful possession means possession that is unlawful from the start , in other words obtained without authority , or that is initially authorised but subsequently became unlawful , either because the authority is quashed or because possession continues beyond the authorised period without an expropriation order being made .", "CARDINAL . Under CARDINAL line of case - law , the owner of land that had been possessed by the authorities did not lose ownership after the completion of the works in the public interest . However , he could not request reinstatement of the land ; his only remedy was to bring an action in damages for wrongful possession . No limitation period applied to such actions as the unlawful nature of the possession was continuing . The authorities could at any time issue a formal expropriation order . If they did so , the action in damages was transformed into a dispute over the compensation for expropriation , with damages for the loss of enjoyment of the land being due only for the period prior to the making of the expropriation order ( see , among other authorities , the judgments of ORG nos . CARDINAL of DATE ; CARDINAL of DATE ; and DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP Under a second line , the landowner did not lose property in the land and could request its reinstatement if the authorities had acted other than in the public interest ( see , for example , ORG judgments nos . CARDINAL of DATE and CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . Under a third line , an owner dispossessed by the authorities automatically lost title to the land as soon as it had been altered irreversibly , that is to say on completion of the works in the public interest . He was PERSON entitled to claim damages ( the sole authority is ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , resolved the conflict between the case - law authorities and adopted the third solution . In so doing , it established the constructive - expropriation rule ( accessione invertita or occupazione acquisitiva ) . Under the rule , the public authorities acquire title to the land from the outset before formal expropriation if , after taking possession of the land and irrespective of whether such possession is lawful , the works in the public interest are performed . If , initially , the land is possessed without authority , the transfer of property takes place when the works in the public interest are completed . If the taking of possession was authorised from the outset , property is transferred on the expiry of the authorised period of possession . In the same judgment , ORG stated that , on a constructive expropriation , the owner is entitled to compensation in full as the acquisition of the land has taken place without title ( sine titulo ) . However , compensation is not paid automatically : the owner must lodge a claim for damages . In addition , the right to compensation is subject to a DATE limitation period that applies to actions in tort ; the starting - point is the date the land is irreversibly altered .", "CARDINAL . Initially , it was held that no limitation period applied , since possession of the land without title was a continuing unlawful act ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In its judgment no . DATE , ORG stated that the right to compensation was subject to a DATE limitation period ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . Subsequently , ORG said that a DATE limitation period should apply ( judgment nos . DATE ) . On CARDINAL DATE the full court of ORG decided the issue finally , holding that the limitation period is DATE and starts to run from the date the land is irreversibly altered .", "CARDINAL . Recent developments in the case - law show that the mechanism whereby carrying out building works in the public interest operates to transfer property in the land to the authorities is subject to exceptions .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , the PERSON stated that there was no constructive expropriation where resolutions of the authorities and an expedited possession order had been quashed by the administrative courts , as otherwise the judicial decision would be devoid of purpose .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , said that the authorities did not acquire ownership of the land if their resolutions and the declaration that expropriation was in the public interest were deemed to have been null and void from the outset . In such cases , the owner retained title to the land and could claim restitutio in integrum . In the alternative , he could seek damages . The unlawful nature of the possession in such cases was continuing and no limitation period applied .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . DATE , ORG , sitting as a full court , said that there was no transfer of property where the declaration that expropriation was in the public interest had been annulled by the administrative courts . In such cases , therefore , the constructive - expropriation rule did not apply . The owner , who retained ownership of the land , was entitled to claim restitutio in integrum . If he brought an action in damages , that entailed a waiver of his right to restitution . The DATE limitation period started to run from DATE when the decision of the administrative court became final .", "CARDINAL . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG followed the decision of the full court and held that there was no transfer of property by constructive expropriation where the declaration that the building works were in the public interest was deemed to have been invalid from the outset .", "CARDINAL . In this judgment , ORG was called upon to decide firstly whether the constructive - expropriation rule was compatible with LAW . The court declared that question inadmissible on the ground that it had jurisdiction to examine statutory provisions only , not rules established by the courts . Secondly , it held that the application to an action for compensation of the DATE limitation period laid down by DATE of LAW for claims in tort was compatible with LAW . The fact that the authorities had become owners of the land by taking advantage of their own unlawful conduct did not pose any difficulty under LAW , since the public interest in the preservation of works for the public good outweighed the individual 's interest in the right of property .", "CARDINAL . Under ORG case - law on constructive expropriations , compensation in full , that is to say damages for the deprivation of the land , is due to the owner in consideration for the loss of ownership caused by the unlawful taking of possession .", "CARDINAL . The Finance Law of DATE ( LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE ) superseded that case - law by providing that the compensation payable on constructive expropriations could not exceed the amount due on formal expropriations . In judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG declared that provision unconstitutional .", "CARDINAL . Under Finance Law no . CARDINAL of DATE , which amended the provision that had been declared unconstitutional , compensation in full can not be awarded for dispossessions effected before DATE . In such cases , compensation can not exceed such amount , plus PERCENT , but without applying the PERCENT reduction , as would have been payable on a formal expropriation ( CARDINAL of the sum of the market value plus the income from the land , PERCENT ) . In a judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE , ORG held that that provision was compatible with LAW . However , in the same decision , it said that compensation in full , up to the market value of the land , could be claimed where the dispossession and deprivation of the land were not in the public interest .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company complained that it had become impossible for it to recover its land as a result of the constructive - expropriation rule , which had been applied despite the decision of ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) quashing the building scheme and the possession order as being unlawful and not in the public interest . It alleged a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL , which provides :", "\u201c Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions . No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law .", "The preceding provisions shall not , however , in any way impair the right of a ORG to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant company maintained that the interference with its right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions was not compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . It contended that constructive expropriation was contrary to the requirement of lawfulness for the following reasons : the authorities became owners of the land through unlawful conduct , namely by taking possession without title ; landowners could not avail themselves of the procedural guarantees available on a formal expropriation ; and the constructive - expropriation rule was not to be found in any statutory provision but had been established by the case - law and was considered to be \u201c living law \u201d .", "CARDINAL . NORP Subsequent events had led the applicant company to consider that the requirement of lawfulness had not been complied with in the instant case . It observed that it was unable to obtain restitution of the land despite the decision of ORG DATE which had become final \u2013 retrospectively quashing all the authorities ' acts , including the declaration that the scheme was in the public interest . The decision of the Consiglio di Stato refusing restitution of the land as a result of the application of the constructive - expropriation rule thus represented an unjustified interference with the applicant company 's right to the peaceful enjoyment of its possessions . The applicant company noted that the constructive - expropriation rule left landowners at the mercy of the authorities , who \u2013 with the sole aim of appropriating land DATE could carry out works that were not in the public interest after taking possession of the land wholly unlawfully and then refuse to comply with judicial decisions declaring their conduct unlawful .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company added that ORG had been called upon to rule solely on the lawfulness of the authorities ' acts and could not decide the merits of the case , that is to say whether the road - building works had been finished . On the other hand , the PERSON , on an appeal on the issue of enforcement ( ottemperanza ) , had jurisdiction to hear the merits and could therefore determine the date of completion of the works .", "CARDINAL . The applicant company observed finally that it was true that the measure of compensation claimable by an owner deprived of his land for works that were not in the public interest was compensation in full ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . However , damages could not be considered as compensation for the alleged loss even assuming they could be claimed by the applicant company . The applicant company was not asking the ORG to rule on the authorities ' conduct \u2013 ORG had already done so \u2013 but to give a decision on the PERSON dismissal of its application for restitution of the land . The applicant company concluded by inviting the ORG to restore legality .", "CARDINAL . The Government submitted that the loss of the land by the applicant company did not infringe LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . They observed firstly that the interference with the applicant company 's right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions was \u201c provided for by law \u201d , namely a rule established by the courts that had been consistently and unanimously applied since ORG judgment no . DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . The Government referred in particular to ORG judgments nos . CARDINAL of DATE and DATE , the PERSON judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE and the case - law of ORG . The rule established by the case - law thus constituted a clear , accessible and adequate legal norm and was an expression of the \u201c living law \u201d , that is to say the law effectively in force .", "CARDINAL . The Government observed secondly that the applicant company had been deprived of its land \u201c in the public interest \u201d . At the outset , the road - building scheme and the authorities ' resolutions had been in the public interest . Although it was true that the authorities ' acts had subsequently been quashed by ORG , the effect of the constructive - expropriation rule was that , once completed , municipal works became de facto a new scheme in the public interest . Completion of the works carried out by the authorities therefore had a dual effect : it entailed recognition that the work carried out was in the public interest and meant that the authorities ' conduct ceased to be unlawful .", "CARDINAL . As a result of that mechanism , the land could no longer be returned to the applicant company as it was irreversibly deemed to have become public .", "CARDINAL . The fact that the deprivation of possession was unlawful until the works had been completed nevertheless afforded the owner the right to claim pecuniary compensation in the form of damages before the relevant courts . The ORG maintained that it was still open to the applicant company in the instant case to bring an action in damages before the relevant courts , that such an action would enable it to obtain compensation in full and thus constituted a sufficient remedy for the interference with its right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions . On that point , the Government referred to the judgment of the ORG in the case of PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions PERSON ) .", "CARDINAL . An action in damages was possible because , in the ORG 's submission , the DATE limitation period which had started to run on DATE on completion of the works had been interrupted by the enforcement proceedings brought by the applicant company before the PERSON . The ORG added that , when dealing with an application for enforcement ( ottemperanza ) the PERSON had jurisdiction to make findings of fact , including as to the date when the works were completed . Consequently , there was no inconsistency between its finding and the fact that the decision of ORG had become final , as the latter could not decide issues of fact .", "CARDINAL . An action in damages would enable the applicant company to obtain compensation in full since the declaration that the works were in the public interest had been quashed by ORG . The Government referred on that point to ORG judgment no . CARDINAL of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . Lastly the Government explained that proceedings for pecuniary reparation had to be instituted by the applicant company as it had failed in its attempt to obtain restitution of the land . Damages would compensate it for the interference with its right to peaceful enjoyment of its possessions .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that LAW No . CARDINAL contains CARDINAL distinct rules : \u201c The first rule , set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph , is of a general nature and enunciates the principle of the peaceful enjoyment of property ; the second rule , contained in the second sentence of the first paragraph , covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions ; the third rule , stated in the second paragraph , recognises that GPE are entitled , amongst other things , to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest ... The CARDINAL rules are not , however , ' distinct ' in the sense of being unconnected . The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule \u201d ( see , among other authorities , the PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , partly following the terms of the ORG 's analysis in the PERSON and PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; see also the GPE v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and GPE v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , ORG CARDINAL-II ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that it is common ground that there has been a deprivation of possessions .", "CARDINAL . In order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of possessions within the meaning of the second rule , the ORG must not confine itself to examining whether there has been dispossession or formal expropriation , it must look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the situation complained of . Since the ORG is intended to guarantee rights that are \u201c practical and effective \u201d , it has to be ascertained whether that situation amounted to a de facto expropriation . ( see the GPE and PERSON judgment cited above , pp . DATE , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that in the present case , by applying the constructive - expropriation rule in its decision , the Consiglio di Stato deprived the applicant company of the possibility of obtaining restitution of its land . In the circumstances , the ORG finds that the effect of the judgment of the PERSON was to deprive the applicant company of its possessions within the meaning of the second sentence of the first paragraph of LAW No . CARDINAL ( see ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-VII ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In order to be compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL , such an interference must be \u201c in the public interest \u201d , \u201c subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law \u201d and must strike a \u201c fair balance \u201d between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual 's fundamental rights ( see the PERSON and PERSON judgment cited above , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . Furthermore , the issue of whether a fair balance has been struck \u201c becomes relevant only once it has been established that the interference in question satisfied the requirement of lawfulness and was not arbitrary \u201d ( see PERSON cited above , \u00a7 DATE , and ORG v. GPE [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ECHR CARDINAL-I ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG reiterates that the first and most important requirement of LAW No . CARDINAL is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful . The rule of law , CARDINAL of the fundamental principles of a democratic society , is inherent in all the Articles of the Convention ( see PERSON cited above , \u00a7 DATE ) and entails a duty on the part of the ORG or other public authority to comply with judicial orders or decisions against it .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not consider it necessary to decide in the abstract whether the role in the continental - law system of a rule , such as the constructive - expropriation rule , established by the courts is comparable to that of statutory provisions . However , it reiterates that the requirement of lawfulness means that rules of domestic law must be sufficiently accessible , precise and foreseeable ( see the PERSON v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , and the PERSON and Others v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . In that connection , the ORG observes that the case - law on constructive expropriations has evolved in a way that has led to the rule being applied inconsistently ( see paragraphs CARDINAL to CARDINAL above ) , a factor which could result in unforeseeable or arbitrary outcomes and deprive litigants of effective protection of their rights and is , as a consequence , inconsistent with the requirement of lawfulness .", "CARDINAL . The ORG also notes that under the rule established by ORG in its judgment no . DATE every constructive expropriation follows the unlawful taking of possession of the land . The unlawfulness may exist at the outset or arise subsequently . The ORG has reservations as to the compatibility with the requirement of lawfulness of a mechanism which , generally , enables the authorities to benefit from an unlawful situation in which the landowner is presented with a fait accompli .", "CARDINAL . NORP In any event , the Court is required to verify whether the way in which the domestic law is interpreted and applied produces consequences that are consistent with the principles of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . In the instant case , the ORG notes that on DATE the ORG quashed with retrospective effect the resolution passed by the authorities as being unlawful and not in the public interest . However , that finding of ORG , in which it held that the occupation of the applicant company 's land was unlawful and not in the public interest ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , did not result in restitution of the land , since the Consiglio di Stato held that the transfer of property to the authorities had become irreversible .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that the interference in question was not compatible with LAW No . CARDINAL . That conclusion makes it unnecessary for it to examine whether a fair balance was struck between the requirements of the general interest of the community and the need to protect individual rights .", "CARDINAL . Consequently , there has been a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto , and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made , the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant company sought restitution and reinstatement of the land in question , those being the only measures which in its submission would remedy the alleged violation , since they would enable the position obtaining before the violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to be re - established . The applicant company also claimed compensation for pecuniary damage to be determined on an equitable basis or , if appropriate , through the assessment of an expert ; it put the compensation at not less than CARDINAL,CARDINAL,CARDINAL Italian lire ( ITL ) plus interest and index - linking covering at minimum its loss of enjoyment of the land for the period of deprivation of possession until restitution . The applicant company further claimed ORG CARDINAL plus interest and index - linking for the non - pecuniary damage which the ORG 's conduct had caused it . Lastly , it requested reimbursement of the costs incurred before the national courts and of ORG CARDINAL for costs incurred before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government stated that restitution of the land was precluded by the constructive expropriation and maintained that the applicant company could obtain compensation for the alleged violation through the action in damages which it could bring in the NORP courts . Referring to the judgments of the ORG in the cases of PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-C ) , and PERSON , Ooms and PERSON v. GPE ( judgment of DATE ( Article CARDINAL ) , Series A no . CARDINAL ) , the Government argued that the applicant company 's claim for just satisfaction was inadmissible .", "CARDINAL . Should the ORG not uphold that objection , the ORG said that it would be impossible DATE for the reasons indicated by the Consiglio di Stato \u2013 for the land to be returned . They contended that restitution of the land was beyond the scope of LAW . As regards pecuniary damage , the Government submitted that no sum could be awarded under that head since it was still open to the applicant company to seek damages before the national courts . As to non - pecuniary damage , the Government maintained that a finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction . The Government considered that the sum requested for costs was excessive and left the issue to the discretion of the ORG .", "DATE . In the light of the reasons which led it to find a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL , the ORG considers that the ORG 's objection must be rejected . The act of the NORP government which the ORG held to be contrary to the LAW was not an expropriation that would have been legitimate but for the failure to pay fair compensation ; it was a taking by the ORG of land belonging to the applicant company , for which the latter had no redress ( see , mutatis mutandis , the PERSON v. GPE judgment of DATE , Series A no . ORG , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
