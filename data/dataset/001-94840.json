In the instant case : the head of the GPE regional government , ORG , and a member of the regional parliament , K ...", "Secondly , the flat was purchased at our expense , at the expense of our budget . MONEY disappeared in DATE into thin air . To date there has been no reimbursement or sanctions on the part of the tax authorities .

NORP The investigator commissioned a linguistic and cultural expert examination of the articles in question .

The expert considered that the articles had sought to present a negative image of PERSON :", "\u201c Tolerance towards the customs and mores of others is , in general , uncharacteristic of the NORP mentality , which is also evident in the attitude towards ' sexual minorities ' .

The report concluded :", "\u201c In this context the information on the sale and purchase of a flat in GPE at the expense of the budget becomes sensational and seeks to persuade the reader to view ORG as a dishonest manager , embezzler of public funds , and , in addition , an immoral person who craves sensual pleasure and physical attraction and is wanton and lustful . The pragmatic aim of the articles ... is to undermine [ readers ' ] trust in PERSON and PERSON as politicians ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE counsel for the applicant privately commissioned a linguistic expert examination of the articles . The expert found that the word \u201c homosexual \u201d had no negative connotations and , therefore , could not be held to damage or undermine the honour and dignity of others . He noted that NORP society in DATE had become more tolerant towards homosexuality and a disclosure of someone 's homosexuality in the mass media was not necessarily damaging to his reputation . Counsel asked the investigator to admit the report in evidence , but her request was refused on the ground that the expert had been a linguist rather than a specialist in cultural studies and thus had not been competent to perform the examination .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE the applicant was charged with criminal libel and insult disseminated via the mass media .", "CARDINAL . Following the applicant 's indictment , she and her counsel filed a number of requests . They pointed out that the indictment did not identify which information the prosecution considered untrue .

Alternatively , if the charges were to be based exclusively on the allegations about PERSON 's and PERSON 's homosexuality , the applicant requested that a medical examination of ORG and PERSON be carried out in order to establish their sexual orientation .

The charges did not refer to the allegations of misappropriation of budgetary funds .", "CARDINAL . The case was referred for trial to the LOC of PERSON , which decided to conduct the trial in private .

In an attempt to slander the victims , she arranged for the printing of CARDINAL copies of the newspaper and distributed them in LOC . The investigating authorities correctly characterised her actions as libel under LAW , i.e. , dissemination via the mass media of information known to be untrue and damaging to other persons ' honour , dignity and reputation .", "In addition , PERSON related in these articles untrue information to the effect that [ ORG and PERSON ] were homosexual lovers who had engaged in homosexual intercourse in GPE in the building of the representative office of GPE , that is , she deliberately assessed the personal qualities and conduct of the victims [ in terms ] which were grossly degrading to their human dignity and which contradicted society 's prevailing approach to the treatment of individuals . Such treatment of the victims must be considered obscene and damaging to their dignity . In order to make the first issue of the newspaper appear important and sensational , she undermined the honour and dignity of the victims in the mass media .
