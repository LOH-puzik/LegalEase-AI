They submitted that the first applicant , a national of GPE , and his wife had been resident in GPE since DATE . Both he and his wife had been granted residence permits ( GPE ) that were valid until DATE . The applicants claimed that the first applicant had a right to take up employment in GPE . They referred in that connection to FAC and ORG between ORG and GPE and submitted that those treaties had to be applied by analogy to their case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused the request in accordance with s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ( GPE ) . It found that the maximum quota fixed for the employment of foreign workers in PERSON had been exceeded and none of the conditions for making an exception under s.

On DATE ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s appeal as inadmissible .

CARDINAL of ORG an alien only became a party to proceedings concerning the issue of a work permit if his personal circumstances were relevant to the decision or if there was no employer . In the present case , however , neither of these conditions applied . In particular , ORG had based its decision exclusively on the situation of the labour market , and in particular the fact that the maximum quota for the employment of foreign workers had been exceeded . For that reason , the first applicant was not a party to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that only certain refugees DATE namely , those who had indefinite leave to remain , were married to an NORP national or had a child of NORP nationality \u2013 were exempted from the regulations of ORG . The first applicant did not fall into any of those categories . ORG between ORG and GPE was not applicable in the present case as the first applicant was not a NORP national .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to dismiss the second applicant \u2019s appeal . It observed that ORG had proposed a replacement for the first applicant within the meaning of s. CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) and ( CARDINAL ) of ORG , but he had not been taken on . In a telephone conversation ORG had been informed by a representative of the second applicant that the proposed replacement had not been employed because the relevant post had already been filled . In further submissions the second applicant stated that the replacement had not complied with the requirements of the post .", "CARDINAL . ORG concluded that the second applicant had no further interest in employing the first applicant . It observed in particular that the second applicant had not given sufficient reasons as to why the proposed replacement could not work as a farm hand , a post which did not require any special qualification . It concluded that the second applicant was not interested in employing a replacement and dismissed the request for an employment permit under s. CARDINAL ) of LAW . It further noted that , in any event , the conditions for granting an employment permit had not been satisfied as the maximum quota fixed for the employment of foreign workers in PERSON had been exceeded and none of the conditions for an exception under s. CARDINAL ) of the above LAW applied .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants filed a complaint with ORG and requested an oral hearing .

On DATE ORG rejected the first applicant \u2019s complaint and dismissed the second applicant \u2019s complaint .

CARDINAL of ORG .", "CARDINAL . As to the second applicant \u2019s complaint , it found that ORG decision was coherent and conclusive . ORG had based its decision essentially on the statements of the second applicant . There had , therefore , been no further need to hear representations from the second applicant . ORG concluded that ORG had rightly refused to issue an employment permit DATE ( CARDINAL ) of ORG . It also decided that it was unnecessary to examine the second applicant \u2019s further submissions questioning whether the maximum quota had been attained .", "CARDINAL . ORG further noted that the second applicant had never alleged that the first applicant was a refugee within the meaning of LAW . As regards the reference to LAW and LAW , it noted that those treaties were not directly applicable and so could not create any subjective rights . At most , they might be of assistance in interpreting the domestic legislation . However , having regard to the clear wording of s. CARDINAL of ORG and the fact that there was no prospect of that provision being successfully challenged in ORG ) , as that court had already ruled that proceedings concerning a request for an employment permit under LAW did not concern a \u201c civil right or obligation \u201d within the meaning of LAW , the Administrative Court said that even the above mentioned interpretation would not lead to recognition of the first applicant \u2019s legal standing in the proceedings concerning the grant of an employment permit .", "CARDINAL .
