The use of force had been excessive because the first applicant \u2019s protests were limited to a request to contact his lawyer and a demand to see the chief of the police department , which measures were legitimate in the context of the situation . In response he was restrained by CARDINAL police officers , who also punched and kicked him , and dragged him down the stairs and into the ambulance car .
