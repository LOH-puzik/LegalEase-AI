On DATE the applicant submitted that he had initially employed A. on the basis of his preliminary work permit . He argued that he had not acted culpably as , prior to his case , ORG had not ruled on the question whether an appeal against the refusal of a work permit could be granted suspensive effect in view of a prior preliminary work permit .

On DATE the ORG confirmed ORG decision . It noted that the facts had been sufficiently established by the witnesses . Thus , there was no need to hear the applicant upon his return to GPE .
