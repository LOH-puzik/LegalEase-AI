CYPRUS", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant company is the owner and hire purchaser of a fleet of vehicles registered in GPE and licensed as \u201c Z \u201d vehicles .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINALst DATE ORG of GPE delivered judgment in a civil action lodged by the applicant against another company , ORG , also in the car hire business . ORG held , inter alia , that the applicant having legally terminated an agreement with Diprose , permitting the use and exploitation by the latter of the \u201c Z \u201d fleet of cars , it was entitled to take possession thereof and to sell them in satisfaction of a debt of CARDINAL Cypriot pounds owed to it by Diprose , by way of rental under the said agreement , and to pay the remaining amount in satisfaction of debts owed by the applicant to a number of banks which had financed the purchase of the fleet by the applicant . Furthermore , ORG ordered Diprose to deliver the cars to the applicant . Diprose obtained a stay of execution of the judgment on condition that it regularly paid certain instalments to the applicant for the use of the vehicles which the applicant had given to it in the past for rental to third parties .", "CARDINAL . Diprose failed to keep up the instalments and , as a result , on DATE , ORG of GPE allowed the applicant to collect the vehicles . In the meantime , Diprose had been wound up and , by letter of CARDINAL DATE , the liquidator declared that he was willing to return the vehicles , which apparently had been wrongfully given to another company , ORG , belonging to the same group as Diprose , without the consent of the applicant .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , PERSON had instituted proceedings ( action CARDINAL ) seeking damages from the applicant for breach of the agreement which they had allegedly concluded on DATE . PERSON contended that , under that agreement , CARDINAL vehicles had been rented to it by the applicant but a number of them was still in the applicant 's possession . ORG further sought to obtain a decision preventing the applicant company from interfering with PERSON ' activities under the agreement and ordering it to hand over to PERSON a number of the vehicles which were still in the applicant 's possession .", "CARDINAL . Whilst the applicant was in the process of collecting the vehicles , ORG obtained in fresh proceedings before ORG of GPE , and on an ex parte basis , an interim decision which ordered the applicant to deliver the said vehicles to PERSON . This order was issued on DATE and served on the same date on the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The order was to be enforced on DATE . On DATE , the applicant 's lawyer appeared before the court and requested time to appeal against the order . The court fixed the case for directions on CARDINAL DATE and then again on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE May in order to afford time to the parties to settle their dispute . The court invited the lawyer to file an appeal DATE before CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , the applicant filed its appeal on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant maintained that the court had been misled by PERSON , which had failed to disclose the real facts of the case and the previous judgment and decision of ORG . The applicant invited ORG to hold a hearing as soon as possible in view of the fact that the fleet of \u201c Z \u201d cars was worth CARDINAL Cypriot pounds . Furthermore , the applicant alleged that the unauthorised use of the vehicles under the interim decision would entail a reduction of their value and would prevent the applicant from presenting them to the competent authorities in order to have their licenses renewed . Finally , the applicant affirmed that it had never entered into such an agreement with PERSON .", "CARDINAL . As the parties had reached no settlement of the case by CARDINAL DATE , ORG fixed the hearing for DATE . On DATE , the judge stopped the hearing at TIME , because of the \u201c lateness of TIME \u201d , and adjourned it until DATE , during the DATE recess . However , the judge pointed out that he would be working during this period .", "CARDINAL . The hearing started on DATE . Evidence given by PERSON was completed on DATE .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant , the hearing should have been completed in DATE or at DATE . However , it was repeatedly adjourned due to the illness of either the advocate for the plaintiff or the judge dealing with the case , as well as to the latter 's transfer to other pending court proceedings .", "CARDINAL . At the end of the hearing on DATE , the applicant 's lawyer had indicated CARDINAL dates in DATE on which he could make himself available for the continuation of the hearing , but the advocate for the plaintiff declared that he would be unavailable due to other court commitments .", "CARDINAL . Adjournments were thus ordered until DATE ( because the advocate for the plaintiff had to undergo an operation ) , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE , CARDINAL DATE ( due to the court 's lack of time and the illness of the advocate for the plaintiff ) , DATE , DATE , DATE ( on which date the case was heard by another judge because the judge dealing with the case was ill ) , DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , CARDINAL DATE , DATE , DATE , and CARDINAL and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and as a result of the repeated adjournments , the applicant filed an application for certiorari and prohibition with ORG . It sought the annulment of the interim order because of the excessive delay in the proceedings before ORG . The applicant also alleged that the court had exceeded its jurisdiction on a matter of construction involving section CARDINAL of LAW . On DATE ORG refused the application . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision and , by way of a letter to the President of ORG , invited him to expedite the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Following a letter from the applicant 's lawyer , who complained about the delay in the proceedings , the President of ORG assigned the case to a new judge on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on DATE , PERSON had applied for an order of imprisonment of the applicant 's managers for contempt of the interim order of DATE . Initially fixed for DATE , the hearing was adjourned until DATE and then until DATE , because of the direct relevance of these proceedings to those concerning the interim order . Due to the DATE recess both sets of proceedings were fixed for hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided that the hearing relating to the interim order should precede the contempt hearing . The hearing commenced on DATE and was adjourned until DATE , and then until DATE because the plaintiff 's advocate had failed to summon a witness whom he wished to call to give evidence . The hearing continued on DATE , but on DATE it was adjourned until DATE at the request of the plaintiff 's advocate . The court rejected the objection by the applicant 's lawyer 's on the ground that the adjournment was granted in order to permit the other party to prepare a document which would expedite the proceedings . The hearing continued on CARDINAL , DATE and DATE and the court heard CARDINAL witnesses .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , when the hearing was to be resumed , the advocate for the plaintiff requested an adjournment because his bad state of health necessitated an operation abroad . The continuation of the hearing was fixed for DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the date on which the hearing in the contempt proceedings ought to have taken place , ORG again ordered an adjournment until DATE and then until DATE because the plaintiff 's advocate was hospitalised abroad . However , following a protest by the applicant 's lawyer , the court affirmed that no further request for an adjournment would be granted .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG again adjourned the hearing until DATE in order to give time to the newly appointed lawyer for the plaintiff to familiarise himself with the case . The applicant 's lawyer did not object because he stated that he had other court commitments .", "CARDINAL . The hearing resumed on DATE with the testimonies of CARDINAL witnesses , thus bringing to CARDINAL the total number of witnesses heard . On DATE , the parties made their final addresses .", "CARDINAL . By judgment of CARDINAL DATE , ORG held that the interim order was no longer in force . It declared it null and void because the plaintiff had failed to prove its allegations ; it also held , at page CARDINAL of the judgment , that the failure of ORG to file the Statement of Claim over a DATE period could not be attributed to the illness of the lawyer .", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of PERSON . CARDINAL ( Civil Procedure ) reads as follows :", "\u201c The court may at any time during a pending action make an order for the ... preservation , custody , sale , detention or inspection of any property being the subject of the action , or an order for preventing any loss , damage or prejudice which but for the making of the order might be occasioned to any person or property , pending a final judgment on some question affecting such person or property or pending the execution of the judgment . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Section CARDINAL of PERSON . CARDINAL ( Civil Procedure ) reads as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Any order which the court has power to make may , upon proof of urgency or other special circumstances , be made on the application of any party to the action without notice to the other party .", "( CARDINAL ) Before making any such order without notice the court shall require the person applying for it to enter into a recognisance , with or without a surety or sureties as the court thinks fit , as a security for his being answerable in damages to the person against whom the order is sought .", "( CARDINAL ) No such order made without notice shall remain in force for a longer period than is necessary for service of notice of it on all persons affected by it and enabling them to appear before the court and object to it ; and every such order shall at DATE cease to be in force , unless the court , upon hearing the parties or any of them , shall otherwise direct ; and every such order shall be dealt with in the action as the court thinks just .", "( CARDINAL ) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect or apply to the powers of the court to issue writs of execution . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In some recent judgments ORG has ruled that the procedure for deciding an interim order which is issued on an ex parte basis is an exceptional one and must therefore be dealt with and treated as a matter of urgency . In CARDINAL cases , ORG decided that such an order must be served within DATE and be brought before the judge for trial within DATE ( judgments of DATE and DATE ) . ORG found that periods of CARDINAL and DATE to serve the order , and give the other party an opportunity to oppose it , were excessive . In the case of SPE Agias Fylas v. PERSON ( judgment of DATE ) , ORG ruled that , if a court issued an ex parte order which is not urgent , it will be set aside for excess of jurisdiction ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
