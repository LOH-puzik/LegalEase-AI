THE UNITED KINGDOM", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicant , Mr PERSON , is a GPE national , who was born in DATE and lives in GPE . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in ORG . The respondent Government are represented by PERSON , ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Under the terms of a tenancy commencing from DATE , the applicant lived in a house owned by his son . The latter lived in GPE , and the property was managed by his mother , the applicant 's estranged wife , under a power of attorney granted to her by the son .", "In DATE the applicant submitted a claim for housing benefit to the local authority , which was refused as follows :", "\u201c I regret to inform you that I can not award Housing Benefit because , in my opinion , you do not have a true liability to pay rent . Regulation CARDINAL [ see below ] ... covers this matter . The basis on which I have made this decision is as follows :", "i. You have been unable to provide a rent book or written statement of your current rent arrears .", "ii . There is no indication that your landlord has taken any formal action to recover the property due to non - payment of rent . It is unusual for a landlord to allow rent arrears to accrue for this length of time without taking action .", "iii . You appear to have lived ' rent free ' in the property DATE , when your tenancy commenced .", "Moreover , even if a liability to pay rent did exist it could be argued that your situation as a tenant has been created primarily in order to obtain ORG Regulation CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ... covers this matter . \u201d", "The applicant appealed to an adjudicator who refused the appeal , holding , in accordance with LAW of ORG , LAW DATE ( \u201c section CARDINAL \u201d : see below ) , that the applicant was not legally required to pay rent . The applicant appealed to ORG ( \u201c HBRB \u201d ) . The ORG heard evidence from the applicant and his estranged wife and dismissed the appeal on DATE , holding under LAW that the applicant 's liability to pay rent had been created to take advantage of the housing benefit scheme .", "The applicant , acting as a litigant in person , applied for leave to seek judicial review of this decision , and was initially refused . He appealed to ORG , which held that it was arguable that the ORG had failed properly to apply the burden of proof in favour of the applicant . ORG therefore granted leave to apply for judicial review .", "On DATE Mr Justice PERSON in the High Court quashed the ORG 's decision and remitted it to the ORG for re - determination . He held that , although the ORG had purported to be acting under LAW , the reasons given in support of the decision suggested that the ORG believed that the applicant was not under a liability to pay rent . Moreover , the reasoning of its decision appeared , wrongly , to place the burden of proof on the applicant . He also commented that the ORG had not adequately considered certain evidence which supported \u201c ... a reasonably cogent case in favour of the existence of a genuine tenancy , ie a true or genuine liability to pay rent \u201d .", "On DATE , after a hearing on DATE at which the applicant had refused to present his case , the ORG again rejected the applicant 's claim for housing benefit , finding under LAW that \u201c there was ample evidence that the purported rental agreement did not establish a genuine liability to pay rent \u201d .", "The applicant sought judicial review . He contended that the ORG was under an obligation to follow the comment in PERSON Justice PERSON 's judgment that he had a \u201c reasonably cogent case \u201d , and thus grant his claim for housing benefit . He was granted leave on DATE , on the ground that the ORG 's decision did not set out the evidence on which it had based its finding that the applicant was under no legal obligation to pay rent .", "On DATE HBRBs ceased to exist and were replaced by new statutory Appeal Tribunals , which had no councillor members ( see statement of domestic law below ) .", "On DATE the local authority applied to ORG for a stay of the judicial review proceedings . The ORG had withdrawn its decision of CARDINAL DATE and had offered to pay the applicant 's reasonable costs and rehear and re - determine his claim for housing benefit . The applicant opposed the stay because he believed that the ORG should undertake to grant his application for housing benefit .", "On DATE Mr Justice PERSON ordered the stay because there was no purpose in continuing the proceedings : the local authority had already offered everything the applicant could have hoped to achieve through judicial review . He explained that , under LANGUAGE law , a court on an application for judicial review of a decision by a body such as the ORG could only quash the ORG 's decision , if wrong in law , but could not substitute its own decision as to whether housing benefit should be granted . Even if Mr Justice PERSON 's judgment could be interpreted as finding that the applicant was under a genuine obligation to pay rent , ORG had no power to make such a finding , but could only remit the case to the ORG for a fresh determination .", "The applicant appealed to ORG . His appeal was refused on DATE , on the ground , inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... [ the applicant ] misreads Mr Justice PERSON 's judgment and indeed , as I think , partly misunderstands the nature of judicial review proceedings . Judicial review proceedings - at least these judicial review proceedings - are concerned with the decision - making process and not with the actual decision made . In the circumstances of housing benefit , ORG has set up a structure for determining whether it should be paid and to whom , and that structure does not involve decisions by the court . The court is concerned to review the process and the reasoning , but not to make the decision ... . \u201d", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant leave to appeal to ORG .", "The local authority then referred the applicant 's claim to the new statutory Appeal Tribunal ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the statement of Domestic Law , below ) , without , however , first informing the applicant or seeking his consent . The case was listed for hearing on DATE , but in a letter dated DATE the applicant withdrew the appeal .", "Housing benefit is payable to people on low incomes by the local authority . By CARDINAL of ORG , LAW DATE ,", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) A person is entitled to housing benefit if :", "( a ) he is liable to make payments in respect of a dwelling in ORG which he occupies as his home ... \u201d", "Regulation CARDINAL of ORG ( General ) Regulations DATE provides :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The following persons shall be treated as if they were not liable to make payments in respect of a dwelling :", "( a ) a person who resides with the person to whom he is liable to make payments in respect of the dwelling ... ;", "( b ) a person whose liability to make payments in respect of the dwelling appears to the appropriate authority to have been created to take advantage of the housing benefit scheme except someone who was , for any period within DATE prior to the creation of the agreement ORG giving rise to the liability to make such payments , otherwise liable to make payments of rent in respect of the same dwelling . \u201d", "At the relevant time , a claim to housing benefit was first considered by officials employed by the local authority and working in the housing department . If the benefit was refused the claimant was entitled to a review of the decision , first by the local authority itself , then by a ORG , which comprised CARDINAL elected councillors from the local authority .", "After the coming into force of LAW CARDINAL , the compatibility of HBRBs with LAW became open to challenge in the domestic courts . In PERSON ( NORP on the application of ) v. ORG [ DATE ] EWHC Admin CARDINAL , the Secretary of ORG conceded that the ORG lacked the appearance of an independent and impartial tribunal . The determination of the central issues of fact in the case depended on an assessment by ORG as to whether the claimant was telling the truth . ORG found that judicial review proceedings were insufficient to remedy the problem , since ORG could not \u201c cure the often imperceptible effects of the influence of the connection between the fact finding body and a party to the dispute since it [ had ] no jurisdiction to reach its own conclusion on the primary facts ; still less any power to weigh the evidence \u201d .", "On DATE HBRBs ceased to exist . They were replaced by a new system in which determinations of the kind previously made by HBRBs are now made by a new statutory Appeal ORG . Members of such Appeal Tribunals do not include councillors .", "Under the transitional provisions contained in Regulation CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of ORG ) ( Transitional and Savings ) Regulations DATE , any decision which would fall to be made by a ORG but for the coming into force of the new system should be made by ORG . In the PERSON case , which involved a decision by the ORG before the new system became operative , the relief granted was the quashing of the ORG 's decision and an order remitting the case to an ORG under the transitional regulations ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
