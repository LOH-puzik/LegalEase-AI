He is represented before the Court by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , and ORG .", "The applicant was a bishop in ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) . On DATE ORG of the MOC ( \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043e\u0442 PERSON ) dismissed him from this duty on the ground that he had violated the oath ( NORP \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435/ \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0430 ) by which he had pledged to safeguard the ORG \u2019s unity and LAW by his unilateral accession to ORG ( \u201c the SOC \u201d ) . On DATE , the applicant was expelled from the FAC . He was also prevented from carrying out ceremonies and preaching in all churches and monasteries .", "On DATE ORG ( \u201c the trial court \u201d ) convicted the applicant of inciting ethnic , racial and religious hatred and intolerance and sentenced him to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment . It established that the applicant had accepted , although being aware that it would instigate religious hatred and intolerance among believers in the ORG , to be appointed by the ORG as an exarch of the so - called ORG and to represent the latter as the only valid church in the respondent State . In that capacity , he had undertaken the following .", "a ) In DATE , he released a religious calendar in which he had made , inter alia , the following defamatory statements in respect of the ORG :", "\u201c ... the dissident high episcopacy of the so - called ORG bears full responsibility for the lack of religious education of the people . The bishops of that dissident organisation , since the beginning of the schism in DATE until the present , behave inadequately given the function which they were bound to by God . They persistently put their own interests before the interests of the church . They were and still remain the last bastion of communism ... The people ... allowed a few so - called archbishops , unrecognised by anyone , to decide about their church ... If people were aware of the [ importance of the church ] , they would never allow some worldlings and heretics to decide on the destiny of the ORG .", "Unfortunately , the schism in ORG , which began in DATE , meant that many religious surrogates were created on our territory .", "The latest heresy disseminated by the high episcopacy of the dissident organisation , which calls itself ORG , is to accept the schism as a normal state of affairs which they defend by non - religious methods ...", "ORG of the episcopacy of ORG ... allowed the dissident archbishops in GPE to reunite ... with ORG , on pain of being taken before ORG . CARDINAL new episcopes , PERSON , were appointed as adjuncts of [ the applicant ] ...", "Being aware that if they targeted the pastor they would destroy the herd , the dissidents , who call themselves ORG , endeavour to discredit [ the applicant ] , who is the only canonical episcope in the territory of GPE ...", "They are further aware that if the state authorities let Patriarch PERSON ( the Patriarch of ORG at that time ) and other archbishops of other ORG to enter GPE , the people would soon realise that everything they said about [ the applicant ] was untrue and a political trick ... \u201d", "b ) In DATE , he attended the confirmation ( \u0445\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430 ) of PERSON episcopes . Both were proposed by ORG with a view to creating the illusion of a parallel ORG of the ORG . The ceremony took place in a church in GPE , GPE .", "c ) On DATE the applicant held a religious ceremony in an apartment owned by his parents which , according to him , served as a religious object . In doing so , the applicant stirred up considerable religious hatred and intolerance among believers in the ORG and provoked various associations of citizens and other organisations .", "The trial court established that , as a historical fact , the ORG had existed on the territory of the respondent State as an ecclesiastical power until DATE , when it had been abolished by GPE . Since then , ORG and , briefly , ORG , had been in power . The ORG had further existed DATE , having autonomy under the ORG . The ORG \u201c did not have an interest in GPE having an independent [ autocephalous ] ORG , but rather an autonomous church , as was the ORG ... after the breakup of GPE and the independence of GPE , the ORG was constituted , which increased the gap with the ORG \u201d The court further found it undisputed that the ORG was not recognised by the ORG and that due to that dispute , the ORG was not recognised by any of the churches of ORG either .", "The court established that the applicant , after being appointed exarch by the ORG , had started acting as a leader of ORG as the true ORG in the respondent ORG , in parallel to the ORG . At his request , the ORG made PERSON with a view to creating ORG of the Ohrid Archiepiscopate . He designated his GPE apartment as the seat of ORG , where he held religious ceremonies on many occasions . He denied the existence of the ORG , as well as the reputation and dignity of its leaders . His ideas in favour of the restoration of ORG under the ORG \u2019s jurisdiction were only supported by a small group of priests and citizens .", "The court found that the applicant , in the religious calendar of DATE , had made untrue , disrespectful and defamatory statements about the ORG and its leaders . He had attempted to present himself as a martyr seeking salvation for the NORP people , whom he called ignorant and illiterate . The court described the calendar as \u201c bad and vulgar in respect of the religious feelings of the NORP people \u201d . It found that , in addition , the applicant had described the religious teaching of the ORG as \u201c heretical \u201d .", "The court established that the applicant had released the calendar , although he denied it . The calendar was published by a monastery located in his GPE DATE house , a fact which could not have been unknown to him . The calendar was fully devoted to him and his activities ; it further contained pictures of him taken on different occasions . Its text reflected his ideas on denying the existence of the ORG , which he had continued to express during the trial . The court therefore concluded that the applicant had determined the text of the calendar , and printed and distributed it through his followers .", "It further established that the applicant had not succeeded in persuading people to accept his teaching , but rather , had instigated hatred towards himself and his followers . The ensuing revolt and intolerance had derived from an infringement of the religious sensibilities of the people , who had requested the state authorities to intervene . He had even been threatened with assault . In this connection , the court referred to an incident of DATE when a considerable number of people had gathered in front of the applicant \u2019s home to protest about his activities .", "The trial court rendered the decision after it had heard submissions from the applicant and several witnesses and examined other documentary evidence . It disregarded the applicant \u2019s arguments that several ORG could exist in the respondent ORG , stating that only the ORG and its ORG existed under LAW .", "The applicant appealed and complained , inter alia , that the proceedings in question concerned his freedom of religion , which was guaranteed under LAW . He was convicted for having expressed different religious opinions than those of the members of ORG . Even though the applicant agreed with the contents of the calendar , he complained that no evidence had been presented that he had published it . He complained that the conduct as a result of which he had been found guilty could not be interpreted as incitement to religious hatred and intolerance , but only as an insult or defamation , which could only be prosecuted by means of a private action .", "On DATE ORG held a hearing which was attended by the applicant , his lawyer and a representative of the public prosecutor \u2019s office . The court upheld the applicant \u2019s conviction under all CARDINAL heads . It found no reason to depart from the trial court \u2019s reasoning that the applicant had deliberately undertaken the actions he was convicted of and that he had instigated a schism in the ORG and religious hatred and intolerance among NORP churchgoers .", "The court held that the applicant had abused the right to freedom of religion by creating a parallel ORG , which was contrary to the LAW , under which there was only CARDINAL ORG on the territory of the respondent ORG . It concluded that the applicant had aimed to implement the ideas of a foreign state on the territory of the respondent ORG .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a request with ORG for extraordinary review of a final judgment ( \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430 , hereinafter \u201c extraordinary review request \u201d ) . He complained that he had been convicted on the basis of having acceded to another religious community and holding a religious ceremony in his home . As regards the calendar , he reiterated that , ultimately , he could only be held criminally responsible for insult and/ or defamation , which were not prosecutable except by means of a private action . He invoked , inter alia , LAW .", "On DATE ORG ruled partly in favour of the applicant and upheld his conviction only in respect of the distribution of the religious calendar . It decided that the applicant \u2019s conduct under b ) and c ) described in the trial court \u2019s decision did not fall within the scope of CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( see \u201c Relevant domestic law \u201d below ) . In this latter context , it found that the applicant \u2019s presence at the confirmation ceremony in GPE and the religious ceremony in his home were to be regarded as falling within the right to freedom of thought and religion and were , as such , protected under LAW .", "As to the religious calendar , it stated inter alia , that :", "\u201c ... the way in which [ the applicant ] entered the public arena by way of the religious calendar of DATE , which was distributed in the homes of believers in GPE and further afield , the formulations he used , his position , the aims he wished to achieve and the consequences of his activities , analysed in the context of the freedom of thought , conscience and religion , as well as the right of freedom of religion of others , is an act which was directed towards the violation of the legal order which guarantees these rights .", "A criminal offence is committed when , irrespective of the manner it is undertaken , an action demonstrates that certain expressions were deliberately intended to serve as propaganda instigating ethnic , racial and religious hatred , division and intolerance ... \u201d", "ORG further stated that :", "\u201c The conduct of [ the applicant ] , who was appointed exarch of the so - called ORG by the Patriarch of ORG , with a view to creating a parallel Holy Synod in GPE , went beyond the freedom of thought , conscience and religion . The facts of the case ... confirm that the public expression of thought , or as the convicted stated \u2013 his freedom of religion \u2013 by way of the religious calendar of DATE , which was addressed to orthodox believers in ORG , in the view of ORG , can not be regarded as an expression of his personal intellectual stance nor it is an intellectual , theological and scientific opinion addressed to [ those believers ] . The calendar of DATE , by its contents and aim , was a direct violation of the freedom of others to have their own thought , conscience and religion , namely belief in ORG and its existence for DATE , in the canons of orthodox communion , in its ceremonies etc . The contents of the religious calendar directly incite and encourage religious intolerance and division among NORP believers in ORG .", "The rights of others , namely to the freedom of religion , entail respect for believers as stipulated in LAW . That , according to ORG , was violated with the provocative depiction of events in the calendar . Defamatory statements such as \u201c those who claim that ORG exists spread heresy \u201d and \u201c ORG is heretical \u201d , are , at the least , a somewhat unusual form of communication between believers and churches .", "[ The applicant \u2019s ] expression ... acting always as an exarch appointed by ORG , reaches high level of abuse and , as such , demonstrates a denial and violation of others\u2019 freedom of thought and religion and can not , accordingly , be tolerated in a free and democratic society . His activities are directed towards the believers in ORG in order to stir up religious hatred and intolerance . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL , as far as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The freedom of conviction , conscience , thought and public expression of thought is guaranteed ... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL , as far as relevant and modified with Amendment VII , provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) The freedom of religion is guaranteed .", "( CARDINAL ) The right to express one \u2019s religion , freely and publicly , individually or with others , is guaranteed .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG , as well as ORG in GPE , ORG , ORG , ORG and other religious communities and groups are separate from the ORG and equal before the law ... \u201d", "Article CARDINAL , insofar as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) Every citizen may seek protection of freedoms and rights set out in the LAW before courts of general jurisdiction , as well as before ORG , in a procedure based on the principles of priority and urgency ... \u201d", "\u201c ORG :", "...", "( CARDINAL ) protects the freedoms and rights of individuals and citizens concerning the freedom of conviction , conscience , thought and public expression of thought ; political association and activity ; and the prohibition of discrimination among citizens on the grounds of sex , race , religion , national , social and political affiliation ;", "... \u201d", "Section CARDINAL of the Criminal Code provides , inter alia , that any person incites national , racial or religious hatred , disagreement and intolerance by coercion , ill - treatment , or duress , who insults national , ethnic and religious symbols , or damages monuments and cemeteries , or in any other way incites national , racial or religious hatred , disagreement and intolerance shall be punished with CARDINAL to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment .", "Section CARDINAL of the Rules of Procedure of ORG , insofar as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c Any citizen who considers that his or her right or freedom set out in LAW has been violated by an individual act or action , may seek protection by ORG within DATE from DATE he or she was served with the final individual act ... \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
