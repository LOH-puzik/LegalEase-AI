He was represented before the ORG by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , PERSON , ORG at ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "Until DATE the applicant was the managing director of ORG , a company incorporated under NORP law . The company ran a mail - order business selling food supplements designed to aid weight loss . Among these were a liquid product called PERSON CARDINAL and effervescent tablets called LANGUAGE - GPE . The applicant indicated that these had been purchased from \u201c a laboratory with the normal accreditation for such products \u201d , based in GPE .", "The applicant added that the products in question had previously been marketed in GPE and that \u201c for this reason , ORG , ORG and the Environment had , in accordance with the procedure in place in the country , authorised [ their ] release onto the market after verification of [ their ] conformity as a nutrient[s ] within the meaning of Community legislation and in particular Directive No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE \u201d . In that connection he provided , in particular , a document dated DATE , issued by ORG , acknowledging receipt of a \u201c notification file \u201d and assigning a \u201c plant number \u201d to GPE .", "Advertising carried out for the marketing of these products in GPE attracted the attention of ORG , ORG , which consequently conducted a number of investigations ( in DATE and DATE ) . Noting that the Sveltys - GPE tablets contained sodium benzoate , they contacted the person who had taken over from the applicant as managing director of DATE who passed them the above - mentioned document dated DATE and then contacted ORG in GPE . The latter responded in the following terms in a letter dated DATE :", "\u201c ... Further to your letter dated DATE relating to non - compliance of the food supplement L[y]ghtyss with Directive No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL on food additives other than colours and sweeteners ( unauthorised presence of sodium benzoate in a solid food supplement ) ... , we have taken the necessary measures to compel the company ORG that markets this product in GPE to comply with the directive within DATE . If the company fails to do so within the period we have allowed , we shall withdraw its notification number .... We thank you for this information ... \u201d", "The applicant and the person who had succeeded him as managing director of the company ORG and the company itself were prosecuted in the criminal courts . They were charged with , inter alia , false advertising , firstly regarding the composition , essential qualities , content of active ingredients , mode of manufacture , properties and expected effects of food supplements with alleged slimming qualities , and secondly by featuring fictitious studies by researchers on the identity , qualifications or skills of the retailers of these products . They were also prosecuted for having ( during DATE and until DATE ) displayed , marketed or sold foodstuffs to be used for human consumption which they knew to be adulterated , tainted or toxic , by marketing food supplements containing sodium benzoate ( ORG tablets ) , namely , an unauthorised product in non - liquid food supplements .", "By a decision of DATE , ORG found the defendants guilty on those counts . It sentenced the applicant to CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of QUANTITY ( ORG ) ; the other defendants were sentenced to fines of LAW and LAW respectively .", "ORG upheld ORG ruling on these points . Its judgment , delivered on DATE , highlights the following points in particular :", "\u201c ... the Order of DATE [ which transposes into NORP law several ORG directives on food additives , including Directive No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE ] , provides that \u2018 maximum levels indicated in GPE , PERSON and V refer to foodstuffs as marketed , unless otherwise stated ; sodium benzoate ( preservative E CARDINAL ) appears in GPE of this Order , which is permitted in food supplements up to a level of QUANTITY , but only in liquid food supplements .", "The PERSON - Lightyss tablets were sold in solid form , so it is immaterial whether they were effervescent or intended to be ingested in liquid form .", "Once ORG had acknowledged that the presence of sodium benzoate in solid tablets was such as to cause it to revise its previous position , the defendants could no longer rely on an authorisation they had obtained from the NORP authorities ; in any event , a decision taken by the authorities contrary to Community law does not create rights and can not result in an acquittal of the defendants on these charges ... \u2019", "By a judgment of DATE , ORG dismissed an appeal lodged by the convicted parties , rejecting the ground of appeal based , inter alia , on LAW as follows :", "\u201c It is apparent from the judgment appealed against and the documents in the proceedings that the company ORG and its CARDINAL successive managing directors ... were prosecuted in the criminal court on a charge of selling and releasing for sale adulterated food products on the grounds that in DATE and DATE theysold food supplements in the form of effervescent tablets , called PERSON and PERSON , containing an illegal additive : sodium benzoate ;", "In finding the defendants guilty of the offence , ORG held that the tablets were released for sale in solid form and that , consequently , the use of sodium benzoate was not permitted , since Directive No . CARDINAL of DATE , transposed into national law by the ministerial order of DATE , restricts the use of this preservative to liquid food supplements ;", "On these grounds alone , and since at the material time sodium benzoate could not be incorporated , either in GPE or GPE , into solid food supplements , ORG justified its decision with regard to the legal and LAW provisions relied on ;", "... \u201d", "Article L. CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the Consumer Code is worded as follows :", "\u201c Anyone who", "CARDINAL . adulterates foodstuffs for human or animal consumption , medicines , drinks , or agricultural or natural products intended for sale ;", "CARDINAL . displays , markets or sells foodstuffs for human or animal consumption , drinks , or agricultural or natural products which they know to be adulterated , tainted or toxic", "shall be liable to the penalties provided for in LAW", "... \u201d", "The adulteration of a product may result from the addition of a substance deemed illegal under the applicable law ( PERSON . PERSON . , DATE , No . CARDINAL ) or , more generally , from \u201c recourse to unlawful processing that fails to comply with the regulations in place , with the effect of altering the substance \u201d ( GPE . PERSON . , DATE , No . CARDINAL ) .", "Directive No . CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of ORG and ORG on food additives other than colours and sweeteners \u201d ( ORG L CARDINAL of DATE , p.CARDINAL ) stipulates that the additives listed in GPE and PERSON \u201c may only be used in the foodstuffs referred to in [ the said ] PERSON and under the conditions specified therein \u201d ( LAW , paragraph CARDINAL of the Directive ) . Sodium benzoate appears in GPE ( Part A ) . Unlike \u201c liquid \u201d food supplements , \u201c solid \u201d food supplements are not mentioned in the list of foodstuffs for which they can be used .
