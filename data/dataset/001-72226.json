She was represented before the Court by PERSON , a lawyer pracitisig in GPE . The respondent Government were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON , Director in ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents , may be summarised as follows .", "On DATE , the applicant had an accident in the street and suffered injuries to her head and right shoulder . An insurance company granted her a DATE allowance ( p\u00e4iv\u00e4raha , dagpenning ) for PERCENT reduction of her working capacity until DATE and an accident pension ( tapaturmael\u00e4ke , olycksfallspension ) for PERCENT reduction of her working capacity from DATE to CARDINAL DATE .", "By its decision of DATE the insurance company granted the applicant a further accident pension for PERCENT reduction of her working capacity for DATE . As to the period DATE onwards , it considered that the injuries sustained in the accident reduced the applicant \u2019s working capacity by PERCENT . The company considered that other medical problems rendering the applicant incapable of working had not been caused by the said accident . It also rejected the application for disability compensation ( haittaraha , meners\u00e4ttning ) as it considered that the accident had not caused a permanent disability of the minimum level required for compensation .", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( tapaturmalautakunta , olycksfallsn\u00e4mnden ) , which received the insurance company \u2019s observations and communicated them to the applicant . She submitted a further written medical opinion of DATE .", "On DATE ORG rejected the appeal , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c Section CARDINALa ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( tapaturmavakuutuslaki , lagen om olycksfallsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring , DATE ) provides that disability compensation shall be paid to an employee , who is not entitled to a DATE allowance and who as a result of an accident has suffered a permanent general disability due to injury or illness . A general disability is to be considered as permanent when the injury or the state of illness will not improve according to medical probability .", "According to ... section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) , the lowest level CARDINAL disability is applicable only to eye and finger injury and illness . As to other kinds of injury , disabilities that do not attain level CARDINAL can not be assessed due to their minor nature .", "According to the medical information on the applicant \u2019s injuries presented in the case , she is not suffering from a permanent general disability attaining level CARDINAL .", "According to the information presented in the case , the scratches on the applicant \u2019s forehead , the strain in her right shoulder , forearm and shoulder joint reduced working capacity by PERCENT after DATE . Thus , the applicant is not entitled to an accident pension after that date . As for the injuries sustained in the accident , she is to be considered to be fit to work as a typist and a salesperson in her own company as from DATE .", "The applicant \u2019s incapacity to work and the medical expenses from DATE have been caused by a chronic symptom complex , depression , insomnia and scoliosis , which do not relate to the accident and which do not give rise to an entitlement to accident compensation .", "... \u201d", "The applicant appealed to ORG ( vakuutusoikeus , f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ) , claiming , inter alia , an accident pension from DATE . She underlined , referring to several medical reports , that the chronic symptom complex had been caused by the accident .

The court upheld ORG decision , giving the following reasons :", "\u201c The reasons are mentioned in ORG decision . The submitted new evidence does not give rise to different conclusions . ORG finds , having regard to the evidence , that the displacement of the shoulder blade did not result from the accident and therefore it does not give rise to an entitlement to compensation based on LAW . \u201d", "The applicant sought leave to appeal from ORG , which received observations from ORG and observations in reply from the insurance company and the applicant . At this point the applicant requested that ORG hold an oral hearing with a view to hearing her physician PERSON She also wanted to be heard in person . The applicant filed several further submissions , on DATE , CARDINAL DATE and DATE .", "By its decision of DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "Subsequently , apparently in DATE , the applicant lodged an application for an annulment , inter alia , on the strength of evidence that had not been at the courts\u2019 disposal during the previous proceedings . She requested on oral hearing with a view to hearing medical doctors as witnesses . She also wanted to be heard in person . By its decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG transferred the application to ORG .", "By its decision of DATE ORG , refusing the request for an oral hearing as manifestly unnecessary having regard to the character of extraordinary appeal proceedings , rejected the application for an annulment as it considered that there were no grounds for a re - examination of the case . ORG reasoned , inter alia :", "\u201c ... the mere fact that the treating doctors and ORG have reached different conclusions in their assessments of the causality between the accident and the [ applicant \u2019s ] health problems does not mean that ORG decision was based on incorrect or insufficient information or that it was contrary to the law , and that the decision should be annulled or that it would prevent [ this court from ] examining the case on the documents . \u201d", "The applicant sought leave to appeal , maintaining that she had the right to an oral hearing . On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "Section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of the then LAW ( Suomen hallitusmuoto , ORG ; CARDINAL ) provided that a decision must be reasoned . A new similar provision can be found in section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) of LAW ( NORP perustuslaki , PERSON grundlag ; GPE ) .", "At the relevant time chapter CARDINAL , section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) of LAW ( oikeudenk\u00e4ymiskaari , r\u00e4tteg\u00e5ngsbalken ) provided that a judgment must be reasoned , indicating the facts and the legal argumentation on which it was based and the grounds which have led the court to hold a disputed issue established or unsubstantiated .", "Section CARDINAL of the then LAW ( laki vakuutusoikeudesta , lagen om f\u00f6rs\u00e4kringsdomstolen ; CARDINAL ) provided that proceedings in ORG were written . When there were exceptional reasons , ORG could however decide to hold an oral hearing . It also provided that the provisions concerning proceedings in general courts were , mutatis mutandis , applied to those before ORG .", "Section CARDINAL of the Decree on ORG ( asetus tapaturmalautakunnasta , f\u00f6rordningen om olycksfallsn\u00e4mnden ; CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that ORG functions as the first appellate body in matters concerning obligatory accident insurance .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW ( tapaturmavakuutuslaki , lag om olycksfallsf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring ; DATE ) provides that appellate bodies in accident insurance matters are ORG , ORG and ORG .", "On ORG there are a full - time president , CARDINAL vice - presidents and CARDINAL lawyer and medical doctor members as well as CARDINAL members representing labour market organizations . They all bear the responsibility of a judge . The president , the vice - presidents and the lawyer members must be qualified to sit as a judge and they must have a good knowledge of accident insurance . The medical doctor members must be registered and have a good knowledge of insurance medicine . All the members and their personal substitutes were at the relevant time appointed by ORG for a fixed term of DATE . The labour market members were appointed on a proposal by the ORG and GPE organizations ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
