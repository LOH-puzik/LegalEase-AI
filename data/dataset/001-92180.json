He is represented before the ORG by Ms PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "and as they appear from the documents on the file , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant arrived in GPE on an unspecified date . On DATE he married a NORP citizen , who gave birth to their son in DATE . The CARDINAL of them lived together until the applicant \u2019s deportation to his country of origin , GPE , in DATE .", "In DATE the applicant had obtained a temporary residence permit based on the marriage . In DATE he was granted a permanent residence permit .", "On DATE the ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicant of an aggravated narcotics offence for having dealt in heroin during the period from DATE to DATE and sentenced him to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . The conviction was upheld by ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) on DATE although the sentence was reduced to CARDINAL years\u2019 imprisonment . On DATE ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) upheld the conviction and sentence .", "On DATE ORG ( ulkomaalaisvirasto , utl\u00e4nningsverket ) decided to deport the applicant owing to his criminal activity and issued a DATE refusal of entry to the GPE area . It considered that , through his criminal activity , he had endangered public order and safety . ORG noted that , according to practice , aggravated offences usually resulted in the issuing of a refusal of entry which would normally remain in force until further notice . However , having regard to the applicant \u2019s family ties to GPE , it considered that a refusal of entry for DATE was appropriate .", "On DATE ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) quashed the decision because of the applicant \u2019s long stay in GPE and his family ties .", "ORG appealed . On DATE ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , finding that the grounds for deportation were weightier than the applicant \u2019s family ties and his DATE stay in GPE , quashed ORG decision and upheld the deportation order . The case turned on the fact that the applicant had been dealing in very dangerous drugs for monetary gain and in the circumstances , the deportation and refusal of entry would not be in breach of LAW ( DATE ; yleissopimus lapsen oikeuksista , konventionen om barnens r\u00e4ttigheter ; SopS CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE the applicant was deported to his country of origin .", "Section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the then Aliens Act ( ulkomaalaislaki , utl\u00e4nningslagen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provided , inter alia , that an alien convicted of a criminal offence which carried a sentence of DATE or more or an alien who repeatedly committed offences could be deported .", "Section CARDINAL provided that when deciding on deportation regard must be had to all the relevant facts and the circumstances as a whole such as the duration of the stay , the relationship between a child and its parent and family and other ties to GPE . The nature of the offence within the meaning of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) was also relevant .", "Under section CARDINAL a refusal of entry could be issued for a maximum period of DATE or until further notice ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
