In a number of decisions delivered before DATE ORG acknowledged the difficulties which legally - aided parties experienced in connection with lodging their cassation appeals against judgments of the first - instance administrative courts .

It analysed the relevant caselaw of the administrative courts and noted that the manner in which the beginning of the time - limit for lodging cassation appeals was determined had led to divergent results . It held that it was necessary to determine the relevant time in a manner compatible with effective access to the highest administrative court and which ensured equal treatment for parties represented by lawyers appointed under the legalaid scheme and by privately hired lawyers . The court held that the time - limit for a legally - aided party started to run only on DATE when a legal - aid lawyer had a genuine possibility of lodging the cassation appeal and not when he or she was informed of his or her assignment to the case . The court was of the view that the latter approach was far too rigid and rendered the effective enjoyment of legal assistance granted under the legal - aid system illusory .
