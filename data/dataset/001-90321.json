She remained hanging on the rope with her head pointing downwards QUANTITY below her co - climber . QUANTITY below her CARDINAL other climbers , Mr. and Mrs. PERSON , were preparing to start the same climb and witnessed the accident .", "At TIME and at TIME attempted to contact ORG and ORG using a mobile phone . Both lines were busy . After another attempt she reached ORG at TIME She was told that a helicopter would be sent immediately and that it would arrive at the place of the accident in TIME .", "The accident had also been reported to the operations centre of ORG in GPE by a tourist passing near the foot of the mountain . The records indicate that the operations centre received the first emergency call about the accident at TIME", "CARDINAL and TIME the co - climber fixed the ropes with a view to preventing PERSON from any further falls and descended by rope to the latter . PERSON was badly injured , but she remained conscious and communicated with her partner until TIME At TIME Mr. and Mrs. PERSON decided to climb up to PERSON and her partner .", "At TIME the duty officer of ORG informed Mr J. by phone that the helicopter would arrive in TIME as it was on a different rescue mission in GPE at that time .", "At TIME the doctor of ORG called Mr J. to tell him that the rescue team was on its way .", "The CARDINAL climbers supported PERSON , hydrated her and communicated with her .", "At TIME the rescue service helicopter landed in GPE to fill the fuel tank and to prepare the equipment needed for the rescue of PERSON . At TIME the helicopter took off from GPE . On its flight to the mountain it landed in LOC at TIME , to board CARDINAL member of ORG . It reached the place of the accident at TIME", "At TIME the pilot informed the land operator that strong turbulence was preventing PERSON from being rescued directly from the helicopter in flight . A reinforcement of the rescue team and special equipment were required in order to reach the injured person .", "The helicopter returned to ORG . CARDINAL a member of ORG with the necessary equipment joined the rescue team and the fuel tank was refilled .", "At TIME another CARDINAL members of ORG boarded the helicopter in LOC .", "At TIME the rescue team was dropped on the summit of the mountain . The helicopter flew off to attend to another accident .

She died at TIME", "Her body was lowered to the foot of the mountain by ropes at TIME", "A forensic doctor concluded , on DATE , that her death had been caused by the shock resulting from the injuries and by bleeding , and by a third degree embolism . The report indicated that PERSON had dislocated her right thigh bone , that the soft tissues of her right arm and thigh had been massively contused and that she had suffered from an intracranial haemorrhage .", "The applicant requested ORG ( \u00darad pre doh\u013ead nad zdravotnou starostlivos\u0165ou ) to examine whether appropriate medical assistance had been provided to his daughter .", "On DATE the ORG branch office of that institution replied to the applicant that no shortcomings had been established in the providing of medical assistance to PERSON .", "The letter stated that the helicopter team had been trained and equipped in accordance with the relevant law . The doctor , who had entered the climbing area of the mountain despite the fact that he had not been obliged to do so , found that PERSON had died before she was released from the rope and put on a transport stretcher . Resuscitation had not been possible in the situation . The question as to whether the life of the injured person could have been saved had there been an earlier intervention was purely hypothetical .", "The letter further stated that nothing indicated that the actions of ORG and ORG had not been duly coordinated . According to ORG , it had been more efficient to have recourse to ORG in the case of the applicant \u2019s daughter . In a letter of DATE the Minister of the ORG informed ORG that he had discovered no shortcomings in the action of ORG which fell under the authority of his Ministry .", "On DATE the sister of PERSON challenged the conclusions of the LOC branch office .", "On DATE , in its protocol , an expert commission under the authority of the President of ORG found an infringement of the relevant health care legislation by ORG .", "The commission held that the operator of ORG had proceeded erroneously when sending a helicopter based in GPE to intervene at the very extreme point of its operation area in GPE while a different helicopter based in GPE had been available for the same territory .", "The commission qualified the operator \u2019s misjudgment as a \u201c human factor \u201d failure . It had resulted in a delay of TIME during which the helicopter based in GPE had not been available for operations in the High Tatras .", "On DATE ORG informed ORG of the commission \u2019s findings . ORG was requested to bring administrative proceedings against ORG and to impose a fine for the latter \u2019s failure to comply with its duties .", "ORG discontinued the proceedings , on DATE , holding that ORG had not contravened any of the duties imposed by law .", "DATE ORG examined the way in which the operators of ORG had organised the rescue of the applicant \u2019s daughter .", "The report indicates that the operators had correctly decided to organise the rescue in co - ordination with ORG . To that effect they had contacted the latter at TIME , immediately after the incident had been reported .", "In particular , access to the place of the incident had been difficult . The rescue team would have needed TIME to reach it on foot . In addition , the operators had correctly presumed that the assistance of ORG was required with a view to ensuring the rapid transportation of the injured person to hospital . The members of ORG had been prepared to intervene in co - operation with ORG within TIME after the receipt of the information about the incident .", "ORG found no shortcomings in the way in which ORG had acted .", "On DATE criminal proceedings were brought within ORG in the context of the accident as a result of which the applicant \u2019s daughter had died . The investigator questioned CARDINAL witnesses . He considered a forensic report and questioned a forensic expert . Records of communications and reports on the rescue action were submitted by ORG and ORG . The investigator also considered other documentary evidence including reports of ORG and ORG .", "On the basis of the evidence obtained the police investigator concluded , on DATE , that the death of the applicant \u2019s daughter was the result of the injuries which she had suffered during the climb . Criminal liability of a third person in that context was not established . The criminal proceedings were therefore discontinued .", "The applicant filed a complaint . He argued , inter alia , that the investigator had disregarded the above protocol of the expert commission of ORG .", "On DATE a prosecutor of ORG in GPE , after having obtained additional documentary evidence , dismissed the applicant \u2019s complaint . The decision stated that the rescue helicopter had been intervening at a different place within its operation area at the time when the emergency call about the incident of the applicant \u2019s daughter had reached the operations centre . It had started attending to the incident in the High PERSON immediately after it had ended the previous rescue action . The expert commission \u2019s conclusion that a different helicopter could have been used for the intervention in GPE did not provide a sufficient basis for prosecuting any person for injury to health . The prosecutor found no shortcomings in the way in which the rescue action had been carried out . Reference was made to a report indicating that the doctor had attended to the victim directly in the exposed climbing area despite the fact that he had not been obliged to do so and that the scope of the climber \u2019s injuries were such that only immediate intervention at a specialised health care centre could have saved her life .", "On DATE a prosecutor of ORG in Pre\u0161ov upheld the above conclusion that no criminal offence had been committed . The letter admitted , however , that the rescue of the applicant \u2019s daughter had not been organised in an optimal manner . In particular , the decision to send the helicopter based in GPE to a remote place , albeit within its operation area , had not been correct . It was also questionable whether the helicopter should not have deposited the rescue climbers on the summit of the mountain immediately instead of attempting to rescue the injured person directly from the air . With reference to the statement of a forensic expert the prosecutor held that those considerations could not affect the position in the case . In particular , the saving of the life of the injured person would only have been possible in the case of immediate medical intervention which had not been possible for objective reasons .", "On DATE ORG , with reference to the above conclusions , dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that appropriate medical assistance had not been provided to his daughter in a timely manner . The letter stated that there was no justification for the criminal proceedings to be resumed .", "At the request of the sister of PERSON , ORG of ORG carried out an analysis of the accident and of the subsequent events .", "The report dated DATE states , inter alia , that the decision of the CARDINAL climbers present not to attempt to lower PERSON to the foot of the mountain by ropes had been correct given that they had been informed that a professional rescue team would arrive shortly . However , that information had turned out to be false . The speediness of the rescue in such cases was of primordial importance . Timely medical intervention could probably have saved the life of the injured climber . There were obvious mistakes as regards the professional rescue system . The most important one seemed to be the late arrival of the helicopter for which no satisfactory explanation existed at the time when the report was drafted .", "The report further contains recommendations on action to be taken by mountaineers in cases of similar accidents .", "In DATE ORG adopted a Manifesto for Emergency Medicine in LOC . It provides , inter alia , that emergency medical care of a high standard should be available to every person in need in all situations and at all times . This requires a dedicated system which provides appropriate care for all acutely ill or injured persons .", "In a speech given at ORG held in GPE in DATE , Professor Dr. PERSON , President of ORG , stated , inter alia , that one of the essential elements of the rescue chain was the statutory definition of delays in first - aid intervention while taking into account the territorial and geographical situation of the country concerned . While it was not realistic to require that an emergency team should reach a person whose life was in danger within TIME in all NORP states , that period should be set as a standard in densely populated and highly developed countries .", "The applicant submits that , as from the moment when an accident is reported , a physician attached to an emergency service is required to start life - saving intervention within TIME in various ORG in GPE , within TIME in GPE and within TIME in GPE .", "Pursuant to LAW , everyone has the right to life .", "Article CARDINAL guarantees to everyone the right to protection of health .", "Article CARDINAL enacted with effect from DATE provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL .
