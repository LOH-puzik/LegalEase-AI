The applicant was born in DATE and lives in LOC , GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant and other third parties in respect of embezzlement , forgery of accountancy papers and tax evasion offences that had allegedly been committed by him in his capacity as director of the limited liability company NORP On DATE he was placed in police custody for twentyfour TIME on the basis of LAW ( c ) and ( h ) of LAW ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) on the ground that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged , that he was a danger to public order , that the offences with which he had been charged were punishable by DATE imprisonment , and that he was preparing to abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued an arrest warrant on the basis of Article CARDINAL ( h ) of the ORG and the applicant was placed in pretrial detention for DATE on the ground that the offences with which he had been charged were punishable by DATE imprisonment and that he was preparing to abscond .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant and the third parties were indicted to stand trial on the abovementioned charges . They continued to remain in pretrial detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s pretrial detention was extended repeatedly by final interlocutory judgments of ORG . The court confirmed the legality of the detention on the ground that the reasons provided for by LAW ( h ) of the ORG which had justified the applicant \u2019s initial detention remained valid , did not breach his right of presumption of innocence and that the length of proceedings depended on the complexity of the case . Therefore it dismissed the applicant \u2019s repeated arguments that he was not a danger to public order , that his pretrial detention could be replaced by alternative measures and that the length of his detention and of the overall proceedings was excessive . The domestic courts did not provide any other explanation for the extension of the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention . Moreover , the CARDINAL hearings held DATE and DATE were repeatedly adjourned , inter alia , in order to allow all the suspects to employ the services of a lawyer , for witnesses to be heard , the summoning of various parties to the proceedings , the submission of technical and medical expert reports and the examination of the transfer of the file to another court as a result of the applicant \u2019s request .", "CARDINAL . By the interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , having regard to the length of the pretrial detention , the applicant \u2019s complaint concerning his state of health and his medical condition , the facts of the case and the evidence submitted by the parties , ordered the release of the applicant . The court also ordered the applicant not to leave town without the court \u2019s consent pending the outcome of the criminal investigation . Lastly , the court adjourned the hearing until DATE for procedural reasons . ORG Office appealed against the decision .", "CARDINAL . By a final interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG allowed the appeal of ORG on the ground that according to the medical expert reports the applicant \u2019s health problems could be treated in prison hospitals and that the initial reasons justifying his detention were still valid . Consequently , the court ordered the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention to be extended from DATE to DATE .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , sitting as a twojudge bench , again extended the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention from DATE to DATE . The court held that the applicant \u2019s detention was still justified under LAW ( h ) of the ORG . Moreover , the court could not be held responsible for the length of proceedings given the complexity of the case , the large amount of evidence submitted by the parties and the difficulties it faced in summoning the witnesses living in other cities . Lastly , the court adjourned the hearing for procedural reasons and ordered a technical expert report to be drafted . The applicant appealed against the decision .", "CARDINAL . By a final interlocutory judgement of DATE ORG allowed the applicant \u2019s appeal , quashed the interlocutory judgment of DATE in part and ordered the lower court to reexamine the matter of extending the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention . The court held that the decision had been taken by CARDINAL judges despite the applicable procedural rules requiring that this be done by a single judge . The court did not address the issue of the applicant \u2019s release despite this having been requested by the applicant .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG extended the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention to DATE on the ground that the reasons justifying his initial detention were still valid . It also dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim that his pretrial detention had ceased to be lawful after the final interlocutory judgment of DATE . It held that the said interlocutory judgment had mainly concerned the composition of the bench which had examined the merits of the judgment and considered , in terms of the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention , that the conditions set out by LAW ORG had been met . Moreover , the extension of the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention had been lawful since it had been the will of both judges . The applicant appealed against the decision .", "CARDINAL . By a final interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG rejected the request of ORG for the extension of the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention and ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate release . The court held that following the judgment of DATE the applicant \u2019s detention from DATE had been unlawful in so far as the authorities had not extended the arrest warrant which had expired on DATE . Moreover , the present decision was not in breach of the res judicata principle in respect of the final decision of CARDINAL DATE since the current decision , among others , did not touch on the merits of the case , but only assessed the lawfulness of the detention , and the decision of DATE had interfered with the applicant \u2019s procedural rights . ORG appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a final interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG allowed the appeal of ORG . It held that ORG judgment of DATE interfered with the legal principle of res judicata . Consequently it quashed the decision and ordered the extension of the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention on the general ground that he was a danger to public order and that the reasons justifying his initial detention , including the ground provided for by LAW ORG , were still valid .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention continued to be extended by final interlocutory judgments of the domestic courts generally on the basis of the provisions of Article CARDINAL ( h ) of the ORG , while his complaints concerning the length of his pretrial detention and of the proceedings as a whole were dismissed generally for the reason that the case was complex . Furthermore , no additional reasons or explanations were provided by the courts in respect of the applicant \u2019s personal situation and his repeated claims that his pretrial detention following the judgment of DATE was illegal were dismissed as res judicata . Finally , the hearings were repeatedly adjourned , inter alia , in order to allow for witnesses and parties to the proceedings to be heard or resummoned and for the submission of technical expert reports .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG assessed the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s detention and ordered his immediate release . The court held that the applicant \u2019s detention DATE and DATE had been unlawful in so far as the arrest warrant had been issued by a prosecutor who was not a \u201c magistrate \u201d within the meaning of ORG ) and who had not clearly established the charges against the applicant . The prosecutor had also failed to hear the applicant prior to his detention or to provide reasons for his detention and had failed to immediately bring him before a judge following his arrest . At the same time , it considered that the assessment of lawfulness carried out by the domestic courts following the applicant \u2019s arrest could not have remedied the abovementioned failures . Furthermore , it held that the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention DATE and DATE had also been unlawful in so far as following the final judgment of DATE the applicant \u2019s arrest had not been based on any express or valid court order . It considered that the previous decisions delivered by the domestic courts in respect of the same issue were not res judicata , because the said principle did not apply to issues such as the applicant \u2019s detention which were separate from the merits of the case concerning the existence of the offence and the guilt of the accused . Moreover , it considered that its argument flowed from the provisions of the domestic procedural law which required courts to regularly assess the lawfulness of pretrial detention even if other domestic courts had previously delivered final judgments in respect of the same issue and to revoke ex officio the measure if it had been rendered unlawfully . The court further held that the applicant \u2019s detention after DATE had also been unlawful on the ground that the judgment of CARDINAL DATE could not simply extend his pretrial detention which had started on DATE since the applicant had not been lawfully detained at the time . In so far as the judgment could be perceived as a new detention order , the court considered that the legal conditions for such an order had not been met : there were no new grounds for the applicant \u2019s detention , the court had not provided any reasons for it , no new detention order had been issued and the transcript of the applicant \u2019s evidence given to the court in respect of his detention had been missing from the file . Finally , the court held that in any event the extension of the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention could no longer be justified . There was no evidence that the applicant was a danger to public order or that his release would interfere with the criminal investigation and his continuous pretrial detention of DATE and DATE was excessive and did not comply with the guarantees set out by LAW ORG . The court also adjourned the hearing on procedural grounds and ordered the resummoning of some of the witnesses . ORG appealed against the decision .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG adjourned the appeal proceedings against the interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE for twentyfour TIME on the ground that the applicant had not been summoned and ordered his summoning .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG , in the absence of the applicant , who had been summoned , but in the presence of his chosen lawyer , suspended the appeal proceedings against the interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE pending the referral of an objection of unconstitutionality raised by the applicant \u2019s lawyer to ORG in respect of Article DATE ( CARDINAL ) of the ORG . Relying on the provisions of LAW , DATE and ORG of the ORG the court reviewed and maintained the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention . Consequently , it dismissed the applicant \u2019s request for an end to his detention . He had based his request on the argument that after DATE his pretrial detention had no longer had a legal basis , since the sixtyday timelimit for assessing the lawfulness of detention provided for by the LAW and the ORG had lapsed .", "CARDINAL . By a final interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG of Appeal reviewed and maintained the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention on the ground that the reasons justifying the applicant \u2019s initial detention were still valid .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered the applicant \u2019s immediate release . It held that the argument of ORG that the applicant \u2019s pretrial detention was justified by the applicant \u2019s preparation to abscond ( Article CARDINAL ( c ) ) had already been dismissed by the domestic courts on DATE and that there was no new relevant evidence to rebut that finding . Moreover it held that there was no evidence that the applicant was a danger to public order and that DATE and DATE was an unreasonable length of time for the proceedings . At the same time the court adjourned the hearing for procedural reasons . ORG Office appealed .", "CARDINAL . By a final interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of CARDINAL DATE . The applicant was released DATE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE ORG dismissed the objection of unconstitutionality raised by the applicant \u2019s lawyer at the hearing of DATE on the ground that the legal provision contested by the applicant was in compliance with the LAW .", "CARDINAL . By a final interlocutory judgment of DATE ORG dismissed ORG appeal against the interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE as moot on the ground that the applicant had already been released .", "CARDINAL . The thirtyone hearings held by ORG DATE and DATE were repeatedly adjourned , inter alia , in order to allow for more witnesses to be heard , the summoning of various parties to the proceedings , the resummoning of some of the witnesses , the submission of technical expert reports and the examination of some of the judges\u2019 requests to withdraw from the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date in DATE the applicant was arrested in GPE . He refused to take part via video link in the hearing of DATE concerning the criminal proceedings brought against him in GPE and pending before the domestic courts .", "CARDINAL . By an interlocutory judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG decided to separate the proceedings concerning the applicant from the proceedings concerning the other co - accused and ordered the applicant \u2019s temporary transfer from GPE to be arranged .", "CARDINAL . The proceedings brought against the applicant are still pending before the firstinstance court .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following an episode of depression , the applicant underwent a psychiatric examination . The panel of experts concluded that the applicant \u2019s condition was a \u201c situational reaction \u201d and that he could be treated in detention in ORG which was equipped with a psychiatric unit .", "CARDINAL . The CARDINAL psychiatrists on the panel of experts expressed a dissenting opinion . They concluded that the applicant should be treated in a civilian psychiatric hospital because psychotherapy sessions could not be properly provided in detention owing to the \u201c lack of privacy \u201d .", "CARDINAL . There is no evidence in the applicant \u2019s medical file to show that he spent time in hospital for psychiatric treatment or that he continued to have similar problems afterwards .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also informed the ORG that he had been kept in solitary confinement and that from DATE he had been under the same detention regime as dangerous detainees , which meant that he had been under constant supervision . His allegations are contradicted by a letter of CARDINAL DATE sent by ORG authorities to the domestic courts from which it can be seen that the applicant was not classified as a \u201c dangerous detainee \u201d .", "CARDINAL . According to the applicant \u2019s medical records , he was diagnosed with chronic uveitis in his left eye in DATE .", "CARDINAL . A medical expert report drafted in DATE concluded that the applicant \u2019s situation required surgery and postsurgery treatment in a specialised hospital , specifically ORG . However , his state of health was not incompatible with his detention .", "CARDINAL . The applicant did not undergo the surgery .
