After leaving the ORG he went to ORG ( \u201c TIPF \u201d ) , a camp created by GPE forces in GPE . This facility was subsequently named ORG ( \u201c ARC \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , after being interviewed , the applicant was recognised as a refugee by the ORG High Commissioner for Refugees ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) Headquarters in GPE during his stay in GPE .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the applicant arrived in GPE on a false passport .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was arrested by the NORP security forces while attempting to leave for the island of GPE , GPE , from the port of LOC , on a false passport .", "CARDINAL . On an unspecified date the ORG branch office asked the national authorities to grant the applicant access to the asylum procedure in GPE . This request was refused in view of the fact that the applicant \u2019s presence in GPE constituted a threat to national security given his membership of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was transferred to the city of GPE in eastern GPE , apparently with a view to his deportation to GPE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representative lodged an application with the ORG , requesting it to stop the applicant \u2019s deportation to GPE and arguing under LAW and CARDINAL of the ORG that his removal to GPE would expose him to a real risk of ill - treatment ( application no . ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the President of the Second Section decided to indicate to the Government of GPE , under LAW , that the applicant should not be deported to GPE until further notice .", "CARDINAL . With reference to the interim measure under LAW , the deportation proceedings were suspended and on DATE the applicant was transferred to the ORG Foreigners\u2019 Admission and ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Second Section of the ORG found that there would be a violation of LAW if the applicant were to be removed to GPE or GPE ( see GPE v. GPE , no . ORG , \u00a7 CARDINAL , CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the General Security Directorate of ORG ( \u201c the Ministry \u201d ) decided that the applicant was to be released from the ORG and ORG and issued with a temporary residence permit in GPE . On CARDINAL DATE the applicant was released accordingly . He is currently living in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , on CARDINAL DATE a lawyer registered with ORG , PERSON , had petitioned ORG for the applicant \u2019s release from the ORG and ORG .", "CARDINAL . Upon the administrative authorities\u2019 failure to reply within DATE , which is considered to be a tacit refusal of the request under section CARDINAL of the Administrative Procedure Act ( Law no . CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) , on DATE Mr PERSON brought an action before ORG . He requested that the court quash the decision of the Ministry not to release his client , which decision infringed his right to liberty as a recognised refugee , and order a stay of execution of that decision pending the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the request for a stay of execution . PERSON appealed against that decision .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG declined to examine the appeal request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s case . It held at the outset that the relevant legislation required the deportation of persons in the applicant \u2019s position , that is , persons who had entered GPE illegally and whose presence in the country posed a danger to public order and security . If , however , deportation had become unfeasible for some reason , then the individuals concerned would be accommodated at a place designated by ORG until such time as the deportation proceedings could be finalised . ORG noted that in the instant case the applicant \u2019s deportation had come to a halt following the interim measure indicated by ORG and he had therefore been placed in an accommodation centre in accordance with the law . By refusing his release , the administration had thus acted in accordance with the applicable laws . The administrative court also noted that granting temporary residence permits to persons awaiting deportation would render their monitoring and control very difficult .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant appealed against the judgment of ORG . He claimed that he had been held at the ORG and ORG since DATE against his will and that this deprivation of liberty had no basis in domestic law and lacked any legal safeguards . He moreover argued that he had not been released from detention despite the judgment of ORG , which had ruled that his deportation would constitute a violation of LAW . He also claimed that the administration had failed to submit any evidence in support of its allegation that he posed a threat to public order and security .", "CARDINAL . It appears that the appeal proceedings are still pending before ORG . However , in the meantime , the applicant was released from the ORG and ORG on CARDINAL DATE upon the order of ORG ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .
