NORP In NORP law area zoning plans and any amendments thereto are regarded as decrees ( ORG ) , even if they only concern CARDINAL individual 's property . Accordingly , the proceedings in which they are issued are not normal administrative proceedings and the persons affected are not parties to them .

This is the case , in particular , where the area zoning plan is the basis for the granting or withholding of building permits .

The review of the lawfulness of general legal acts such as decrees issued by administrative authorities as to their lawfulness and of laws ( Gesetze ) as to their constitutionality is concentrated with ORG . Only that ORG is therefore to carry out this review . LAW , insofar as relevant , provides as follows :", "\u201c ( CARDINAL ) ORG decides on application by an ordinary court or an independent administrative tribunal whether decrees issued by a federal or regional authority ... are contrary to law , but ex officio in so far as ORG would have to apply such a decree in a case pending before it . It also decides on application by ORG whether decrees issued by a regional authority are contrary to law and likewise on application by the municipality concerned whether ordinances issued by a municipal affairs supervisory authority ... are contrary to law . It decides furthermore whether decrees are contrary to law when an application alleges direct infringement of personal rights through such unlawfulness in so far as the decree has become operative for the applicant without the delivery of a judicial decision or the issue of a ruling ...", "( CARDINAL ) NORP If the applicant of a complaint lodged with ORG , entailing application of a decree by ORG , receives satisfaction , the proceedings for the review of a decree shall nevertheless continue .", "( CARDINAL ) ORG may repeal a decree as contrary to law only to the extent that its repeal was expressly requested or ORG would have had to apply it in the pending case .
