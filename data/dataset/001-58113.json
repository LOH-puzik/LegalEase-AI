On DATE the investigating judge at ORG ( GPE ) began a preliminary investigation and issued a warrant for the arrest of the applicant and CARDINAL other persons suspected of having made fraudulent use of another person \u2019s credit card when making purchases in various shops in GPE to the value of CARDINAL NORP schillings ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police arrested the applicant at the border between GPE and GPE as he was preparing to enter GPE .", "CARDINAL . On CARDINAL DATE the investigating judge at ORG interviewed Mr PERSON and detained him pending trial .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he again interviewed the applicant .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , at the request of the public prosecutor \u2019s office , the investigating judge decided to discontinue the proceedings in the light of a graphologist \u2019s finding that it was unlikely that the signatures on the payment slips for the purchases made with the stolen credit card were in the applicant \u2019s hand .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant sought compensation from the ORG for the pecuniary damage sustained on account of his detention .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( Ratskammer ) of ORG refused his compensation claim on the ground that , contrary to the requirements of section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of ORG DATE ( ORG , \u201c the DATE Act \u201d \u2013 see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , the suspicion concerning him had not been dispelled .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed against that decision to ORG ( Oberlandesgericht ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , sitting in private , dismissed the appeal . It ruled as follows :", "\u201c The ORG accepts the appellant \u2019s submission that in its decision ORG of the Wiener Neustadt Regional Court confined itself essentially to mentioning the applicable provisions and setting out the facts and did not make use of certain concrete information apparent from the file . The appellant , who has in the meantime been convicted in GPE of handling under LAW CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) and CARDINAL of LAW and imprisoned , is in fact suspected of having participated in obtaining goods fraudulently by using an unlawfully obtained credit card made out in the name of another person . It can not be ruled out that he signed payment slips using a card made out in the name of a woman by wearing a wig . This attempt to investigate was necessary as it had not been possible to bring the other offenders before the court below . Against the conjecture that the signatures were written by the appellant there stands only his assertion that he did not sign any payment slips and that he does not look like a girl either . In so far as he sought to have admitted as genuine proof of his innocence the expert \u2019s statement that the signatures on the payment slips were probably not written by the appellant , regard must be had to the scale of probability drawn up by the expert , which does not at all exclude that the appellant wrote the signatures , and it must be observed that this submission by the appellant does not refute the argument that he took part in the fraudulent acts by providing the necessary transport to the various places where the offences were committed and conveying the proceeds from them , knowing that the other persons involved were committing offences . On the contrary , the large number of fraudulent purchases made both in GPE and in GPE supports the view that the appellant was fully aware of the criminal nature of the operations and that it was in full knowledge of this that he assisted the offenders in their criminal acts by continuing to provide transport ( LAW ) .", "Contrary to what the appellant maintained , compensation under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( b ) of ORG is payable only on condition that the innocence of the detained person can be regarded as proved ; that is to say , it must be proved that the detained person is not punishable , and can not be prosecuted , on account of the act in respect of which his detention was ordered . Where that remains only doubtful , suspicion is not dispelled and the condition on which compensation may be paid is not satisfied ( see PERSON , second ed . , E.CARDINALa and DATE , on section CARDINAL of the Compensation ( Criminal Proceedings ) Act ) . In the instant case it can not be said that suspicion has been dispelled , and the appeal , being unfounded , must therefore fail . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In his pleadings of CARDINAL DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) Mr PERSON also complained of the excessive length of the detention pending trial and sought compensation for unlawful detention under section CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) ( a ) of DATE Act ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , in a separate decision , ORG , sitting in private as a court of first instance , dismissed the applicant \u2019s claim on the ground that neither his arrest nor the order for his detention pending trial or the continuation of that detention had been unlawful .", "ORG also referred to the reasoning in its other judgment of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

As a general rule , there is no public hearing before ORG of ORG or in ORG in appeal proceedings ( Beschwerden ) against a decision of ORG .
