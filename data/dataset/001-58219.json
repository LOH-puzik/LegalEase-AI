In the course of a judicial investigation into offences of theft , burglary , handling the proceeds of theft and aggravated theft , and unlawful possession of Class CARDINAL weapons and ammunition , an investigating judge at PERSON issued a warrant on DATE instructing the gendarmerie to arrange for the telephone line of a certain PERSON to be tapped until DATE .", "CARDINAL . By means of standard - form written instructions ( \u201c soit transmis \u201d ) dated DATE , DATE and DATE , the investigating judge extended the duration of the telephone tapping until DATE , DATE and CARDINAL DATE respectively .", "CARDINAL . As a result of this tapping and the interception of some of his conversations , the applicant was charged with handling the proceeds of aggravated theft ; he was held in custody from DATE to CARDINAL DATE , when he was released subject to judicial supervision .", "CARDINAL . In an application of DATE the applicant \u2019s lawyer applied to ORG of ORG for a ruling that the extensions of DATE and CARDINAL DATE were invalid , arguing that they had been ordered merely by standard - form written instructions without any reference to the offences which justified the telephone tapping , and that the DATE period which could have been authorised in the warrant of CARDINAL DATE had expired on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG dismissed PERSON application on the following grounds :", "\u201c \u2026 by Articles CARDINAL , CARDINAL and CARDINAL of LAW [ see paragraph CARDINAL below ] taken together , decisions to intercept telecommunications messages must be in writing and contain all the information necessary for identifying the link to be monitored , the offence that justifies the interception and the duration of the interception , which must not exceed DATE but may be extended subject to the same formal requirements and maximum duration .", "In the instant case it is beyond doubt that the warrant of CARDINAL DATE complies with the requirements of the above - mentioned ORG in so far as it specifies the number of the link to be monitored , a duration of DATE and the offences that justified interception , the criminal penalties for which were greater than DATE imprisonment .", "It is also clear that the decisions to extend the duration of the interception , which were issued in standard - form instructions , were in writing and mentioned the number of the link concerned ; that they are an extension of the original decision of DATE and necessarily referred to it ; and that the duration of their validity was DATE . They thus comply with the requirements of LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on a point of law against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , arguing , as his only ground of appeal , that LAW seq . of LAW had been infringed because the extensions of the duration of the telephone tapping in issue , by means of standard - form written instructions , did not contain any reasons .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG affirmed the decision appealed against and held that the applicant had \u201c no locus standi to challenge the manner in which the duration of the monitoring of a third party \u2019s telephone line was extended \u201d and that accordingly \u201c the grounds of appeal , which contest[ed ] the grounds on which ORG [ had ] wrongly considered it must examine [ the ] objections of invalidity and subsequently dismissed them , [ were ] inadmissible \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The relevant provisions of LAW no . CARDINAL of DATE on the confidentiality of telecommunications messages ) read as follows :", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c In the case of a serious crime or other major offence attracting a sentence of DATE imprisonment , the investigating judge may , where necessary for the investigation , order the interception , recording and transcription of telecommunications messages .

They shall not constitute judicial decisions and no appeal shall lie against them . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Decisions made pursuant to LAW shall contain all the information necessary for identifying the link to be monitored , the offence that justifies the interception and the duration of the interception . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL", "\u201c Such decisions shall be valid for a maximum duration of DATE .

Mr PERSON applied to the Commission on DATE . He alleged that the interception of certain telephone conversations which were used against him amounted to interference with his private life and correspondence , contrary to LAW ; he also maintained that he had not had an effective remedy in ORG , contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The Commission declared the application ( no . CARDINAL ) admissible on DATE . In its report of DATE ( Article CARDINAL ) , it expressed the opinion by QUANTITY votes to QUANTITY that there had been a violation of LAW and by CARDINAL votes to CARDINAL that it was unnecessary to consider the case under LAW also . The full text of the ORG \u2019s opinion and of the CARDINAL dissenting opinions contained in the report is reproduced as an annex to this judgment .", "CARDINAL . In their memorial the Government submitted that \u201c the application lodged by PERSON should be dismissed \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The applicant asked the ORG to", "\u201c hold that there has been a violation of LAW ;", "award him MONEY by way of just satisfaction \u201d .", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON submitted that ORG decision to refuse him any standing to complain of the interception of some of his telephone conversations , on the ground that it was a third party \u2019s line that had been tapped , had infringed LAW , which provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence .", "CARDINAL . There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a NORP society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well - being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The ORG points out that as telephone conversations are covered by the notions of \u201c private life \u201d and \u201c correspondence \u201d within the meaning of Article CARDINAL , the admitted measure of interception amounted to \u201c interference by a public authority \u201d with the exercise of a right secured to the applicant in paragraph CARDINAL of that Article ( see , among other authorities , the following judgments : PERSON v. the GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; ORG v. GPE and PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL-A and B , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ; PERSON v. the GPE , DATE , Reports of Judgments and Decisions CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE ; and PERSON v. GPE , DATE , Reports CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 MONEY ) . In this connection , it is of little importance", "that the telephone tapping in question was carried out on the line of a third party .", "The Government did not dispute this .", "CARDINAL . Such interference will contravene LAW unless it is \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d , pursues CARDINAL or more of the legitimate aims referred to in paragraph CARDINAL and furthermore is \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d in order to achieve them .", "CARDINAL . The expression \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d within the meaning of LAW requires , firstly , that the impugned measure should have some basis in domestic law ; it also refers to the quality of the law in question , requiring that it should be accessible to the person concerned , who must moreover be able to foresee its consequences for him , and compatible with the rule of law .", "CARDINAL . The ORG notes that the investigating judge ordered the telephone tapping in question on the basis of Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraphs CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The interference complained of therefore had a statutory basis in NORP law .", "CARDINAL . The second requirement which derives from the phrase \u201c in accordance with the law \u201d \u2013 the accessibility of DATE does not raise any problem in the instant case .", "CARDINAL . As to the \u201c foreseeability of the law \u201d , the ORG maintained that following the ORG \u2019s judgments in the ORG and PERSON cases ( see paragraph QUANTITY above ) , the NORP legislature had remedied the omissions and weaknesses of domestic law on telephone tapping by adopting safeguards in respect of the persons whose telephones could be tapped , the duration of interception , the requirements for drawing up reports , and the communication or destruction of recordings .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers , as the ORG did , that Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure , inserted by the PERSON of DATE on the confidentiality of telecommunications messages , lay down clear , detailed rules and specify with sufficient clarity the scope and manner of exercise of the relevant discretion conferred on the public authorities ( see the PERSON and PERSON judgments cited above , pp . CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , and p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , respectively , and , as the most recent authority and mutatis mutandis , the PERSON judgment cited above , pp . CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG shares the opinion of the Government and the Commission and considers that the interference was designed to establish the truth in connection with criminal proceedings and therefore to prevent disorder .", "CARDINAL . It remains to be ascertained whether the interference was \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d for achieving those objectives . Under the ORG \u2019s settled case - law , GPE enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing the existence and extent of such necessity , but this margin is subject to NORP supervision , embracing both the legislation and the decisions applying it , even those given by an independent court ( see , mutatis mutandis , the Silver and Others v. the GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and the PERSON v. GPE judgment of CARDINAL DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . When considering the necessity of interference , the ORG stated in its PERSON and Others v. GPE judgment of DATE ( Series A no . CARDINAL , pp . CARDINAL and CARDINAL\u2013CARDINAL , \u00a7 \u00a7 DATE ) :", "\u201c The ORG must be satisfied that , whatever system of surveillance is adopted , there exist adequate and effective guarantees against abuse . This assessment has only a relative character : it depends on \u2026 [ among other things ] the kind of remedy provided by the national law .", "\u2026", "It therefore has to be determined whether the procedures for supervising the ordering and implementation of the restrictive measures are such as to keep the \u2018 interference\u2019 resulting from the contested legislation to what is \u2018 necessary in a democratic society\u2019 .", "\u2026 In addition , the values of a NORP society must be followed as faithfully as possible in the supervisory procedures if the bounds of necessity , within the meaning of LAW , are not to be exceeded . CARDINAL of the fundamental principles of a democratic society is the rule of law , which is expressly referred to in the LAW to the Convention \u2026 The rule of law implies , inter alia , that an interference by the executive authorities with an individual \u2019s rights should be subject to an effective control \u2026 \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicant said that he had wished to complain of the circumstances in which the investigating judge had ordered the extensions of the duration of the telephone tapping ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , but ORG decision had deprived him of any practical possibility of using the remedies provided by law to penalise irregularities committed by the authorities .", "CARDINAL . In the ORG \u2019s submission , the interference complained of had been \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d . In the instant case the telephone tapping had been one of the principal means of investigation contributing to the establishment of the truth and , in particular , to proving the involvement of various individuals , including the applicant , in large - scale illicit dealing in furniture . Furthermore , PERSON had been able to avail himself of a remedy in ORG , and a further remedy in ORG was quite unnecessary to satisfy the requirement of \u201c effective control \u201d .", "CARDINAL . The ORG must accordingly ascertain whether an \u201c effective control \u201d was available to PERSON to challenge the telephone tapping to which he had been made subject .", "CARDINAL . It notes , firstly , that ORG in its judgment of DATE held that the applicant had \u201c no locus standi to challenge the manner in which the duration of the monitoring of a third party \u2019s telephone line was extended \u201d and that accordingly \u201c the grounds of appeal , which contest[ed ] the grounds on which ORG [ had ] wrongly considered it must examine [ the ] objections of invalidity and subsequently dismissed them , [ were ] inadmissible \u201d .", "CARDINAL . In its ruling ORG therefore went beyond the ground relied on by the applicant concerning the extension of the duration of the telephone tapping and held that a victim of the tapping of a telephone line not his own has no standing to invoke the protection of national law or LAW . It concluded that in the instant case ORG had been wrong to examine the objections of invalidity raised by the applicant as the telephone line being monitored had not been his own .", "CARDINAL . Admittedly , the applicant had been able to avail himself of a remedy in respect of the disputed point in ORG , which held that the investigating judge \u2019s extension of the duration of the telephone tapping had been in accordance with Articles CARDINAL et seq . of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , and it is not the ORG \u2019s function to express an opinion on the interpretation of domestic law , which is primarily for the national courts to interpret ( see the PERSON and PERSON judgments cited above , p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , and p. CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , respectively ) . However , ORG , the guardian of national law , criticised ORG for having examined the merits of PERSON application .", "CARDINAL . As the ORG has already said ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the provisions of the PERSON of DATE governing telephone tapping satisfy the requirements of LAW and those laid down in the PERSON and PERSON judgments . However , it has to be recognised that ORG reasoning could lead to decisions whereby a very large number of people are deprived of the protection of the law , namely all those who have conversations on a telephone line other than their own . That would in practice render the protective machinery largely devoid of substance .", "CARDINAL . That was the case with the applicant , who did not enjoy the effective protection of national law , which does not make any distinction according to whose line is being tapped ( Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG therefore considers , like the Commission , that the applicant did not have available to him the \u201c effective control \u201d to which citizens are entitled under the rule of law and which would have been capable of restricting the interference in question to what was \u201c necessary in a NORP society \u201d .", "CARDINAL . There has consequently been a violation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also alleged a violation of LAW , which provides :", "\u201c Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [ the ] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In view of the preceding conclusion ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) , the ORG does not consider that it need rule on the complaint in question .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of the ORG provides :", "\u201c If the ORG finds that a decision or a measure taken by a legal authority or any other authority of a High Contracting Party is completely or partially in conflict with the obligations arising from the ... Convention , and if the internal law of the said ORG allows only partial reparation to be made for the consequences of this decision or measure , the decision of the ORG shall , if necessary , afford just satisfaction to the injured party . \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr PERSON sought MONEY ( FRF ) for non - pecuniary damage .", "CARDINAL . The Government considered that any finding of a violation would constitute sufficient just satisfaction .", "CARDINAL . The Delegate of the Commission expressed no view on the matter .", "CARDINAL . The ORG considers that the applicant undeniably sustained non - pecuniary damage and awards him the sum of FRF CARDINAL under this head .", "CARDINAL . The applicant also claimed ORG CARDINAL in respect of the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Government considered that the amount claimed was not unreasonable and wished to leave the matter to the ORG \u2019s discretion .", "CARDINAL . The Delegate of the Commission did not express a view .", "CARDINAL . Making its assessment on an equitable basis and with reference to its usual criteria , the ORG awards the sum claimed .", "CARDINAL . According to the information available to the ORG , the statutory rate of interest applicable in GPE at the date of adoption of the present judgment is PERCENT per annum .", "Done in LANGUAGE and in LANGUAGE , and delivered at a public hearing in FAC , GPE , on DATE .", "Signed : PERSON", "President", "Signed : PERSON", "Registrar", "In accordance with LAW , the concurring opinion of PERSON is annexed to this judgment .", "PERSON : PERSON", "PERSON : PERSON"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["8"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
