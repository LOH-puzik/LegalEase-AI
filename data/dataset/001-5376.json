DENMARK", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant is a NORP citizen , born in DATE . It appears that he resides in ORG , GPE . Before the ORG the applicant is represented by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE , GPE .", "A.", "On DATE an indictment was served on the applicant by the Chief of Police in Helsing\u00f8r ( Politimesteren i Helsing\u00f8r ) charging him with having illegally possessed a knife , with a blade whose size exceeded the maximum length permitted under NORP law , and with having assaulted and uttered threats of violence against a social worker on duty .", "On DATE ORG ( retten i H\u00f8rsholm ) held a hearing in which the applicant , assisted by counsel , and CARDINAL witnesses were heard . On the basis of an evaluation of the available evidence ORG convicted the applicant and sentenced him to CARDINAL days\u2019 imprisonment . The applicant appealed immediately against the judgment to ORG of Eastern GPE ( PERSON ) claiming acquittal .", "On DATE the indictment for the proceedings in ORG was accordingly served on the applicant by ORG Statsadvokaten for Sj\u00e6lland ) . The indictment also informed the applicant that he would receive further notice about the date of the hearing .", "On DATE ORG issued a writ of summons to be served on the applicant , announcing that the hearing would take place on DATE in ORG . The writ granted the applicant CARDINAL days\u2019 notice and warned him that failure to appear in court could , inter alia , result in his appeal being dismissed . The writ was forwarded to the Chief of Police of Gladsaxe . It appears , however , that problems arose in that the police were unable to find the applicant in order to serve the writ on him .", "Thus , on DATE the Chief of Police informed ORG that CARDINAL unsuccessful attempts had been made to serve the writ on the applicant at his registered address and that , by mail , he had been requested to contact the police , which , however , he had not done .", "The same day the police succeeded in reaching the applicant through his brother who managed to establish a telephone contact by which the applicant informed the police that he was at present working in GPE ( in GPE ) and could not , therefore , come to the hearing in ORG DATE .", "On DATE the applicant failed to appear in ORG for which reason ORG requested that the applicant \u2019s appeal be dismissed pursuant to section CARDINAL c \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of ORG ( retsplejeloven ) . The applicant \u2019s counsel , who was present in court , objected to the claim for dismissal but did not request leave to plead the case in the applicant \u2019s absence . ORG allowed the parties to present their arguments on the question of dismissal following which the ORG decided as follows : ( Translation )", "\u201c According to the information available , during the period from DATE until DATE ORG has CARDINAL times attempted in vain to serve a summons for the hearing on the applicant , who has not been at home at the civil register address indicated and who has not reacted to the invitations of the police to contact the police .", "The applicant , who was aware that the appeal had been brought before ORG , has omitted to give notice to the effect that he does not stay at the address notified to the civil register , but is staying in GPE at present . Since it is then due to the applicant \u2019s circumstances that it has been impossible to serve a summons on him in the usual manner , the High Court finds for ORG claim of dismissal pursuant to section CARDINAL c \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of ORG . \u201d", "On DATE the applicant applied to ORG for leave to appeal against the dismissal to ORG ( H\u00f8jesteret ) . Having obtained written observations from the prosecution and from the applicant , ORG refused , on DATE , to grant leave to appeal .", "B. Relevant domestic law", "A person convicted in a criminal case tried by a city court is free , in principle , to appeal the judgment to ORG , to whose district the court in question belongs , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL first sentence , of ORG . Immediately upon pronouncement of the judgment , a defendant can give notice orally to the court records that he wants to appeal the judgment , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of ORG .", "As soon as possible after receipt of the notice of appeal , ORG sees to it that attempts are made to serve a notification ( notice of appeal and indictment ) on the defendant in the usual manner , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG . The notification must include information to the effect that the defendant or his counsel will later be notified of the time of the hearing , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG .", "When an appeal also comprises assessment of the evidence , ORG arranges for a summons containing information on the time and place of the hearing to be served on the defendant with CARDINAL days\u2019 notice , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of ORG . If a summons is not served pursuant to section CARDINAL a \u00a7 CARDINAL , cf . section CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL , of ORG , or if a summons is served on the defendant at CARDINAL days\u2019 notice , the effect is that the defendant is not lawfully summoned to the hearing , and therefore , as a point of departure , the hearing can not be held if the defendant fails to appear at the hearing .", "However , pursuant to section CARDINAL c \u00a7 CARDINAL , second sentence , of ORG , the defendant \u2019s appeal may be dismissed if it has been impossible to serve the indictment or the summons on him in the usual manner because he has changed his address or place of residence without giving due notice thereof .", "The provision must be seen in the light of section QUANTITY , first sentence , of ORG . Under this provision , if a defendant fails to appear without stating a lawful cause of absence in proceedings where the appeal was raised by him and comprises the assessment of evidence , the ORG can dismiss his appeal by order if it finds that the hearing can not usefully be proceeded with in his absence ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
