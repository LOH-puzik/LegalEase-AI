NORP The applicant body is an association under GPE law . Named ORG ( LOC , hereinafter \u201c ORG \u201d as per its acronym in NORP ) , it functions as a political party . Before the ORG the ORG is represented by ORG , ORG and ORG PERSON , lawyers practising in GPE , GPE and ORG , respectively . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr R.A.A. PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . The ORG was founded in DATE and has , since DATE , consistently held CARDINAL to CARDINAL seats in ORG ( ORG ) of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The ORG is a confessional political party firmly rooted in historical ORG . Both the ORG \u2019s Statement of Principles ( Program PERSON ) and its articles of association ( statuten ) state that the party bases itself directly on the infallible Word of God as revealed in the Bible . In addition to the Bible , the ORG acknowledges the Three Forms of Unity ( PERSON van GPE ) accepted by churches of ORG tradition , namely ORG ( PERSON ) , ORG ( PERSON ) and the ORG of PERSON ( Dordtse Leerregels ) .", "CARDINAL . With its strong emphasis on religion as the inspiration of its politics , the ORG draws its membership from among Reformed NORP believers of a traditional inclination but it has no formal links with any particular church .", "CARDINAL . It is a basic tenet of the ORG that Government should govern as God \u2019s servant according to the Word of God . Government derives its authority not from the people , but from God Himself . This view is derived from scripture ( NORP CARDINAL:CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG does not aim , in the first place , to win the majority of votes of the electorate , but rather it strives to promote and implement its principles . It uses ORG as its arena to express those principles .", "CARDINAL . The ORG professes the absolute authority of the Word of God over all areas of societal life . The ORG rejects the idea of absolute equality of human beings , which it sees as false teaching of the French Revolution . In essence , the ORG believes that , although all human beings are of equal value as God \u2019s creatures , differences in nature , talents and place in society should be recognised . Scripture ( in particular CARDINAL Corinthians CARDINAL ) teaches that men and women have different roles in society . Thus , women are not inferior to men as human beings ; but unlike men , women should not be eligible for public office .", "CARDINAL . Articles DATE and CARDINAL of the applicant party \u2019s Statement of Principles spell out this view . They read as follows :", "\u201c The Word of God holds that , on the basis of the order of creation , man and woman have each been given their own and distinct mission and place . In this order the man is the head of the woman . Any measures aimed at acknowledging the equality of men and women are to be regarded positively . Every effort at emancipation that negates the God - given mission and place of men and women is considered revolutionary and has to be combated forcefully . \u201d", "\u201c The notion of [ the existence of ] a right to vote for women which results from a revolutionary striving for emancipation is incompatible with woman \u2019s calling . The latter equally holds true for the participation of women in both representative and administrative political organs . Women shall be led by their consciences as regards the question whether casting their vote is in accordance with their God - given place . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In its application form , the ORG emphasises that it considers its scriptural points of departure and principles to be crucial . They constitute the ultimate foundation for the functioning of the party in practice and they represent the deeply - rooted and profoundly - felt religious convictions of the party itself and its members . They are , indeed , felt to be the ORG \u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre .", "CARDINAL . The ORG maintains a political youth organisation , \u201c ORG Youth \u201d ( ORG - jongeren ) , and a political science institute , ORG ( ORG , named after the author of ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s income consists of membership fees , Government subsidy , donations and bequests , proceeds from the sale of its periodical , interest payments and income not elsewhere included . According to the ORG \u2019s DATE report , the party \u2019s total income in DATE was QUANTITY ( ORG ) , of which ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL ( including arrears referable to DATE in an amount of some EUR CARDINAL ) consisted of Government subsidy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE after the rulings of ORG in the civil proceedings ( see below ) \u2013 the ORG amended its Principles to enable women to become members of the party . Since DATE the ORG has admitted women members , though still without allowing them to stand for election to public office .", "CARDINAL . A group of non - governmental organisations , the PERSON test case foundation ( PERSON proefprocessenfonds PERSON , named after an DATE suffragette ) , the GPE section of ORG ( PERSON voor de Mensenrechten ) , ORG ( PERSON ) , ORG , ORG ( PERSON , ORG ) , ORG ( PERSON GPE ) and other private associations and foundations which later abandoned the proceedings ( hereinafter \u201c PERSON and Others \u201d ) lodged a pair of actions under GPE civil law , one against the ORG , the other against the ORG , with the civil section of ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE .", "CARDINAL . Their actions were brought pursuant to article CARDINAL:CARDINALa of LAW ( Burgerlijk Wetboek ) . They were based on the associations\u2019 and foundations\u2019 goals as stated in their articles of association ; as relevant to the case before the ORG , these included the protection of women \u2019s rights and interests . The grounds on which these actions were brought were , for all practical purposes , the same .", "CARDINAL . PERSON Foundation and Others stated that owing to the differential treatment according to gender laid down in its articles of association , the ORG violated fundamental rights of equal treatment of men and women and fundamental rights in terms of the right of women to political participation . In this sense , so it was argued , the general interest of society as such in the elimination of discrimination was being violated . It was claimed that the ORG would not allow women membership of the party and consequently to stand for election to organs of general representation , nor certain other privileges reserved to men . This violated LAW . CARDINAL of the Convention in conjunction with LAW No . CARDINAL of the Convention , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the DATE LAW , LAW on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and relevant provisions of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings against the ORG PERSON and Others asked ORG to hold that the ORG \u2019s position was in violation of the treaty and constitutional provisions aforementioned and consequently wrongful in respect of themselves and/or the persons whose interests they defended ; to order ORG to change its bye - laws accordingly ; and to annul the provisions of the ORG \u2019s bye - laws that created differential membership status between men and women . In the proceedings against the ORG , they sought the same finding of violations of treaty and constitutional provisions and an order for measures to put an end to what they argued was an unlawful situation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered judgments in both cases .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment given in the case against the ORG itself , ORG found that the plaintiffs lacked standing on the ground that they had no legal interest . This finding was based essentially on the fact , as established , that no women had come forward who subscribed to the principles of the ORG and wished to become members for that reason . Although an appeal was lodged against this judgment with ORG ( gerechtshof ) of GPE , the proceedings were not actively pursued and ORG eventually struck the case out of its list .", "CARDINAL . In the judgment given in the case against the ORG , ORG found that the ORG had violated LAW by having granted subsidies to the ORG pursuant to LAW ( Wet subsidi\u00ebring politieke partijen ) . LAW was held to be binding and to have direct effect in accordance with the GPE constitution . ORG held that in having granted subsidies to the ORG , the ORG had acted unlawfully against PERSON and Others , having regard to the ORG \u2019s obligation to protect women \u2019s rights based on , in particular , LAW . The ORG was ordered to refrain from granting any such subsidy to the ORG for as long as the party continued to deny women membership of the party on an equal footing with men .", "CARDINAL . Based on this judgment CARDINAL rather distinct sets of proceedings and appeals ensued , the first under GPE administrative law , the second under GPE civil law . They will be discussed separately below .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of the Interior and ORG ( Minister PERSON en GPE \u2013 \u201c the Minister \u201d ) , taking the view that he was bound by ORG judgment , rejected the ORG \u2019s application for a subsidy pursuant to LAW .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lodged an objection ( bezwaar ) with the Minister against this decision . With the Minister \u2019s permission , the objection was referred to the administrative law section of ORG of GPE for adjudication without a prior administrative decision .", "CARDINAL . NORP By decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG rejected the ORG \u2019s appeal against the refusal to grant a subsidy , holding that , in view of ORG judgment in the civil proceedings , the Minister would have acted unlawfully if he had granted the subsidy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG lodged further appeal with ORG of ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State \u2013 \u201c the Administrative Jurisdiction Division \u201d ) .", "CARDINAL . PERSON Foundation and Others were granted leave to join the proceedings as a third party .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG acknowledged that LAW was binding and had direct effect but should not be construed as precluding the Minister from granting subsidies to the ORG pursuant to LAW as long as that party continued to bar women from membership of the party and , consequently , from standing for office in , among other legislative bodies , ORG .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that while LAW ) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women provided that women should be ensured , on equal terms with men , the right to participate in non - governmental organisations and associations \u2013 which included political parties \u2013 , the text did not require that women should be ensured the right to participate in \u201c all \u201d such organisations and associations . Nor did the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of ORG admit of such an interpretation of LAW .", "CARDINAL . ORG went on to consider that in many GPE , including the GPE , the democratic structure of the state ( democratisch staatsbestel ) , including the right to vote , was DATE like the women \u2019s rights codified in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women \u2013 imposed by public international law . Application of Article CARDINAL of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to a political party would , so it was held , encroach not only on the freedom rights of political parties , but also on the public interest of sufficient representation of the full electorate , as foreseen in the GPE constitutional order . This included the representation in the elected bodies of small minorities with views divergent from those held by the majority , as long as any such views did not violate criminal law .", "CARDINAL . The rights of women as found , for the purposes of this case , in LAW should be weighed against other internationally recognised rights of political parties : those of freedom of religion and conscience , freedom of assembly and association and freedom of expression .", "CARDINAL . LAW was aimed not at the financial stimulation of individual political parties , but served the public interest of creating a situation in which \u2013 among other things \u2013 the various religious beliefs that might exist in society were broadly reflected . The fact that LAW provided that all parties represented in the GPE parliament be granted subsidies on the same conditions \u2013 except when their conduct had led to a criminal conviction of illegal discrimination as provided for in LAW showed that the GPE legislature had explicitly chosen to leave to the judiciary any issues of denying subsidies to particular parties based on discrimination . ORG endorsed this approach by holding that political parties , even those with opinions deviating from the majority , should not be excluded from participation in the public debate , provided that such deviating opinions did not violate criminal law . Otherwise , the legitimacy of the public debate would be compromised .", "CARDINAL . ORG also attached value to the fact that in the GPE women were not precluded from joining DATE other \u2013 political parties and stand for election on equal terms with men . It held that nothing prevented women wishing to stand for office but otherwise adhering to views and convictions like those adhered to by the ORG from founding their own political party and possibly benefiting from subsidies granted pursuant to LAW . Therefore no real infringement of the rights guaranteed to women by LAW obtained in the GPE .", "CARDINAL . With reference to ORG judgments in the cases of ORG ( \u00d6ZDEP ) v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-VIII ) and PERSON ( ORG ) and Others v. GPE ( [ ORG ] , ORG . ORG , CARDINAL , ORG and CARDINAL , \u00a7 CARDINAL , ORG CARDINAL-II ) , ORG also pointed out that the ORG considered that GPE should show restraint in limiting the freedoms of political parties since they were essential for the proper functioning of a pluralistic and NORP society . Intervention in the functioning of political parties could only be justified in cases where a domestic court had found that a political party constituted a danger to the democratic legal order ( democratische rechtsorde ) . This was not so in the present case .", "CARDINAL . ORG thus granted the appeal lodged by the ORG and ordered the Minister to take a fresh decision based on its judgment .", "CARDINAL . The ORG appealed to the civil section of ORG against the judgment of the civil section of ORG of GPE DATE . ORG granted the ORG leave to join the ORG as a party to the proceedings .", "CARDINAL . In its judgment of CARDINAL DATE ORG reiterated that the ORG had codified in its Statement of Principles , which were based on the Word of God , that the man is the head of the woman and that the woman was not allowed to be elected to Government office . It further held that PERSON and Others , the respondents in appeal , were not to be denied standing and that LAW was directly binding on the ORG . It remained to be assessed whether the ORG had violated said provision .", "CARDINAL . ORG noted that the ORG distinguished between men and women to the extent that women were not allowed by the party to stand for election , without there being an objective justification for this difference in treatment . Women were , by that time , allowed to become members of the party , but were explicitly barred from standing for election . The ORG had sought to justify this distinction solely with reference to its religion , which was dismissed as not constituting objective justification .", "CARDINAL . In failing to take adequate measures to prevent the ORG from proceeding in this manner , the ORG had acted in violation of LAW as well as of ORG and CARDINAL of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In the proceedings before ORG , the ORG had argued that forcing the party to allow women to stand for election would violate its right to freedom of religion , of expression and of association as laid down in ORG CARDINAL of the Convention . ORG considered that the breach of the prohibition of discrimination based on gender of which PERSON and Others accused the ORG should be weighed against the rights invoked by the ORG , provided those latter rights were indeed infringed by the finding that the prohibition of discrimination had been breached .", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW , ORG held that this provision did not guarantee an absolute right to freedom of religion . Expressions of religious belief should only be protected when they were a direct expression of that religion . ORG found that , in spite of the deeply religious motives underpinning it in this particular case , preventing women from standing for election did not constitute conduct protected by LAW as such conduct could not be defined as a direct expression of the ORG \u2019s religious beliefs . ORG similarly failed to see how the ORG would be hindered in exercising its religious beliefs if it did not , or were forced not to , deny its female members the right to stand for election . Even if compelling the ORG to allow women to stand for election was to be construed as an infringement of its right to freedom of religion , such compulsion would not touch upon the core of that right ; that core was the protection of personal religious beliefs and acts closely connected to it , such as acts of worship in the context of generally accepted religious ceremonies . The connection between the core of LAW and the practice of excluding women from the right to stand for election was therefore relatively tenuous .", "CARDINAL . As regards LAW , the ORG had argued that granting the female members of the party the right to stand for election would violate the party \u2019s PERSON right , protected by LAW , to assemble and to organise their party in accordance with their principles and , secondly , to their right freely to choose , without ORG intervention , who to elect as their representatives .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal agreed with the ORG that forcing the party to allow women to stand for election would conflict with its ideological basic principles and would thus infringe its rights under LAW . However , there was nothing preventing the ORG from organising itself otherwise and , bar this particular element , wholly in accordance with its basic principles . ORG further held that if and when the ORG was forced to allow women to stand for election , nothing precluded it from freely deciding on such issues as composition of lists of candidates standing for elections and what political opinions such candidates should express . Such political opinions , ORG held , could also include those not shared by the majority in the GPE , namely that women were by definition not suited for any Government office .", "CARDINAL . ORG considered that neither the ORG nor the ORG had substantiated how having to allow female members to be able to stand for elections would infringe the ORG \u2019s rights under LAW . It reiterated that nothing would preclude the ORG from expressing its opinions about women while allowing women to stand for election .", "CARDINAL . In terms of balancing these conflicting rights , ORG had regard to the fact that the Convention did not allow any exceptions to the prohibition of discrimination based on gender , whereas it did allow certain limitations to the rights of freedom of religion , of assembly and association and of expression . Although not considering it to be decisive , it did attach value to this difference .", "CARDINAL . ORG attached great importance to the fact that the alleged discrimination of women occurred in the context of a political party , rather than some other association that did not manifest itself in the public domain . It considered that political parties played an essential role within the democracy and a central one within the GPE electoral system , where one could only stand for office as a candidate for a political party . ORG concluded that a democracy based on the rule of law ( rechtsstaat ) was fundamentally affected if representative bodies were formed , albeit to a small extent , through a process that violated the prohibition of discrimination based on gender . It had to be weighed against this that , as ORG had already held , allowing women to stand for election did not infringe in their core the rights invoked by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . The Court of Appeal therefore concluded that the interest of maintaining the prohibition of discrimination should outweigh the rights invoked by the ORG , and that it was thus for the ORG to take measures effectively leading the ORG to grant women the right to stand for election . It added that the ORG ought to deploy a measure that was both effective while at the same time not impinging on the fundamental rights of the ( members of the ) ORG any more than was necessary .", "CARDINAL . Unlike ORG , however , ORG found that the ORG could not be ordered to stop granting subsidies to the ORG pursuant to LAW as the judiciary in the GPE had not the competence to order the ORG to take specific measures of any kind . Consequently ORG overruled ORG judgment on this particular point .", "CARDINAL . The ORG and the ORG each lodged a separate appeal on points of law ( cassatie ) to ORG ( PERSON ) . ORG joined the cases . All CARDINAL appeals \u2013 PERSON Foundation and Others , the ORG and the ORG \u2013 were declared admissible .", "CARDINAL . ORG reasoning on the merits included the following :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . NORP The central issue in this case is the ORG \u2019s view that women should not enjoy the right to stand for election to the general representative bodies of government . This view is expressed in LAW ORG \u2019s Statement of Principles .", "The rejection of the right of women to stand for election is grounded in the ORG \u2019s conviction that in God \u2019s order of creation men and women are admittedly complete equals ( they are \u2018 an equal bi - union within GPE ( een gelijkwaardige tweedeling binnen de schepping ) but not the same and that they each have received their own specific , distinct calling and place . In this order , the man is the head of the woman : \u2018 The man was created first by God . The woman was taken from the man . In this [ order ] , the woman is \u201c subordinate \u201d to the man , who is invested with \u201c responsibility \u201d , but definitely not PERSON ( LAW with explanatory report ) . For that reason government is reserved for the man . This excludes the woman from government , which means that she should not be a member of political organs , whether representative or executive . The consequence of that , in the ORG \u2019s view , is that women do not enjoy the right to stand for election ( explanatory report on LAW [ of the Statement of Principles ] .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The ORG as a political party expresses its rejection in practice of women \u2019s right to stand for election by not nominating women as candidates for election to general representative government bodies . The issue in the present case is whether the ORG should take action against this .", "CARDINAL . It is no longer an issue that the ORG did not admit women as ( ordinary ) party members either , as since the change in the bye - laws of DATE women can be members of the ORG with voting rights in the general assembly and the right to be office - holders within the party . In the view of the ORG , incidentally , one can only become a member of the ORG if one subscribes to its basic principles and aims , including the Statement of Principles , so that all members , including female members , are legally bound to the Statement of Principles and the consequent view that government office and therefore the right to stand for election to general representative organs is not for women . The ORG is considering requiring new members to sign a written statement to the effect that the aspiring member subscribes to the basic principles and aims of the ORG .", "...", "DATE . It follows [ from the direct applicability of LAW ) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ] that the ORG has the duty towards its citizens , based on the provisions mentioned of ORG , to ensure that political parties do not merely admit women as members , in so far as membership of a party is required for nomination as a candidate , but also to admit them to nomination as candidates itself . Only thus can the ORG effectively secure to women the right to stand for election as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women demands . The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women does not leave the ORG any margin of appreciation on this point .", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . The above does not alter the fact that the right of women to equal treatment , as set out in , inter alia , LAW , may in particular cases come into conflict with other equally important basic rights , including freedom of religion and freedom of association , and that these rights must be weighed against each other in order to decide which should prevail . There is no reason to assume , as PERSON and Others argue , that this balancing exercise has been done already in LAW .", "The ORG \u2019s and the ORG \u2019s position therefore raises the question whether an exception to equal rights for women , as set out in LAW , can be accepted in relation to the right to stand for election in a case like the present , in which a political party whose political aims are grounded on its religious convictions , based on these convictions deny women nomination as candidates for election to public elected bodies . In view of what follows , this question must be answered in the negative .", "CARDINAL . The basic rights of freedom of religion and freedom of association DATE and of course also freedom of expression , which , for the matter now in issue , has little if any independent significance next to the basic rights just mentioned DATE guarantee that citizens may unite in a political party on the basis of a religious or philosophical conviction and may express their conviction and the political principles and programmes based thereon within the framework of that party .", "In a democratic state governed by the rule of law , however , those principles and programmes may only be given practical effect within the limits posed by laws and treaties .", "CARDINAL . The general representative bodies represent the entire population without making distinctions among the citizens of whom it is made up . They form the heart of the democracy and a guarantee for the democratic content of the ORG . The rights to vote and to stand for election are essential to guarantee the democratic content of these bodies . Both LAW taken together with its LAW and , as far as women are concerned , LAW guarantee to everyone , without any distinction based on gender , the right to elect members of these bodies as well as to be elected to them . The said provisions mention the right to vote and the right to stand for election in the same breath , thus expressing that in a democracy they are each other \u2019s necessary pendant , since the voters must be able to determine for themselves who among them should be eligible .", "CARDINAL . Seen thus , since the possibility to exercise the right to stand for election goes to the core of the ORG \u2019s democratic functioning , it is unacceptable that a political formation in composing its lists of candidates violates a basic right that guarantees the elective rights of all citizens , regardless of whether such action reposes on a principle rooted for that formation in its religious or philosophical convictions . To that extent , the prohibition of discrimination set forth in LAW , Article CARDINAL taken together with LAW and , in the particular context of the present case , LAW outweighs the other basic rights in issue .", "It follows from the above that the ORG \u2019s violation of the basic right , guaranteed by the LAW and the said treaties , to be allowed to stand for election on an equal footing with men is not justified by the fact that its view of woman \u2019s calling and place in society is directly rooted in its religious conviction . Admittedly the ORG can not be denied its conviction and the civil courts are not even competent to express an opinion on the question whether that conviction is of greater or lesser importance in the faith of the members of the party , and admittedly a democratic legal order requires tolerance in relation to opinion rooted in religious or philosophical convictions . All that , however , does not prevent the courts from finding the way in which the ORG puts its convictions into practice in nominating candidates for general representative bodies unacceptable .", "...", "CARDINAL . The ORG \u2019s specific obligations and the claims of PERSON and Others", "CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . It follows from the above that the ORG was wrong to take the position that its own balancing exercise entitled it not to take any measures against the ORG \u2019s failure to admit women to its lists of candidates for election to the general representative bodies .", "ORG was therefore right to conclude in [ its ] judgment that the ORG is under an obligation to take measures that will actually lead to the ORG granting the right to stand for election to women and that the ORG must adopt a measure to that purpose that will at the same time be effective and impinge as little as possible on the basic rights of the ( members of the ) ORG .", "CARDINAL . It does not follow , however , that the courts are competent or able to order the ORG to take specific measures to put a stop to the ORG \u2019s discrimination as regards the right of its female members to stand for election .", "As was held in ORG judgment of DATE , [ ( ORG [ National Jurisprudence Number ] , \u201c LJN \u201d ) ORG ] , the courts have not the competence to order the ORG to enact statutory legislation . The cross - appeal brought by PERSON and Others fails on this point . Leaving aside the fact that PERSON and Others have not , even in their cross - appeal in both cases , indicated what other measures the ORG would be in a position to take ( apart from blocking the subsidy , which will be discussed hereafter ) , it is in the present case , which concerns the interrelation between a political party and the ORG , all the less possible in principle to give a court order for specific measures to meet the requirements of LAW because the choice of such measures to be taken by the ORG requires a balancing of interests which coincides with political assessments to a degree that can not be expected from the courts .", "This also applies to an order blocking the subsidy allotted to the ORG by the ORG . Moreover , as ORG of ORG held [ see paragraphs DATE above ] , neither LAW , nor LAW , nor the LAW requires this and present legislation does not offer that possibility apart from the situation , which does not obtain in the present case , of a final and binding judgment of a criminal court convicting of discrimination within the meaning of the penal provisions contained in section QUANTITY of LAW .", "For the same reason set out in the second sub - paragraph , ORG rightly denied PERSON and DATE claim for an order to put an end to an unlawful situation within a time - limit to be set by the court at its discretion , quite apart from the fact that the ground on which any court might consider ordering such a vague and general prohibition is unclear . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its judgment on DATE . No further appeal lay against it .", "CARDINAL . By letter of CARDINAL DATE the applicant party informed ORG following developments .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjudicated a case relating to the present one , in which the ORG was the defendant party . An appeal had been lodged by an interested party against the decision of DATE of the principal electoral committee ( hoofdstembureau ) to declare valid the list of candidates submitted by the ORG for the elections of the members of ORG ( ORG ) .", "CARDINAL . It was argued before ORG that the list submitted by the ORG should have been declared invalid as the ORG discriminated against women by , in breach of LAW , not allowing them to become eligible for public office , including ORG . Since the ORG had failed to take appropriate measures against the ORG \u2019s conduct , as ordered by ORG by judgment of DATE ( supra ) , the list submitted should have been declared invalid .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the appeal . It noted that ORG judgment had held , specifically , that it was to be left to the GPE legislature to take appropriate measures to end the illegal situation .", "CARDINAL . LAW ( PERSON ) , ORG further considered , was also specifically drafted so as to leave issues pertaining to legitimacy of political parties\u2019 goals and motives to the prerogative of the judiciary , with article I CARDINAL of that Act enumerating , exhaustively , grounds rendering lists of candidates invalid . The principal electoral committee had thus been limited by law to scrutinising lists of candidates only against those grounds for invalidity found in LAW . Given that a failure to comply with LAW did not feature in article I CARDINAL , ORG concluded that the principal electoral committee had correctly not examined the compatibility of the list of candidates submitted by the ORG with said LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of the Interior and ORG wrote to the ORG \u2019s governing body ( hoofdbestuur ) in the following terms :", "\u201c ORG , in its judgment of DATE on the subject of the passive voting rights of women in your party , has held that the ORG must take a measure that is at once effective and interferes as little as possible with the basic rights of ( members of ) the ORG .", "I am aware that you have since lodged an application against the judgment with ORG . I am proceeding on the assumption that some time will TIME before the ORG will give its decision in the case , the more so if it has to deal with the substance of the extremely fundamental questions of principle here in issue . For me too , it is important in taking such a measure that I should be in a position to take into account the ORG \u2019s view on these matters of principle . However , I feel that I can not wait if at this time there is a legal obstacle to a woman to exercise her passive voting rights in your party ( indien er op dit moment in juridische zin een beletsel zou zijn voor een vrouw om haar passief kiesrecht uit te oefenen in uw partij ) .", "In view of the above , I would appreciate your ORG \u2019s answers to the following questions :", "Do your bye - laws or rules , including the Statement of Principles , impose impediments ( belemmeringen ) in a legal sense on women who are members of your party to stand for election to a representative body ?", "In drawing up your lists of candidates , do you follow procedures which hinder the eligibility of women ?", "In considering the candidates who come forward , do you apply any selection criteria other than their suitability to act as members of representative bodies on behalf of your ORG ?", "If there are any impediments on any one of the former points , are you prepared to remove them ? \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the governing body of the ORG replied in the following terms :", "\u201c In your letter of CARDINAL DATE you have put several questions to the governing body of the ORG . The governing body will deal with them in succession .", "Your first question is whether the bye - laws , rules or Statement of Principles impose impediments in a legal sense on women who are members of the ORG to stand for election to a representative body .", "In DATE the bye - laws and rules of the ORG were modified by a decision of its members at a general meeting , so that members of the ORG are now referred to as \u2018 persons\u2019 , see section CARDINAL of the bye - laws . The same applies to standing for election to representative bodies , see sections CARDINAL - CARDINAL of the rules . A difference made between men and women members was actually removed from these provisions in DATE .", "Your second question concerns the possible use of procedures in drawing up lists of candidates which might hinder women in standing for election . The ORG applies no formal selection criteria other than the general standard set out in sections DATE of the rules , which require that candidates should be members considered to be faithful to the ORG \u2019s principles and suitable , in which age , church involvement and occupation are relevant factors . Women members , like all members , have the possibility to contribute actively in the selection of candidates for election to representative bodies ( een actieve bijdrage te vervullen bij de kandidaatstelling van volksvertegenwoordigers ) , and also to add items to the agenda , etc .", "Lists of candidates are drawn up after the advice of a selection advisory board has been obtained . The only formal restrictions in the rules are constituted by the length of membership of ORG ( DATE ) and where appropriate an age criterion for persons who are not yet members of the representative body concerned . No further procedural restrictions can be derived from the rules .", "You next ask whether within the ORG , in considering the candidates who come forward , any selection criteria are applied other than their suitability to act as members of representative bodies on behalf of the ORG . Every selection advisory board must , as in any party , seek out members who can be considered to promote the ORG \u2019s principles . These principles , as set out in the Statement of Principles , form the core of the ORG . ORG members have been pursuing politics based on these principles for DATE . The ORG \u2019s so - called \u2018 position on ORG ( vrouwenstandpunt ) is a part of a more enveloping view of Bible - based politics ( meeromvattende visie op Bijbelgenormeerde politiek ) on which the ORG operates . Every candidate is expected to be able to be politically active on the basis of this more enveloping view of Bible - based politics . It is for the various selection advisory boards to give a reasoned opinion on this point .", "In view of the negative answers to your above questions , the governing body can not answer your last question , that is , whether the governing body is prepared to remove any impediments .", "That concludes the answers to your questions .", "The governing body would wish to make the following , perhaps entirely unnecessary , remark . The governing body has submitted an application to ORG in GPE because the ORG finds ORG judgment of DATE unacceptable . The grassroots support of the ORG across its full width considers itself deeply affected and harmed in its constitutionally protected freedoms , including freedom of religion , freedom of expression and the freedom to set up a political association and promote its principles in representative bodies . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister of the Interior and ORG wrote to the Speaker of ORG of ORG in the following terms :", "\u201c In a judgment of DATE ORG has held that ORG was correct in finding that the ORG was under a duty to take measures to ensure that the ORG grants the right to stand for election to women ; the ORG is required , in so doing , to apply a measure that is at once effective and least liable to impinge on the basic rights of ( members of the ) ORG . Following this judgment , the ORG has lodged an application with ORG in GPE ( \u2018 the ORG ) , because the ORG considers as a matter of principle that it ought to be free to act according to the principles held within the party . The lodging of this application does not suspend the execution of the judgment of ORG .", "This does not alter the fact that executing the judgment of ORG can make serious inroads and requires care and preparation , also in view of the fundamental rights at stake . For that reason I consider it indicated to take the ORG \u2019s judgment into consideration before arriving at a final decision in this complex matter .", "In preparing to execute the judgment of ORG I have ascertained , among other things , whether there is at this time a formal ( legal ) impediment preventing women from exercising their right to stand for election within the ORG .", "Against this background , I have asked the ORG \u2019s governing body whether there are currently any restrictions for women in bye - laws , or related rules , or in the procedures or selection criteria operated by the governing body , other than suitability of the candidates as perceived by the governing body . The governing body has informed me that no such formal impediments exist . I attach the relevant correspondence . I am of the view that this will suffice for now and will consider the need and desirability of possible legal measures after the ORG has expressed itself . \u201d", "This letter was the subject of debate in ORG for the ORG ( ORG CARDINAL FAC ) of ORG of ORG on DATE .
