SWITZERLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "1", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Christos Rozakis", "TEXT": ["The applicant has dual NORP / NORP nationality . She was born in DATE and lives at GPE ( GPE ) . She is represented before the court by PERSON PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In DATE the applicant was injured in a road accident when travelling as a passenger in a vehicle insured for third - party risks by the PERSON insurance company .", "She sustained serious bodily injuries . S. paid her medical expenses until DATE but refused to make any further payments .", "After negotiations had broken down , the applicant brought an action for damages against the insurance company on DATE in ORG .", "In the course of those proceedings she learnt that had been under surveillance by private detectives on several occasions . It appears from the file that was produced to the ORG that in DATE the insurance company began to have doubts about the true extent of the applicant \u2019s injuries and instructed CARDINAL private detectives to verify her physical condition . The detectives monitored the applicant \u2019s movements and followed her by car . They also kept a record of any visits she received . They filmed the applicant on various occasions , notably when she attended an appointment at the insurance company \u2019s offices and at a picnic that had been organised in the car park of the company for which her partner worked . In the course of their surveillance operations the detectives produced reports , photographs and a video recording .", "On DATE the applicant made an \u201c application for protection of her personality rights \u201d to ORG on the basis of Articles CARDINAL et seq . of LAW . She sought an injunction restraining the insurers from keeping her under surveillance , an order for the destruction of the photographs and video and a declaration that the reports , photographs and video constituted an unlawful interference with her personality rights .", "On DATE she lodged a criminal complaint against the private detectives and representatives of the insurance company , notably for interference with her privacy . The criminal proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of the civil proceedings before ORG , which on DATE made an order for damages against the insurance company . According to the applicant , that judgment has become final and irreversible as neither party has appealed against it .", "On DATE ORG Instance dismissed the applicant \u2019s application for protection of her personality rights . On DATE ORG of ORG of GPE upheld that decision .", "In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s application to have that judgment set aside . It began by observing that by virtue of LAW subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW an interference was unlawful unless justified by the victim \u2019s consent , an overriding private or public interest , or statute . When , as in the case before it , the insurance company had pleaded an overriding interest , the trial court had to decide whether , in the light of all the circumstances , sufficient grounds existed to make the interference legitimate . It further pointed out that it was for the trial court , in its discretion , to weigh up the competing interests . It proceeded to dismiss the applicant \u2019s application on the following grounds :", "\u201c ( b ) NORP Before making an insurance payment , an insurer providing third - party cover has a duty to verify whether the insured has incurred civil liability for the damage caused to the third party and whether the victim \u2019s claim for reparation is justified . It must also defend the insured against unjustified claims by third parties . Further , the insurer acts in the interests of all its insured collectively ( see , on this subject , PERSON , ORG , GPE DATE , ORG . CARDINAL et seq . ) . When discharging its duties , the insurer is therefore entitled to conduct private investigations and assemble evidence . For their part , victims claiming compensation must cooperate in establishing the facts and accept that the insurer may conduct investigations , even without their knowledge , when that is necessary to achieve the aim pursued . Thus , assembling evidence with a view to establishing the existence and extent of the insurer \u2019s obligations towards the victim may constitute a valid reason for interfering with personality rights ( see PERSON , \u2018 PERSON i m GPE , thesis , ORG , p. CARDINAL ) .", "( c ) In the present case , the cantonal court accepted , and its finding is binding on ORG ( Article CARDINAL subparagraph CARDINAL of LAW ) , that the investigations , which were conducted from a public place and were confined to ascertaining the appellant \u2019s mobility , that being \u2018 an essential element in the GPE proceedings for which the information thereby obtained was intended\u2019 , were aimed solely at protecting the insurer \u2019s pecuniary rights and preserving the evidence necessary for its defence in the proceedings . On the basis of those facts , ORG must be regarded as having acted within the limits of its discretionary powers when it found that the respondent had an overriding interest that made the interference lawful .", "The impugned judgment shows that the insurer had doubts about the true extent of the injuries sustained by the appellant in the accident . In the light of the above principles and of the amount claimed ( MONEY ) , the insurer was entitled to conduct an investigation . Furthermore , the means employed ( surveillance , photographs and video recording ) were appropriate for the aim pursued . Admittedly , any impairment of a person \u2019s physical condition can be established by medical evidence and indeed the appellant underwent a medical examination . However , a medical examination constitutes first and foremost a theoretical medical assessment , while the effects of damage to physical integrity may also be assessed by reference to the sufferer \u2019s actual DATE and working life . In the circumstances , the surveillance carried out by the respondent DATE which amounted to CARDINAL investigations each lasting DATE and staggered over a period of DATE and the pictures taken of the appellant as part of those investigations do not appear to be disproportionate either . In any event , the cantonal court clearly was acting within the bounds of its discretion when it found that the interference was justified .", "( CARDINAL ) In conclusion , to the extent that it is admissible , the application must be dismissed and the impugned judgment upheld . \u201d", "LAW lays down the principle of protection of personality rights . It reads as follows :", "\u201c Anyone who suffers an unlawful interference with their personality rights may apply to the courts for protection against any person who has participated therein .", "An interference will be unlawful unless it is justified by the consent of the victim , an overriding private or public interest or statute . \u201d", "Article CARDINAL(a ) sets out the remedies available to anyone who claims to have sustained damage as a result of a violation of their personality rights :", "\u201c The applicant may request the court to :", "( CARDINAL ) prohibit an unlawful interference , if imminent ;", "( CARDINAL ) NORP order that any continuing unlawful interference shall cease ;", "( CARDINAL ) make a declaration that an interference is unlawful if the harm which it has caused continues to subsist . \u201d", "The applicant lodged a criminal complaint for , inter alia , \u201c an interference with [ her ] private life \u201d against the private detectives and the representatives of the insurance company . LAW of LAW makes it an offence to use a camera to encroach upon a person \u2019s personal or private life :", "\u201c It shall be an offence punishable by imprisonment or a fine following a complaint to use a camera to observe , or image - recording equipment to record , any matter pertaining to a person \u2019s personal life or , if it would not be in public view but for the camera or equipment , to his or her private life , without the consent of the person concerned . \u201d"], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
