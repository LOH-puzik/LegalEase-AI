The applicants appealed to ORG against that judgment . In their pleadings they relied on , inter alia , Articles CARDINAL and CARDINAL of the LAW , their main arguments being that ORG had based its judgment on contradictory and inconsistent reasoning and had , in particular , applied section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW ( which concerned high - cost medical \u201c equipment \u201d ) , whereas , pursuant to the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE , an MRI unit constituted a high - cost medico - technical \u201c service \u201d , the setting up or operation of which came under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of that LAW ; that ORG had omitted to examine whether the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE was compatible with LAW DATE on institutional reform , which had apportioned powers among the ORG , the ORG and the Regions , or with the principle of equality enshrined in LAW and CARDINAL of the LAW , and that it had failed to refer the matter to GPE and Procedure Court ; that it had infringed the general principle of the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence ; that the lawfulness of the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE , which ORG had applied , had not been established ; and that , in any event , the penalty for which it provided had been tacitly abolished by a subsequent provision , namely section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of the PERSON of DATE .", "Under the second limb of their second ground of appeal , the applicants asserted that ORG had breached section CARDINAL ) of GPE and Procedure Court ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) by refusing to refer a preliminary question to that court as to whether section CARDINAL of LAW contravened the rules laid down by or pursuant to the LAW to determine the respective powers of the ( federal ) ORG , the ORG and the Regions .

NORP In its judgment , delivered on DATE , ORG held , in particular , that the reasoning given in the judgment appealed against had not been contradictory and that the contention that ORG had applied section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) instead of section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW amounted to complaining of an incorrect reference to the applicable legal provision , an error that had no bearing on the penalty imposed since the CARDINAL provisions in question provided for the same penalty . It further held that the complaint that the royal decree was incompatible with LAW of DATE amounted to challenging the PERSON \u2019s constitutionality , a question outside ORG jurisdiction . Furthermore , ORG was under no obligation to submit a preliminary question to GPE and Procedure Court if it considered that the reply to the question was not essential for it to be able to give judgment .", "ORG further noted that ORG had not infringed the rules on the burden of proof as , in dismissing the complaints that the royal decree of CARDINAL DATE was unlawful , it had based its decision not on the appellants\u2019 arguments but on the consideration that it was not for the courts to take the place of the executive in assessing the appropriateness of a measure falling within the executive \u2019s sphere of competence .", "ORG also dismissed the argument that the royal decree in question was unlawful or had been repealed , holding that section CARDINAL of the Law of DATE was in no way incompatible with LAW of DATE as it merely provided for an additional sanction in the form of a limit on fees and , consequently , had not tacitly abolished the criminal penalties provided for in that Act .", "Lastly , ORG refused the request to submit a preliminary question to ORG .
