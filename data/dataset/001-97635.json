They were represented before the Court by PERSON Jan Aminoff , a lawyer practising in GPE . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) were represented by their Agent , Mr PERSON of ORG .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In an DATE storm in DATE , the Vrouw Maria , a NORP merchant ship , was wrecked on the seabed in NORP waters in the south - western archipelago in the vicinity of ORG and GPE islands . The ship , which was on its way from GPE to GPE , is believed to have been carrying valuable works of art destined for GPE PERSON the Great of GPE .", "On DATE , the first applicant , an experienced diver , located the vessel at a depth of QUANTITY and subsequently informed ORG ( merimuseo , sj\u00f6historiska museet ) of the find as required under LAW ( muinaismuistolaki , lagen om fornminnen ; Act no . GPE ) . The first applicant had a total of CARDINAL divers in his team .", "On DATE artefacts were brought up from the wreck by the applicants . According to the applicants , they were brought up at the request , alternatively with the permission , of Ms F. , a representative of ORG ( museovirasto , museiverket ; a subordinate body of ORG ; opetusministeri\u00f6 , undervisningsministeriet ) .", "Under LAW , as in force at the time , a wreck DATE could not be removed or touched without permission from ORG and/or ORG . The same was true of items found in , or originating from , such a wreck . Subsequently the ORG and/or the ORG consistently refused the applicants permission to deal with the wreck and the associated items .", "In or around DATE the applicants informed the local police of the find and , when no owner appeared , a claim to title was lodged with the police in or around DATE , in accordance with the procedure laid down in LAW ( l\u00f6yt\u00f6tavaralaki , hittegodslagen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) .", "On DATE an amendment to section CARDINAL of LAW , vesting the ownership of a wreck in the ORG , entered into force ( see below ) .", "On DATE the applicants instituted proceedings in ORG ( merioikeus , sj\u00f6r\u00e4tten ; a department of ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) composed of CARDINAL professional judges and CARDINAL sea captains ) , requesting the court to confirm that on DATE by bringing up CARDINAL chalk pipes , a clay bottle , a seal and a zinc ingot they had engaged in salvage operations for which they were entitled to remuneration under LAW of LAW ( merilaki , sj\u00f6lagen ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) and that they had a right , either under a contract or as first salvors , to bring up all objects for which they were entitled to salvage remuneration . The court was also asked to confirm that the applicants were to be considered owners of the wreck and that they had the right also on that ground to engage in salvage operations . Were the court to consider the ORG owner of the wreck , the applicants requested it to confirm that they , either under a contract or as first salvor , had the right to engage in salvage of the wreck and to receive remuneration therefor . Lastly , they claimed legal costs .", "Under LAW , LAW , of LAW anyone who salvages or assists in salvaging a foundered vessel , or goods in such a vessel , is entitled to salvage remuneration . As the applicants had been the first at the scene , they contended that they had been entitled to engage in salvage . Under LAW a right to salvage remuneration arose even if the wreck was no longer in danger . In any event , the presumably valuable cargo could be considered in danger as divers had access to it through the wreck 's open cargo hold . This was shown by the fact that on DATE ORG had asked ORG and ORG to monitor the wreck .", "The applicants conceded that ownership as regards objects found in the wreck fell to the ORG under LAW as in force at the time when the case was heard before the courts . However , they considered themselves owners of the wreck under former section CARDINAL as in force at the time of the find . The old provision did not state anything about the ownership of a vessel DATE but the decision was to be made in accordance with the general principles . The subsequent entry into force on DATE of the amendment could not remove the applicants ' right of ownership , although the LAW was given retroactive effect if the wreck did not have an owner . As the applicants had become owners in DATE as a result of appropriation , the subsequent amendment could not be given retroactive effect in the present case .", "The ORG contested the action , arguing that objects had been brought up under section CARDINAL of LAW with the permission of ORG for research purposes . PERSON was a relic of antiquity within the meaning of LAW . The exclusive right to make decisions concerning the wreck and objects therein , their examination and possible removal was vested in the ORG . Any decision to bring up objects did not mean engaging in salvage but rather the conduct of research under LAW . The remuneration of such work was to be decided pursuant to a contract , or in the absence of such , pursuant to LAW ( kauppakaari , handelsbalken ) .", "The ORG argued that there was no salvage contract . In any event , such a contract was not binding on the ORG since PERSON , a researcher , had not been competent to enter into such a contract , a fact of which the applicants had been aware . If the court were to find that a salvage contract had been established , it must be considered to have concerned only the bringing up of objects in DATE . The ORG also argued that , as there had been no dangerous situation requiring immediate salvage action , the applicants could not be considered first salvors . Accordingly , they had no right to salvage remuneration .", "The ORG argued that ORG had the right to forbid possible further action under LAW , LAW , of LAW . It was likewise free to choose its own salvor for the remaining work .", "In the ORG 's view , the amendment of LAW had only been of a clarifying nature . The intention of the LAW from the outset had been that the ORG would receive ownership of a wreck based on protection . This was evidenced from the duty to inform ORG of a find . Under LAW a third party did not have the right to interfere , touch or otherwise repossess an immovable relic of antiquity . Therefore , the applicants could not have gained ownership of the wreck on the basis of appropriation . As PERSON had been abandoned by its original owner , she had immediately become protected following her discovery in DATE without any separate decision or action .", "By an interim judgment of DATE ORG ( composed of CARDINAL single professional judge ) held that the provisions of the Maritime Code on salvage were applicable to the operations aimed at salvaging the wreck and the property originating from it .", "During the course of the present proceedings , and as noted above , ORG amended section CARDINAL of LAW so as to vest ownership of vessels wrecked DATE previously in the ORG . According to the applicants , this enabled the ORG to assert as owner that it objected to salvage , which it had not been able to do before , thus depriving the applicants of their position as first salvors .", "In a final judgment of DATE ORG ( in its full composition ) , having held an oral hearing and heard CARDINAL witnesses , decided that LAW , as amended , was to be considered lex specialis . As the wreck and objects therein were protected , any interference required the permission of ORG .", "Under section CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) of LAW was the owner of any object found in or obviously originating from the wreck . Under the amended section CARDINAL ) also the wreck belonged to the ORG . As PERSON had been shipwrecked in DATE , it was clear that she had been abandoned by her owner . Because she was over DATE she had become protected by law before DATE when the amendment to LAW took effect . Appropriation by the applicants , which presupposed , inter alia , the gain of control over an object , had not been possible due to the protection by law .", "According to the court , the Maritime Code applied only to ships in navigation and in danger . In respect of a foundered ship which fell within the purview of LAW ( an historic vessel without an apparent owner ) , the LAW worked to exclude the provisions on salvage ; hence , the applicants were not in the position of first salvors . The court further held that , even if the applicants were considered as first salvors , the ORG had in any case the right to forbid any salvage operation and the salvage remuneration could be refused on that ground .", "The judgment was not unanimous as CARDINAL of the professional judges expressed the view that the applicants had the right of first salvors and a right to remuneration for the objects brought up by them . The claim for remuneration for further actions was premature as it was not known whether anything else would be brought up . The judge did not find the existence of a salvage contract established .", "The applicants appealed , repeating their claims as presented before ORG . In their counter appeal , the ORG requested the court to find that LAW superseded the provisions on salvage in LAW as lex specialis and lex posterior and because of the hierarchical order of these laws and that the action should be dismissed on the ground that ORG had lacked jurisdiction to examine the case .", "On DATE ORG ( hovioikeus , hovr\u00e4tten ) , having held an oral hearing in which it received testimony from CARDINAL witnesses , rejected the appeals save that it discharged the applicants from their obligation to pay the ORG 's legal costs .", "The court found that both LAW and LAW were lex specialis . There were no grounds for considering that the former superseded the latter . Neither did the court uphold the ORG 's contention that there were CARDINAL different groups of flotsam , one to be examined under LAW and another under LAW . Nor did it uphold the ORG 's argument that LAW , article CARDINAL , of the Maritime Code applied only to wrecks in danger . Finding that an unendangered wreck could also be the object of salvage , it confirmed that PERSON was shipwrecked within the meaning of LAW of LAW . The court also noted that LAW did not include a provision forbidding the application of LAW provisions on salvage to flotsam within the meaning of LAW . In sum , both Acts were applicable to the present case .", "As to the applicants ' claim for ownership based on appropriation , the court noted that the wreck was placed under protection under LAW , which meant that all types of interference were forbidden without the permission of ORG . The provisions on protection worked to prevent the finder of a wreck from gaining de facto dominion over it . Therefore appropriation of an abandoned object such as the CARDINAL in issue was not possible and the applicant 's claim for ownership could not be upheld . Under section CARDINAL ) the ORG was the owner of the wreck .", "As to the applicants ' contention that the parties had entered into a salvage contract , the court held that the existence of such an agreement had not been evidenced . It noted the following . On the basis of the witness statements of PERSON and PERSON the former had , in any event , not been competent to enter into such an agreement with binding effect on the ORG . On the basis of PERSON testimony it was equally clear that the personnel of ORG had not been competent to agree on remuneration . PERSON also gave evidence to the effect that she had plainly given permission to bring up objects for research purposes in order to identify the wreck and without having the intention of engaging in a salvage contract . While noting that ORG had paid compensation to CARDINAL of the applicants for operations carried out during a diving expedition , the compensation paid could not be equated to salvage remuneration . The court found that the sums already paid did not support the conclusion that a salvage contract had been established between the parties . As to a document relied on in evidence and entitled \u201c the wreck of the Vrouw Maria \u201d , its drafter , PERSON , explained that she had made an estimate of the costs for examining the wreck . When drawing up the document there had been no discussion about bringing up the wreck . The court also noted a written statement by PERSON according to which there had been discussion within ORG about the possible bringing up of objects . However , none of these documents showed that the representatives of ORG had intended to engage in a salvage agreement with the applicants .", "As to whether the ORG as owner had the right under LAW , article CARDINAL(CARDINAL ) , of LAW to forbid the applicants from engaging in salvage , the court noted that the first salvor may engage in salvage contrary to the owner 's will when there is a concrete danger which necessarily requires engaging in salvage . In the present case , there was no such danger . The wreck and its cargo had lain at the bottom of the sea for DATE . The wreck and at least part of the cargo had been found in good condition and it could be assumed that they would continue to remain so for DATE . The wreck was situated at a depth of QUANTITY and at a difficult location navigationally . It caused no danger to navigation . It was possible that divers might enter the wreck and remove items . On the other hand , the wreck was under radar and camera surveillance by the authorities and therefore it was not probable that any stay of a long duration at the location where the ship went down would be possible without the intervention of the authorities . The ship went down in territorial waters and therefore it was unlikely that the wreck could be damaged by anchoring . Neither did archaeological concern require the immediate salvage of the wreck or its cargo . On these grounds ORG considered that the ORG had the right to prohibit salvage .", "The court did not comment on the amendment of LAW .", "The applicants appealed , repeating their claims as presented before ORG and ORG . However , in their request for leave to appeal , the applicants expressly abandoned their ownership claim . They did so because they considered that the intervening amendment to LAW had made it impossible for them to succeed in that claim as ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) was bound to give effect to the legislation and therefore to reject their ownership claim .", "On DATE ORG refused leave to appeal .", "LAW ( Suomen perustuslaki , ORG grundlag ; Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provides that the property of everyone is protected . Provisions on the expropriation of property , for public needs and in consideration of full compensation , are laid down by an Act .", "According to LAW", "\" [ i]f , in a matter being tried by a court of law , the application of an Act would be in evident conflict with the LAW , the court of law shall give primacy to the provision in LAW . \"", "ORG found , inter alia , in the case ORG CARDINAL:CARDINAL concerning property rights that a provision of the LAW on the Protection of Buildings ( rakennussuojelulaki , byggnadsskyddslagen ) was in conflict with the LAW and that primacy was to be given to the latter .", "Section CARDINAL of LAW no . CARDINAL ) provides that immovable relics of antiquity are protected as traces of the previous settlement and history of GPE . Without permission given under this Act such relics are not to be the object of excavation , covering , modification , damage , removal or other unauthorised interference .", "Section CARDINAL provides that ORG has the right , inter alia , to examine and restore an immovable relic of antiquity , or it can entrust this task to someone else .", "Sections CARDINAL and CARDINAL provide that the find of certain specified movable objects , which can be presumed to be DATE , must be reported to ORG , which is entitled to redeem them . A movable antiquity found on an immovable CARDINAL belongs to the ORG without redemption provided that it is connected with the immovable antiquity . ORG may however decide to give a finder 's reward if it considers this justified .", "At the time when PERSON was found , section CARDINAL of LAW no.CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) provided :", "\u201c A wreck of a ship or other craft , or part of such a wreck , discovered in the sea or inland waters , which can be presumed to be DATE , is protected .

The amended LAW no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) reads :", "\u201c A wreck of a ship or other craft , or part of such a wreck , discovered in the sea or inland waters , which can be presumed to have gone down DATE , is protected . The provisions regarding immovable antiquities shall apply where relevant to such a wreck or part thereof .", "If , on the basis of external conditions , it is obvious that the owner has abandoned a wreck referred to in subsection CARDINAL or a part thereof , it shall belong to the ORG .", "Items found in a wreck referred to in subsection CARDINAL or which apparently originate from such a wreck belong to the ORG without redemption , and otherwise the provisions concerning movable antiquities shall apply where relevant .", "Anyone who finds a wreck or an item referred to in this section must inform ORG without undue delay .", "... \u201d", "The amendment ( Act no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) took effect on DATE . It was , however , given retroactive effect . The amendment was applicable to wrecks and parts thereof which had already become protected as historical monuments before the entry into force of the amendment if , based on external conditions , it was obvious that they had been abandoned by their owner .", "The preparatory works of the amendment of LAW ( see the ORG bill HE MONEY ) noted the need to clarify the question of ownership of a protected wreck or part thereof . It stated , inter alia , that :", "\u201c Since the enactment of LAW , technological developments have facilitated locating and exploring old shipwrecks under water . The number of wrecks located by means of side scan sonar in territorial waters of GPE will probably grow in DATE . ....", "PERSON , which foundered in DATE , was discovered in DATE in LOC . It has been stated that the title to the wreck itself is not unambiguous in the light of current law , because the LAW does not stipulate directly that a wreck regarded as a relic of antiquity is owned by the ORG . No case - law exists on the application of LAW to this question , and it is not covered in legal literature either .", ".... NORP and NORP legislation contains an unambiguous provision stipulating that the title to a shipwreck regarded as a relic of antiquity is vested in the ORG . The preparatory works of LAW in force state , however , that relics of antiquity , because of their old age , can no longer be regarded as the property of private individuals . Relics of antiquity are considered to have primarily antiquity value and/or historical value but no longer use value . Also the raising of a sunken historical wreck constitutes primarily archaeological research . For these reasons it can be considered that the legislator originally intended to stipulate that historical shipwrecks are owned by the ORG , although this intent was not expressed openly . \u201d", "LAW , article CARDINAL , of LAW no .
