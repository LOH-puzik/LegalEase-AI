The President granted the applicant \u2019s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He was represented before the ORG by Ms A - M.

NORP The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant \u2019s parents were heroin addicts . He was taken into local authority care when he was still a baby and adopted . As a young adolescent he became drug dependent and involved in offending behaviour , spending increasingly long periods of time in custody .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE , aged DATE , the applicant was sentenced to CARDINAL years\u2019 detention for a series of offences . When serving this sentence , he demonstrated serious personality problems including engaging in repetitive , serious and dangerous self - harming behaviour . In a report dated DATE , Professor PERSON , a forensic psychiatrist instructed on behalf of the applicant , noted the repetitive self - harming behaviour of an \u201c extreme and dangerous nature \u201d and that he was at a \u201c serious risk of suicide \u201d . Professor PERSON diagnosed a psychopathic disorder under LAW DATE ( hereinafter \u201c LAW \u201d ) . Whilst the applicant was not yet amenable to psychotherapy , Professor PERSON recommended that he be transferred to hospital for assessment and treatment under LAW of the MHA DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE to early DATE there was no agreement between the psychiatrists as to the applicant \u2019s diagnosis or treatment . Since he had spent much of his life in GPE , it was thought that any psychiatric hospital treatment would be in GPE so he was examined by Dr. PERSON , ORG for ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) Trust which covered GPE .", "CARDINAL . Dr. PERSON stated in a CARDINAL - page letter dated DATE that , although the applicant had antisocial and borderline personality traits , he was not suffering from a psychopathic disorder and would not be amenable to psychotherapy . He also took the view that there was no evidence that the applicant would benefit from hospital treatment or that his condition would improve as a result . The applicant did not require pharmacological treatment therapy and was not likely to respond to psychological treatments . Indeed , the applicant \u2019s history had shown that his behaviour badly deteriorated in institutions , so that a transfer to hospital would likely result in his detention in a maximum security mental health setting , which Dr. PERSON was convinced would not be in the applicant \u2019s best interests .", "CARDINAL . ORG in later proceedings confirmed that this diagnosis meant that it was not possible to transfer the applicant to hospital for treatment under sections CARDINAL , DATE , DATE or DATE of the MHA DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant was released on licence on DATE .", "CARDINAL . DATE and DATE , the applicant was detained at ORG ( \u201c GPE YOI \u201d ) on remand on serious criminal charges , including robbery , and then into custody following his conviction by ORG in DATE of false imprisonment and dangerous driving .", "CARDINAL . Feltham YOI received a copy of the reports of Professor PERSON and PERSON . PERSON . The applicant was psychiatrically assessed as suitable for ORG ( \u201c ACCT \u201d ) care - planning system for prisoners at risk of self - harm . This system was designed to ensure that relevant prisoners received assessment , care , supervision and treatment commensurate with an ongoing process of risk assessment by a multi - disciplinary team trained in the LAW procedures . The ORG system could include search provisions , restrictions on possessions , provision of accommodation specially adapted to reduce risk of self - harm , as well as interaction and monitoring appropriate to the risk . The applicant was moved within GPE YOI depending on his health : the mental health in - patient ORG in GPE YOI was a restrictive place of safety for periods of acute risk and he was moved to more open environments when he improved .", "CARDINAL . The applicant displayed , it appears from the beginning , serious and dangerous self - harming behaviour at GPE YOI . An extract from his medical and prison records for DATE is demonstrative :", "\u201c DATE : medical records state that he inserted a pin in his mouth , which he removed when he calmed down . He later put a pencil in his mouth . The prison records record that he put a broken pencil in his mouth .", "DATE : the medical records state that [ the applicant ] opened an old abdominal wound ; he claimed to have inserted CARDINAL staples into it . He was taken to [ hospital ] . He also reported that he had inserted staples underneath his right eye . Wound stitched at [ hospital ] . The staples on the right side of his face were not taken out as he needed an operation , as he had inserted them through his mouth . The prison records state that he had got hold of a screw and picked off the scab on his arm and continued to screw it in his arm . The officer asked him to hand over the screw but he declined . A note timed at CARDINAL states that he continued to put staples into an open wound . At CARDINAL he was told he would go to hospital .", "DATE : the medical records state that he barricaded the door with a mattress . He removed a piece of the door and used it to harm himself , deepening an existing wound on his right arm causing it to bleed . He was taken to [ hospital ] . He was refusing meals , stating that he was on hunger strike .", "DATE : the medical records state that he banged his head on the cell gate . According to the prison record , at CARDINAL he was kicking the sink . When asked why , he stated that he wanted to break his foot . \u201d", "CARDINAL . NORP The records also show that the applicant inserted foreign bodies into his penis on multiple occasions , including a screw on DATE , forced a piece of glass into his urethra on DATE and severed the tendons of both feet on DATE . The applicant inserted dirt into his self - inflicted wounds causing repeated infections .", "CARDINAL . The applicant claims that he attempted suicide on CARDINAL occasions and threatened to commit suicide at other times . The Government denied that the applicant ever attempted suicide whilst at GPE YOI .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s then representatives , ORG , sent a \u201c letter before claim \u201d challenging the failure of the Secretary of ORG to provide a safe environment for the applicant . Noting that the applicant had CARDINAL surgical interventions in DATE , other serious incidences of self - harm and that he had made suicide threats , they argued that the prison was not a suitable environment for him .", "CARDINAL . Professor PERSON , instructed on the applicant \u2019s behalf , reported on DATE , noting that the applicant \u2019s behaviour had rapidly deteriorated since his return to custody . He confirmed his earlier view that the applicant \u2019s condition amounted to mental illness and psychopathic disorder within the meaning of the ORG DATE , so that the applicant should be urgently transferred to a hospital for treatment under section CARDINAL of that Act . He reiterated that the applicant was not yet amenable to psychotherapy .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG Solicitor responded to the \u201c letter before claim \u201d of the applicant \u2019s representatives\u2019 noting that the applicant was in good health , that he had self - harmed less lately , that his last visit to hospital was on DATE and that his behaviour , conduct and mood had improved allowing his transfer to a normal room . The applicant \u2019s representatives did not take any further action at that time .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr. PERSON , a ORG and the in - house psychiatrist at ORG , wrote to the Specialist Commissioner of ORG expressing concern about the applicant \u2019s deteriorating health and requesting his transfer to a hospital . It was the opinion of the clinical team at GPE YOI that the applicant met the criteria for antisocial and borderline personality disorder and required specialist treatment in a hospital setting . He was a prolific self - harmer , the situation having become more serious over DATE . The health services in GPE YOI considered that they could not provide adequate care for the applicant in prison and that he required a transfer to a secure centre specialising in the treatment of personality disorders . Dr. PERSON considered , contrary to Dr. PERSON , that the applicant would benefit from hospital treatment and that his history did not exclude this option , as he had only been in CARDINAL psychiatric hospital setting and that was when he was very young . Since the ORG Commissioner had indicated that she could not consider Dr. PERSON request without Dr. Williams\u2019 view , Dr. PERSON requested Dr. PERSON to conduct another assessment .", "CARDINAL . In the meantime , PERSON a consultant psychiatrist , assessed the applicant at the request of ORG due to sentence him ( offences committed in DATE ) . His report dated DATE found that the applicant was suffering from a psychopathic disorder as defined in the MHA DATE . He concurred with Professor PERSON that the applicant was detainable and should be admitted to hospital for further assessment and treatment of his serious personality disorder . This could be achieved once a suitable placement was identified under LAW DATE or , if sentenced to imprisonment , under section CARDINAL of the MHA DATE .", "CARDINAL . Dr. PERSON re - assessed the applicant as requested in DATE . In his report of DATE he revised his earlier opinion about the applicant \u2019s condition and about the prospects of treatment , stating that there had been some change since he reviewed the applicant , so that he considered that a treatment trial would be worth considering ( section CARDINAL of the MHA DATE ) . However , Dr. PERSON queried whether or not the applicant was a patient for whom his Trust ( NORP ) was responsible . The applicant had indeed been born and had spent much of his life in GPE , but he had informed Dr. PERSON , during his re - assessment interview in DATE , that he had re - registered in DATE with a medical practice in GPE . Enquiries confirmed this and , as a result , the applicant \u2019s case had to be transferred to ORG which had , in turn , to re - assess the applicant and , if relevant , identify an appropriate and available hospital place .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr. PERSON followed up with another letter to the Specialist Commissioner recommending that the applicant be considered for placement in a specialist personality disorder unit . His mental health had deteriorated and his self - harming had increased whilst in prison : any delay caused by his transfer to ORG had to be kept to a minimum .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant \u2019s representatives wrote to the ORG solicitor . They recognised that the applicant \u2019s behaviour was difficult and challenging and that staff at GPE were seeking to put in place , within limited resources , skills and training , as safe a regime and environment as possible , but the truth was that this was insufficient to protect the applicant \u2019s health and life . They enclosed a report dated DATE by Dr. PERSON , a consultant in intensive care and anesthesia , who had been instructed by the applicant to report on whether his self - harming behaviour was life - threatening . Dr. PERSON noted that staff in GPE YOI considered the severity and frequency of the applicant \u2019s self - harming placed him in a \u201c completely different category \u201d from virtually all other self - harmers whom they had encountered . Dr. PERSON \u2019s report examined the risk posed to the applicant \u2019s life , concluding :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL The nature and pattern of self - harm inflicted by [ the applicant ] are clearly disquieting to any external reviewer and indicative of an extremely disturbed mindset .", "CARDINAL His current injuries and their sequelae place him at risk of renal failure due to obstruction of the urinary tract and at constant risk of life - threatening infection from necrotizing fasciitis , urinary tract sepsis , bacterial endocarditis and deep - seated pelvic infection . The risk of these complications is enhanced not only with each new additional injury but also by the multiple retained foreign bodies within the tissues which create susceptibility to colonisation by bacteria and subsequent infection from any distant source of sepsis carried around the body by the circulation .", "CARDINAL He is also currently at risk of losing limbs through refractory infection and the use of his penis for normal urination and sexual function .", "CARDINAL [ His ] life is also in jeopardy from exsanguination with either intentional or accidental arterial damage during further self - harm .", "CARDINAL This pattern of self - injury will predictably induce a state of chronic ill - health within a short time - frame and leave [ the applicant ] more vulnerable to the above complications of his injuries . The cycle will then become self - fuelling , inevitably culminating from CARDINAL complication or another in [ the applicant ] \u2019s death .", "CARDINAL There also appears to be a more immediate urgency in placing [ the applicant ] in the short - term within a hospital environment to ensure optimal medical and nursing management of both his abdominal wound and the urinary tract foreign bodies and strictures due to scarring , which are capable of causing acute urinary tract obstruction and severe septicaemia . Such optimal management depends very much on [ the applicant ] \u2019s compliance with advice and cares , and provision of appropriate psychiatric and psychological support whilst within any conventional hospital setting . The required duration of stay is not possible to calculate , [ ... ] but the endpoint should be CARDINAL of satisfactory healing of his current injuries and a greatly reduced frequency and magnitude of further self - harm with a commitment to overcoming this pattern of behaviour over the long term . The severity of the abdominal wound and urinary tract injuries , coupled with the instability of his mental health status which will predictably lead to further self - harm , would suggest that this option should be pursued within DATE rather DATE . \u201d", "Dr. PERSON added a postscript to his report :", "\u201c Since completion of this report , I have been informed by ORG that there has been an escalation in [ the applicant \u2019s ] \u2019s pattern of self - harm following news of his birth mother \u2019s death . Given the extreme vulnerability of this individual to significant life - threatening complications with the level of injury at the time of my assessment , it should be apparent that the hospital - based care specified in CARDINAL should be expedited as a matter of urgency . \u201d", "CARDINAL . A letter of DATE by PERSON , a specialist registrar in urology , was appended to Dr. PERSON \u2019s report and stated , inter alia :", "\u201c Although there is currently no evidence of urethral stricture or bladder injury over a period of time , it is almost certain that he will develop a urethral stricture . ... If he continues to abuse his body in this way , it may lead to a poor bladder emptying which in turn can cause renal failure and death .", "While currently none of [ the applicant \u2019s ] \u2019s urological incidents have been a risk to his life , it is only a matter of time until he develops sepsis , a urethral stricture , renal failure or death .", "It has been the opinion of ORG here ... that something more definitive needs to be done for [ the applicant ] \u2019s psychological care . On each occasion that his bladder is cleared of foreign bodies , it is usually DATE or CARDINAL before he is readmitted having inserted something else ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for leave to take judicial review proceedings to obtain an order that he be removed from GPE YOI . He cited the Secretary of ORG ( responsible for GPE YOI ) and ORG as defendants . At this point , the applicant had been hospitalised CARDINAL times in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE Dr. TIME , a consultant forensic psychiatrist , advised ORG that the applicant suffered from a severely abnormal personality and reached a high diagnostic threshold for specific personality disorder types , which suggested that he might reach a threshold for psychopathic disorder classification . Given his background of frequent and severe self - harm , Dr. PERSON concluded that it was appropriate to admit the applicant for a period of in - patient assessment under LAW . He confirmed that a bed would be available at LOC hospital within DATE period to which LAW referred .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG made a hospital order under LAW of the MHA DATE for the applicant \u2019s admission to ORG . The applicant was transferred to that hospital on DATE . He then withdrew his proceedings against the Trust .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG refused leave to apply for judicial review . The court considered the manner in which his claims were expressed to be strikingly unhelpful . However , since he had been transferred to hospital , his representatives confirmed that the purpose of the action was now to seek an order that there be an investigation into what had occurred , including how the relevant agencies could work better , which would serve a real public interest . ORG considered this to be rather an afterthought to the principal claim . The applicant sought damages for a breach of ORG , CARDINAL and DATE of the Convention .", "CARDINAL . ORG clarified that the Secretary of ORG had no power under LAW of the MHA DATE to transfer the applicant from GPE YOI to a hospital because , unlike section CARDINAL , it did not apply to prisoners who suffered from psychopathic disorders .", "CARDINAL . The High Court considered that LAW had not been engaged . While according to Dr. PERSON \u2019s bleak summary , the applicant would undoubtedly put his life at risk if he continued to self - harm in the way that he had , his life was not imminently at risk . Nor was it a case of a \u201c near - death experience \u201d such as a failed suicide attempt .", "CARDINAL . Likewise , there was no arguable breach of LAW by the Secretary of ORG and therefore no duty to hold an inquiry . ORG remarked that the Secretary of ORG had accepted the version of events advanced by the applicant . This , supplemented by the many reports done and the records which could still be produced from GPE YOI and the hospital , meant that there could be no doubt about the facts . There was no suggestion in the documents that the applicant \u2019s injuries had not been promptly and skilfully treated or , indeed , that it was detention at GPE YOI which had caused the applicant to harm himself . Had the applicant wished to complain about his treatment in detention , he could have complained under ORG and onward to ORG , who could have conducted an independent inquiry . The wider \u201c lessons learned \u201d objective of the action fell outside the scope of LAW v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL/CARDINAL ( dec . ) DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE ORG granted leave to appeal limited to the claim that the Secretary of ORG should hold an inquiry . By judgment of DATE ORG accorded leave to apply for judicial review but dismissed the substantive application . The applicant had confirmed to his representatives that he wanted an explanation about his treatment in GPE YOI and that an inquiry would have a wider public benefit . His representatives made a statement to the court that they were concerned about the treatment and conditions experienced by the applicant and other prisoners .", "CARDINAL . As regards the LAW complaint , ORG considered :", "\u201c CARDINAL . This case is not a case of attempted suicide . [ The applicant ] did not attempt suicide . The medical evidence was that his self - harming , if continued , could lead to life - threatening injury or disease . His medical condition , and his actions , can not in my judgment be assimilated to cases of suicide and near suicide . It can not be said that there was a \u2018 real and immediate ORG to [ the applicant \u2019s ] life while he was at GPE . The risk was real but not immediate . \u201d", "CARDINAL . It clarified that serious injury , in the absence of a risk to life , could not give rise to any relevant duty by virtue of LAW . There was , therefore , no necessity under LAW to conduct an inquiry .", "CARDINAL . ORG also found that no Article CARDINAL investigative duty could be imposed on the Secretary of ORG for CARDINAL main reasons . In the first place , it agreed with ORG that there was no evidence of an \u201c arguable breach \u201d or of a \u201c credible assertion \u201d of a breach of LAW Secondly , the exclusion of psychopathic disorders from section DATE , which precluded the applicant \u2019s transfer to hospital under that provision , was not the proper subject of an LAW inquiry . Thirdly , even if there had been an arguable breach of LAW , there could be no investigative duty because all the relevant facts in the case were known .", "CARDINAL . NORP In particular , the only complaint that could be made was that :", "\u201c CARDINAL . ... [ the applicant ] should have been transferred to a psychiatric hospital earlier . But , as I have pointed out , in not doing so , the Secretary of ORG was acting in accordance with Dr Williams\u2019 medical opinion . The action or inaction of the executive based on medical advice of an appropriately qualified doctor , as PERSON was , can not amount to a breach of LAW . Once Dr PERSON had changed his opinion , steps were taken to transfer [ the applicant ] to a hospital , but any delay then was attributable to ORG and the need to meet the requirements of section CARDINAL ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As to whether an inquiry was needed , ORG considered the applicant \u2019s case remarkably similar to the above - cited case of PERSON v. GPE ( cited above ) . The allegations of a breach of LAW could be dealt with by the combination of criminal ( if relevant ) and civil proceedings . Any wider interest inquiry ( including to publicise the alleged lack of appropriate care for persons such as the applicant in a ORG such as GPE ) was a matter for public and political debate which fell outside the scope of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In any event , ORG saw no need for an investigation :", "\u201c In the present case , I see no need for an investigation . The facts relating to [ the applicant ] \u2019s detention in GPE and the reasons why he was only transferred after Dr Williams\u2019 re - assessment are known . [ The applicant \u2019s Counsel ] was pressed to identify what an inquiry might reveal that was not already known . In my judgment , he was unable satisfactorily to do so . The summary of the applicant \u2019s case , set out in the Addendum to his FAC , does not include a formulated allegation of breach beyond the assertion that the Secretary of ORG was in breach of her protective obligation . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In conclusion , the ORG of appeal summarised its findings :", "\u201c DATE . Article CARDINAL was not engaged in this case , where there was no immediate risk to [ the NORP rights inquiry has significant resource implications , a matter of growing concern when the resources of public authorities are increasingly constrained . Good reason for an LAW inquiry must be shown . In the present case , all the relevant facts are known : why [ the applicant ] was kept at GPE and not transferred until after PERSON had re - assessed him and why there was some delay thereafter . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE that court refused leave to appeal .", "CARDINAL .
