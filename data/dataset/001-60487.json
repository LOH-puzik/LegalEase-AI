DATE the applicant was the sole managing director of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) , a company which owned and controlled CARDINAL of the CARDINAL casinos licensed to operate in GPE . ORG was a subsidiary company of ORG ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) of which the applicant was also managing director . Both companies will hereafter be collectively referred to as GPE Clubs .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE a raid took place at the various premises of ORG . The raid was carried out by the police in the presence of officials of ORG for GPE ( \u201c the Gaming Board \u201d ) , a statutory body which regulates and monitors the gaming industry . A large quantity of documents was seized . In DATE ORG lodged objections with the clerk to ORG with regard to ORG 's DATE application for renewal of the licences it held in respect of each of its casinos . ORG also made cancellation applications in respect of the existing licences held by ORG .", "A meeting was held between ORG and the non - executive directors of ORG and their legal advisers on DATE . As a result of that meeting , the applicant and the other executive directors ( with the exception of the finance director ) resigned with effect from DATE , on the understanding that such resignation was involuntary and constituted dismissal by ORG .", "Subsequently an agreement was reached between ORG and ORG , whereby ORG would apply for new licences for the casinos via reconstituted operating companies , to which applications ORG would not object . If the applications were successful and new licences were granted by ORG , ORG would undertake to surrender its existing licences , thereby avoiding the necessity for the applications for cancellation or renewal to be heard .", "ORG issued ORG with certificates of consent , which ORG was statutorily obliged to obtain from ORG as a prerequisite to making an application to ORG for new licences . Objections to the issuing of new licences were made by a rival casino owner . However , these objections were rejected and new licences were granted in DATE , after DATE hearing before ORG . ORG was represented at the hearing and expressed to ORG its support for the application of ORG , explaining the grounds on which ORG itself had granted ORG certificates of consent in the following terms :", "\u201c In determining that it should issue certificates of consent ORG took into consideration , amongst other relevant factors , the degree to which ORG had addressed the ORG 's grave concerns at the matters of complaint referred to above , and in particular had in mind the following :", "Those executive directors of ORG and of [ ORG ] who in the ORG 's view carried the principal responsibility for the matters of complaint ... [ the applicant was named along with CARDINAL others ] have left the company and relinquished their management shares .", "...", "ORG viewed the matters raised in their cancellation applications extremely seriously . However they are satisfied that the practices that were unacceptable have now been eradicated and that those individuals responsible for encouraging or tolerating them have been removed . \u201d", "CARDINAL . In DATE the Chairman of ORG , PERSON , addressed ORG at its DATE luncheon . Her speech referred to ORG and commented :", "\u201c We [ ORG ] satisfied ourselves that the practices we and the Police had regarded as unacceptable had ceased , that persons regarded by ORG as not fit and proper had been removed ... \u201d", "CARDINAL . As a result of this speech , the applicant 's legal advisers entered into correspondence with ORG solicitors , on the basis that the speech was defamatory . ORG alleged that the \u201c persons \u201d referred to were minority shareholders and no reference to the applicant was intended . The applicant did not accept this explanation , but did not institute defamation proceedings .", "CARDINAL . By a letter of CARDINAL DATE , the applicant 's legal advisers received written notice that ORG was considering whether the applicant was a fit and proper person to hold the ORG 's certificate of approval , as required by LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) in order to hold a management position in the gaming industry . By a letter dated DATE , ORG informed the applicant formally that it was \u201c minded to revoke \u201d the applicant 's section CARDINAL certificates and that the applicant would be given the opportunity to state his case against revocation either in writing or orally at an interview before ORG ( \u201c a section CARDINAL hearing \u201d ) .", "The letter detailed the matters which ORG wished to discuss with the applicant and also referred to the particulars of ORG complaints in the application for cancellation of ORG 's licences ( the hearing of which had , in fact , never taken place ) . In these complaints , numbered CARDINAL to BCARDINAL , it was claimed , inter alia , that there had been breaches of section CARDINAL of LAW , in that cheques had been accepted without any expectation that they would be met promptly ( CARDINAL ) ; that the applicant had been involved in granting cheque - cashing facilities to members without proper investigation of their creditworthiness ( BCARDINAL ) ; that cheques had been accepted which exceeded the authors ' cheque - cashing facility ( FAC ) ; that third - party cheques had been accepted in a way which would permit circumvention of the DATE LAW ( BCARDINAL ) ; that NORP players had been assisted in breaching NORP exchange - control regulations ( BCARDINAL ) ; that gifts or hospitality had been made to substantial players in breach of further DATE guidelines ( ORG ) ; and that the method for computing the \u201c cash drop \u201d in casinos produced inaccuracies , and was open to abuse ( BCARDINAL ) . Examples were given .", "CARDINAL . The applicant 's legal advisers objected to ORG presiding the section CARDINAL hearing , suggesting that an independent tribunal be set up as an alternative . The applicant 's principal objection was based on the fact that ORG had already publicly expressed the view ( at the hearing before ORG ) that the applicant was not a fit and proper person to remain an executive director of ORG . As such , the applicant contended , ORG could not be considered an impartial tribunal appropriate to consider the issue of whether the applicant 's section CARDINAL certificates should be revoked .", "CARDINAL . ORG rejected the request for an independent tribunal and the section CARDINAL hearing opened on DATE before a panel of CARDINAL , all members of ORG ( \u201c the Panel \u201d ) . The hearing was conducted in private and lasted for DATE . The applicant was represented by senior counsel . ORG solicitors , a senior ORG official and a representative of ORG accountants also attended the hearing .", "By a letter dated DATE , the applicant was informed that ORG did not consider the applicant to be a fit and proper person to continue to hold the ORG 's certificates of approval and that , accordingly , ORG would revoke his section CARDINAL certificates within DATE of receipt of the letter . This letter detailed the matters which had been of concern to ORG and the complaints that it deemed established against the applicant .", "CARDINAL . The effect of the revocation of the section CARDINAL certificates was that the applicant was unable to obtain employment in any sector of the gaming industry in GPE or in any jurisdiction which had a relationship with the GPE gaming authorities .", "CARDINAL . By an application dated DATE , the applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review of the decision of ORG to revoke his section CARDINAL certificates . The decision was challenged on the grounds that the Panel was biased , or had the appearance of bias , and that its findings were vitiated by errors of law and were irrational .", "CARDINAL . In the course of the judicial review proceedings , a document entitled \u201c LOC to Minutes of ORG of ORG for GPE \u201d , dated DATE , was produced , attached to an affidavit sworn by the Chairman of ORG . This document recorded that ORG had decided at its meeting on DATE that it had", "\u201c sufficient evidence before it to conclude that [ the applicant ] ... was not a fit and proper person to be a director of a casino company \u201d .", "CARDINAL . All the members of the ORG before which the section CARDINAL hearing took place had been present at the ORG meeting and were parties to this decision , which had been taken prior to the hearing itself .", "CARDINAL . The application for judicial review was dismissed on DATE by Mr Justice PERSON after a hearing lasting DATE . He delivered CARDINAL separate judgments in respect of the applicant 's appeal . The first judgment dealt with the scope of the phrase \u201c a fit and proper person \u201d in Schedule CARDINAL of the DATE Act . The second judgment considered the applicant 's claim that he had a \u201c legitimate expectation \u201d that ORG would be precluded from taking account of any breaches of its guidelines unless the breaches were unlawful . The third judgment , which dealt with \u201c ORG \u201d challenges and allegations of bias , ran to CARDINAL pages . Mr Justice PERSON stated that the scope of the judicial review was such that he was not concerned to review findings of fact , as for an appeal , but rather to assess whether the findings of the Panel disclosed illegality , irrationality ( \u201c PERSON unreasonableness \u201d ) or procedural impropriety .", "CARDINAL . On pages CARDINAL of the third judgment , Mr Justice PERSON dealt with the applicant 's \u201c PERSON \u201d challenges to the findings in respect of the various complaints made of him .", "CARDINAL . By way of example , it was accepted that cheques drawn by CARDINAL player , a Mr S. , on a NORP and a NORP bank were not cleared within DATE after payment into a NORP bank , as would be the normal course of events . Rather , the average time for clearance was DATE . ORG found that this practice breached section CARDINAL of LAW , which prohibits credit betting save when a cheque is exchanged for tokens . The applicant alleged that the cheques he accepted were not shams , as none of the NORP cheques was ever dishonoured . The judge found that the ORG 's conclusion \u2013 that what took place amounted to an agreement between Mr S. and ORG , such that LAW was breached DATE was a conclusion it was entitled to reach .", "CARDINAL . CARDINAL pages of the third judgment were devoted to the issue of bias . Mr Justice PERSON described the test of bias under LANGUAGE law in the following terms ( pp . CARDINAL of the judgment ) :", "\u201c [ Counsel for the applicant ] submits that the decision to revoke the applicant 's section CARDINAL certificates of approval should be quashed because the Panel was biased . The grounds on which leave to move for judicial review were granted asserted firstly that the ORG could not and did not approach its decision with objectivity and impartiality . Secondly , it was asserted that whether or not there was actual bias the applicant reasonably believed there was and that the ORG should have had regard to the appearance of bias which had been created by its actions ...", "There was no disagreement between the parties as to the approach the court should adopt when bias is alleged . It is a CARDINAL - stage test . The applicant has first to show from the evidence that there is an appearance of bias ( NORP v. PERSON , ex parte PERSON [ DATE ] CARDINAL All England Law Reports CARDINAL ) . [ Counsel for ORG ] properly and realistically accepts that in the light of the available evidence the applicant has surmounted this hurdle . Having done so , he has to go on to show that on a proper examination by the court of the evidence before it there is demonstrated a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of bias ... [ The analysis in that case of ] the decision of ORG in NORP v. PERSON [ DATE ] Appeal Cases CARDINAL ... illuminates my task in relation to this second stage .", "' ( CARDINAL ) Any court seised of a challenge on the ground of apparent bias must ascertain the relevant circumstances and consider all the evidence for itself so as to reach its own conclusion on the facts .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) In reaching its conclusion the court \u201c personifies the reasonable man \u201d .", "( CARDINAL ) The question on which the court must reach its own factual conclusion is this : is there a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of bias ? By \u201c real \u201d is meant not without substance . A real danger clearly involves more than a minimal risk , less than a probability . CARDINAL could , I think , as well speak of a real risk or a real possibility .", "( CARDINAL ) Injustice will have occurred as a result of bias if \u201c the decision - maker unfairly regarded with disfavour the case of a party to the issue under consideration by him \u201d . I take \u201c unfairly regarded with disfavour \u201d to mean \u201c was pre - disposed or prejudiced against CARDINAL party 's case for reasons unconnected with the merits of the issue \u201d .", "( CARDINAL ) A decision - maker may have unfairly regarded with disfavour CARDINAL party 's case either consciously or unconsciously . Where , as here , the applicants expressly disavow any suggestion of actual bias , it seems to me that the court must necessarily be asking itself whether there is a real danger that the decision - maker was unconsciously biased .", "( CARDINAL ) ... the court is [ not ] concerned strictly with the appearance of bias but rather with establishing the possibility that there was actual although unconscious bias .", "...", "( CARDINAL ) It is not necessary for the applicant to demonstrate a real possibility that the ... decision would have been different but for the bias ; what must be established is the real danger of bias having affected the decision in the sense of having caused the decision - maker , albeit unconsciously , to weigh the competing contentions , and so decide the merits , unfairly . ' \u201d", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON then applied the test of bias which he had set out to the facts of the case , and concluded that , on the evidence before him , he could not say that the applicant had established that there was a real danger of injustice having occurred as a result of bias . He concluded that there was no unconscious bias on the part of any of the ORG members .", "CARDINAL . Mr Justice PERSON stated further that if , contrary to his finding , there was unconscious bias on the part of the Panel , the \u201c doctrine of necessity \u201d fell to be considered . He said :", "\u201c When a body is charged by statute with the power or duty , which can not be delegated , to make a decision in circumstances in which a question of bias arises because :", "( i ) in pursuance of that statutory power or duty an initial view has been formed upon a matter affecting the interests of someone in respect of whom the body in the exercise of its statutory power or duty has thereafter to make a decision , or final decision , after receiving and considering representations which he is entitled to make or", "( ii ) in the exercise of a statutory power or duty to make a decision a conflict arises between the interests of another or others which have to be taken into account and the body 's own interests :", "the decision will not be liable to be impugned on account of bias provided that :", "( i ) if only some of those charged with the power or duty to decide are potentially affected by bias such of them as can lawfully withdraw from the decision - making do so , and", "( ii ) those of the decision - makers who are potentially affected by bias but can not lawfully withdraw use their best endeavours to avoid the effect of bias and , consistently with the purpose for which its decision has to be made , the body takes what reasonable steps are open to it to minimise the risk of bias affecting them ... \u201d", "Mr Justice PERSON indicated that if , contrary to his finding , there was unconscious bias on the part of the Panel , the doctrine of necessity would apply , and the decision of the Panel would stand . Counsel for the applicant submitted before PERSON Justice PERSON that the Board had failed to take the reasonable step of appointing an independent body to hear evidence and report to the Panel . Mr Justice PERSON rejected the submission , on the grounds that no useful reference could have been made to an independent tribunal which did not involve an impermissible delegation .", "CARDINAL . In respect of all other allegations brought by the applicant , Mr Justice PERSON concluded that the applicant had failed to establish that the ORG 's decision was irrational or unreasonable or to make out any sufficient ground for judicial review . Mr Justice PERSON noted that , by trying to frame his allegations in terms of \u201c PERSON unreasonableness \u201d , the applicant was in fact making an impermissible attempt to re - argue the case as though on appeal in order to have the factual merits of the case re - examined .", "CARDINAL . ORG , after an oral hearing on DATE , refused an application for leave to appeal from Mr Justice PERSON 's decision . Lord Justice PERSON ( with whom Lord Justice PERSON agreed ) held , on the \u201c doctrine of necessity , \u201d as follows :", "\u201c I am prepared to assume in favour of [ the applicant ] that he would have an arguable case sufficient to justify leave to appeal , that there was a real risk that the decision of the tribunal had been actuated by bias even though they were not in fact biased against him . That would leave the question of how the doctrine of necessity would be applied to the facts of the case .", "[ Counsel for the applicant ] did not seek to suggest that the propositions of law which [ Mr Justice PERSON ] enunciated , and which I have quoted , were not accurately formulated by him , but he sought to challenge the final conclusion , to which I have just referred , that there could have been [ no ] useful reference to an independent tribunal which did not involve an impermissible delegation . The question of bias , therefore , depends on the very limited point of whether it is arguable that [ Mr Justice PERSON ] was wrong in that respect . I am bound to say that , on that limited point , I think he was manifestly right . The decision for ORG was , at DATE , whether or not Mr PERSON was a fit and proper person . That could not be delegated to an independent panel and if they were actuated by bias , apparent or real , then the decision would still have to be made by them . Therefore , on the doctrine of necessity , which is accepted , there could have been no meaningful independent panel and the decision would stand because the decision has to be made by ORG and could not be delegated to the independent tribunal . It seems to me that there is no arguable point , susceptible on this part of the case , which would justify giving leave to appeal . \u201d", "CARDINAL . ORG for GPE ( \u201c the Gaming Board \u201d ) is a statutory body , established under LAW DATE ( \u201c the DATE LAW ) to regulate and monitor the gaming industry . In order for any company to obtain the requisite gaming licence for LOC , a certificate must first be issued by ORG consenting to the company applying for such a licence ( Schedule CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL ) , of the DATE Act ) .", "CARDINAL . Under section CARDINAL of the DATE Act ORG issues certificates to individuals in order that they be permitted to hold certain positions in the gaming industry . A certificate , once issued , continues to be in force unless and until it is revoked . ORG may revoke the certificate at any time if it appears to ORG that the person to whom it relates is not a fit and proper person to perform the specified function or act in the specified capacity ( Schedule CARDINAL , paragraph CARDINAL , of the DATE Act ) . DATE written notice of the revocation must be given to the certificate holder . ORG has developed a procedure whereby an individual is sent a letter in which the ORG states that it is minded to revoke his certificate .
