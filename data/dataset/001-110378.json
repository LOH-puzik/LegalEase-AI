The applicants were born in DATE and DATE , respectively , and are married to each other .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE and DATE , respectively , the applicants were granted disability pensions by ORG Republi\u010dki fond za penzijsko i invalidsko osiguranje zaposlenih ; hereinafter \u201c the SPDIF \u201d ) \u2013 Branch Office in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Having lived in GPE for DATE , in DATE they moved to ORG , GPE proper ( i.e. the territory of GPE excluding GPE ) , as documented in their personal identity cards issued by the respondent ORG \u2019s ORG ( ORG unutra\u0161njih poslova ) .", "CARDINAL . The first and second applicants regularly received their pensions until DATE and DATE , respectively , when the DATE payments stopped without any explanation having been provided by the ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants sought that the payment of their pensions be resumed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and CARDINAL DATE , the ORG adopted formal decisions to suspend payment of the ORG pensions as of DATE and DATE , retroactively . In so doing , it noted that GPE was now under international administration which was why the pensions could no longer be paid .", "CARDINAL . NORP By CARDINAL separate judgments of DATE ORG ( Okru\u017eni sud ) in ORG annulled ( poni\u0161tio ) the impugned decisions , noting , inter alia , that they did not refer to the relevant domestic law or provide a satisfactory explanation as to why the payment of the ORG pensions should be suspended . In respect of the latter , ORG effectively re - stated parts of ORG Opinion of DATE , but did not formally cite it ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG thereafter filed CARDINAL separate appeals on points of law ( dva zasebna zahteva za vanredno preispitivanje presude ) in respect of ORG rulings of DATE . In its appeal as regards the second applicant the ORG , inter alia , stated that , since the respondent ORG has been unable to collect any pension insurance contributions in GPE as of DATE , persons who had already been granted ORG pensions in this territory could not continue receiving them . In support of this position the ORG cited ORG ( ORG socijalna pitanja ) of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) and noted that it considered this opinion binding .", "CARDINAL . On DATE and DATE ORG ( PERSON ) rejected the said appeals on points of law . Whilst the appeal as regards the second applicant was rejected as incomplete , the same remedy concerning the first applicant was rejected on its merits . In the latter case , ORG confirmed the impugned decision of ORG .", "CARDINAL . By means of CARDINAL separate decisions of DATE the ORG suspended the proceedings instituted on the basis of the applicants\u2019 requests for the resumption of payment of their pensions until such time , as stated in the operative provisions , when the entire issue shall be resolved between the NORP authorities and the international administration in GPE . The PERSON decisions had an appearance of printed templates where merely the applicants\u2019 names , their place of residence and case identification data were entered by hand .", "CARDINAL . The applicants maintain that they filed administrative appeals against these decisions . The Government contests this claim . The applicants have provided the ORG with copies of postal certificates indicating that correspondence of some sort had been sent to the ORG , as well as ORG ( Ministarstvo rada , zapo\u0161ljavanja i socijalne politike ) , but have not supplied the ORG with copies of the appeals in question .", "CARDINAL . Without formally deciding to resume the stayed proceedings , on DATE the ORG requested ( zaklju\u010dkom o obezbe\u0111enju dokaza ) the applicants to provide them with the decisions granting their pensions . It would appear that the applicants complied with this request . They have also provided this ORG with copies of the decisions in question .", "CARDINAL . There seem to have been no procedural developments thereafter .", "CARDINAL . In DATE GPE was placed under international administration .", "CARDINAL . The applicants submitted that all ethnically NORP pensioners from GPE had continued receiving their pensions normally , as have many NORP , GPE , NORP and NORP . They further contended that they also could have solved their pension problem had they been willing to \u201c bribe those in charge \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , in response to a prior query , informed GPE \u2019s ORG that the pension system in GPE was based on the concept of \u201c ongoing financing \u201d . Specifically , pensions were secured through current pension insurance contributions . It followed that since the NORP authorities have been unable to collect any such contributions in GPE as of DATE , persons who had already been granted ORG pensions in GPE also could not expect , for the time being , to continue receiving them . Further , the ORG noted the adoption of Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL on pensions in GPE , providing for a separate pension system for persons living in the territory ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In DATE , following the destruction of their house , the applicants moved from ORG to ORG located in GPE proper .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG certified , inter alia , that the first applicant \u2019s maiden family name had been PERSON .", "CARDINAL . Both applicants are suffering from serious heart - related conditions , and are living under very difficult financial circumstances . They maintain , however , that they have never applied for pensions in GPE .", "CARDINAL . Article ORG provides , inter alia , that administrative proceedings before the ORG may be reopened , at the request of the insured person or ex proprio motu , if new relevant facts or evidence become known or if in the original proceedings such facts or evidence were not presented .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that one \u2019s pension and disability rights shall be terminated if it transpires that one no longer meets the original statutory requirements . However , should an entitled pensioner secure an additional pension before another pension and disability insurance fund established by CARDINAL of the other GPE formed in the territory of the former GPE , his or her pension paid by the ORG , unless stipulated otherwise by an international agreement , shall be reassessed ( recalculated ) based on the pensionable employment period ( penzijski sta\u017e ) already taken into account by the former .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides , inter alia , that the ORG \u2019s assets consist of : pension and disability insurance contributions ; its own property ; earmarked sums in the States\u2019 budget ; subsidies and donations , return on various investments ; and a certain portion of the funds obtained through the privatisation of ORG - owned and socially - owned capital .", "CARDINAL . These decisions set out details concerning the procedural competence of various branches of the ORG as regards the entitlements of insured persons from GPE .", "CARDINAL . These Opinions state , inter alia , that the pension system in GPE is based on the concept of \u201c ongoing financing \u201d . Specifically , pensions are secured through current pension insurance contributions . Since the NORP authorities have been unable to collect any such contributions in GPE as of DATE , persons who have been granted ORG pensions in GPE also can not expect , for the time being , to continue receiving them . Further , it is noted that Regulation CARDINAL/CARDINAL on pensions in GPE , adopted by ORG , provides for a separate pension system for persons living in the territory , which in itself amounts to a serious issue ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( ORG ) has consistently held that Opinions and ORG issued by various Government ministries do not amount to legislation ( ne predstavljaju propis ili op\u0161ti pravni akt ) , and are instead merely meant to facilitate the implementation thereof ( see , for example , ORG of DATE and IUo-CARDINAL/CARDINAL of CARDINAL DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . NORP In response to the situation in GPE , this ORG states , inter alia , that one \u2019s recognised right to a pension may only be restricted on the basis of LAW ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) . In view of LAW , one \u2019s recognised pension rights can not either depend on whether or not current pension insurance contributions can be collected in a given territory ( see paragraph CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL . The ORG further explains that administrative proceedings ( upravni postupak ) and , if needed , judicial review proceedings ( upravni spor ) would be the appropriate avenue to challenge any restriction of one \u2019s pension rights .", "CARDINAL . Lastly , the ORG notes that the civil courts shall , in this context , only be competent to adjudicate cases involving claims of malfeasance ( nezakonit i nepravilan rad ) on the part of the ORG .", "CARDINAL . Articles DATE and CARDINAL provide , inter alia , that judicial review proceedings may be brought against an administrative decision issued by a competent ORG body or public authority .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that should a second instance administrative body fail to decide on an appeal filed DATE , and should it again fail to do so in DATE , upon receipt of the claimant \u2019s repeated request to this effect , the latter may directly institute a judicial review suit , i.e. as if his or her appeal had been rejected .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL provides that the competent court may not only quash the impugned administrative act but may also rule on the merits of the plaintiff \u2019s claim , should the facts of the case and the very nature of the dispute in question allow for this particular course of action .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL provides that statutory interest shall be paid as of the date of maturity of a recognised monetary claim in NORP dinars until the date of its settlement .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL states that such interest shall be calculated on the basis of the official consumer price index plus another PERCENT DATE .", "CARDINAL . These regulations provide for a separate pension system whereby , inter alia , all persons \u201c habitually residing \u201d in GPE , aged DATE or above , shall have the right to a \u201c basic pension \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adopted this LAW which , essentially , endorsed the pension system as set up by the two Regulations cited above but transferred the functional competencies from ORG in GPE to the Kosovan authorities ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P1"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P1-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": ["P1-1-1"], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
