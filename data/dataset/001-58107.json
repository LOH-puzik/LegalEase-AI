It results from the principle of separation of powers ... that the legislature is not precluded from abolishing by means of new legal rules \u2013 through extinguishment \u2013 rights acquired under legal rules that were in force in the past , even if those rights have been recognised by final court decisions . This , however , is not the case with new rules which are not of general application and which consequently infringe the principle of equality ( LAW ) or the right of property ( LAW ) ; in such circumstances the courts may not give effect to such rules ...
