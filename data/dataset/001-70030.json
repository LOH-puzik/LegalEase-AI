{"ITEMID": "001-70030", "LANGUAGEISOCODE": "ENG", "RESPONDENT": "FIN", "BRANCH": "ADMISSIBILITY", "DATE": 2005, "DOCNAME": "AARNIOSALO AND OTHERS v. FINLAND", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["The applicants are Ms A. GPE , Mr P. GPE , Ms H.A. Liljeroos , Ms H.M. Liljeroos , Mr NORP Liljeroos , Ms S. PERSON , PERSON PERSON , Mr R.T.J. Nurminen and Mr R.R.K. PERSON . They are NORP nationals , born in DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE , DATE and DATE , respectively , and living in LOC in GPE . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "In the DATE \u2019s construction work was started in order to build a road to LOC , which has no connection to the mainland . The part of the road ( the Kattilaniemi road ) which is situated on the mainland , and in the construction of which the applicants also participated , was finished at DATE .", "On DATE , ORG ( vesioikeus , vattenr\u00e4tt ) of LOC entitled the applicants to build a bridge from ORG to a place called GPE on LOC as it was found to be the most advantageous place to build the road with a view to connecting with the network of public roads .", "ORG ( l\u00e4\u00e4ninhallitus , l\u00e4nsstyrelsen ) of LOC , represented by PERSON , appealed against ORG decision to ORG ( vesiylioikeus , vatten\u00f6verdomstolen ) which , on DATE , upheld ORG decision .", "On DATE , the proceedings concerning the construction of the private road to PERSON concluded and established the right to the road of those who owned property in the area in which the road was to be built , excluding the owners of such property which was used only for leisure activities and who had objected to the road plan . CARDINAL private persons as well as ORG appealed against the decision in the road construction proceedings to ORG ( maaoikeus , jorddomstolen ) , claiming , inter alia , that the road would , if built as planned , destroy conservable nature values in the area .", "ORG decided , in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , not to examine the appeals lodged by ORG and CARDINAL of the private individuals as it found that they were not parties to the road construction proceedings in question . The rest of the appeals were rejected as ORG found , inter alia , that there was an important public interest to build a connecting road from the island to the mainland . Some of the private individuals whose appeals had been rejected by ORG applied to ORG ( korkein oikeus , h\u00f6gsta domstolen ) for leave to appeal . ORG granted them leave to appeal on DATE . On DATE , ORG rejected the relevant appeals and upheld ORG decision .", "Meanwhile , on DATE , to prevent the enforcement of the ORG decision , ORG had issued an interim order prohibiting works in the area , for DATE , for the purpose of protecting the habitat of the white - backed woodpecker . ORG decision was signed by , inter alia , PERSON who had represented ORG in the appeal proceedings against ORG decision . The road construction work which had already started was thus discontinued .", "CARDINAL of the applicants and the administrative committee for the maintenance of forest roads in NORP appealed against the order to ORG on the grounds that an error had allegedly taken place in the hearing of the parties and that the construction of the road would not endanger the protection of the white - backed woodpecker . On DATE , ORG found that no error had taken place in the hearing of the parties , noting that trees had already been cut down . Insofar as the decision depended on the assessment of the appropriateness of the decision , it transferred the issue to ORG .", "Following the transfer , ORG ( ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6ministeri\u00f6 , milj\u00f6ministeriet ) found , on DATE , that there was no reason to change the decision of ORG . The ORG \u2019s decision was appealed to ORG , inter alia on grounds that the Minister for Environment , PERSON , was biased as she had already participated in the decision - making before ORG in so far as the prohibition was concerned . On DATE , ORG rejected the appeal . The applicants\u2019 request to reopen the proceedings was refused by ORG on DATE .", "As the owner of the PERSON estate had refused to sell her real estate to the ORG , ORG granted , on DATE , permission for the expropriation of the PERSON estate with a view to protecting the white - backed woodpecker even though the municipality of GPE had , in its statement of DATE , objected to the expropriation , taking the view that the prohibition against building the NORP road would render the relevant part of the municipality more and more isolated and deserted as living there would become too difficult and unsafe . According to ORG , the expropriation would violate the general sense of justice if the interests of a species of a bird were preferred to those of the inhabitants of the municipality . It was also noted in the statement that ORG had already decided to allow the road to be constructed and that a contrary decision would be surprising and dubious .", "The applicants appealed to ORG which , on DATE , dismissed the ORG appeal and upheld the expropriation . It held that the land was part of a larger area which was , due to its natural features , a suitable habitat for the white - backed woodpecker and that observations of the species had been made there . Thus the area was , with respect to the protection of the white - backed woodpecker , of such importance that it could be defined as a special protection area within the meaning of LAW , subsection CARDINAL of the DATE LAW . On DATE , the applicants asked for the annulment of this decision . The matter is pending .", "By letter dated DATE , the administrative committee of PERSON requested ORG to lift the expropriation insofar as the right to the road was concerned . By reply dated DATE , ORG stated that it was impossible to establish a right to a road in the area , as it was so small that that no measures changing the nature of the forest could be allowed without endangering the existence of the bird which had been sighted in the area since DATE .", "The applicants\u2019 request to reopen the proceedings was refused by ORG on DATE .", "The expropriation proceedings concerning the PERSON estate were completed on DATE . The area concerned QUANTITY and was delimited so that , as a biotope , it covered the habitat of the white - backed woodpecker only . The compensation paid to ORG amounted to ORG CARDINAL,CARDINAL with costs and expenses of ORG .", "On DATE , the executors of the expropriation of the ORG estate decided , after a vote , to expropriate the right to the road attached to the estate in accordance with the Ministry decision and then to establish a new right to a road for the same area to which the earlier right to a road was attached . In his dissenting opinion , the engineer considered that a right to the road could not be established for the same area as there was an alternative .", "On DATE , ORG lodged an appeal with ORG ( acting as ORG ) , which on DATE upheld the decision of the executors . On DATE , ORG suspended the execution of the decision of ORG . On DATE ORG reversed the judgment of ORG and returned the matter to the executors stating that the right to a road could not be re - established on an area which under a decision of ORG had been expropriated . The executors were to take up the matter without delay in order to establish another route . On DATE , the applicants appealed for the annulment of ORG judgment . The matter is pending .", "Meanwhile , the inhabitants of LOC continued to live on their island without any connection to the mainland during time when there was no open water or the ice was too thin to build an ice - road from the island to the mainland . Such a period could last for DATE each DATE and DATE . In DATE , when the water areas were not frozen , boats were used , for example , for delivering the DATE mail and groceries as well as the medication needed by the elderly islanders . There was no medical care nor fire and rescue service available to the islanders . The closest shop was CARDINAL ( CARDINAL ) kilometres away .", "The applicants referred to a number of incidents as illustrating the risk to human life arising from the lack of proper connection to the mainland . A mailman was drowned in the lake when delivering the mail to LOC and a father , forced to leave the island by foot to get medicine for his sick child , was also drowned in the lake as the ice was too thin to carry him . On DATE , a local cabdriver risked his life by driving his cab to the island to fetch an islander to the hospital even though the ice was thin at the time . Allegedly , the islander in question would have died in a matter of hours if he had not been taken to hospital in time . It has also happened that a fire brigade was forced to watch from the other side of the lake when a barn was burned down by lightning as they could not reach the island with their equipment .", "On DATE a question concerning the justification of the prohibition in terms of the cost of human lives was put in the ORG by a Member of ORG , Mr PERSON . The question was answered by ORG at the time , Ms S.Hassi , on DATE . She referred to the decisions given by ORG and found that the road could and should be constructed to the island but through another estate than the PERSON estate . She also noted that the loss to the islanders would be compensated for in accordance with LAW ( lunastuslaki , inl\u00f6sningslag ) . PERSON and another Member of ORG , Mr PERSON , repeated the question in ORG on DATE , requesting that the Minister for Environment would herself visit the island . The question has been left unanswered . The applicants also sent an invitation to the Minister for Environment to visit the island .", "The applicants in addition twice approached the Chancellor of ORG , who on DATE and DATE rendered decisions rejecting their complaints ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
