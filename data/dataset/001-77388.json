A further application for release made on DATE was likewise denied by the court , which noted that it had already ruled on such an application DATE and there had been no change in the circumstances since then . It also stated that the applicant 's arguments concerning the lack of evidence against him went to the merits of the criminal case , not to the issue whether or not he should be released .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was convicted and sentenced to a prison term . That conviction and sentence were quashed on DATE ( see paragraphs CARDINAL and CARDINAL above ) .", "CARDINAL .

It appears from the documents in the case file that the applicant did so DATE and DATE . After that his pretrial detention on the murder charges continued .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG denied an application for release by the applicant . It reasoned that in view of the seriousness of the charges against him pre - trial detention was mandatory by virtue of LAW of DATE ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) .

The applicant also submitted a number of applications for release to the competent court . He filed such applications on DATE and DATE , and on DATE , DATE and DATE . He advanced various arguments regarding the weak case against him , the lack of a risk of fleeing and his weakening health . Most of the applications were dismissed with reference to LAW ORG . Thus , in a decision of CARDINAL DATE ORG stated the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional offence and his detention was accordingly mandatory under LAW ORG . There were no grounds to apply the exception provided for by paragraph CARDINAL of that Article , as a hearing had been listed in the trial against him , whereas his position with regard to the charges revealed a genuine risk that he might abscond or impede the course of justice .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ordered the applicant 's release on bail , holding that after DATE of detention and several rounds of investigation there was no risk of him jeopardising the investigation . There was furthermore no indication that he could flee or reoffend . The court also said that the length of the applicant 's detention had exceeded a \u201c reasonable time \u201d within the meaning of the Convention . It set the bail at CARDINAL old NORP levs ( ORG ) , without providing reasons as to the amount . Its order was not subject to appeal ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL .

Following an unsuccessful attempt to have it reduced by the court , he posted bail and was released on DATE .", "CARDINAL . The applicant spent his time in custody ( DATE ) on the premises of ORG and in FAC .

At the relevant time , the cells of ORG detention facility had central heating and were DATE save for CARDINAL \u2013 equipped with an en suite toilet . Natural light came through glass tiles secured by metal bars . According to the applicant , the influx of natural light was limited . The detainees slept on plank beds . The applicant averred that at times he had been detained together with CARDINAL other persons in a cell measuring QUANTITY . According to him , the ventilation system in the cell only worked for TIME a day . He also stated that there was no openair exercise area on the LOC . He was accordingly not allowed to take walks .

According to the Government , the LOC of ORG detention facility were relatively new , built in DATE , offered conditions better than those of ORG detention facilities in other towns , and were in line with the minimum NORP standards . The Government did not comment on the number of inmates kept in the applicant 's cell .", "CARDINAL . The applicant submitted that in FAC he was kept in a cell measuring QUANTITY , which he shared at times with CARDINAL other inmates . According to him , during TIME they had to relieve themselves in a bucket kept in the cell . In DATE warm water for bathing was available once DATE , whereas later , in DATE , a warm shower was possible only once a month with the result that he often had to take showers with cold water , which had a negative impact on his health . He was allowed to take walks for TIME a day .", "CARDINAL . The Government did not comment on the conditions in FAC .", "CARDINAL . During his time in custody the applicant was examined by a doctor on unspecified dates , apparently each time he was transferred from FAC to ORG detention facility , and was found to be physically healthy . However , in DATE he was diagnosed with tuberculosis , for which he was treated in hospital DATE and DATE . Apparently he continued to receive medication for his illness after he was released from hospital . Reports on the applicant 's mental health noted that he suffered from depression .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant issued a civil action against ORG and ORG in GPE . In his statement of claim he described the allegedly excessive length of the criminal proceedings against him and of his detention and pointed to the attendant negative consequences , such as a smear campaign against him in the press , a worsening of his health , the retention of the bail amount and a prohibition to leave the country . He alleged that this breached his rights under LAW , his right under LAW to a trial within a reasonable time , and his right under LAW to respect for his private life . He claimed CARDINAL new NORP levs ( ORG ) in damages . He also requested the court to order the defendants to return the bail amount and allow him to leave the country .", "CARDINAL . Following instructions by the court to specify his request for relief , in CARDINAL additional memorials the applicant indicated that he requested ORG CARDINAL for the breach of his right to a trial within a reasonable time , BGN CARDINAL for the injury to his reputation resulting from the impression , stemming from the length of the proceedings , that he was guilty of the offence alleged against him , and BGN CARDINAL for the impossibility to leave the country during the pendency of the proceedings . He also stated that his claim was under section CARDINAL of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) .", "CARDINAL . In a judgment of DATE ORG dismissed the applicant 's action , holding that the defendants , being part of the judicial branch , did not carry out \u201c administrative action \u201d within the meaning of LAW in performing their duties relating to the processing of the criminal case against the applicant . They could hence not be found liable for a breach of that provision . On the other hand , the applicant did not plead a breach of LAW CARDINAL of the LAW and there was no indication that at that point in time the facts alleged by him fell within its purview . Noting that the applicant had been exempted from paying the court fee up front , the court , acting in pursuance of section ORG ) of ORG of DATE ( see paragraph CARDINAL below ) , ordered him to pay BGN CARDINAL in fees .", "CARDINAL . Upon the appeal of the applicant , on DATE ORG affirmed with almost identical reasoning .", "CARDINAL . The applicant appealed on points of law to ORG . In a final judgment of DATE that court fully quashed the lower courts ' judgments and awarded the applicant ORG CARDINAL ( CARDINAL,CARDINAL.CARDINAL MONEY ( ORG ) ) , plus interest as from DATE , the date of the filing of the action . It also ordered the defendants to pay the applicant 's legal costs , amounting to ORG CARDINAL ( EUR CARDINAL ) . The court described in some detail the unfolding of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and his pre - trial detention , and found that the applicant 's reliance on the provisions of the ORG was wellfounded . It stated that the length of the pre - trial detention had breached the law . It also found that at the material time and until DATE NORP law did not set any timelimits for finishing the pre - trial phase of criminal proceedings . The provision that controlled this was therefore LAW , which was part of domestic law . The period DATE throughout which the criminal charges against the applicant had not been determined and during which the applicant could not use any mechanism to speed up the proceedings \u2013 was significant and exceeded the reasonable time for examining the case . In such situations , where national law did not provide a possibility to vindicate infringed rights , they could be vindicated under international treaties which had been ratified by GPE and had become part of its domestic law . For instance , LAW , thus applicable , required an effective remedy against any alleged violation of that Convention . The inaction of the investigation and the prosecution authorities and the courts had infringed the applicant 's right to a trial within a reasonable time and had caused him nonpecuniary damage . Taking into account that the applicant had sustained non - pecuniary damage on account of a pre - trial detention exceeding the time - limit provided by law and the failure to bring the criminal proceedings against him to an end DATE , and ruling in equity , the court considered that the damage could be made good by an award of ORG CARDINAL . It did not order the applicant to pay any court fees or costs for the remainder of his claim .", "CARDINAL .
