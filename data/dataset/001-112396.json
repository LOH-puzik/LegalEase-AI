NORP The applicant , PERSON , is an NORP national , who was born in DATE and lives in the GPE . The President decided not to disclose the applicant \u2019s identity to the public ( Rule CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL ) . He is represented before the ORG by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . ORG ( \u201c the Government \u201d ) are represented by their Deputy Agent , PERSON , of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant together with his spouse and their CARDINAL children , the latter born DATE , applied for asylum in the GPE . On unspecified dates , the applicant \u2019s spouse and children were granted asylum in the GPE . On DATE , a fourth child was born to the applicant and his wife .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Minister for Immigration and Integration ( Minister PERSON ) , rejected the applicant \u2019s asylum request by holding LAW DATE LAW relating to ORG ( \u201c the DATE LAW \u201d ) against him . The Minister further decided , although the decision entailed that the applicant was no longer lawfully staying in the GPE and obliged to leave the country , that for the time being the applicant would not be expelled to GPE as it could not be excluded that , if returned to GPE , he would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG ( rechtbank ) of GPE . In its judgment of DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE accepted the appeal , quashed the Minister \u2019s decision of DATE and ordered the Minister to take a fresh decision . Although it agreed with the Minister \u2019s decision and pertaining reasoning to hold LAW against the applicant , it also found \u2013 on the basis of rulings given on DATE and DATE by ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG ( PERSON ) and noting that the Minister had acknowledged that in GPE the applicant would be exposed to a risk of treatment proscribed by LAW that the Minister should also have examined whether the applicant had established that there was a sustained obstacle based on LAW for his expulsion to GPE . Consequently , the Minister \u2019s examination had been incomplete .", "CARDINAL . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG was rejected on DATE . It upheld the impugned judgment of CARDINAL DATE . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s spouse and their children were granted GPE citizenship .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the Deputy Minister of Justice ( Staatssecretaris van Justitie ) DATE the successor to the Minister for Immigration and Integration \u2013 took a fresh decision on the applicant \u2019s asylum request . The Deputy Minister again decided to hold LAW against the applicant . As regards LAW , the Deputy Minister accepted that the applicant would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited in that provision if , given the current situation there , he were to be removed to GPE . However , this did not automatically imply that on this basis , the applicant should be granted a residence title as this would be contrary to LAW ) . This meant in the applicant \u2019s case that he was not eligible for admission to the GPE whilst no recourse would be had to the power to remove him to GPE . As regards the question whether the LAW obstacle for his removal was of a sustained nature , the Deputy Minister held that the term \u201c sustained \u201d was to be interpreted as entailing a situation in which the alien concerned could not for DATE be removed for reasons based on LAW without there being any prospects of a change in that situation within a not too long delay . If that were the case , and if resettlement in a third country \u2013 despite sufficient efforts to comply with the obligation to leave the GPE DATE was not possible and , in addition , the alien found him / herself in an exceptional situation in the GPE , there would be reason for the Deputy Minister to consider whether a continued withholding of a residence title was disproportionate . Noting that , at least until that moment , the applicant had been allowed to stay in the GPE , the Deputy Minister concluded that the applicant not yet found himself in a situation in which , for a great number of DATE , he could not be removed from the GPE for reasons based on LAW . In addition , the Deputy Minister decided to impose an exclusion order ( ongewenstverklaring ) on the applicant . As to the applicant \u2019s reliance on his right to respect for his family life within the meaning of LAW in the GPE with his spouse and their CARDINAL children , the Deputy Minister found that the exclusion order entailed an interference with the applicant \u2019s rights under this provision but that the general interest outweighed the applicant \u2019s personal interests . In this context the Deputy Minister considered , inter alia , that there was an objective obstacle standing in the way of family life being enjoyed in GPE , but that no objective obstacles had appeared for the enjoyment of the applicant \u2019s family life in a third country and that this was not altered by the fact that the applicant \u2019s spouse and children had become GPE nationals .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection ( bezwaar ) with the Deputy Minister against the decision to impose an exclusion order . As this order is immediately enforceable and the objection not having suspensive effect , the applicant also filed a request with ORG of GPE for the issuance of a provisional measure , i.e. an injunction on his expulsion pending the objection proceedings . On DATE , the applicant also filed an appeal with ORG of The GPE against the decision to reject his asylum request .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the provisional - measures judge ( voorzieningenrechter ) of ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE granted the applicant \u2019s request for an injunction on his expulsion pending the proceedings on his objection to the decision to impose an exclusion order on him .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant \u2019s objection of CARDINAL DATE . The Deputy Minister noted that , on the basis of the rulings of CARDINAL DATE and DATE , the decision to hold LAW against the applicant had become final and that for that reason an exclusion order could be imposed . In this connection , the Deputy Minister pointed out that GPE attached great importance to the premise that the GPE does not become a safe haven for persons in respect of whom there are strong suspicions that they have committed crimes referred to in LAW and that , in order to accomplish this , an exclusion order was imposed on persons against whom this provision had been held . As regards the question whether the LAW opposing the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE was of a sustained nature , the Deputy Minister held that the applicant did not find himself in a situation in which , for a great number of DATE , he could not be removed from the GPE for reasons based on LAW and , in this respect referred to a letter sent on DATE by the Minister and Deputy Minister of ORG to ORG ( ORG ) of ORG on the application of LAW , stating inter alia that the notion of \u201c a great number of years \u201d meant in principle a period of DATE . The Deputy Minister further considered that it had not been established that there were no prospects of change in the situation where Article CARDINAL opposed the applicant \u2019s removal to GPE , which country was undergoing a period of transition , comprising a complex reconciliation process which had the active support of the international community . The Deputy Minister lastly rejected the applicant \u2019s arguments based on his rights under LAW . As regards the question whether the applicant \u2019s family life could only be enjoyed in the GPE , the Deputy Minister accepted that , in the current circumstances , the applicant could not return to GPE but did not find it established that this family life could not be enjoyed in a third country . The Deputy Minister concluded that the interests of the applicant and those of his family were of insufficient weight to tip the balance in their favour .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with ORG of The Hague . By judgment of DATE , that court , sitting in GPE , rejected the appeal . It held that , barring newly emerged facts or changed circumstances , the decision to hold LAW against the applicant had become final with the ruling given on DATE by ORG . Referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law , it reiterated that under \u201c newly emerged facts or changed circumstances \u201d was to be understood facts or circumstances having occurred after the initial decision , i.c . after DATE , and which could not and therefore should not have been submitted before that decision was taken and that , even if that condition was fulfilled , such facts or circumstances nevertheless did not warrant a revision of the judicial assessment if it was excluded from the outset that such new submissions or arguments could alter the initial decision . ORG did not find such newly emerged facts or changed circumstances in the applicant \u2019s submissions . It further noted that it was not in dispute that LAW had , as from the date of the applicant \u2019s asylum request and until the date of the impugned decision , uninterruptedly opposed the applicant \u2019s expulsion to GPE . Noting that DATE had elapsed between the filing of the asylum request and the taking of the impugned decision , it further accepted that the Deputy Minister did not have to determine the question whether the continued withholding of a residence title to the applicant was disproportionate . It agreed that DATE had elapsed at the time of its own examination , but held that its scope for review was limited to the impugned decision . If the applicant wished to obtain an examination of the proportionality of the continued withholding of a residence title , he should file a request for a regular residence permit together with a request for the lifting of the exclusion order . As regards the applicant \u2019s arguments under LAW , ORG held :", "\u201c The appellant correctly points out that the existence of serious reasons for considering that he has committed offences as referred to in LAW does not offer the same degree of certitude about his culpability as a criminal conviction of such crimes . This does not alter the fact that the Deputy Minister \u2019s assumption , as accepted by ORG , is founded on the [ contents of the ] official country assessment report which , in the opinion of ORG , is carried by the underlying materials . As a general , the appellant has further exercised an important function under PERSON . In these circumstances , there exists a rather high degree of certainty that the appellant has committed the acts held against him which belong to the most serious crimes imaginable . In its ruling of DATE ( ORG [ National Jurisprudence Number \u2013 \u201c LJN \u201d ] ORG ) , ORG considered that a person against whom LAW has been held by the international community is regarded as a danger to ( international ) public order and public safety . In the ruling cited ORG found that the Deputy Minister , when considering that the aim of the exclusion order is to prevent that an alien against whom LAW has been held can obtain protection in the GPE DATE thereby rendering the GPE a host state for persons who have committed serious crimes DATE and to counter residence of that alien in the entire GPE territory , has on good grounds and with sufficient reasoning adopted the position that interference in the alien \u2019s family life is justified in the interest of public safety and security . ORG concludes that the fact that the appellant has not been criminally convicted does not mean that the LAW objection gives insufficient cause for interference in his right to family life .", "When taking the impugned decision , the Deputy Minister proceeded on the basis of the existence of objective obstacles to family life being exercised in GPE . ORG sees no ground for holding that the Deputy Minister has incorrectly considered the interest of the appellant and his family to be of less weight than the interests served by the imposition of the exclusion order or that on this point the impugned decision lacks adequate reasoning . The appellant is indeed already for a long time involved in [ residency ] proceedings during which he has been allowed to stay in the GPE , but he has never held any residence title enabling him to exercise family life in the GPE . When the impugned decision was taken , his oldest child had come of age , whereas no special relationship of dependency between the appellant and this child has appeared . At that time , the other CARDINAL children were , respectively , CARDINAL , DATE . It has not appeared that , if need be , these children could not appeal to their mother and the oldest child for aid and assistance . Moreover , it can not be ignored that , for as long as the Deputy Minister considers that the appellant \u2019s expulsion to GPE is in breach of LAW and the appellant takes no concrete steps to meet the obligation placed on him \u2013 irrespective of the exclusion order \u2013 to leave the GPE by actively attempting to obtain admission to another country , the appellant will in fact remain with his wife and children . [ His claim ] that not a single other country is willing to admit the appellant does not , without more , have to be accepted by the Deputy Minister , the less so as the appellant \u2019s lawyer has stated during the hearing held on DATE that persons holding a higher rank than the applicant have been admitted to GPE and that the appellant is examining the possibilities of admission to that country . ORG concludes that the impugned decision does not violate LAW . \u201d", "CARDINAL . On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal against this judgment with ORG .", "CARDINAL . In a separate judgment , also given on DATE , ORG of The GPE sitting in GPE declared inadmissible the applicant \u2019s appeal against the Deputy Minister \u2019s decision of CARDINAL DATE to reject his asylum request . Referring to a ruling handed down by ORG on DATE ( PERSON [ Immigration Law Reports \u2013 \u201c JV \u201d ] CARDINAL ) , ORG held that the applicant did not have an interest in a determination of that appeal for as long as the exclusion order imposed on him had not been definitely lifted , as this order rendered him ineligible for any kind of residence title . Although a further appeal lay with ORG , there is no indication in the case file that the applicant has lodged such an appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE , ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL DATE and confirmed the judgment of ORG of The GPE relating to the imposition of the exclusion order . No further appeal lay against this ruling .", "CARDINAL . To date , the applicant has not been prosecuted for the offence defined in article CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) and he has not made any attempts to resettle in a third country .", "CARDINAL . Until DATE , the admission , residence and expulsion of aliens were regulated by LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . Further rules were laid down in LAW ( Vreemdelingenbesluit ) , the Regulation on Aliens ( Voorschrift Vreemdelingen ) and LAW DATE ( PERSON ) . On DATE , LAW DATE was replaced by LAW . On DATE , LAW , the Regulation on Aliens and LAW were replaced by new versions based on LAW . LAW ( PERSON ) applies to proceedings under LAW , unless indicated otherwise in this LAW .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW of LAW , an alien is eligible for a residence permit for the purpose of asylum if , inter alia ,", "- he or she is a refugee within the meaning of the CARDINAL Refugee Convention , or", "- he or she has established that he or she has well - founded reasons to assume that he or she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin .", "CARDINAL . If the exclusion clause under LAW of the CARDINAL ORG is held against an asylum seeker , the alien concerned loses any protection which might have been available under this LAW and , consequently , becomes ineligible for a residence permit for asylum under LAW of LAW ( article CARDINAL of LAW and LAW ) .", "CARDINAL . Under LAW , judicial review by ORG and ORG in administrative law appeal proceedings only addresses whether the executive authority concerned has exercised its administrative powers in a reasonable manner and , in the light of the interests at stake , could reasonably have taken the impugned decision ( marginale toetsing ) . Both before ORG and ORG it is possible to apply for a provisional measure ( voorlopige voorziening ) pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW DATE provides that a foreign national may be declared an undesirable alien , entailing the imposition of an exclusion order , on the ground , inter alia , that he or she poses a danger to public safety or national security and/or that it is in the interests of the international relations of the GPE . An exclusion order entails a ban on residing in or visiting the GPE .", "CARDINAL . An exclusion order , which is immediately enforceable , can be challenged in administrative law appeal proceedings under the terms of LAW . Such appeal proceedings do not have automatic suspensive effect .", "CARDINAL . Article CARDINAL of LAW ( GPE ) provides that an alien who stays in the GPE while he or she knows that an exclusion order has been imposed on him or her commits a criminal offence punishable by CARDINAL months\u2019 imprisonment or a fine of CARDINAL CARDINAL,CARDINAL euros . In accordance with the discretionary powers held by the public prosecution service ( opportuniteitsbeginsel ) , it remains for that service to decide in each individual case and in line with the general policy rules defined by ORG ( College van procureursgeneraal ) whether to prosecute or not .", "CARDINAL . An exclusion order may be revoked , upon request , if the alien concerned has been residing outside the GPE for an uninterrupted period of DATE ( article DATE of LAW ) . Such revocation entitles the alien to seek readmission to GPE territory subject to the conditions that are applicable to every alien .", "CARDINAL . The implementation as from DATE of ORG Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EC of DATE ( on common standards and procedures in Member GPE for returning illegally staying third - country nationals ) has no consequences in respect of persons on whom an exclusion order has been imposed which has obtained the force of res iudicata . Exclusion orders which are being challenged in administrative appeal proceedings or in respect of which a request for revocation has been filed may be replaced by an entry ban ( inreisverbod ) within the meaning of the Directive and a decision to that effect can be challenged in administrative appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to article CARDINAL of LAW , a decision rejecting an alien \u2019s request for admission to the GPE automatically has , amongst others , the following legal consequences :", "- the alien is no longer lawfully residing in the GPE ;", "- he / she is required to leave the GPE within DATE ;", "- officials entrusted with the supervision of aliens are authorised DATE if the alien has not voluntarily left the GPE within the delay fixed for this purpose DATE to proceed with his / her effective removal from the GPE .", "CARDINAL . Under the preceding Aliens Act DATE , a separate decision was given in respect of each of these legal consequences which could each be challenged in distinct proceedings . This is no longer possible under LAW DATE and a negative decision on an admission request is therefore known as a so called \u201c multi - purpose decision \u201d ( meeromvattende beschikking ) .", "CARDINAL . Pursuant to the provisions of ORG ) , in force as from DATE , and article CARDINAL of LAW , an alien who does not have lawful residence in the GPE is not entitled to any benefits in kind , facilities and social security benefits issued by decision of an administrative authority . Derogation is possible if the benefits relate to education for minors , the provision of essential medical care ( i.e. prevention of life - threatening situations or loss of essential functions ) , the prevention of situations that would jeopardise public health of pose a risk for third parties ( for instance prevention of infectious diseases , or care related to pregnancy and childbirth ) or the provision of legal assistance to the alien concerned .", "CARDINAL . In a ruling of DATE ( PERSON ) , ORG considered that the decision to proceed with effective removal does not constitute an independent partial decision within the multi - purpose decision on a request for a residence permit , that the competence to proceed with effective removal is a legal effect ipso iure ( rechtsgevolg van rechtswege ) of the refusal of such a request , and that this competence is not of a discretionary nature . Although reiterating that in principle no further remedy lies against a multi - purpose decision as the lawfulness of its consequences has already been judicially determined in the administrative appeal proceedings challenging a refusal to admit the alien concerned , ORG also accepted that in certain exceptional circumstances , such as a relevant change of circumstances having occurred during the delay between the refusal of the admission request and an act aimed at effective removal ( daadwerkelijke uitzettingshandeling ) , an objection ( bezwaar ) and subsequent appeal ( beroep ) may be filed against an act aimed at effective removal . Under the terms of article CARDINAL of LAW , such an act can be equated with a formal decision within the meaning of LAW which can be challenged in separate administrative appeal proceedings .", "CARDINAL . A refusal on the basis of LAW of the CARDINAL Refugee Convention to grant an asylum - related residence permit does not necessarily imply that the alien concerned will be effectively removed to his or her country of origin if that would be in breach of LAW .", "CARDINAL . In CARDINAL rulings handed down on , respectively , CARDINAL and DATE ( nos . CARDINAL/CARDINAL and CARDINAL ) , ORG of ORG noted that , according to article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINAL of LAW , a refusal to grant asylum entailed that the person concerned should leave the GPE voluntarily , failing which he or she could be expelled . It accepted that an alien \u2013 who was denied entry pursuant to LAW but who could not be expelled to his or her country of origin on the basis of a risk of being subjected to treatment in breach of LAW can be denied a residence permit . It did however underline the legislator \u2019s apparent wish to limit the size of this group as much as possible . Where an asylum seeker is able to demonstrate that LAW constitutes a sustained obstacle to his or her expulsion to the country of origin , , the immigration authorities had not dealt with the question whether the expulsion of the persons concerned would be in breach of LAW , as they had first examined whether and concluded that the exclusion clause of LAW applied . ORG concluded that , therefore , the immigration authorities\u2019 examination of these cases had been incomplete .", "CARDINAL . These rulings resulted in an amendment to the relevant rules . Where it has been established that a person , for reasons based on LAW , can not be expelled to his or her country of origin but who , pursuant to LAW , is ineligible for any kind of residence permit , no act aimed at effective removal will be undertaken , at least for as long as these reasons exist . However , no residence title will be issued to the alien concerned who remains under the obligation to leave the GPE at his or her own motion . It further remains possible to proceed with his or her effective removal as soon as this no longer entails a risk of treatment contrary to LAW in the country of origin or to proceed with removal to a third ORG willing to accept the person concerned .", "CARDINAL . Eligibility for an eventual temporary regular residence permit may arise when the obstacle based on LAW return to his / her country of origin is of a sustained nature . In practice , such a situation may arise after a period of unlawful residence in the GPE of the alien concerned for DATE whilst Article CARDINAL continues to stand in the way of removal to his / her country of origin and without any prospect of change in that situation in the foreseeable future , and where the alien concerned has demonstrated that despite his / her best efforts there is no possibility for him / her to relocate to a third country , and where the continued withholding of a residence permit would be disproportional .", "CARDINAL .
