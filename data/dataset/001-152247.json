The applicant was born in DATE and lives in PERSON .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant was charged with , inter alia , causing a serious traffic hazard ( t\u00f6rke\u00e4 liikenneturvallisuuden vaarantaminen , grovt \u00e4ventyrande av trafiks\u00e4kerheten ) and operating a vehicle without a licence ( ajoneuvon kuljettaminen oikeudetta , olovlig k\u00f6rning ) , both acts having been committed on CARDINAL DATE . The prosecutor requested that , in relation to the charge of causing a serious traffic hazard , a driving ban be imposed .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG ( k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus , tingsr\u00e4tten ) convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to DATE - fines , amounting to CARDINAL ( ORG ) . A driving ban was also imposed until DATE on the basis of section CARDINAL of the Driving Licence Act of GPE .", "CARDINAL . No appeal was made against the judgment and it became final .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the police imposed a new driving ban on the applicant from DATE to CARDINAL DATE on the basis of section CARDINAL \u00a7 \u00a7 CARDINAL ( c ) and CARDINAL of the Driving Licence Act of GPE . In their decision the police referred to the fact that on DATE the applicant had been driving a vehicle without a licence and that ORG had convicted him for this by final judgment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . By letter dated DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( hallinto - oikeus , f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , claiming that he had been tried and convicted twice in the same matter . He referred to LAW .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal and upheld the driving ban . The court found that ORG had imposed the driving ban for causing a serious traffic hazard whereas the police had imposed it for operating a vehicle without a licence . Therefore , the applicant was not punished twice for the same offence and his rights protected by LAW were not violated .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the applicant appealed to ORG ( korkein hallinto - oikeus , h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen ) , reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before ORG . He stressed that both the criminal and the administrative proceedings had related to the same facts which had taken place on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld ORG decision . It found that ORG had imposed the driving ban for causing a serious traffic hazard whereas the police had imposed it for operating a vehicle without a licence . LAW had therefore not been violated . The decision was not unanimous and one of the judges expressed a dissenting opinion . In her opinion , it was not to be ruled out that a driving ban constituted a criminal sanction . Referring to the case GPE v. GPE , she considered that after the applicant \u2019s final conviction by ORG , a new driving ban based on the same facts on the basis of which he had already been convicted could no longer be imposed . Therefore , she would have quashed the police decision as well as ORG decision ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["P7"], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["P7-4"], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
