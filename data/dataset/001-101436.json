On DATE the applicant requested that a legalaid lawyer be assigned to the case for the purposes of lodging a cassation appeal with ORG . On DATE ORG granted his request for legal aid and requested ORG to assign a lawyer to the case . Subsequently , as the first lawyer assigned by ORG suffered from certain health problems at that time , on DATE ORG assigned another lawyer , PERSON PERSON , to the case . He was served with the letter informing him of the assignment on DATE .", "CARDINAL . Subsequently the lawyer requested ORG to serve on him its judgment of DATE . The judgment with the written grounds was served on him on DATE .", "CARDINAL . In a letter to the applicant dated DATE the lawyer explained in detail why he had found no grounds on which to prepare a cassation complaint in the case .", "CARDINAL .

Under the amended text of LAW , the time - limit for lodging a cassation appeal with ORG was extended DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG has repeatedly held that a request for leave to appeal out of time was the only method by which a cassation appeal submitted after the expiry of the timelimit could be admitted for examination ( DATE , II CZ CARDINAL ; CARDINAL DATE , II UZ CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . In a further series of decisions ORG considered that it would be unfair for the legally - aided party to be penalised for the fact that legalaid applications could not be processed quickly enough to make it possible for a cassation appeal to be lodged within DATE counted from DATE of service of the judgment on the party . The parties waiting for legal - aid services can not be held at fault for shortcomings in the system . A party who was obliged to have recourse to legal aid should not be put in a worse situation than that of a person who did not seek it . A request to appeal out of time should therefore be submitted within DATE from the date on which the legal - aid lawyer could obtain effective access to the case file or had an effective possibility of drafting an appeal ( DATE , II UZ CARDINAL ; DATE , I ORG CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , or from the date when the lawyer was informed that he had been assigned to the case by ORG DATE , PERSON ; CARDINAL DATE , II UZ DATE ; CARDINAL DATE , PERSON ;", "CARDINAL . In a resolution adopted by a bench of CARDINAL judges of ORG on DATE ( III CZP CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) that court acknowledged that there had been discrepancies in the manner in which the beginning of the DATE time limit for submitting an application for leave to appeal out of time by legally - assisted parties had been determined . The court was of the view that applications for leave served the purpose of making access to ORG for legally - aided parties genuine and effective . Hence , the beginning of the time - limit could not be determined in a mechanical manner in all cases . The courts should instead examine the circumstances of individual cases as a whole and determine that date bearing in mind the genuine possibility for a lawyer to examine the case and prepare a cassation appeal ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
