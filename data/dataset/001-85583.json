The applicant was born in DATE and lives in ORG .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant brought a civil action in ORG ( PERSON ) against PERSON and PERSON , seeking termination of a contract for lifelong maintenance ( ugovor o do\u017eivotnom uzdr\u017eavanju ) . She enclosed a copy of the contract in question , drawn up on DATE , and its annex of CARDINAL DATE . The contract stipulated that the defendants were to care for the applicant until her death in order to acquire all her property post mortem . She also asked that CARDINAL witnesses , PERSON and PERSON , be heard . The defendants submitted receipts for DATE payments for the applicant \u2019s maintenance and asked that CARDINAL witnesses be heard .", "CARDINAL . At the hearing held on DATE ORG heard evidence from the parties and after that , in the presence of the applicant \u2019s counsel , scheduled the next hearing for DATE . The applicant \u2019s counsel fell ill and had to be hospitalised pending urgent surgery . On DATE he sent a fax to ORG excusing himself from the hearing scheduled for DATE and asked for an adjournment of the hearing . However , ORG proceeded with the hearing and heard CARDINAL witnesses , PERSON . PERSON and PERSON , the parents of CARDINAL of the defendants . It also scheduled a further hearing for DATE and ordered that CARDINAL other witnesses , also called on behalf of the defendants , be heard . Neither the applicant nor her counsel were notified of the hearing .", "CARDINAL . NORP The counsel did attend the hearing of DATE , which he had learned about by chance when at ORG on DATE for other reasons . ORG heard CARDINAL witnesses for the defendants , PERSON and PERSON , as scheduled , but refused the proposal of the applicant \u2019s counsel that CARDINAL other witnesses be heard . The relevant parts of the transcript of the hearing read as follows :", "\u201c Counsel for the plaintiff asks that the plaintiff \u2019s neighbours PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON be heard as witnesses about the circumstances of the applicant \u2019s DATE life and the care she has received from them in DATE and in particular in DATE following her release from a hospital , when she was immobile .", "...", "Counsel for the plaintiff withdraws his request that PERSON be called as a witness since , according to the plaintiff , that person is not able to attend a hearing at the court .", "The judge decides that evidence is not to be heard from PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON , PERSON and PERSON and no further evidence is to be presented . \u201d", "ORG proceeded by closing the proceedings and pronouncing its judgment , dismissing the applicant \u2019s claim . The relevant part of the judgment read as follows :", "\u201c In view of the above , the court considers that the factual background has been fully established on the basis of the parties\u2019 testimony and in particular in the contract for lifelong maintenance and its annex and the enclosed receipts for payment . For that reason the court declined to hear evidence from the witnesses called on behalf of the plaintiff , because these witnesses can not tell the court anything of influence on its judgment , save for the fact that they , owing to the plaintiff \u2019s age , have been increasingly assisting her on a DATE basis . For precisely that reason the court is not relying on the evidence heard from the witnesses Lj . M. , \u0160. M. and PERSON \u201d", "CARDINAL . A subsequent appeal by the applicant was dismissed by ORG ( \u017dupanijski sud u ORG ) on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint alleging , inter alia , that her right to a fair trial had been infringed , because the hearing of CARDINAL DATE had been held in the absence of her counsel who had duly excused himself due to his urgent hospitalisation and that she had thus been prevented from questioning CARDINAL witnesses . Furthermore , neither she nor her counsel had been notified of the hearing scheduled for DATE . Although her counsel did attend the hearing , which he had learned about by chance on DATE , he had not been able to prepare himself to question the CARDINAL further witnesses who had been heard at that hearing . Thus , she had been prevented from questioning any of the CARDINAL witnesses , all of whom had been heard on behalf of the defendants . Finally , she complained that ORG had refused to hear any of her CARDINAL witnesses . On DATE ORG ( Ustavni sud PERSON ) dismissed the complaint as ill - founded ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
