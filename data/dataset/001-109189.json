The court stated that the press had certain privileges so as to provide free and impartial news , to be able to discuss views and opinions and to enlighten the public .

The court further considered , inter alia , that the press , while performing their duty to inform the public of issues and events of public interest , may have to criticise certain persons and institutions .

The court opined that in the present case the remarks contained in the article went beyond the limits of acceptable criticism , there was no harmony between the form and the content , the content went beyond the subject of criticism , and that through the words used there was an unjustified attack on the plaintiff \u2019s personal rights .", "CARDINAL .

I guess a CARDINAL - page newspaper advertisement would n\u2019t have been bad . It was high time I put in an advertisement which said \u2018 read me\u2019 in large print and which was of a modern design and under which I put my signature .", "However , I needed some money for my dream to come true . But , I would not overcome this problem by putting a paid advertisement in the newspaper as both the euro and NORP lira were taken out of circulation a long time ago in my newspaper , which had no boss . In the last analysis , I found out that I had to find some other solutions as the conditions for submitting an advertisement were not ripe . Since I was the child of a \u2018 country where solutions were PERSON , I could overcome this problem by standing on my own feet . And I did . In DATE my colleagues have been asked whether their columns are their property . And now I decided to use my column for my private matters as \u2018 it is my property\u2019 . Maybe I would use the \u2018 get well\u2019 advertisement as a step to improve private relations that would \u2018 lead to some good\u2019 .", "The contrary could also be experienced . My innocence would be disregarded and my well - intentioned attempt could be misunderstood . It would be deemed as \u2018 a libellous and deriding statement against honour , pride and dignity which infringes personal rights and a severe , intolerable and unbearable insult\u2019 . Then I would feel sorry for not taking the opportunity to make a \u2018 get well visit\u2019 .

My answer to them would be , in GPE jargon , that \u2018 they are dead on their feet paying their hotel ORG . Moreover , I would n\u2019t do that either . Because by my nature , I refuse to be rude to somebody all along .", "Suppose that giving way to despair , I dialled the number . It would appear that there is no such office in the central organisation of ORG any more . Several journalists from the supporting media organisations who are \u2018 holding a press card and members of a religious ORG are coupled together and wandering in the building like cats on hot bricks . However , its functioning has changed . When you dialled the number , you immediately realise that the journalist you get on the phone is not a press agent but an \u2018 executive director for proofreading press PERSON . You do n\u2019t even have to call them . Mostly , they call you . So far I have n\u2019t called them and they have n\u2019t called me .

Having regard to the fact that he defames the birds in the air and the wolves in the mountains , he responds to criticisms with swearing , for him University professors are immoral , the opposition party meagre , journalists shameless , and he also makes inappropriate remarks about the mothers of the voters , I consider it useful for both his and the public \u2019s mental health to investigate whether he had a high - fevered illness when he was young ...", "As he has become such a nervous wreck in that he dismissed a question like the erection of the \u201c NORP FAC \u201d in GPE and tore the NORP book in the house of PERSON , I suspect that he is suffering from a psychopathic aggressive illness .
