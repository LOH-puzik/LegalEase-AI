THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "Elisabeth Palm;Gaukur J\u00f6rundsson", "TEXT": ["The applicant , PERSON , is a NORP national of NORP origin , born in DATE and , at the time of introduction of the application , he was detained in the GPE for expulsion purposes . He is represented before the ORG by Ms G.E.M. Later , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant , may be summarised as follows .", "The applicant entered and took up residence in the GPE in DATE . On DATE , the applicant applied for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . The ORG Secretary of ORG ( ORG ) rejected these requests on DATE . The applicant filed an objection ( bezwaarschrift ) against this decision with the ORG Secretary on DATE .", "As , pursuant to LAW ( Vreemdelingenwet ) , this objection was denied suspensive effect as to the applicant \u2019s expulsion , the applicant filed a request with ORG ( ORG ) on DATE for an injunction on his expulsion pending the proceedings on his objection . On DATE , the ORG Secretary rejected the applicant \u2019s objection . The applicant \u2019s subsequent appeal to ORG was rejected on DATE .", "The applicant filed an opposition ( verzet ) against the judgment of CARDINAL DATE , which was rejected by ORG on DATE .", "In DATE the applicant participated in a hunger strike in a church in the GPE together with CARDINAL other illegal aliens who had been living in the GPE for a long time . On DATE , the ORG Secretary gave an undertaking that he would personally examine the cases of these illegal aliens . In this connection , the ORG Secretary informed the applicant by letter of CARDINAL DATE that he did not meet the conditions for a residence permit on the basis of the policy on the legalisation of illegal aliens . The ORG Secretary had further not found any reason , capable of justifying a departure from this policy , to grant the applicant a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . On DATE , the applicant filed an objection against this decision with the ORG Secretary .", "On DATE , following the apprehension of the NORP leader PERSON by the NORP authorities , a protest demonstration took place in GPE in the course of which protesters occupied the residence of the NORP Ambassador and members of the Ambassador \u2019s household were prevented from leaving the LOC . DATE , the applicant was arrested and subsequently detained in police custody ( inverzekeringstelling ) on suspicion of vandalism and violence ( openlijke geweldpleging ) after he was found amid a group of protesters who appeared to be heading in the direction of the residence .", "Upon instructions of the public prosecutor and after having been heard and served with an indictment to stand trial on charges of disobeying police orders , the applicant was handed over to the GPE police ( vreemdelingenpolitie ) on DATE , who apprehended him in order to verify his identity , nationality and residence title in accordance with LAW .", "On DATE , the applicant was placed in GPE detention for the purposes of expulsion ( vreemdelingenbewaring ) under LAW ( a ) of LAW ( PERSON ) . On DATE , the applicant \u2019s lawyer filed a request with ORG for an injunction on his expulsion pending the proceedings on the applicant \u2019s objection filed on DATE against the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision of DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a second request for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds and , on DATE , he was interviewed by an official on the reasons for these requests .", "On DATE , the applicant filed an appeal with ORG against his placement in GPE detention and he requested compensation for the time spent in GPE detention .", "The applicant \u2019s request of DATE was rejected by the ORG Secretary on DATE . Noting that the applicant had stated that he had left GPE for the GPE in DATE because the NORP authorities had made it impossible for him to do his work as a shepherd and had exerted pressure on him to become a village guard , the ORG Secretary held that the applicant \u2019s submissions did not disclose any grounds for believing that he had well - founded reasons to fear persecution within the meaning of the DATE LAW . The ORG Secretary considered that the mere fact that the applicant belonged to the NORP community in GPE did not warrant such a conclusion , and neither had it appeared that the applicant had attracted the particular attention of the NORP authorities . Insofar as the applicant relied on LAW , the ORG Secretary did not find it established that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to this provision of the LAW . The ORG Secretary further ordered the applicant to leave the GPE without delay .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE in the course of which the applicant was represented by a lawyer , ORG , in a decision pronounced in public , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal of CARDINAL DATE against his placement in GPE detention . ORG considered that public order required the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention as he had resided illegally in the GPE for DATE and had apparently evaded the control of the ORG department ( vreemdelingendienst ) . Noting that the applicant had no residence title and finding that it had not been established that the applicant had sufficient means of subsistence , ORG held that there were serious grounds to believe that the applicant would seek to find ways of avoiding his expulsion .", "ORG did not agree with the applicant that there were no real prospects for his expulsion and , in this respect , rejected his argument that the public prosecutor had not given his consent for the expulsion . It considered that this consent was implied in the public prosecutor \u2019s decision to hand the applicant over to the GPE police for expulsion purposes . As to the objection filed against the rejected request for asylum of DATE , ORG considered that this did not have such prospects of success that , on that ground , the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention should be discontinued . It further took into consideration that this request for asylum had only been filed after the applicant \u2019s arrest on DATE , which cast doubts as to the sincerity of his motives for making an application for asylum . It further held that there was no indication that the applicant had well - founded reasons to fear persecution in his country of origin .", "ORG concluded that the applicant \u2019s apprehension and placement in GPE detention were lawful under the relevant statutory provisions and , after having balanced the interests involved , could reasonably be regarded as justified . Consequently , it found no grounds to award the applicant compensation for the time spent in placement in GPE detention . The parties were notified of this decision on DATE .", "On DATE , the applicant filed a third request for asylum or , alternatively , a residence permit on humanitarian grounds . On DATE , he filed a second appeal with ORG against his placement in GPE detention and he requested compensation for the time spent in GPE detention .", "On DATE , following a hearing held on DATE in the course of which the applicant was represented by a lawyer , ORG , in a decision pronounced in public , rejected the applicant \u2019s appeal of DATE . Noting that the lawfulness of this placement had already been determined in its decision of CARDINAL DATE , it limited its examination to the lawfulness of the applicant \u2019s continued placement in GPE detention .", "As to the ongoing proceedings , ORG found no indication that these had such evident chances of success that it would be unreasonable to continue the applicant \u2019s placement in GPE detention . It further did not find it established that the applicant , if expelled to GPE , would run the risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to LAW . As to the argument that LAW entails the right of an accused to appear at his trial , ORG noted that the GPE authorities granted entry visas to aliens wishing to attend their trial in the GPE and that , therefore , this did not constitute an obstacle to expulsion . It further noted that the applicant was in the possession of a valid NORP passport , so that a presentation to the NORP consular authorities in order to obtain travel documents would not be necessary . It further noted that a determination of a new application for a residence permit could only be awaited in the GPE if no contraindications existed and that , in the applicant \u2019s case , there were such contraindications since he was suspected of having committed a criminal offence .", "ORG further found no indication that , since its decision of DATE , the authorities had been lacking in diligence in their consideration of the applicant \u2019s case or that there were insufficient prospects of expulsion . It concluded that there was no appearance that the applicant \u2019s continued placement in GPE detention was contrary to the relevant statutory provisions and that , after having balanced the interests involved , it could reasonably be regarded as justified . Consequently , it found no grounds for awarding the applicant compensation for the time spent in placement in GPE detention . The parties were notified of this decision on DATE .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , in view of reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin . On DATE , upon an order of ORG , the applicant was released from GPE detention .", "On DATE , following proceedings on appeal in the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant , ORG ( ORG ) quashed the applicant \u2019s conviction by ORG and declared the prosecution inadmissible , holding that the applicant \u2019s deprivation of liberty on DATE had been unlawful in that there had been no reasonable suspicion that he had committed an offence in respect of which the legal provisions in force allowed a suspect to be taken into police custody .", "The applicant \u2019s objection of CARDINAL DATE against the ORG Secretary \u2019s decision of DATE has , to date , not been decided on . No further information has been submitted as to the remaining proceedings instituted by the applicant .", "LAW , insofar as relevant , provides :", "\u201c CARDINAL . If the interests of public order , public policy or national security so require , the following categories of aliens may be detained :", "a. NORP aliens whose expulsion has been ordered ;", "b. aliens in respect of whom there are serious ground to believe that their expulsion will be ordered ;", "c. aliens who are not allowed to reside in the GPE by virtue of any of the provisions contained in ORG CARDINAL - CARDINAL < of LAW > , pending the decision on an application for a residence permit , a permanent residence permit or leave to enter as refugees .", "CARDINAL . An alien shall not be detained when , and detention shall be terminated as soon as , he intimates that he wishes to leave the GPE and is in fact in a position to do so .", "CARDINAL . Detention for the reasons set out in the first sentence of paragraph CARDINAL and for the categories referred to under b. or c. of that paragraph shall not be of longer duration than DATE .", "... \u201d", "An alien whose expulsion has been ordered can , in principle , remain in GPE detention for an unlimited period of time . The lawfulness of a placement in GPE detention can , however , be challenged before a court . Where the court is of the opinion that there are no prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time , it can order that the measure of placement in GPE detention be terminated .", "It has been established in the case - law of ORG ( ORG ) of ORG that the interest of an alien to be released from GPE detention increases with the passage of time . Where a placement in GPE detention exceeds a period of DATE , it is generally held that the alien \u2019s interest in being released is greater than the interest to keep him in detention for the purposes of expulsion . Depending on the specific circumstances of each case , this point in time may also be reached before or after DATE have passed . It may be later where the alien frustrates the determination of his identity or nationality and it may be earlier where the alien concerned is unable to obtain travel documents for reasons beyond his control .", "Pursuant to Article PERSON of LAW , ORG must examine an appeal brought against a measure of deprivation of liberty within DATE and must hand down its written decision on the appeal within DATE following its hearing on the appeal .", "According to LAW ( PERSON ) , the President of ORG shall inform the parties at the closure of the hearing when the court \u2019s decision will be handed down . LAW provides that , within DATE of the date of the pronouncement of the decision , ORG will send a copy of the decision to the parties free of charge .", "Although no appeal lies against a decision by ORG in proceedings concerning requests for release from detention for expulsion purposes , an appeal to ORG ( Gerechtshof ) is available in relation to a decision taken in the context of such proceedings on a request for compensation for the time spent in detention for expulsion purposes . Furthermore , an appeal may be admitted in which the complaint is made that in the decision challenged a fundamental principle of law has been disrespected ( cf . ORG , CARDINAL DATE , PERSON , nr . CARDINAL )", "There is no time - limit for the filing of an appeal against a decision of placement in GPE detention and in principle a person placed in GPE detention may file as many appeals against this decision as he sees fit . When the lawfulness of a decision of placement in GPE detention has been determined for a first time , the examination of any subsequent appeal in this respect will be limited to the lawfulness of the continuation of the placement in GPE detention as from DATE last judicial decision taken on this point .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary of ORG requested ORG to suspend the examination of appeals , including requests for injunctions on expulsions , filed by asylum seekers of NORP origin , as it had appeared that CARDINAL such asylum seekers had encountered serious problems after they had been expelled to GPE .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that , in view of reports on what had happened to CARDINAL asylum seekers who had been expelled to GPE , a policy decision had been taken to suspend temporarily the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin .", "On DATE , the ORG Secretary informed ORG that the results of an investigation into the facts on the basis of which the expulsion of NORP nationals of NORP origin had been temporarily suspended had led to the lifting of that suspension ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
