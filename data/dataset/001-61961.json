The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . In DATE he issued nuisance proceedings against his landlord . Those proceedings were settled in DATE . Subsequently , and as a result of alleged further nuisance problems and new evidence , he unsuccessfully attempted to re - enter the nuisance proceedings in DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he issued negligence proceedings in ORG against the firm of solicitors ( \u201c ORG \u201d ) who had acted for him in the above - described nuisance action . He took issue with the advice given to him by ORG during the settlement and , in particular , in relation to the possibility of re - entering his nuisance action . ORG filed an appearance dated DATE . The applicant \u2019s statement of claim was filed on DATE and on CARDINAL DATE he filed an application seeking judgment in default of defence which he obtained from ORG on DATE . However , ORG filed its defence on DATE and sought an order to set aside the default judgment . On CARDINAL DATE the default judgment was set aside . Further particulars of the applicant \u2019s claim were requested by ORG on CARDINAL DATE and the applicant responded on DATE . On CARDINAL DATE ORG applied for discovery and on DATE ORG refused that application .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant applied for discovery by ORG . On CARDINAL DATE ORG ordered discovery to be made by ORG within DATE . On DATE he applied to strike out the defence of ORG as they had not made discovery as ordered .

On the latter occasion the hearing date was fixed for DATE . However , on that date ORG was informed of settlement negotiations and in DATE or DATE the case was accorded a further hearing date in DATE .", "The High Court heard the case on DATE , legal submissions were heard on DATE and the court reserved its judgment . Judgment was delivered on DATE dismissing the applicant \u2019s case . The High Court judge found the evidence of a senior counsel ( who had acted for the applicant in the nuisance proceedings \u2013 \u201c GPE \u201d ) more convincing than that of the applicant and found that ORG had simply relied on the ORG \u2019s advice during the nuisance proceedings . Accordingly , it was found that no negligence could be attributed to ORG . Costs were awarded to ORG \u201c when taxed and ascertained \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant lodged his appeal to ORG : he argued that ORG should not have relied on evidence of ORG which was given in breach of GPE \u2019s privilege of confidentiality to the applicant .", "CARDINAL . SC was the subject of a complaint by the applicant to ORG of ORG of GPE . On DATE the tribunal found that ORG had been in breach of LAW and by decision of DATE he was formally admonished by the tribunal for dealing directly with the applicant and for giving evidence in court as to the advice he had given to the applicant without any protest as to confidentiality or privilege .

A letter of DATE confirmed to the applicant that his appeal had been listed for hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . NORP However , it was then listed for mention on DATE when the applicant \u2019s solicitors applied and were allowed to come off record . On that date the appeal hearing was adjourned ( to DATE ) and final submissions were ordered to be lodged by DATE . The applicant was not represented for the remainder of the proceedings . On DATE the applicant applied for leave to amend his appeal and on DATE ORG granted him leave .", "CARDINAL . The appeal came on for hearing on DATE . Since CARDINAL of the judges had previously participated in a ORG action brought by the applicant , the applicant was given the opportunity of having the appeal heard by a differently constituted ORG , the applicant accepted and the hearing was adjourned for mention on DATE . On that latter date , the appeal was listed for hearing on DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG adjourned the applicant \u2019s request for leave to introduce fresh evidence until the date fixed for the hearing of the action . Due to the illness of one of ORG judges , that hearing date was vacated . A further hearing date was set for DATE . The hearing took place on DATE and judgment was reserved . Judgment was delivered on DATE rejecting the applicant \u2019s appeal . The ORG found that the applicant had impliedly waived his privilege by instituting the proceedings . The court noted that , even if the alleged negligence had been established , it was questionable whether he had suffered loss as the original nuisance action on which ORG had advised him was more likely to fail than to succeed . The costs of the appeal were also awarded to ORG \u201c when taxed and ascertained \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG filed a note of their High and ORG costs . In the absence of the applicant \u2019s agreement on the level of the costs , on DATE ORG issued a summons to taxation , returnable for CARDINAL DATE .

On DATE the taxation of ORG costs was concluded and , on the applicant \u2019s request , a stay was put on the issuance of the relevant certificate until DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant requested and obtained a further stay until DATE . On that date leave was granted by the taxing master to ORG to take up both certificates of taxation . On DATE those certificates were taken up by ORG and were served on the applicant with a demand for payment by DATE . The costs payable by the applicant amounted to MONEY inclusive of value added taxation . Further demands were sent to the applicant on DATE and DATE indicating that ORG would apply for his bankruptcy should he not discharge the sums due .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG issued and served a \u201c notice of the particulars of demand and requiring payment prior to the issue of a bankruptcy summons \u201d , a notice which was updated with the interest accrued and served on the applicant on DATE . ORG then filed affidavits dated DATE and DATE and on DATE ORG issued a bankruptcy summons on the application of ORG .", "CARDINAL . The applicant applied on DATE to dismiss the summons . ORG filed an affidavit in response on DATE to which the applicant replied by affidavits filed on DATE and DATE . ORG therefore filed an affidavit in response on DATE . On DATE the High Court gave the applicant time to submit a further replying affidavit . The applicant submitted this affidavit on DATE . The matter was heard by ORG on DATE ( by a judge different from the judge sitting DATE ) . The detailed judgment delivered on DATE acceded to the request for the applicant \u2019s bankruptcy and refused his application to dismiss the summons . Noting that ORG had undertaken not to take steps to enforce the bankruptcy summons for DATE , ORG put no stay on its order .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicant appealed , requesting ORG to dismiss and stay indefinitely the bankruptcy summons . On DATE he also issued a notice of motion before ORG requesting a stay on the order of ORG of DATE pending the finalisation of his appeal . On DATE ORG rejected that motion , finding that it was not possible to stay a summons and that an injunction restraining ORG from taking any action on foot of the bankruptcy summons would not be justified . In any event , it was extremely unlikely that ORG could take any further action based on the existing bankruptcy summons since there was a DATE time - limit from the date of issue of the summons , within which ORG should have applied for adjudication against the applicant . On DATE ORG issued and served a further \u201c notice of the particulars of demand and requiring payment \u201d of the costs award plus relevant interest , amounting to the sum of DATE ( ORG ) ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": ["6"], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": ["6-1"], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
