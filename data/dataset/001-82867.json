MOLDOVA", "IMPORTANCE": "3", "CONCLUSION": "Preliminary objection dismissed (application not properly submitted by the applicant but rather by a lawyer who claimed to be associated with the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights);Violation of P1-1;Remainder inadmissible;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award", "JUDGES": "Nicolas Bratza", "TEXT": ["CARDINAL . The applicant was born in DATE and lives in GPE .", "CARDINAL . The facts of the case , as submitted by the parties , may be summarised as follows .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the applicant was employed by ORG ( \u201c the ORG \u201d ) , a ORG service . In DATE the ORG adopted new by - laws , which were approved by ORG . Under these by - laws , the ORG was registered as an independent legal person with the rights of a ORG company and governed by the ORG companies . It was created within the organs of local public administration and on the basis of municipal property but was financed exclusively from the income it generated from selling a variety of services to the local administration and to the population .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG decided to merge several bureaux , including ORG , into CARDINAL service at the County level . ORG thus became the legal successor of ORG in which the applicant had worked . Before this merger , ORG decided to reduce the number of personnel employed and as a result the applicant was made redundant by an order of CARDINAL DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE he acknowledged the dismissal notice in writing , as requested by law . In accordance with the relevant labour legislation , he requested redundancy payments ( namely redundancy compensation worth DATE average salary , his average DATE salary during DATE when he would be looking for a new job , payment for unused leave for DATE and payment of his salary for DATE and part of DATE ) .", "CARDINAL . The employer refused to pay because it had set aside no money for redundancy payments . According to a certificate issued by the GPE employment office on DATE , the applicant had been unemployed from CARDINAL DATE to the date of the issue of the certificate .", "CARDINAL . The applicant initiated court proceedings , claiming redundancy payments , namely DATE salary on dismissal , the continuing payment of his salary for DATE when he would be looking for another job and monetary compensation for untaken leave . On DATE ORG partly accepted his claims . He appealed and ORG quashed that judgment , ordering a full re - hearing of the case .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG rejected all his claims as unfounded .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG upheld that judgment . It found , among other things , that the applicant had missed the DATE deadline for making his claim against ORG , since the decision to reorganise the bureau had been published in DATE and the complaint had been lodged in DATE .", "CARDINAL . Notwithstanding the fact that the applicant had missed the above - mentioned time - limit , on DATE ORG examined the substance of his appeal and upheld the judgment of ORG . The court reasoned that no compensation was due because ORG , in which the applicant had worked , was self - financed ; it had not set aside any resources for compensation but had distributed all the money obtained from its activity to its employees , after paying taxes . Since it had been an independent legal person , its legal successor , ORG , could not be held liable for any outstanding debts . The court also found that the applicant had not offered any new services after DATE and thus could not claim his salary for DATE . He had been warned in DATE of impending dismissal and instructed to complete all outstanding work by DATE . Finally , the court found that he had not registered with the ORG employment office as unemployed and could therefore not claim redundancy compensation .", "CARDINAL .
