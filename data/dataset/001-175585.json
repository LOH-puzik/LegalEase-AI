The applicants , PERSON and Mr PERSON , are NORP nationals who were born in DATE and live in GPE / Main . They were represented before the ORG by Mr PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP In DATE the applicants moved from GPE to GPE / Main in GPE . They submitted a registration form dated DATE to the local registration authority , to inform the latter of their new place of residence . The form required information about their religion , and for both applicants they indicated \u201c Mosaic \u201d ( \u201c Mosaisch \u201d ) in the relevant part of the form .", "CARDINAL . The applicants remained members of their liberally - oriented NORP community in GPE .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter dated CARDINAL DATE the NORP community of GPE / Main welcomed the applicants as new members . A copy of the community \u2019s statutes was attached to the letter . According to the statutes , all persons of NORP faith whose place of residence or usual abode was in GPE / Main were members of the community , unless they had made a written objection to the community council within DATE from their date of arrival .", "CARDINAL . NORP By letter of DATE the applicants opposed membership . They further requested restitutio in integrum ( Wiedereinsetzung in den vorigen Stand ) , pointing out that they had received the community \u2019s statutes only after the expiry of the period for filing an objection .", "CARDINAL . As the community did not accept their objection , the applicants , as a precautionary measure , resigned their membership with effect from DATE . This was accepted by the community .", "CARDINAL . As a public - law entity ( K\u00f6rperschaft \u00f6ffentlichen Rechts ) the NORP community of GPE / Main levies a church tax based on the individual income of their members , which is collected by the ORG tax authorities . For the period from DATE to DATE the GPE / Main tax office levied a church tax on the applicants . They objected to paying the church tax in a separate set of proceedings which is not the subject of the application at issue .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants brought an action before ORG to obtain a declaration that they had not been members of the community DATE and DATE .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the GPE / ORG rejected the action as inadmissible , denying that such a judgment would have a legitimate interest .", "CARDINAL . The applicants appealed and , on DATE , ORG dismissed their appeal . It held that the applicants\u2019 action was admissible , but ill - founded because their membership was based on internal regulations of the religious community which had to be recognised by ORG authorities , in view of the principle of autonomy of religious organisations .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG quashed the judgment of ORG and declared that , in the public sphere , the ORG membership could not have legal effect . It reasoned , in essence , that notwithstanding the autonomy of religious organisations\u2019 religion was \u201c Mosaic \u201d could not be taken as a declaration of willingness to become members of the local NORP community .", "CARDINAL . After the GPE / Main NORP community had lodged a constitutional complaint ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) , on DATE ORG , sitting in a chamber of CARDINAL judges , quashed ORG judgment , finding a violation of the community \u2019s fundamental right under LAW and CARDINAL , read in conjunction with LAW of LAW of CARDINAL DATE ( ORG ) . The court held that ORG had not correctly evaluated the scope and the significance of the guarantee of autonomy ( Selbstbestimmungsrecht ) afforded to religious communities by the aforementioned Articles of LAW Regulations governing membership had to be seen as affairs that religious communities are free to determine at their own discretion . The ORG \u2019s duty to acknowledge the guarantee of autonomy of religious associations for the secular legal sphere found its limits in the negative religious freedom of potential members . The inclusion of members by religious communities had to be acknowledged where this was legitimised by positive declaration , albeit possibly by an implicit declaration . There were various ways to express willingness to be a member of a religious community . This did not necessarily have to be expressed to the religious community itself . From the information submitted by the applicants to the registration office in GPE / Main it could be concluded , from the objective standpoint of the onlooker ( objektivierter GPE ) , that the applicants had expressed their willingness to be members of the NORP community of GPE / Main .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG , to which the case had been remitted , dismissed the ORG appeal on points of law . It pointed out that , on procedural grounds , the judgment of ORG was binding . It nevertheless expressed doubts as to the compatibility of the finding with LAW . It noted in particular that ORG had attached no importance to the fact that the applicants had not been asked for their religious affiliation but for their religion in the registration form at issue . Notwithstanding the NORP community of GPE / Main \u2019s conception of itself as a uniform community , everyone who lived in the community \u2019s district and declared his or her religious belief should be free to choose another NORP community . Due to the binding effect of the judgment of ORG , the court considered itself prevented from founding its decision on these aspects .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with ORG which is still pending ( no . CARDINAL BvR CARDINAL/CARDINAL ) . Relying on LAW and referring to the ORG \u2019s case - law they complained in particular that their membership in the NORP community of GPE / Main was not based on their consent ."], "VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_ARTICLES": [], "NON_VIOLATED_PARAGRAPHS": [], "NON_VIOLATED_BULLETPOINTS": []}
