THE NETHERLANDS", "IMPORTANCE": "4", "CONCLUSION": "Inadmissible", "JUDGES": "", "TEXT": ["The applicants are CARDINAL housing associations . Their names are set in the appendix to this decision . They are represented before the ORG by PERSON N. PERSON and PERSON , both lawyers practising in GPE .", "The facts of the case , as submitted by the applicant associations , may be summarised as follows .", "The aim of the applicant associations is to construct and renovate housing for renting purposes on a non - profit - making basis . Their profits are used for financing the construction of new housing or for the renovation of existing housing . In the field of public housing in the GPE , associations like the applicants hold a prominent place in that they provide good standard housing at a relatively low cost on a large scale . ORG provides financial support to housing associations by , inter alia , subsidising their public housing construction projects .", "On DATE , the Order on Financial Support for Rented Housing ( PERSON geldelijke steun huurwoningen \u2013 the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , as published in the Bulletin of Acts and Decrees ( Staatsblad ) DATE , CARDINAL , entered into force . In the ORG , the ORG Secretary for ORG , PERSON en Milieubeheer \u2013 \u201c the ORG Secretary \u201d ) introduced a financing system for subsidised public housing , i.e. the so - called \u201c dynamic cost price \u201d ( \u201c DCP \u201d ) method , in combination with a scheme where financing takes place by way of loans geared to the subsidies granted .", "Under the ORG , the ORG Secretary may , in a decision granting a subsidy for a total duration of DATE for a housing construction project , stipulate that such a loan is a ORG loan ( rijkslening ) or direct the housing association concerned to the private capital market for a loan . Both the ORG and capital market loans were endowment loans ( klimleningen ) , i.e. loans in which the loaned capital sum initially increases by adding part of the interest to the loaned sum , whereas actual repayment only starts after DATE . The idea is that the repayment of the loan is financed in part by presumed rent increases . The calculation of the DCP was based on the principle that during the total exploitation period of a dwelling , which was set at DATE , the revenues would cover the standardised costs . To this end a \u201c cost price rent \u201d was determined , indicating what amount would be required DATE given the interest on and repayment of the loan \u2013 to meet this objective , as well as a hypothetical development of rent payments and exploitation costs during the entire period of exploitation . The DCP rent was not DATE determined , but calculated on the basis of the total standardised costs over the entire period of exploitation . On the assumption that rents would increase in the future , the DATE rent would be low during the initial exploitation period . As a consequence of this form of calculation , during the first DATE of exploitation , the annual exploitation costs exceeded the revenue , thus creating a liquidity and exploitation deficit which required the house owners to contract a loan . Hence , endowment loans were developed . The initial liquidity deficit would be added annually to the balance sheet value of the dwelling concerned . In DATE of exploitation , the rents would have increased to such a level that the accrued debt could be repaid rapidly . In comparison to previous subsidy methods , the advantage of this system was that at a constant rent level , a lower ORG contribution to the costs sufficed . The characteristic feature of the system under the ORG was that the initial subsidy would be low , subsidy costs in principle being projected to the future by anticipating future rent increases . The DCP rent was calculated in principle for DATE period and a subsidy was awarded for the whole period with a review of the cost price rent DATE , following a possible adjustment of the set parameter values .", "The construction of public housing was initially solely financed by ORG loans but , for budgetary reasons , the ORG Secretary directed housing associations as from DATE more and more often towards the private market . The housing associations considered that their aims would be put in jeopardy with this tendency towards private loans unless the conditions for capital market loans were eased .", "On the basis of assurances given by the ORG Secretary to ORG ( ORG ) of ORG that this method of financing would not have negative financial consequences for the tenants concerned , if necessary with extra ORG subsidies being provided , the housing associations started to make investments with capital market loans . A situation thus developed in which public housing building projects were financed by both private and ORG loans , and were subsidised for a total duration of DATE in accordance with the DCP method . During DATE period of exploitation , the subsidy for all public housing was calculated in the same manner . As a result of the application of the DCP method , the ORG could limit itself to relatively low subsidies during DATE of exploitation .", "In DATE , the then Government felt that it was no longer desirable that subsidy costs be projected in the future and decided to neutralise this feature by removing the dynamic character of the cost price rent . This implied that the rent parameter was set at PERCENT , which would result in an increase in the subsidy level . This proved to be easier in cases concerning ORG loans than in those concerning capital market loans . As to the latter category , the removal of the dynamic character was still not fully implemented by DATE . The ORG Secretary blamed this on the uncooperative attitude of the private lenders who refused to amend the terms of the housing association loans in accordance with the terms unilaterally prescribed by the ORG Secretary .", "The housing associations considered that the ORG Secretary had failed to appreciate that the private lenders had no objection to increased ORG subsidies , thereby implementing the removal of the DCP element for this form of rented accommodation .", "The ORG Secretary eventually decided , as regards DATE subsidy period , to remove the dynamic character of the cost price rent for all public housing , with the exception of such housing financed by the private market . To this end , the ORG Secretary issued ORG geldelijke steun huurwoningen \u2013 the \u201c OR \u201d ) , as published in the Bulletin of Acts and Decrees DATE , CARDINAL , which entered into force on DATE .", "Under the OR , the rent parameter for dwellings financed by ORG loans was set at PERCENT , whereas the dynamic parameter for dwellings financed by the private market was set at PERCENT . As regards the latter housing category , the ORG Secretary could limit himself to a considerably lower subsidy level , as it was assumed that the rent revenues would increase with the passage of time . In practice , however , the PERCENT rent increase was not attained , which created considerable financial difficulties for some of the housing associations . In addition and contrary to previous assurances given by the ORG Secretary \u2013 upon which the housing associations had based their investment policies \u2013 the level of subsidies in respect of social housing financed by the private market was considerably lower than that financed by ORG loans .", "In unsuccessful administrative proceedings instituted on DATE , the tenth applicant association ( see PERSON ) argued inter alia that the rules set out in the OR as to this financing system were contrary to the principle of equal treatment . On appeal , ORG ( Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak ) of ORG held , on DATE , that it had not been established that the ORG Secretary had given any undertakings about the removal of the dynamic factor concerning privately financed public housing . Insofar as the ORG Secretary had undertaken to compensate the higher costs of private financing , ORG considered that this undertaking had been respected as the housing associations , including the tenth applicant , had been compensated by extra subsidies . It further rejected the argument that the principle of equal treatment had been violated . It held that ORG and private financing systems were not comparable and that all mixed stock housing associations had met with the same treatment .", "In the meantime , on DATE , the LAW of CARDINAL DATE on the Removal from ORG ( PERSON geldelijke steun volkshuisvesting \u2013 \u201c the LAW \u201d ) had entered into force . The aim of this LAW was to redeem the long term subsidy commitments for public housing in one go by offsetting in the balance sheet of housing associations the net cash value of the ORG \u2019s outstanding subsidy commitments to housing associations against unpaid ORG loans . For the determination of the net cash value amount for public housing financed by private loans , a dynamic rent parameter was to be applied . This was not the case for public housing financed by ORG loans . According to the applicant associations , a disadvantageous and unequal treatment under the OR was thereby perpetuated in respect of housing financed by the private sector for the remaining DATE subsidy periods ( CARDINAL in all ) .", "Prior to the adoption of the LAW , the applicant associations attempted to challenge these matters by way of a petition ( rekest ) on DATE to ORG for an advisory opinion on the then draft legislation . In their petition , the applicant associations argued inter alia that the redemption arrangement set out in the Draft Bill was in violation of property rights and constituted unjustified unequal treatment . ORG acknowledged receipt of the petition but , in its advice to the Government on the Draft Bill , it did not explicitly address the issues raised by the applicant associations . According to the applicant associations , the negative consequences of the redemption arrangement were also insufficiently understood in the subsequent discussions in ORG .", "DATE , the Minister of Housing , Town and Country Planning and Environment ( Minister PERSON , PERSON en Milieubeheer \u2013 \u201c the Minister \u201d ) issued the first decisions within the meaning of LAW to all the applicant associations . With the exception of the eleventh applicant association ( see PERSON ) , the applicant associations filed a joint objection against these decisions with the Minister . The Minister rejected their objection on CARDINAL DATE . The applicant associations then appealed to ORG on DATE .", "In its decision of DATE , ORG dismissed the appeal . This decision , insofar as relevant , states :", "\u201c ORG considers that it appears from the drafting history of the LAW that it intends to set off existing subsidy commitments of the ORG towards < housing associations > against outstanding ORG loans held by these institutions . These commitments encompass DATE financial contributions still to be paid and lump sums for the construction of new housing and for < housing > improvement on the basis of subsidy arrangements prior to DATE . The setting off of commitments against payment claims is being described as \u2018 the removal from the balance PERSON balansverkorting ) . The aim of this is to attain further independence for the leasehold sector , control over public expenses and sound rent development . In the calculation of the present DATE contribution , account is being taken of the starting - points of variable exploitation costs , rent development and interest . The Act sets parameters on the basis of which this series of DATE contributions is calculated beforehand . It appears from LAW ( c ) of the LAW that the parameter for the annual rent increase is dependent on the form of financing the housing . This implies that , as regards housing financed by capital market loans , the dynamic cost price method remains in force , whereas for housing financed by ORG loans the rent parameter is set at CARDINAL . This difference has in any event already come about with the entry into force of LAW on financial support for rented housing .", "As from DATE ( the reference date ) , the series of DATE contributions and < other financial > contributions for the construction of new housing and for < housing > improvement , on the basis of subsidy arrangements prior to DATE that were still to be paid , were rendered payable in cash at once . Furthermore , on the reference date the outstanding loans were rendered redeemable .", "As regards the appellants\u2019 objections against the difference made in the LAW in the calculation of the cash value ... between the parameters for housing financed by ORG loans and for housing financed by capital market loans , ORG finds that these objections are primarily aimed against the LAW as such , which is a statute ( wet in formele zin ) .", "Pursuant to LAW ( PERSON ) , the judge can not examine the constitutionality of statutes and treaties . Having regard to LAW , no appeal lies against the LAW , it being a general , binding rule . The reasonableness and equity of the LAW can not , therefore , be examined by the judge . This is not altered by the fact that the LAW is a continuation of the policy already set out in LAW on financial support for rented housing . Neither can the compatibility of the LAW with the general principles of proper administration ( algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur ) be examined .", "In this connection , the appellants have argued that the lack of a possibility to subject the lawfulness of a statute to judicial review is contrary to LAW . ... As to this argument , ORG considers that it follows from this provision < of ORG , for cases referred to in this provision , must guarantee access to an independent and impartial tribunal without , however , setting criteria on the basis of which the matter in dispute must be examined . Already for this reason it can not be deduced from this provision that the absence of a possibility to examine the lawfulness of the LAW , as such , is incompatible with the right set forth in < LAW Since the law provides for the possibility to submit disputes like the present one to ORG of ORG , no violation of LAW arises .", "Insofar as the appellants have submitted that the LAW is contrary to < LAW Protocol No . CARDINAL > , ORG considers as follows . ...", "In the opinion of ORG it can not be successfully maintained that the change in payment of < financial > contributions to be provided by the ORG in connection with the financing of housing owned by the appellants entails a violation of LAW No . CARDINAL to the Convention . In reaching this conclusion , account has been taken of the fact that , with the introduction of the LAW , the ownership rights in the housing and the entitlement to ORG contributions have not , as such , been affected or limited . The LAW merely brought about a change in the payment of ORG contributions , namely , instead of DATE contributions to the appellants , the cash value of those contributions is paid after these have been set off against the obligations < arising out of loans contracted>. In the calculation of the value of the DATE contributions , an DATE rent increase of PERCENT is assumed , whereas under the system of DATE payment of the contributions , in force until DATE , those increases for the appellants\u2019 housing stock at issue were set at PERCENT .", "There is also no violation of the prohibition on discrimination as set forth in ... LAW The LAW is applicable to various sorts of housing belonging to those institutions indicated in LAW prior to DATE , including housing associations . It is true that in LAW different parameters are used for different housing complexes , but this difference is linked to the difference between the regulations under which , at that time , the financial contributions have been awarded for these houses and with the form of their financing . The difference made by the LAW is not an aspect connected to a difference in the nature , trait or characteristic of the beneficiary of the contributions . All < housing associations > are treated equally as regards housing created under the same regulation and financed in the same manner .", "Insofar as the appellants have argued that the LAW should not be applied in their < particular > cases as it violates the general principles of proper administration ... < or > general principles of law ( algemene rechtsbeginselen ) , ORG considers as follows :", "Even assuming that in very exceptional cases the LAW , at least in part , should not be applied on the ground of being contrary to the general principles of law , this does not arise in the present case . In reaching this finding account has been taken of the fact that it does not concern a situation that was not foreseen in the establishment of the LAW . Having regard to the parliamentary consideration of the PERSON which resulted in the LAW , it can not be maintained that ORG was not aware and did not take into consideration the problems now advanced by the appellants . It has moreover not been shown that the \u2013 unforeseen \u2013 concrete financial situation of the appellants as a consequence of the application of the LAW is so serious that measures should be taken . It follows from the above that a ( subsidiary ) obligation to < award > administrative compensation ( bestuurscompensatie ) < on the basis of equity for negative consequences stemming from acts of ORG , as contended by the appellants , does not arise either . \u201d", "Since DATE , an unspecified number of applicant associations have received a final decision , within the meaning of LAW , and some of them have filed an objection with the Minister against these decisions , requesting an adjournment pending the outcome of the present application to the ORG .", "The eleventh applicant association received such a final decision on DATE . In its objection filed with the Minister , it requested an adjournment pending the outcome of the present application to the ORG . The Minister granted this request on DATE .", "Under LAW ( Woningwet \u2013 \u201c the LAW \u201d ) , a municipal council ( gemeenteraad ) may grant recognised institutions , within the meaning of LAW , financial support in order to meet costs incurred or to be incurred by such institutions in the interests of public housing . Costs recognised as such include the exploitation costs of dwellings and their annexes ( LAW of LAW ) . This financial support can be provided by way of awarding DATE contributions ( Article CARDINAL \u00a7 CARDINALd of LAW ) . Institutions within the meaning of LAW are associations and foundations whose sole aim is to work in the field of public housing without making any payments other than in the interests of public housing .", "The practical implementation of these provisions of LAW were set out in ORG geldelijke steun volkshuisvesting \u2013 the \u201c BGSV ) , as published in the Bulletin of Acts and Decrees ( Staatsblad ) DATE , CARDINAL .", "Under LAW of the PERSON , loans may be granted to municipalities for the purposes set out in LAW by a decision of ORG ( Minister PERSON , PERSON en Milieubeheer \u2013 \u201c the Minister \u201d ) . Under LAW of the BGSV , municipalities may be awarded DATE grants for the purposes set out in LAW \u00a7 CARDINALe of LAW . Pursuant to LAW , the Minister is to set further rules on the amounts of those grants .", "These further rules were issued in the DATE Order on Financial Support for Rented Housing ( PERSON geldelijke steun huurwoningen \u2013 the \u201c ORG \u201d ) , as published in the Bulletin of Acts and Decrees DATE , CARDINAL . According to LAW ORG , the DATE grant for DATE of exploitation of the first term of DATE is the difference between the amount of the dynamic cost price rent at DATE term and the amount of the annual rent , as calculated in accordance with a table set out in GPE I to the ORG . The dynamic cost price rent is the rent calculated at the beginning of the exploitation and after each term of DATE that is necessary DATE under the assumption set out in LAW ORG as to the development of both rents and exploitation costs \u2013 to attain with the exploitation , DATE and as a minimum , the revenues envisaged in LAW ORG over the capital invested in DATE ( LAW of the ORG ) . The calculation of the dynamic cost price rent at DATE term and any subsequent term is based on the assumption that , at the beginning of that term , rents are increased DATE by the percentage set out in DATE of ORG ( GPE woonruimte ) . The system for the calculation of the annual contributions after DATE of exploitation were set out in LAW of the ORG .", "According to LAW ( Bulletin of Acts and Decrees DATE , CARDINAL ) , the DATE ORG was withdrawn as of DATE . It was replaced by LAW geldelijke steun DATE the \u201c OR \u201d ) . Under the OR , the calculation of the dynamic cost price rent at the beginning of the second DATE term is to be based on an assumed rent increase of PERCENT per year ( LAW .", "In a Circular ( Circulaire ) , published in the Bulletin of Acts and Decrees DATE , CARDINAL , the ORG Secretary set out the policy for subsidising rented housing . This policy entailed the removal of the dynamic character of the exploitation of existing housing . To this end , the determination of the dynamic cost price rent for the second and subsequent DATE terms for housing financed by ORG loans was to be based on an assumed PERCENT increase of both the rent and exploitation costs . The scheme for the payment of the interest and the ORG loan was to be adapted accordingly .", "The aim of this new policy was to attain a situation in which the remaining debt for the new housing would no longer be increased by the passage of time so that DATE given limited inflationary developments \u2013 a better balance would be achieved between the balance sheet value and the real value of housing . This also applied for already existing housing . By setting the relevant parameters at CARDINAL , the postponement of costs to the future could be prevented . The ORG Secretary considered it desirable that these costs be covered directly , thus mitigating the long - term autonomous increase of housing project subsidies as a result of previously undertaken commitments . In respect of housing projects that were financed by capital market loans , it had appeared that a mid - term change of agreed loan conditions as to scheduled repayment met with problems from the capital providers , whereas this situation did not arise in the case of housing financed by ORG loans . In these circumstances , it was decided to differentiate between housing financed by ORG loans and other housing .", "Following an agreement reached between the ORG Secretary and representative organisations of housing associations , a PERSON was prepared enabling the setting off of outstanding subsidy commitments against unpaid ORG loans . In this manner , housing associations would have greater possibilities for an independent financial policy , whereas the total housing budget of ORG , Town and Country Planning and Environment would be almost halved .", "On DATE , the resulting Draft Bill on the removal from the balance sheet of financial support for public housing was submitted to ORG for an advisory opinion . ORG issued its advice on DATE . On the basis of its recommendations , certain amendments to the Explanatory Memorandum of the Draft Bill were made . The PERSON was subsequently submitted to ORG for approval .", "On DATE , the Act on the Removal from ORG ( PERSON geldelijke steun volkshuisvesting \u2013 \u201c the DATE LAW ) was adopted . It entered into force on DATE .", "Under the provisions of LAW , the Minister is to determine for each housing association recognised by a municipality the amount of the cash value on DATE of the still outstanding subsidy commitments for their housing stock ( LAW . The procedure for the determination of this cash value is set out in LAW . The Minister initially determines the cash value in a first decision taken on the basis of information already available ( LAW ) .
