It noted that PERSON , who was DATE , had repeatedly declared that he refused contact with his father . According to ORG opinion , PERSON should not be forced into contact with the applicant . According to the curator \u2019s submissions , PERSON did not refuse contact with his father capriciously . Apparently , the hurt he had sustained in DATE had been so serious that he now did not wish to agree to personal contact with his father . There was no indication that PERSON had been influenced by his mother in this respect . The judicial conflicts concerning custody and rights of contact and the confrontations had led to the adolescent \u2019s seeking psychotherapeutic treatment . Having regard to these circumstances , ORG considered that it was in the child \u2019s best interests to refuse the applicant \u2019s request for rights of contact . The applicant remained , however , free to stay in touch with his son by mail .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an appeal with ORG .", "On DATE the applicant \u2019s counsel submitted reasons for his appeal .

Furthermore , the question put to the expert did not sufficiently take into account the problems relating to ORG .", "On DATE ORG refused the applicant \u2019s request for rectification of its record . It further appointed psychological expert PERSON to replace PERSON , who had been prevented by illness from accepting the commission .", "On DATE the applicant named CARDINAL witnesses to demonstrate that PERSON had been manipulated by his mother and submitted a written witness statement .

The expert considered that there was no indication that the applicant presented a danger to the child \u2019s welfare . However , the severe conflicts between their parents prevented all CARDINAL children from maintaining an emotional relationship with them . In this respect , both parents were seriously harming their children .", "The expert further considered that F. could be rather easily influenced by third persons . He did not , however , meet all the criteria defining parental alienation syndrome . Having regard to F. \u2019s age and his strong resistance to contact visits , the expert urgently advised the court not to order forced contact visits . Such an order would not only jeopardise F. \u2019s welfare , but would also complicate the instigation of voluntary contact after PERSON had reached adult age .", "In DATE ORG scheduled a hearing for DATE , which was postponed at defence counsel \u2019s request to DATE .", "On DATE the applicant submitted CARDINAL comments in reply to the expert opinion prepared by CARDINAL psychological experts .

That court accepted that the applicant wished to exercise rights of contact in accordance with his son \u2019s best interests . It considered , however , that the exercise of rights of contact would jeopardise PERSON \u2019s welfare . ORG , having heard F. personally , was firmly convinced that PERSON had formed his own strong opinion on the question of contact with his father which could be only marginally influenced by his mother \u2019s wishes . Under these circumstances , the court did not consider it necessary to examine whether PERSON had been negatively influenced by his mother or to hear further expert opinion .", "ORG further noted that PERSON , during the hearing held on CARDINAL March CARDINAL , and under the influence of the expert \u2019s and the court \u2019s submissions that the exercise of rights of contact would not be harmful to him , had agreed to see his father once a month if the applicant refrained from instituting judicial proceedings . Accordingly , CARDINAL meeting took place , on DATE . Having learned that the applicant had taken enforcement measures against him by attempting to execute costs orders obtained against him in separate proceedings , PERSON refused to agree to further contact . Even taking into account the explanations given by the applicant for taking these enforcement measures , according to which the enforcement measures were aimed at the mother and were addressed to the son for purely formal reasons , ORG considered that PERSON \u2019s reaction was understandable , at least on an emotional level . Having regard to the fact that PERSON had almost reached the age of majority , his firmly established will had to be respected . ORG further considered that forced contact visits were not likely to contribute to establishing a stable relationship with his father .", "This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal ( GPE ) against ORG decision . He complained , in particular , that ORG had given its decision without having heard the witnesses named by the applicant and without a further oral hearing . He further complained about the length of the proceedings before ORG .", "On DATE the applicant extended the scope of his extraordinary appeal and requested ORG to reopen the proceedings because of an infringement of his right to a fair hearing .", "On DATE the curator ad litem requested the court to grant an extension of the time - limit for comments on the applicant \u2019s submissions until DATE .", "On DATE the applicant lodged a complaint with ORG ( Bundesverfassungsgericht ) .", "On DATE ORG informed the curator that the time - limit could only be extended until DATE , having regard to the urgency of the matter .", "On DATE ORG dismissed the applicant \u2019s extraordinary appeal . ORG pointed out that it had referred to the written expert opinion submitted by Professor PERSON only in support of the assumption that contact with the applicant would not in principle jeopardise the child \u2019s welfare . This assumption was in the applicant \u2019s favour and induced the court to propose contact visits . Under these circumstances , it had not been necessary personally to hear the expert . Based on its own impression during the hearing held on DATE , ORG confirmed that it had no doubt that PERSON \u2019s refusal further to see the applicant was based on an autonomous decision . Under these circumstances , it was out of the question to impose contact visits on the adolescent , who was at the time DATE .", "This decision was served on the applicant \u2019s counsel on CARDINAL DATE .", "On DATE ORG , sitting as a panel of CARDINAL judges , refused to accept the applicant \u2019s constitutional complaint for adjudication pursuant to the relevant provisions of its Rules of Procedure without giving any further reasons .
