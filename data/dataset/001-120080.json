The applicants are GPE nationals resident in the GPE . They are represented by PERSON , a lawyer practising in GPE . A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix .", "CARDINAL . From DATE the GPE , in common with other ORG countries , introduced measures aimed at limiting the quantity of dung , or faecal matter , produced by certain animals including pigs . This initially involved a system of \u201c dung production quotas \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE LAW ( GPE ) entered into force .", "CARDINAL . LAW , according to its preamble , was enacted with a view to implementing ORG Directive CARDINAL/CARDINAL/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources , and also in order to preserve amenity , the quality of the environment and the health and well - being of animals .", "CARDINAL . LAW transformed \u201c dung production quotas \u201d into a maximum number of pigs per farm \u2013 the so - called \u201c pig entitlement \u201d ( varkensrecht ) . Pig entitlements ( except in so far as they concerned breeding sows , which were treated as a special category ) were transferable , within certain ( especially territorial ) limits ( sections CARDINAL of LAW ) and subject to the lapse of a variable proportion of the entitlement upon transfer ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) ; they could not , however , be used as collateral ( section CARDINAL ) .", "CARDINAL . The pig entitlement was calculated in each case by reducing the average number of pigs held on the farm in DATE or , in certain cases , DATE by PERCENT ( sections DATE CARDINAL of LAW ) . A further reduction by PERCENT was foreseen with effect from DATE ( section CARDINAL of LAW ) . It was the actual number of pigs kept in DATE that was decisive ; any \u201c latent capacity \u201d ( latente ruimte ) , that is the difference between the number of pigs a farmer would have been allowed to keep at the relevant time and the number actually kept , was lost .", "CARDINAL .

The applicants PERSON and Lohuis - Voshaar , who ran a farm as a partnership ( maatschap ) , were farming at considerably less than full capacity in DATE and DATE owing to ill - health . They ended up losing PERCENT of their original pig entitlements as \u201c latent capacity \u201d , in addition to the PERCENT total reduction prescribed by LAW . They have since given up farming .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant PERSON farmed at CARDINAL locations , on CARDINAL of which he was building a new pig shed in DATE ; farming began there in DATE . Thanks to a clause beneficial to him in GPE Decree he lost PERCENT of his entitlements for that location as \u201c latent capacity \u201d . For the other location he lost the full PERCENT .", "CARDINAL . The applicant PERSON lost the full PERCENT of his DATE entitlement plus PERCENT as \u201c latent capacity \u201d . He also stated that he had run into financial difficulties as a result of the uncertainty facing pig farming in DATE , which had forced him to sell off some of his land and purchase pig entitlements from elsewhere .", "CARDINAL . NORP The applicant PERSON lost the full PERCENT of his former entitlements , plus a claimed PERCENT as \u201c latent capacity \u201d .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the applicants , together with other pig farmers and a non - governmental organisation set up to further the interests of pig farmers ( hereafter \u201c the original plaintiffs \u201d ) , brought a civil action in tort against the ORG before ORG ( arrondissementsrechtbank ) of GPE , arguing among other things that the new legislation constituted a \u201c deprivation of possessions \u201d within the meaning of LAW No .

On DATE ORG gave judgment holding that the measures complained of constituted not a \u201c deprivation \u201d of possessions but a \u201c control \u201d of their use . It accepted the necessity of measures to be taken , and also the proportionality of the first reduction of the pig entitlements by PERCENT . The second reduction by PERCENT , however , it found disproportionate . It therefore held that section CARDINAL of LAW should not be put into effect as regards the original plaintiffs , dismissing their claims for the remainder .", "CARDINAL . A number of the original plaintiffs , including the applicants , lodged an appeal on points of law to ORG ( PERSON ) . The ORG lodged a cross - appeal .", "CARDINAL . On DATE ORG delivered a judgment ( PERSON ( ORG , ORG ) quashing the judgment of ORG . As relevant to the case before the ORG , it found that LAW No . CARDINAL was applicable and that there had been an interference with the applicants\u2019 right to the peaceful enjoyment of their possessions . However , there was no \u201c de facto expropriation \u201d as the applicants argued . On this point , ORG held as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL.CARDINAL . According to the case - law of [ ORG ] , in cases where there is no formal expropriation there is a deprivation within the meaning of the second sentence of LAW No . CARDINAL if it concerns a \u2018 de facto expropriation\u2019 ( see GPE and PERSON v. GPE , DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . DATE , PERSON ( ORG , GPE ) DATE , no . CARDINAL , and PERSON v. GPE ( no . CARDINAL ) , CARDINAL DATE , \u00a7 DATE , Series A no . CARDINAL ) .", "According to the case - law of [ ORG ] cited in the advisory opinion of the Acting Procurator General ... it is , in the case of a ( partial ) withdrawal of a licence , or of a restriction of a different kind of the rights flowing from the licence , not the licence itself that constitutes the nexus ( aanknopingspunt ) for the protection of property , but the enterprise exploited with that licence . In line with this , whenever \u2013 as in the cases in issue in the present proceedings \u2013 the contested Government measure purports to restrict certain enterprise activities ( bedrijfsactiviteiten ) in pursuance of goals such as those pursued by the quota arrangement of LAW ( ... ) , then in answering the question whether that measure constitutes a \u2018 de facto expropriation\u2019 the effects of that measure on the affected enterprise as a whole must be examined ( ... ) . The circumstance that the legislative arrangements ( regelingen ) involved provide for ( limited ) transferability of dung production quotas and pig entitlements does not deprive these legislative arrangements of the character of a restriction imposed on the exploitation of the enterprise ( aan de bedrijfsvoering opgelegde beperking ) . \u201d", "ORG went on to hold that the new legislation constituted a \u201c control of use \u201d of the applicants\u2019 possessions . The legislature had not , in principle , overstepped its \u201c margin of appreciation \u201d . It had to be recognised , however , that the interests of the individual pig farmers among the plaintiffs deserved protection : in particular , a \u201c fair balance \u201d had to be found in each case , implying a \u201c reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised \u201d . The case was remitted to a different ORG , that of GPE , which would have to review the individual cases of the pig farmers party to the proceedings . The instruction to ORG was phrased as follows :", "\u201c CARDINAL.CARDINAL It follows [ from the above ] that the second paragraph of LAW No . CARDINAL does not , in principle , constitute a basis for not applying LAW in respect of those pig farmers who have been affected by the impugned measures only as concerns dung production quotas or pig entitlements allotted them by law and which they have not acquired for a consideration in any other way .", "However , after remittal it will have to be examined whether the impugned measures under LAW constitute an \u2018 individual and excessive burden\u2019 for CARDINAL or more of the [ individual ] appellants [ i.e. not including the non - governmental organisation aforementioned ] owing to specific facts and circumstances not applicable to all pig farmers , and whether the relevant provisions of LAW should not be left unimplemented in their respect , at least as long as no provision is made for adequate financial compensation . This may be the case , in DATE but not exclusively DATE , if a pig farmer \u2019s dung production quota or pig entitlement , obtained for a consideration , is affected , it being of particular importance to what extent the ORG has created expectations finding their expression in , for example , the price for which the rights in issue were obtained .", "As mentioned , such problems have been provided for in part by LAW . The [ individual ] appellants have however stated that this Decree does not apply to them .", "CARDINAL . In so doing it will be possible also to take into consideration facts and developments in the field of legislation that have occurred subsequent to the judgment of ORG . After remittal the parties will be able to expand and adapt their positions accordingly . \u201d", "CARDINAL . The applicants lodged an application with ORG DATE , complaining that the new legislation did not constitute a \u201c control of the use of property \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL but a \u201c deprivation of possessions \u201d without any form of compensation .", "CARDINAL . On DATE the ORG , sitting as a ORG of CARDINAL judges ( former LAW ) , declared that application ( no . CARDINAL ) inadmissible . It found that domestic remedies had not been exhausted as required by LAW , since , after the case had been remitted by ORG to ORG of GPE , the proceedings had not yet been pursued to a final decision .", "CARDINAL . After the ORG \u2019s decision of inadmissibility , proceedings were resumed in ORG of GPE on the basis of ORG remittal judgment of DATE .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave an interlocutory judgment on DATE . It found , as relevant to the case before the ORG , that both ORG of GPE and ORG had dismissed the suggestion that the applicants\u2019 pig entitlements were \u201c possessions \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL of which they had been deprived . Referring to the judgment of a Chamber of this Court ( J.A. Pye ( ORG v. GPE , no . CARDINAL , \u00a7 DATE , DATE ) , it held that it had nonetheless to consider whether a \u201c reasonable relationship of proportionality \u201d existed regardless of whether the interference with the applicants\u2019 rights was to be seen as a \u201c deprivation \u201d of possessions or as \u201c control \u201d of their use .", "CARDINAL . Faced with the need to consider the ORG cases individually , it came to the provisional conclusion that the applicant PERSON had been disproportionately affected . He had lost PERCENT of his pre - existing rights , his \u201c latent capacity \u201d , in addition to the PERCENT total reduction under LAW ; this had rendered an investment in a new pig shed made in DATE , worth MONEY ( NLG ) , useless . In the case of the applicant PERSON there was a dispute as to the actual extent and value of the \u201c latent capacity \u201d actually lost . The claims of the applicants PERSON and PERSON , whose loss of \u201c latent capacity \u201d was minimal , would have to be dismissed in their entirety . The proceedings were adjourned so that the loss suffered by the applicants PERSON and PERSON den Heuvel could be established .", "CARDINAL . In a second interlocutory judgment , delivered on DATE , ORG found it established that the applicant PERSON had suffered a disproportionate loss in that he had lost his PERCENT \u201c latent capacity \u201d , for which he had received no compensation . It also found it established that the applicant PERSON had lost \u201c latent capacity \u201d in an amount of PERCENT of his former entitlement . However , he had obtained this \u201c latent capacity \u201d by taking over dung production quotas attached to land which he had purchased ; hereafter , the discussion centred on whether he had paid a consideration for these quotas or not . It adjourned the proceedings to hear any witnesses brought forward by the parties and obtain a report by an expert .", "CARDINAL . ORG delivered its final judgment on CARDINAL DATE , after having heard witnesses and taken cognisance of a report by an expert . It found that the applicant PERSON had lost \u201c latent capacity \u201d in an amount of PERCENT , but had been able largely to set off his loss against capacity tied to the land which he had purchased . With respect to the PERCENT reduction provided for by LAW , he was affected no worse than any other pig farmer ; he could therefore not be said to have been made to bear an \u201c individual and excessive burden \u201d .", "CARDINAL . ORG quashed the judgment of ORG . It held that the ORG had committed a tort in respect of the applicants PERSON and ORG and was therefore liable for any damage thereby caused , the amount of which would need to be assessed and settled in due course . It dismissed the other applicants\u2019 appeals .", "CARDINAL . The ORG lodged an appeal on points of law against ORG judgment .", "CARDINAL . The applicants PERSON and ORG lodged a cross - appeal . The other applicants did not , having been advised by counsel that an appeal lodged by them had no prospects of success .", "CARDINAL . The applicants PERSON and ORG argued that ORG ought , on reflection , to have given favourable consideration to their argument that they had suffered a \u201c deprivation of possessions \u201d within the meaning of LAW No . CARDINAL .", "CARDINAL . ORG gave judgment on DATE . It dismissed the ORG \u2019s appeal and the cross - appeal by the applicants PERSON and ORG in their entirety . In dismissing the latter , it referred to its own judgment of DATE , which was binding on ORG .", "CARDINAL .
